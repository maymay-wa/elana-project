even the captain of an eavesdropping 
soviet spy ship seemed impressed by the first successful launch of 
the navys deadly new trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine 
my best regards to the skipper of the sub the soviet 
captain radioed after the 44foot missile roared away from the uss 
tennessee burst to the surface ignited and hurled a dummy warhead 
to a target far down the atlantic tracking range on wednesday 
the message was radioed to the launch support ship range 
sentinel earlier the range sentinel had warned the russian 
trawler not to get too close 
were not going to interfere with the launch replied the 
captain of the soviet ship and he stayed about 2 miles away just 
outside the security zone 
for years soviet spy ships have observed most launchings from 
cape canaveral 
greenpeace usa activists who oppose nuclear weapons at sea 
halted the launch attempt last friday by sailing ships into the 
security zone and refusing to leave arguing they were in 
international waters they stayed away wednesday saying they had 
made their point 
following the 11 am launch rear adm arlington campbell 
commander of submarine group 6 told reporters on the range 
sentinel as far as we can tell from our telemetry it was a 
totally nominal launch from all indications everything has been 
successful 
the navy did not disclose how far the warhead section traveled 
each of the 237 million missiles is designed to propel as many 
as 12 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4600 miles 
away 
the results were far different from those of the trident 2s 
first submarine launch on march 21 when the missile cartwheeled 
out of control and exploded just four seconds after it was launched 
from the tennessee 
investigators reported that failure was caused by a faulty 
mechanical linkage responsible for moving the rocket motor nozzles 
back and forth to control direction the system was redesigned 
we had one failure at sea campbell said but these are 
production evaluation missiles were here to learn they get 
improved so they are right when they are actually deployed 
the navy plans seven or eight more underwater tests over the 
next few months if all goes as planned the navy will send the 
tennessee on operational patrol next march with 24 of the 
nucleartipped missiles 
before the trident 2 was taken to sea the navy conducted 19 
flight tests from a land launch rating 15 of them successful

the soviet union has accepted an american demand 
that inspections be carried out before an agreement is formally 
concluded to ban chemical weapons the new york times reported 
the times quoted unidentified officials in its thursday editions 
as saying the soviet acceptance would help resolve one of the major 
disputes remaining in the way of an agreement 
the newspaper said the acceptance was conveyed in a paper 
presented to secretary of state james a baker 3d by foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union when they met 
recently in paris 
the two countries previously had disagreed on whether chemical 
weapons stockpiles should be inspected before or after a treaty is 
signed 
the united states had said they should be inspected and moscow 
had insisted that the inspections not be carried out until after a 
pact is formally concluded 
moscow says it has no more than 50000 tons of chemical 
armaments but some analysts have said the soviets have more than 
300000 tons 
this is a sign that the soviets are serious about concluding a 
chemicaldisarmament treaty said elisa d harris an expert on 
the chemical weapons talks at the brookings institution the 
washingtonbased research and policy analysis institute

growers of sweet potatoes claiming their 
products character is being maligned want to divorce the 
vegetable from other potatoes by giving it a new name sweetpotato 
we could call it the love spud said virginia tech 
vegetable specialist charlie odell referring to a campaign once 
developed for tomatoes as love apples 
sweet potato advocates whose efforts to promote the product as 
yams resulted in only halfbaked success have no love for the 
starchy image of the ordinary potato 
yam never was a good word said bill mapp regional 
marketing manager with the virginia department of agriculture and 
consumer services its a madison avenue word 
the campaign for sweetpotato has its origins in the us 
department of agriculture which has used one word to denote the 
product for some time said billy yeargin executive director of 
the north carolina sweetpotato commission 
their contention is that to refer to it as two words is 
inaccurate because it refers to a potato that is sweet said 
yeargin whose commission dropped yam from its name in january 
so what does a sweet potato marketing official do when he wants 
to change the name of his spud go to the dictionary yeargins 
commission tried that but the effort was a dud 
a dictionary doesnt have anything to do with deciding whether 
sweet potato should be one word said victoria neufeldt editor 
in chief at websters new world dictionary what we use is 
usage

president bush expressed fears for the safety 
of americans held hostage in lebanon on wednesday and said he was 
hampered by a lack of information but nbc news said the president 
had made up his mind to retaliate if another hostage is killed 
the network said it had been told by unidentified senior 
administration officials that bush has decided to strike back 
at the lebanese shiites and their iranian sponsors if his 
diplomatic moves failed to prevent the death of the next hostage 
just what form this retaliation would take was not specified 
a senior defense department official asked about the report 
said wednesday evening i know of no such decision this 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity noted that defense 
secretary dick cheney left washington during the day for a visit to 
his home state of wyoming and said there is a distinct 
atmosphere of uncrisis around here 
another administration official said a message to iran the 
existence of which was disclosed on tuesday had said in substance 
if anything happens to the hostages we hold you responsible 
and was conveyed to tehran trhough two channels the swiss embassy 
representing us interests there and through another government he 
declined to name this official discussed the message on condition 
of anonymity 
bush sought help from more world leaders and for the third time 
in three days met with top military diplomatic and national 
security advisers in the cabinet room to review developments in the 
hostage crisis the white house said no further sessions were 
scheduled 
we are leaving no stone unturned bush said 
he said he had been incontact with many world leaders including 
british prime minister margaret thatcher in telephone calls during 
the day 
they face the same problems that we face when it comes to 
information and trying to find out exactly what happened bush 
said we are not dealing with all the facts 
but ive had assurance after assurance from world leaders that 
they want to help the president said 
on the eve of the threatened execution by kidnappers of american 
hostage joseph cicippio bush was asked if he feared the hostages 
were in peril alluding to the threats bush replied well were 
considering that that might well be the case given statements that 
weve seen 
however shiite moslem sources in lebanon said they expected 
cicippios captors to spare him at irans behest to avert a 
confrontation with the united states international tension already 
was high after the reported execution monday of marine lt col 
william higgins 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration was pleased with a statement by irans 
presidentelect hashemi rafsanjani condemning the killing of 
higgins and all acts of a terrorist nature 
she called on rafsanjani to act in accordance with the 
spirit of his statement we remain convinced that iran is in a 
position to bring significant influence to bear on those who hold 
the hostages and call on it to do so ms tutwiler said 
she also welcomed a statement by a top aide to palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat criticizing the 
execution of higgins 
meanwhile pentagon officials said the uss belknap the flagship 
of the us 6th fleet and the fleets commander canceled a 
scheduled visit to the soviet port of sevastapol to be at the 
beck and call of bush in case he needs them 
the aircraft carrier uss america also cut short a visit and left 
the port of singapore officials said 
were prudently planning bush said of the military moves 
on the other hand white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
advised reporters not to read a lot into those movements i 
would not attach a great deal of significance to them 
bush posing for pictures in the oval office with the visiting 
foreign minister of the persian gulf nation of bahrain sheik 
mohammed bin mubarak alkhalifa said the administration was 
dealing with the hostage crisis with a heavy heart because of 
higgins reported death 
we are thinking prudently about this matter in every possible 
way the president said we have exercised every diplomatic 
channel that i can think of 
weve been in touch i have personally with many world 
leaders and our state department has fleshed his out so were 
leaving no stone unturned bush said 
but regrettably were dealing with less than a full deck 
when it comes to information he added it is very hard when 
youre dealing with this kind of cowardice and this kind of 
dastardly act to get all the information that you need to make a 
decision 
afterward sheik mohammed told reporters outside the white house 
that i think in the next few days something must come to stop 
this kind of killing of innocent people 
the president was asked by reporters if it would make matters 
easier if israel released the moslem cleric whose kidnapping by 
israel inflamed the hostage situation 
i have made clear the position of the united states that i 
think a release of everyone held against their will would be a good 
thing bush replied 
separately fitzwater said the united states has not asked 
israel to release the cleric sheik abdul karim obeid 
the official who discussed the message to iran said the united 
states had told israel through the embassies in washington and tel 
aviv on several occasions that it neither approves nor 
disapproves israels proposed swap of obeid for hostages held by 
the shiites 
bush and white house officials made a deliberate attempt to 
quell any suggestion that the administration was paralyzed by 
crisis 
i dont want anyone in this country or around the world to 
think that it the hotage ordeal is anything of other than 
tremendous concern bush said but we must prudently move on 
with the business of our country 
administration officials said a study of a videotape purporting 
to show higgins dead by hanging was inconclusive as to the identity 
of the victim or when the victim was killed 
there are those who think the circumstantial evidence from the 
videotape would indicate that the victim did not die by hanging 
however there is is no conclusive proof of that or any proof of 
when it happened said one official insisting on anonymity 
the new york times said in thursday editions that the cia had 
told the white house it believed higgins was probably killed before 
monday according to unidentified officials who said the conclusion 
was based in part on conversations with nations in contact with 
the hezbollah a call to cia spokesmen wednesday night was not 
immediately returned 
in another development the senate displayed growing frustration 
with terrorist kidnappings and murders voting to instruct the cia 
and pentagon to report by sept 1 on how best to locate and rescue 
american hostages in lebanon 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan meanwhile said his 
criticism of israel this week was not helping terrorists drive a 
wedge between the united states and the jewish state as critics 
contended 
my basic message to israel is this we are in this together 
we both have vital interests at stake whenever possible we ought 
to act together and always we ought to take fully into account the 
vital interests of the other when we contemplate unilateral 
action dole said

as soon as senate republican leader bob dole 
heard that marine lt col william higgins had reportedly been 
hanged by terrorists he headed for the senate floor 
he didnt have a text prepared or need a meeting with his staff 
he delivered a blunt assessment of how he believed israel might 
have provoked the murder 
we cannot apologize for israeli actions in this country when 
it endangers the lives of americans in some faroff country and 
perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the israelis 
one of these days would be refreshing he said a bitter edge to 
his voice 
doles remarks sparked outrage from defenders of the jewish 
state who said he was playing into the hands of the terrorists 
themselves 
it was a contemptible slander that showed the gullibility 
of its utterer said rep howard berman dcalif it is 
precisely what the murderers want people to think 
but for dole jumping into controversy was nothing new his 
stinging comments about israel fit in a political style which has 
put him at the pinnacle of senate politics even if it has 
sometimes hurt his ambitions for national office 
he enjoys it bob enjoys being in the middle of the fray he 
usually can handle it every well says sen nancy kassebaum his 
kansas republican colleague its something that really sparks an 
energy he likes a good political fight she said 
doles zest for the jugular of an issue or an opponent has not 
always served him well it hurt him in 1976 when as gerald fords 
running mate he earned a reputation as a mean campaigner 
more than a decade later in losing the new hampshire primary to 
george bush last year doles mean image resurfaced when he 
angrily blurted that the thenvice president should stop lying 
about my record 
dole took more criticism for the remark than bush ever took for 
his hardball campaign and it might have cost dole another vice 
presidential nomination 
but within the senate doles sometimes mercurial personality is 
accepted as his style raising the stakes when he wants a point to 
be made 
its nothing more than bob dole on course said sen alan 
simpson rwyo he is our leader and i think he does a 
magnificent job 
often dole senate minority leader for the last 4 years acts 
in the role of a team player such as his strong partisan attacks 
on democrats who refused to back the nomination of john tower as 
secretary of defense 
this week dole suggested president bush make a recess 
appointment of william lucas the nominee to head the civil rights 
division of the justice department 
the senate judiciary committee killed lucas nomination on a 77 
vote a recess appointment would go around the normal confirmation 
process and put lucas in the post through the end of next year 
and would almost certainly provoke open warfare between the 
democratic congress and the republican white house 
attorney general richard thornburgh said wednesday he was 
seriously considering it 
in the case of israel dole was seen by many as saying what the 
white house couldnt say for diplomatic reasons 
he went further than i would have gone but i dont think its 
ever a bad thing for a message to go out that an ally should not be 
taken for granted said rep david boren dokla chairman of 
the senate intelligence committee 
sen connie mack rfla a freshman who disagrees with dole on 
israel said the statement in no way lowered his opinion of dole 
to be leader of this group you have to be able to work with 
all different factions mack said he is a leader 
whether one agrees or not the point of it is its consistent 
with describing his role here said sen pete v domenici rnm 
while there was talk after last years bruising political 
campaign that dole would somehow get revenge on bush when he 
returned to the senate the kansan has proven a loyal soldier 
he has laid himself on the line for george bush since we 
opened for business and george bush knows it and bob dole knows 
it said simpson 
dole and bush have patched up any hard feelings and if there is 
any bitterness remaining between dole and white house chief of 
staff john sununu who helped bush bring down dole they wont let 
that come out simpson said 
if dole still harbors any national ambitions he knows that 
the key to his success is support of this president simpson 
said bob never looks back

nearly two decades after their perennially 
woeful baseball namesake skipped town the only senators left in 
washington are still striking out in the major leagues 
in a semiannual ritual that so far has produced nothing but 
vague promises and veiled threats baseballs commissioner 
wednesday once again fended off congressional demands to expand 
major league baseball 
it was a bartlett giamattis second turn at confronting the 
special senate task force representing the franchise hopes of at 
least a dozen cities 
and like his predecessors he threw its score of members a 
gentlemanly curve and still shut them out 
he stood there like a stone wall sen john warner rva 
said in mock disbelief 
the senators joined by two house members at the closeddoor 
meeting pressed giamatti for a commitment to expand the american 
league by at least two teams and the national league by at least 
four the al has 14 teams the nl 12 
giamatti would only repeat the commitment of nl owners to add 
two teams at some indefinite date in the 1990s 
in our view there are six or eight cities which are very 
strongly qualified for a major league team said sen john 
mccain rariz who has phoenix uppermost on that list 
but giamatti wouldnt budge 
it is a fact that two is not six it is not eight it is not 
10 he told reporters after the meeting our disagreement is 
about the pace and about the number 
several senators including democrat timothy wirth of colorado 
chairman of the senate task force on the expansion of major league 
baseball alluded to the possibility that congress could repeal 
baseballs special exemption from antitrust law if owners dont 
respond swiftly to expansion demands 
that threat has often been aired but never enacted by members 
whose constituents dont live in prospective expansion cities 
in a letter presented to giamatti at the meeting wirth said the 
task force is preparing to pursue all available avenues to 
correct the inequities of the existing expansion procedure 
though we would prefer to develop a mutually satisfactory 
expansion plan with baseball it is time to move this process out 
of discussions and into action wirth said 
it has been more than a decade since the last franchises the 
toronto blue jays and the seattle mariners were awarded the 
addition of only two teams in the last 20 years coupled with the 
possibility of only two more in the next decade clearly is not 
responsive to the fans and cities that desire and can support major 
league baseball 
the washington senators left the nations capital after the 1971 
season and became the texas rangers 
giamatti told reporters there werent any promises made 
other than to return for more discussion at an indefinite date 
possibly at public hearings 
warner confronted giamatti after the meeting about his claim 
that not enough talent is available to preserve the quality of the 
game if several new teams are added at once 
what i said was that it is more difficult to step off a 
college baseball field into the major leagues than in other 
sports giamatti replied to expand is not to say you degrade 
quality but one must be responsible deliberate and prudent 
warner and others didnt buy that 
the pool of talent is expanding very rapidly said sen dan 
coats rind colleges are now taking baseball very seriously 
other members of the task force all representing states with 
one or more cities hoping to land an expansion team were sens

jesse abney a chemical worker at the fernald 
nuclear weapons plant says he doesnt want to see the ohio 
facility close down because it will mean a loss of jobs but he 
feels a sense of betrayal 
it is at fernald he told a congressional hearing wednesday 
that he became contaminated with plutonium and uranium despite 
assurances over the years from supervisors that health risks were 
minimal 
david day another worker and union official at the fernald 
plant where investigators have documented widespread abuses in 
environmental and health safeguards says he too relied on those 
assurances 
we were told the levels of contamination were too low to 
harm us he told the senate government operations committee 
superiors told him a decade ago the radioactive substance he 
handled was like working with lead and involved no more risk 
than crossing the street he said 
we are the guinea pigs added abney 55 we perform 
important and dangerous work but are made to feel expendable 
recent tests showed unhealthy levels of plutonium in his body and 
uranium contamination in his lungs 
workers and union officials said there are similar stories at 
the other major 17 weapons plants in a dozen states government 
investigations are probing violations of safety and environmental 
laws at a number of plants the cleanup effort and bringing the 
plants into compliance nationwide may cost more than 100 billion 
and take 30 or more years 
contractors have ignored safety rules with the complicity of 
energy department officials information documenting radioactive 
releases and poor safety practices has been withheld from the 
public and the extent of the hazards covered up by doe margaret 
seminario a health expert with the aflcio told the senate panel 
other union officials said some workers are still reluctant to 
complain 
the cloak of secrecy which kept workers for years unaware of 
safety hazards for the most part has disappeared and been replaced 
by the threat of unemployment said day who is head of a union 
local at fernald 
energy secretary james watkins acknowledged in separate 
testimony wednesday that the departments program to track health 
risks at the weapons plants is a mess and that the department 
has given workers past assurances of safety without an accurate 
reading of the health risks involved 
when he took over the department in march watkins said he found 
the program for monitoring and evaluating health risks buried 
deep within the bureaucracy understaffed underfunded and 
underutilized with no outside scrutiny 
the historical record provides little comfort said sen 
john glenn dohio committee chairman 
the committee produced a list of 30 reports and studies over the 
years that describe health problems among workers and residents 
near the energy department facilities since the 1950s 
robert wages a union official representing 5000 atomic weapons 
plants workers across the country said the energy departments 
record on worker health and safety issues at the plants has been 
one of denial coverup inefficiency and betrayal 
wages a vice president of the oil chemical and atomic workers 
union said concerns about worker exposure to radioactive materials 
and wastes at the plants were debated in congress nearly two 
decades ago but little was improved 
watkins promised a shakeup in the departments health monitoring 
program and said it will be opened to review by an outside 
committee of experts 
watkins told the senators he plans to rely heavily on outside 
review panels because he cant trust internal department 
statistics sometimes the reports coming in from the field are 
not really true said the secretary

the four manhattan lawyers chanted shrieked and 
slapped themselves not their usual workday behavior 
but they were on a stage performing wednesday night in a 
festival called serious fun at the usually serious alice tully hall 
the piece by performance artist and choreographer ann carlson 
was called sloss kerr rosenberg amp moore for john chet 
scott and tom the reallife lawyers who star in it 
in the piece a work of performance art ms carlson examines 
the lives of lawyers 
i think this is our 15 minutes of fame said sloss an 
entertainment lawyer 
i never really thought id be appearing at lincoln center 
onstage said moore a corporate lawyer before the big moment 
my god this is really something 
their feet firmly grounded in an invisible box the lawyers do 
dancelike interpretations alternately frenzied fidgeting and 
mellow they call a cab go to the beach ride a roller coaster and 
see their suits smudged by puppies 
at one point each lawyer recites something he learned in 
childhood his address a prayer the months of the year 
ms carlsons life gets equal time when rosenberg points 
accusingly at the audience and yells youre the biggest baby in 
this room 
it happened to me in the second grade it was traumatic ms 
carlson said 
at the end their lawyerishness sort of drops away said ms 
carlson they take rose petals out of their breast pockets sniff 
them and drop them onto the floor they lunge out of their box and 
notice each other 
i have friends in the audience tonight but i was somewhat 
selective about the people i notified said moore some people 
think its kind of strange or weird ive gotten a little bit of 
ribbing but most people are very positive 
the program of works by 10 contemporary dance or performance 
companies also was highlighted by the second hand dance companys 
clackers in which a precision dance trio kicked percussion 
instruments strapped to their derrieres and 3b49 a whimsical 
dance portrayal of a taxi driver and passenger by blondell cummings 
and tom thayer 
the lawyers were discovered in 1985 
ms carlson living near wall street noticed the visual 
climate around me was mostly threepiece suits and briefcases i 
had this dream where these four men in suits had their shoes glued 
to the floor 
she asked kerr a civil litigator and former high school 
classmate from park ridge ill to bring over three lawyer buddies 
to talk about themselves and experiment with dance she also spent 
time at a law firm observing lawyers movements and attitudes 
what evolved was a 9minute work with lawyers who look like 
theyre running around and getting nowhere 
its a very frenetic piece reflective of the way we often 
work said kerr we spend little time in the piece 
communicating with each other 
in a way lawyers have a bad rap sometimes said ms 
carlson the suit a power icon in our culture and the lawyers 
vulnerability is a paradox that has a lot of resonance my 
challenge was to blow the stereotype apart let it explode 
the lawyers have performed at the whitney museum and the central 
park band shell moore once cut short travel in china to perform at 
the brooklyn academy of music kerr convinced his colleagues to do 
an impromptu performance at his wedding 
the piece spawned a series called real people starring 
basketball players fly fishermen mothers and daughters a 
different work featuring blind people was just performed at the 
jacobs pillow festival 
im trying to change the nature of traditional performance 
work ms carlson said im interested in extending performance 
into the public creating something that can empower people

korean air lines says it will appeal a 50 
million verdict awarded by a jury that ruled a kal crew acted with 
willful misconduct by straying into soviet airspace an action that 
led to the jet being shot down 
all 269 people aboard the jumbo jet including 61 americans 
died sept 1 1983 when the plane was hit by a missile fired by a 
russian military jet 
the sixmember jury awarded 50 million in punitive damages 
wednesday a day after beginning deliberations 
families of a total of 137 victims will share equally in the 
award said lawyer milton sincoff the decision also will allow the 
families to seek actual damages in federal courts 
without the finding of willful misconduct the families would 
have been limited to compensation of 75000 per passenger a 
figure set by international treaty 
kal lawyer george tompkins said after the verdict that the 
evidence doesnt support the jurys finding and that kal will 
appeal 
a kal motion to dismiss the case is pending before us district 
court judge aubrey robinson the airline also could file a motion 
with robinson to set aside the verdict 
tompkins said it was not believable as suggested by lawyers for 
the families during the twoweek civil trial that the crew flew 
for hours over soviet territory and radioed false position reports 
two expert witnesses former pilots testifying for the 
plaintiffs theorized that flight 007 spent several hours in soviet 
airspace after the crew accidentally misprogrammed one or more of 
the planes computerized navigation systems before taking off from 
anchorage alaska 
shortly after takeoff a kal captain on a flight 14 minutes 
behind flight 007 said he spoke by radio with the doomed airliner 
and that the pilots voice was under stress or tension 
testifying on videotape that kal captain said he was under 
the impression something truly out of the ordinary was occurring 
the pilot aboard flight 007 reported experiencing strong head 
winds while the other kal plane did not even though both aircraft 
were flying in the same area 
tompkins said the kal captain on the videotape was a 
disgruntled employee who had sought unsuccessfully to remain a 
pilot past normal retirement 
tompkins said the crew aboard flight 007 radioed a position 
report saying it was on course over the pacific ocean about an hour 
before it was downed 
however tompkins acknowledged that something happened in 
the final hour of flight because some of the planes wreckage was 
recovered in the sea of japan hundreds of miles from flight 007s 
scheduled flight path 
sincoff said the families of the dead passengers feel they 
received a fair measure of justice 
the families said in a statement that many unanswered 
questions still remain about flight 007 
their comment echoes that of judge robinson 
at the start of the trial robinson said there are people in 
the us and soviet governments who know exactly where this plane 
was shot down and how it got there 
due to national security concerns nobody will breathe a word 
about it robinson said speaking out of the presence of the jury

as this island of 20 million inches toward 
democracy a 30yearold model has gained notoriety with a 
political campaign that relies on maximum exposure nudity 
hsu hsiaodan is running sometimes naked for a seat in 
taiwans yuan legislature in the first election since the lifting 
of martial law two years ago 
like the raucous chairthrowing sessions and fights that break 
out in the yuan hsus unusual campaign for the december vote 
indicates how much the island has changed since martial law 
during the 38 years that taiwan lived under military rule hsu 
might have been locked up for stripping in public and demanding 
greater freedom and free love now taiwans version of cicciolina 
the italian porn star who won a seat in parliament has become the 
most talked about woman on this island 
every major newspaper has carried her halfnaked picture 
indepth interviews on her sex life have appeared in leading 
magazines 
and although the little cabbage as shes called is not 
expected to win her campaign has added spice to taiwans changing 
political scene 
my body is a political weapon laughs hsu as she snuggles 
with one of her three cats in her downtown taipei apartment my 
breasts are nuclear warheads

a key member of the house armed services 
committee is waging a battle in congress to restore the 23000 
annual marine corps pension oliver north lost when he was convicted 
in the irancontra scandal 
rep bill dickinson the senior republican on the committee 
introduced legislation wednesday to restore the pension 
the alabama congressman said that north earned the retirement 
pay during his 20year career in the marines when he demonstrated 
his willingness to give his life for his country north retired 
before his conviction with the rank of lieutenant colonel 
he certainly shouldnt be asked to give up the security of his 
own family over charges that may not have been his doing 
dickinson said 
the bill would exempt north from a law that denies retirement 
pay to any government officer convicted of destroying government 
documents one of three felony crimes for which north was convicted 
the navy suspended norths pension july 5 when he was fined 
150000 and ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service 
for his convictions on charges of aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress accepting an illegal gratuity and altering 
or destroying classified documents 
the navy recommended to us comptroller general charles 
browsher that norths retirement pay be restored but bowsher 
rejected that recommendation monday 
the navys top lawyers disagreed over whether north should be 
considered a government officeholder under the terms of the law 
that denies pension benefits to officials convicted of destroying 
government documents 
because of the conflicting opinions dickinson said congress 
should act to ensure that benefits earned by north arent taken 
away unjustly 
james hinchman the general accounting office lawyer who 
reviewed the navy recommendation for bowsher said it was 
impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is serious doubt 
that a retired regular officer convicted of destroying documents 
can continue to receive retirement pay 
hinchman said denying retirement pay to north would clear the 
way for the former white house aide to seek a court ruling on 
whether the law applies to him 
dickinson said there remains very real and substantial 
questions about whether the destruction of documents by north 
was done illegally or done within the score of his authority 
in a related move the senate on tuesday added language to the 
fiscal 1990 defense bill requiring the senate judiciary committee 
to study the north pension issue and report back to the senate by 
november 
the amendment was a substitute for a proposal by sen steve 
symms ridaho that would have restored the norths full pension

israels supporters in the senate are urging 
colleagues to exercise caution in criticizing the jewish state for 
abducting a moslem cleric linked with lebanese terrorists 
but senate republican leader bob dole of kansas says israel must 
understand that vital us interests including the lives of 
american hostages may be at stake when it takes such unilateral 
actions as the abduction last week of shiek abdul karim obeid a 
moslem religious leader 
the lebanese captors of marine lt col william higgins 
announced this week they had hanged him to avenge obeids 
abduction higgins murder has not been independently confirmed 
and there had been reports that he had been killed months ago 
dole said earlier this week that israel had not told washington 
of its intent to kidnap obeid and said that such freelancing 
might place americans at risk 
i dont think my remarks have driven any wedge between the 
united states and israel dole said wednesday 
my basic message to israel is this we are in this together 
we both have vital interests at stake whenever possible we ought 
to act together and always we ought to take into account the vital 
interests of the other when we contemplate unilateral action 
that is the way to avoid any wedge being driven between us 
he said 
but other senators said israel was justified in its actions and 
implied dole may have caused harm by his remarks 
we ought to be very cautious about our criticism of what 
israel has done said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee 
certainly all of us have questions certainly we want to be 
able to have a dialogue with israel and find out some of the things 
that they may have known and may still know and we dont know 
nunn said 
if there had been a complete release of the prisoners we would 
now be saying this was a marvelous marvelous action i think we 
should be very cautious in rushing to judgment in terms of what the 
israelis have done 
sen john warner rva said israels situation surrounded 
constantly 360 degrees by terrorist groups should be taken 
into consideration 
sen arlen specter rpa said israels exercise of longarm 
jurisdiction against an alleged terrorist suspected of violating 
israeli law was justified and is similar to actions against 
terrorists taken by the united states

rep gus savage dill is the subject of a 
state department investigation into his conduct on official foreign 
trips a house member says 
the decision to send investigators to at least two locations was 
made after inspector general sherman funk reviewed cables from 
several embassies familiar with savages travels since 1984 said 
the house member who spoke wednesday only on the condition of 
anonymity 
the member did not know the investigators destinations

officials

night to his official beijing guest house with two women he had met 
in a disco chinese security officials sought to prevent them from 
entering and savage was seen raising hell at the guard 
station a source told the newspaper 
the women were driven back to their hotels in an official car

a feud between two families erupted in 
gunfire before city officials negotiated a truce hoping to halt a 
20year squabble that had neighbors taking sides 
fistfights threats and arguments between the mcdonald and jones 
families have been common since the late 1960s last weekend the 
tension exploded into a series of shootings in the innercity 
neighborhood that left both houses pockmarked but no one injured 
were extremely lucky over the weekend that someone wasnt 
killed sgt greg mills a police spokesman said wednesday 
the way the violence was escalating it was just a matter of time 
before someone was seriously injured or killed 
the families said many of the arguments during the past 20 years 
began between children but no one can remember what specifically 
started the feud shortly after the joneses moved to the 
neighborhood 23 years ago 
one of them would get into it with one of my daughters and she 
would curse her and then naturally id say something clarencine 
jones explained it just got bigger weve had fights and 
arguments but never guns 
it stayed between the kids before barbara mcdonald said as 
she stood on the front porch of her home 
after the gunfire saturday police called the citys human 
relations department director alvin brooks met with 22 members of 
both families monday on tuesday mrs jones and ms mcdonald 
signed an agreement aimed at ending the feud 
it calls for the families to discourage violence threats or 
hostile remarks it also said the families wont use weapons and 
will be responsible for actions of people who visit their homes 
the agreement requires both families to discourage neighbors 
from getting involved in any disputes as they had in the past 
brooks said the feud will end up in court if either family 
violates the pact mrs jones and ms mcdonald say they will abide 
by the agreement 
i think we can end it i think its pretty much over right 
now ms mcdonald said wednesday 
the weekend gunfire resulted from a childrens argument during a 
football game more than a week ago police reported a shootout 
friday night and two more episodes the next night three people 
were arrested one juvenile and two adults who were charged with 
assault 
mrs jones said she just missed being shot when the shooting 
began friday on flora avenue which is interspersed with vacant 
weedchoked lots bullet holes cover the front door of her small 
beige home and she pointed out bullet marks in the dining room 
curtains and windows 
my nephew came and grabbed me from the dining room i would 
have been dead everybody just hit the floor she said 
across the street gunfire broke the windows of ms mcdonalds 
neat brown and yellow house and holes dot the exterior 
the city will stay involved as long as it needs to brooks said 
its something thats been going over 20 years and just 
signing the paper one day its not going to go away he said 
mrs jones daughter cheryl said she would abide by the 
agreement 
its dangerous for all of us especially with the little kids 
around cheryl jones said five of mrs jones grandchildren live 
with her 
if they keep going around trying to be al capone it wont get 
better

good news for unemployed actors why wait 
around for fussy fiction writers to make up stuff you can perform 
the news tonight 
except for being scooped by abc news apparently inadvertent 
attempt at an emmy nomination for best 10second drama nbc news 
would have been the first network to leap into the questionable 
arena of news recreations why let those sterling bastions of 
journalism like a current affair have all the fun 
at the outset of nbcs new primetime news program yesterday 
today and tomorrow wednesday night coanchor mary alice williams 
promised that the recreations would faithfully reproduce the 
events they portrayed and be clearly labeled 
as to the former its assumably true as to the latter fraid 
not 
in a segment about dna fingerprinting coanchor chuck 
scarborough indeed announces that the crime in question is to be 
recreated but as the segment drones on it becomes confusing to 
the viewer are the pictures of the woman with bruises on her arms 
fake or real is the gruesome closeup of brain tissue in her 
abandoned car recreated if so why 
nbc news has gone over the line between news and entertainment 
a line increasingly blurred in recent months by the proliferation 
of socalled tabloid tv shows that rely on often sensational 
and melodramatic recreations to compete for viewers 
while unsolved mysteries which preceded yesterday today 
and tomorrow wednesday night states at its outset that it is not 
a news program ytt declares proudly that it is occasionally 
the two programs are disturbingly similar 
news recreations have become the tv issue of the summer cbs 
revamped west 57th is reported to have recreations in its 
plan but details of the show which wont premiere until next 
month havent been revealed 
the issue arose when abc news recreated not an event but an 
alleged event the handoff of a briefcase from an accused spy to a 
soviet agent two abc news staffers were the performers in an 
early feed of world news tonight the picture was not labeled a 
simulation in a later feed it was but abc news president 
roone arledge later said that the film of the actors was to be 
used as a model for a computergenerated sketch that would have 
been a graphic more than a simulation 
yesterday today and tomorrow is getting a summer run as a 
series of three specials it does not have a regular time period on 
nbcs fall schedule 
abc is premiering a new primetime news show this week too 
primetime live with diane sawyer and sam donaldson premieres 
tonight it will not include recreations 
yesterday today and tomorrow set out to utilize 
recreations and will no doubt be discussed largely in terms of the 
propriety of network news engaging in recreation of events 
lost in all this is the substance of the program just as well 
the premiere of ytt was indifferent the crime segment which 
was the only one that utilized recreations was hokeylooking at 
best williams segment on whatever happened to the woodstock 
generation was vacuous 
the most compelling segment was maria shrivers segment 
examining selective termination a difficult decision faced by 
parents who resort to fertility drugs to conceive a child and end 
up with multiple fetuses in some cases doctors tell them some 
must be terminated if any are to survive the shriver segment was 
no different from a segment on any newsmagazine no recreations 
just a compelling story 
during the opening of yesterday today and tomorrow 
scarborough announces that show hopes to be unique what is the 
point of employing questionable practices for the sake of producing 
a program that is mediocre but unique maybe nbc news should 
think about getting back to basics instead

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee is working to force a compromise on a capitalgains tax 
to prevent his democraticcontrolled panel from endorsing a major 
element of the 1988 republican party platform 
rep dan rostenkowski dill trying to block the cut favored 
by president bush and dissident democrats said wednesday that he 
was offering an everybody wins compromise that stops short of 
changing tax rules 
rostenkowski has made no effort to hide his disdain for any cut 
in capitalgains taxes because 80 percent of the benefits would go 
to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
unless he can force the compromise he faces the likelihood that 
his own committee where democrats have a 2313 majority will 
endorse the republican plank 
ive worked out pretty much what i view as a possible 
compromise where everybody wins rostenkowski told reporters 
after explaining the concept to his committee members 
his plan would allow investors to avoid taxes on as much as half 
the profit from the sale of assets held over the long term it also 
would provide a greater benefit than an adjustment for inflation 
but less than the capitalgains rate cuts recommended by bush and a 
bipartisan majority of rostenkowskis committee 
rostenkowski said he was pleasantly surprised at how receptive 
gop members were some democrats were skeptical about how the 
proposal would affect the budget deficit 
rostenkowskis proposal is based on the same arguments that bush 
advanced in asking a capitalgains cut that it would spur 
investment and create jobs the chairmans plan would benefit most 
assets obtained after july 31 1989 including common stock in us 
corporations timber and commercial buildings 
under the plan 
profits from the sale of an asset owned more than one year 
after that date but less than five would be adjusted to ensure that 
gains caused solely by inflation would not be taxed for example 
if inflation were 4 percent a year for five years 20 percent of 
the profit would avoid tax 
when an asset owned more than five years but less than 10 was 
sold the seller could subtract inflation for the period or if 
more advantageous could avoid tax on 25 percent of the selling 
price 
in the case of property owned more than 10 years the owner 
could subtract inflation or 50 percent of the price for which the 
asset was sold 
a major part of the 1986 tax overhaul was to wipe out a 
longterm tax break for capital gains such income now is taxed at 
the same rate as wages and other income 
bushs plan which drew little democratic support in the ways 
and means committee would cut the maximum tax rate on capital 
gains from 33 percent to 15 percent 
rep ed jenkins dga a member of the committee proposed an 
alternative that in effect would cut the top rate to 196 percent 
for two years then raise it permanently to 28 percent and add an 
inflation adjustment 
that proposal is supported by all 13 republicans and six 
democrats on ways and means and jenkins said wednesday he has the 
votes to win in the house 
heres how the various proposals would work assuming a block of 
stock was bought for 1000 and sold for 10000 five years and one 
day later with inflation of 4 percent a year 
current law would tax the full gain 9000 at a maximum rate 
of 33 percent for a tax of 2970 
simply indexing the system so that inflationcaused gain 
would escape tax would result in 8800 gain and 2904 tax 
rostenkowskis proposal would mean a 7500 taxable profit and 
a 2475 maximum tax 
jenkins amendment which would exclude 30 percent of gain from 
taxes would have a 6300 taxable gain and a top tax of 2079

some members of the fraternal order of 
police endorsed new restrictions on semiautomatic weapons others 
were sticking by their guns as the organization prepared to vote on 
gun control resolutions 
its a very emotional issue for this group and the delegates 
are really polarized steve cain president of the oklahoma 
fraternal order of police said wednesday 
some delegates many from eastern cities expressed support 
not only for restrictions but also for waiting periods on gun 
purchases other delegates however backed the national rifle 
associations blanket opposition to more gun controls the nra a 
national gun lobby has more than 3 million members 
one of the resolutions which could go to a vote today at the 
organizations national convention would direct the fops 
national legislative committee to support sensible legislation 
on the sale of semiautomatic weapons such as the ak47 the uzi and 
the ar15 
another calls for lobbying efforts against any attempts to 
liberalize laws on machine guns and silencers 
a third resolution supports the concept of waiting periods on 
gun sales 
don cahill chairman of the legislative panel said he was 
confident about the chances of the resolutions being passed by the 
5000 attending the convention 
he added that the fop has been inaccurately portrayed as 
antigun ownership 
that is not the case cahill said were sportsmen and 
were marksmen but some guns have no legitimate use other than to 
kill other people including police officers 
all we want to do is to slow down the proliferation of weapons 
obtained by the criminals 
cahill of the prince william county va police department said 
some of the strongest opponents of the resolutions are from 
sparsely populated western states where you could shoot off a 
cannon and it wouldnt hurt anybody 
but the majority of our cops are not in those locations they 
are in densely populated areas 
deputy sheriff cr powell of tucson ariz said he fears 
passage of the resolutions ultimately will lead to police officers 
not having access to weapons with the firepower that criminals have 
he said the pima county sheriffs department is constantly 
fighting drug runners from nearby mexico who are armed with 
semiautomatic weapons 
i dont want to be facing the bad guys with just a 45 
powell said 
charles j oshinsky of charleston sc a retired police and 
security officer said his position is no gun control 
whatsoever he backs the nra position that outlawing weapons 
infringes on the constitutional right to bear arms 
the nra though present at the convention is prohibited from 
lobbying at its booth in a building across from the state fair 
arena site of the conventions main business 
jody thomas of the nra said the association was notified in 
writing to refrain from political activity at the booth she said 
the nra has been advancing its cause at a hospitality suite near 
the convention 
inside the hall numerous fop members espoused the nra view 
among them sam cross a retired police chief from indio calif 
who said he found gun controls such as waiting periods ineffective 
weve had waiting periods for at least 20 years in california 
but the crime rate has kept going up he said 
still cain a lieutenant with the norman police department 
said something must be done 
i head a narcotics unit said cain and im tired of 
seeing our officers outgunned

hezbollah was formed seven years ago and 
became an arm of terror for irans fundamentalist shiite moslem 
revolution 
western intelligence agencies say blackscarved fanatics of the 
party of god have cut a trail of terror kidnapping scores of 
foreigners in lebanon hijacking airliners and killing hundreds of 
americans frenchmen and israelis in suicide bombings 
they believe hezbollahs core of 3500 fighters includes about 
150 kidnappers using cover names including islamic jihad 
organization of the oppressed on earth and revolutionary justice 
organization 
all these groups overlap and in all likelihood are the same 
people said adam cherski a specialist on iran with the 
institute for the study of terrorism in london despite tehrans 
denials the iranian influence with these people is very very 
strong 
hezbollah embraces the cult of martyrdom embedded in shiite 
tradition since the 7th century when islam was split over the 
succession to the prophet mohammed founder of the religion 
it was formed in 1982 by shiite militants and iranian 
revolutionary guards who were sent to the syriancontrolled bekaa 
valley of eastern lebanon to fight israels invasion army 
the organizations roots are in 1969 when plans for a militant 
movement were made in najaf iraq where ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini lived after the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi sent him 
into exile 
in najaf iranian mullahs laid the foundations of the islamic 
revolution that toppled the shah 10 years later 
financed by up to 5 million a month of iranian money hezbollah 
tried to create another islamic republic by building religious 
social educational agricultural and medical services for 1 
million shiites in lebanon the countrys largest sect 
government authority had been eroded by a long civil war and 
hezbollah made a virtual state within a state while fighting for 
control of the shiite community with a more moderate rival the 
syrianbacked amal militia 
in recent months mirroring the power struggle in tehran four 
factions have arisen in hezbollah 
one is allied with irans new president hashemi rafsanjani and 
another with hardline interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi a 
third is linked to ayatollah husseinali montazeri once khomeinis 
designated heir and the small fourth group has aligned itself with 
syria 
there are indications rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled 
pragmatists who see no future in exporting khomeinis revolution 
is trying to rein in shiite zealots in lebanon 
shiite sources say mohtashemis influence over hezbollah began 
to decline when rafsanjani emerged after khomeinis death june 3 as 
irans most powerful politician they say rafsanjani has sent some 
of his allies in the revolutionary guards to the bekaa to contain 
the militants 
militants in hezbollah have followed mohtashemi but its 
political leaders in beiruts southern slums side with rafsanjani 
who controls their finances 
when the movements spiritual guide sheik mohammad hussein 
fadlallah visited tehran with other hezbollah leaders in july to 
mark the end of 40 days of mourning for khomeini he reported to 
rafsanjani 
previously fadlallah had reported to mohtashemi or hussein 
sheikoleslam deputy foreign minister and a link for years between 
tehran and hezbollah 
sheikoleslam was involved in the 1979 us embassy seizure in 
tehran a former student at the university of california at 
berkeley he trained with the palestine liberation organization in 
southern lebanon in 1977 and was an interrogator of the us 
hostages in tehran 
he had close ties to hezbollah in the early 1980s when he was 
based in damascus and mohtashemi was ambassador to syria 
us intelligence has linked both men to suicide bombings in 
1983 and 1984 including an attack on the us marine base in 
beirut that killed more than 240 military personnel 
a central figure in hezbollah violence is imad mughniyeh 36 
its chief of security 
western intelligence agencies list him as leader of islamic 
jihad or islamic holy war which holds two us hostages he is 
believed to be the brains behind scores of kidnappings 
mughniyeh is wanted by the united states in the 1985 hijacking 
of a twa jetliner in which a us navy diver was killed and 33 
americans were held hostage 17 days

passengers praised the pilot of a 
piedmont airlines jet who brought the aircraft down safely after a 
rubber wheel block jammed the landing gear and they thanked god 
they were alive 
i was praying i had my rosary i was saying mass i just 
knew we werent going to crash said marie fay of mclean va 
who was chainsmoking and perspiring profusely after telephoning 
relatives 
god and the pilot were with us she said 
a boeing 737400 with 94 passengers and six crew members aboard 
and piloted by a 20year veteran who wasnt scheduled to make the 
flight came to a skidding halt with a wing and engine scraping the 
runway wednesday after its left landing gear failed to lower no 
one was injured 
airline officials declined to identify the pilot of piedmont 
flight 1489 but he was identified by his family as larry fuda of 
rocky mount va the roanoke times amp worldnews reported in 
todays editions 
fuda 48 declined interviews wednesday night as he rested at 
his home with his family 
hes just glad it worked out said his wife margaret the 
whole crew did just what they were supposed to do he says he 
doesnt consider himself a hero 
the plane was bound for charlotte from washington national 
airport but was diverted to greensboro after a light on the jets 
instrument panel showed the landing gear wasnt locked said usair 
spokesman david shipley piedmont is a subsidiary of usair group 
the greensboro airport was chosen because it has the longest 
runway in the state and piedmont has a maintenance hangar and a 
larger staff with technical expertise there officials said the 
plane circled the airport for more than a hour as the pilot and 
piedmont officials on the ground collaborated on ways of shaking 
the gear loose 
a flash of flame and smoke flew from the engine as it dragged 
the runway when it came to a stop fire crews hosed down the left 
side of the plane as passengers and crew evacuated by sliding down 
two emergency chutes shortly before 11 am 
i opened my eyes saw the plane was in one piece thanked god 
and got the hell off said michael maher 31 of washington 
phillip powell an air safety investigator with the national 
transportation safety board said investigators found a chock a 
triangular rubber block 30 inches long and 6 inches high used to 
brace the wheels of parked planes wedged between two wheels on 
the left landing gear 
inflight efforts to shake the wheels loose failed and after 
the landing the gear remained jammed 
powell said officials did not know whether the incident was an 
accident or sabotage 
chocks normally are removed by the ground crew before the plane 
leaves the gate said powell and j daniel brock usairs vice 
president of marketing services they said they had never before 
seen a malfunction from a wheel chock that jammed landing gear 
fuda was not originally scheduled to pilot the flight according 
to donnie campbell a retired piedmont pilot and neighbor of fudas 
he just picked this trip up campbell said he was 
supposed to work friday night but theyre having a farewell to 
piedmont party in roanoke friday night and he wanted to go to 
that

a wrongful life lawsuit claiming a child 
should never have been conceived can go to trial the indiana court 
of appeals has ruled 
in a 21 decision wednesday the court reinstated the claim of 
the son of a mentally retarded nursing home resident who was raped 
by another patient 
previously california new jersey and washington have 
recognized a wrongful life suit in which a child claims that were 
it not for the negligence of another the child would never have 
been born 
forum group inc owner of riverview manor nursing home in 
marion is the defendant in the indiana suit 
according to court records a mentally retarded resident of the 
home wayne anthony morgan had intercourse with a retarded 
34yearold woman unable to speak or control her muscles more 
than once in the summer of 1985 
morgan later pleaded guilty but mentally ill to a rape charge 
the woman gave birth to a son on march 25 1986 later a suit 
was filed against the nursing home on behalf of the woman her 
parents and the son 
the suit brought on behalf of the boy by his adoptive mother 
claimed negligence allowed the child to be born into a world in 
which there is no natural parent capable of caring for and 
supporting him 
other parts of the suit alleged forum was negligent in not 
protecting the mother from morgan and in failing to provide 
prenatal care until discovering the pregnancy in its fifth month 
forum didnt concede morgan was the father and denied negligence 
johnson circuit court judge jeffrey c eggers dismissed all of 
the claims except one pressed by the adoptive mother that is 
awaiting trial 
but the court of appeals said the sons claim deserves a trial 
judge linda chezem wrote for the court 
we now recognize a wrongful life cause of action to include a 
situation where as in the boys case both parents are so 
severely mentally or physically impaired as to render them 
incapable of affirmatively deciding to have a child or to care for 
a child and where but for the custodians negligent care of both 
parents the child would not have been conceived 
the court majority said an indiana law prohibiting certain 
wrongful life actions fails to apply in this case that law 
prevents a claim related to a decision on whether to abort a 
pregnancy 
but chezem said the boys claim raises a separate issue of 
whether without forums negligence he would have been conceived 
although the boys claim sought financial support until he 
reaches age 21 the court said any support he receives as damages 
should be only for the period from his birth until his adoption 
in a concurring opinion judge william conover said he would go 
farther by allowing the child to recover damages for mental pain 
suffering and anguish based on a diminished quality of life he 
might suffer from being the child of two mentally deficient parents 
conover said the child had a personal right not to be born 
under such circumstances and thus his conception alone 
constitutes the required trauma and injury however slight to 
recover damages 
court of appeals chief judge wesley w ratliff jr disagreed 
with the majority arguing that the childs birth in itself should 
not be considered an injury for which he can collect damages 
ratliff said that although testimony indicated the child had a 
10 percent chance of developing a medical problem there is no 
evidence the boy suffers from any defect or disability without 
that proof no injury and no liability exist ratliff said

the tobacco and cigarette industries and their 
opponents are each breathing easier after a house vote that retains 
a ban on airline smoking but fails to expand it 
in a preliminary 259169 vote the house decided wednesday to 
make permanent the ban on smoking aboard airline flights of two 
hours or less the restriction covering four of five us routes 
would otherwise expire next april 
with that same vote however lawmakers refused to consider a 
proposal that would have expanded the ban to cover all domestic 
us flights 
the provision was part of the 119 billion spending bill for 
fiscal 1990 beginning oct 1 for federal transportation programs 
a vote on final approval of the overall legislation was planned for 
today which would send it to the senate 
meanwhile the house adopted a separate bill wednesday 
increasing federal expenditures for aids research prevention and 
treatment to 16 billion next year 25 percent higher than this 
year 
the same measure halts plans for a government survey of american 
sexual habits a study officials had hoped would give them clues 
about how sexually transmitted diseases spread 
tobacco interests did little to block the smoking ban extension 
reasoning that allowing the ban to become permanent would prevent 
antismoking forces from seeking to expand it every time the law 
expired 
a lot of members simply wanted to be rid of the issue said 
walker merryman vice president of the tobacco institute the 
industrys lobbying arm in washington 
we recognize the realities of politics said rep walter 
jones dnc whose district is one of the countrys largest 
producers of tobacco this is the best compromise we can get 
the tobacco industry has argued that opponents claims of health 
problems caused by secondary smoke inhaled by nonsmokers are 
unproven and that the ban is bad for business 
supporters of the ban backed by health groups and airline 
employee unions argued that smoking kills hundreds of thousands of 
people annually and that secondary smoke kills 5000 more 
tell me a more important health issue said rep richard 
durbin dill sponsor of the ban proposals tell me a more 
important life and death issue 
durbin is the author of the law enacted in 1987 at that time 
the house passed a permanent ban on smoking aboard flights of two 
hours or less it was watered down to a twoyear prohibition by the 
senate where senators from tobaccogrowing states hold influential 
positions 
the aids spending was contained in legislation providing 1552 
billion for fiscal 1990 for labor health and education 
initiatives the bill was approved 36558 and sent to the senate 
the 11 million survey of american sexual preferences was sought 
by the public health service which has complained that the most 
current statistics on the subject are from the 1948 kinsey report 
but conservatives in the bush administration and in congress 
have said enough is already known about the sexual transmission of 
aids and that the questionnaire would be an invasion of privacy a 
preliminary survey form asked participants whether their most 
recent sexual partner was male or female and what they thought 
about masturbation and oral sex 
more than 100000 americans have been diagnosed as having aids 
and more than 58000 of them have died according to the centers 
for disease control

thousands of suspected political opponents in 
ethiopia have been imprisoned for months or even years without 
trial and many have been tortured repeatedly amnesty 
international charged today 
the worldwide human rights organization based in london said 
ethiopia has systematically ignored constitutional and legal 
safeguards for human rights and is among the worst offenders in 
africa in failing to ratify international human rights covenants 
in a 13page report on political imprisonment in the east 
african nation amnesty said some prisoners have been secretly 
condemned to death by a special government committee or vanish 
without explanation while in detention 
methods of torture include electric shocks submersion in water 
and beatings on the soles of the feet the group said 
amnesty said ethiopia has responded to the groups charges with 
either silence or evasion it appealed to president mengistu 
haile mariams marxist government to free prisoners detained for 
their opinions beliefs or ethnic origins who have not used or 
advocated violence 
thousands of political prisoners have been detained for months 
or even years on the orders of the state security service the 
central investigation organ without their cases ever being 
referred to the courts the report said 
following a failed coup attempt in may authorities detained 180 
people mostly military personnel but the government has given no 
information of their whereabouts or legal status it said 
amnesty asked the government to either release the prisoners or 
formally charge and try them 
ethiopias constitution specifies that anyone arrested should be 
produced in court within 48 hours and that no one accused of a 
crime should be considered guilty unless convicted by a court the 
report said 
however in practice these constitutional safeguards have 
been ineffective amnesty said arrests have frequently been 
carried out without a warrant and no political prisoner is known 
have been brought to court and charged within 48 hours

the energy and defense departments will be 
allowed to hire double dipper retirees and give huge salary 
increases to critical technical personnel under the senates 
version of the defense authorization bill 
the pay provisions are considered unprecedented 
some 525 scientists and engineers 500 from defense and 25 from 
energy could thus get 134250 per year more than anybody in the 
government except the president 
the president makes 200000 the vice president 110000 and 
members of congress and cabinet officers get 89500 
current law forbids military officers from getting a pension if 
they return to the government payroll a practice called double 
dipping 
the defense bill for the next fiscal year would permit the 
pentagon to hire 1000 retired officers and the energy department 
250 who could still draw full pensions the provision tries to 
encourage specialists to take critical jobs 
the pentagon also would be authorized to set up four pilot 
programs under which the department could adjust rank and pay of a 
total of 100000 civilian employees giving the department a 
flexibility that current law forbids 
individuals could receive pay increases as long as total payroll 
costs did not change 
other government departments could operate a total of six such 
programs the office of personnel management would have to approve 
the provisions of these programs 
the house version of the defense bill includes no such 
provisions a conference committee will have to produce an 
agreedupon version of the bill in september 
both versions include a 36 percent pay raise for pentagon 
employees

escape heavy rain when the structure collapsed dropping stone 
columns and bricks on them lt gen ivan gladush the ukraines 
interior minister was quoted as saying in the newspaper krasnaya

nearby metro station were trapped under the rubble the tv report 
said it said the brown stone rubble pile was 16 feet high

a 19th century gold prospector may have 
been telling the truth according to a team studying the mans 
claims he only killed one of his five prospecting companions 
alferd packer was convicted in 1885 of killing the other five 
members of the party and was sentenced to 40 years in prison but 
although he admitted resorting to cannibalism to stay alive after 
the group became stranded in the snow packer maintained until his 
death that he had killed only one 
a study of the prospectors remains support that claim walter 
birkby curator of physical anthropology at the university of 
arizona said wednesday 
the remains were exhumed last month from their resting place in 
the rockies near lake city colo and are being studied at the 
university of arizona 
examinations of and tests on the bones of the five showed signs 
that flesh was scraped off with a knife birkby said the four 
skulls removed from a common grave also showed signs of hatchet 
blows he said 
the fifth skull was gone when the bones were buried in august 
1874 
anthropologists have taken on the challenge to see if they can 
determine the real story through scientific detection and see if 
packer was wrongly convicted 
packer insisted he shot only one of the men and hit him in the 
head with a hatchet in self defense packer said the man had killed 
the four others with a hatchet 
birkby said findings included a bullet hole in the pelvic bone 
of one of the skeletons 
the study team might be able to attach names to bones with 
further study of the remains which include buttons belt buckles 
and some partially decomposed clothing birkby said 
the study team was assembled by james starrs a law professor at 
george washington university in washington dc starrs has said 
that final results of the study will be detailed at the annual 
meeting of the american academy of forensic sciences in february

a richmond va priest fired from his job by 
his roman catholic bishop for trying to set up a separate 
africanamerican catholic congregation now seeks to challenge 
other black priests 
the rev bruce greening announced wednesday he would join the 
rev george a stallings in setting up a separate africanamerican 
catholic congregation 
what is happening at imani temple is in my opinion the right 
method to take greening said referring to the congregation set 
up by stallings himself suspended by washington archbishop james 
hickey 
greening said he wanted to challenge other black priests and 
other black sisters to follow stallings example 
greening 38 was fired by the catholic diocese of richmond for 
which he had worked since 1988 as the principal of an elementary 
school in norfolk the priest a member of the society of the 
divine savior in milwaukee wis had requested a leave of absence 
from his virginia job to set up a separate congregation for blacks 
he remains a priest 
by the very fact of his free decision father greening 
automatically dissociates himself from the diocese of richmond 
said richmond bishop walter f sullivan i am relieving him of 
his duties as principal of st marys academy in norfolk effective 
immediately 
stallings who has strongly criticized the catholic church 
accusing its leaders of not meeting the needs of its black members 
said greening would assist him as a minister and in forming a 
school at the monthold imani temple 
the rev keith brennan spokesman for the society of the divine 
savior salvatorian order in wisconsin said no action had been 
taken there by greenings provincial the rev paul portland 
this is the first time that we have had anything like this 
happen said brennan we are trying to find as much 
information about what occurred and what our obligations are 
within the law of the church 
brennan said the wisconsin office would first hold an internal 
meeting and would then call greening back to his home office for an 
explanation 
he said that greening was the only black priest among 123 at the 
wisconsin religious order 
in atlanta meanwhile black catholics are poised to begin today 
their annual laymans conference the first major gathering of 
black catholics since stallings founded his splinter group 
the rev james goode a san francisco priest who will attend the 
atlanta conference praised stallings movement as a beautiful 
time of coming together of africanamerican catholics across the 
country 
at the press conference in washington greening said he had been 
warned by the richmond bishop against becoming involved with 
stallings 
stallings who appeared with greening said the congregation of 
the imani temple would be meeting aug 19 to discuss the issues 
they feel should be at the forefront of the churchs agenda 
were going to look at teenage pregnancy and the drug 
epidemic in our community he said we see these issues as 
being systematic of greater issues in our society other 
priorities for the black community are unemployment and education 
stallings said 
he also said the imani temple has received several requests from 
other cities to help them establish other africanamerican 
congregations 
stallings said although he has his eye set on certain cities he 
felt would respond enthusiastically he first wanted to set the 
groundwork for the mother church

disabled americans could enjoy civil rights 
protections with a comprehensive measure approved by the bush 
administration and key senators 
the americans with disabilities act sailed unanimously through 
the senate labor and human resources committee wednesday and is 
expected to be approved by the full senate 
this historic legislation will end segregation and 
discrimination against people with disabilities in all aspects of 
american society said a statement released jointly by 
cosponsors of the measure sens edward kennedy dmass tom 
harkin diowa and david durenburger rminn 
the measure was hailed by civil rights groups as well as aids 
advocacy organizations 
ralph g neas director of the leadership conference on civil 
rights a coalition of 180 national organizations said the bill is 
probably the most comprehensive civil rights measure since the 
1964 civil rights act 
the agreement between president bush and the senators was a 
fair compromise that resulted in a strong and effective bill he 
said 
disability rights groups have been lobbying for years to give 
the nations estimated 37 million disabled americans including 
people with aids the same civil rights protections as minorities 
and women 
the aids action council said the measure marked a turning 
point in the federal response to the challenges of the aids 
epidemic 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush favors allowing 
maximum flexibility to implement effective solutions and 
bringing the disabled into the mainstream without imposing undue 
burdens 
the president believes this can be accomplished by using 
reasonable measures phased over time as this legislation does 
he said the president has pursued a common sense approach 
seeking a practical bill that will help the disabled reach their 
full potential 
the agreement provides for 
federal protection for the disabled against job discrimination 
paralleling existing protections that apply to organizations that 
receive federal funds initially the new requirement would apply 
to employers of 25 or more but eventually it would cover employers 
with at least 15 workers 
a ban on discrimination against the disabled in public 
accommodations including restaurants stores and health care 
facilities 
enforcement of these new civil rights protections through the 
equal employment opportunity commission and suits seeking 
injunctive relief 
fitzwater said a core group of public accommodations would be 
required to make readily achievable alterations to existing 
facilities to accommodate the disabled 
this legislation is designed to achieve access for the 
disabled in the most efficient manner with emphasis on making new 
buildings accessible he said

factions of japans scandalridden governing party 
were meeting today to decide whether to throw their support to a 
former cabinet minister with a reputaton as a reformer 
several major japanese newspapers said the factions support was 
certain to give former education minister toshiki kaifu enough 
votes within the liberal democratic party to become party president 
and its candidate for prime minister 
the party president is assured of being elected prime minister 
by parliament because of the partys large majority in the lower 
house 
kaifu a 10term lower house member officially announced his 
candidacy on wednesday if no other candidates appear before 
saturdays deadline he could be declared party president without a 
parliamentary election currently scheduled for tuesday officials 
said 
the vote in parliament was expected aug 10 
kaifu 58 would succeed prime minister sousuke uno who 
announced last month he would resign after only two months in 
office because of the partys heavy losses in july 23 elections for 
the upper house of parliament uno also was linked to a sex scandal 
in which he was accused of keeping paid mistresses 
kaifu normally would be an unlikely candidate for the 
premiership because he has a small power base within the party and 
belongs to a faction headed by 78yearold toshio komoto with 29 
members the komoto faction is one of the smallest groups in the 
conservative governing party 
kaifu has not held key cabinet posts nor top party jobs that 
normally are considered prerequisites for the nations highest 
office 
but larger factions in the giant governing party decided not to 
field candidates or were unable to find suitable choices untainted 
by the recruit co bribery scandal which toppled unos 
predecessor noboru takeshita 
the power groupings were meeting today and considering kaifus 
candidacy 
recruit sold stocks in a subsidiary to about 160 influential 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen at bargain prices before 
the shares were offered for public sale in 1986 the price soared 
when the stock went on the market and the buyers made huge profits 
recruit also made large political donations and loans to 
political figures 
kaifu acknowledged he had received about 110000 in political 
donations during a fiveyear period from recruit co 
but he said the donations had been properly reported and that 
he had received no stock shares from the information and publishing 
conglomerate 
like many members of parliament kaifu and takeshita both 
graduated from tokyos waseda university and reportedly have 
maintained close ties 
party officials said the new prime minister would serve only the 
remainder of takeshitas original term which ends oct 31 the 
party will then hold a new election 
kaifu told reporters wednesday it was too early to talk in 
detail about his policies but political reform is the biggest 
issue that has been raised by the people he said 
party members have called for political reform to help restore 
public trust in the party eroded by the recruit scandal unos 
alleged involvement with mistresses and a highly unpopular 3 
percent sales tax the party instituted 
kaifu has a background as a reformer he is a member of the 
reform committee set up by the liberal democrats to deal with the 
recruit scandal 
from 1974 to 1976 he was deputy chief cabinet secretary under 
the late prime minister takeo miki who sought to clean up japans 
money politics when he succeeded scandalplagued prime minister 
kakuei tanaka 
kaifu later served as education minister for two periods 
totaling about two years

attorney general dick thornburgh is convinced 
that william lucas did not get the civil rights post because he 
refused to criticize recent supreme court decisions 
the attorney general said wednesday he discounted the 
significance of criticism by several democrats on the senate 
judiciary committee that lucas lacked expertise for the job 
lucas 61 a former sheriff and chief executive of wayne county 
mich has never tried a court case the panel refused tuesday on a 
pair of 77 votes to recommend lucas nomination or send it to the 
senate floor for further consideration 
thornburgh said mr lucas supported the views of the president 
and the attorney general in this regard when he testified that no 
legislation was needed at this time to overturn the rulings 
i find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the 
president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an 
important area of the law thornburgh said

education secretary lauro f cavazos is 
finding it difficult to sell the administrations idea of 
parental choice to the chairman of the education and labor 
committee 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif made clear wednesday he was 
not impressed by cavazos plea for support for proposals 
emphasizing parental involvement that he said were needed to 
revitalize school systems 
although initiatives outlined by cavazos have been embraced in 
principle by the senate education panel and the house 
appropriations committee hawkins told cavazos he sees some 
dangerous trends in the proposals being advocated 
for example he characterized the parental choice approach to 
school selection for their children as a very dangerous idea that 
has not been fully scrutinized 
the selling of choice reminds me of the medicine man selling 
snake oil said hawkins

the senate foreign relations committee is 
being urged to ratify an international antidrug trafficking treaty 
attorney general dick thornburgh told the panel wednesday the 
pact will provide us with enhanced law enforcement tools and can 
lead to substantial advances in our international cooperative 
efforts to counter the illegal drug market 
thornburgh signed the un convention against illicit traffic in 
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances on behalf of the united 
states last december in vienna 
the treaty includes a provision under which all the nations 
signing the convention have agreed to exchange evidence of criminal 
conduct and to extradite accused traffickers so that safe havens 
are no longer so readily available he said 
however thornburgh noted in response to questions from chairman 
claiborne pell dri that the treaty does not obligate countries 
to extradite their own nationals wanted on drugrelated charges in 
other countries

the treasury department says it plans to 
borrow 395 billion from the public next week in a series of debt 
auctions being held to replenish the governments depleted coffers 
treasury officials said wednesday the auctions are contingent on 
passage by congress this week of a bill to raise the limit on 
federal borrowing by 70 billion to a record 287 trillion 
the house approved the measure on tuesday and it is expected to 
win senate approval before congress begins a monthlong recess on 
saturday 
the administration has warned lawmakers that failure to boost 
the debt ceiling before the august recess would force the 
government into an unprecedented default on its bills on aug 15 
treasury undersecretary robert glauber told reporters wednesday 
that the debt auctions scheduled for next week are contingent on 
final passage of the increase in the debt limit the national debt 
as of tuesday stood only 25 million below the current ceiling of 
28 trillion 
according to wednesdays announcement the auctions for next 
week will include 
10 billion in threeyear notes in minimum denominations of 
5000 to be auctioned tuesday 
975 billion in 10year notes in minimum denominations of 
1000 to be auctioned wednesday 
975 billion in 30year bonds in minimum denominations of 
1000 to be auctioned thursday

auctions which are held four times a year

said it would also sell 10 billion in cash management bills that 
would mature on april 19 1990 these bills will be sold in minimum 
denominations of 10000

as federal officials in chicago announced the 
indictment of 46 traders on the nations two largest commodity 
exchanges a house committee wrangled over how best to eliminate 
fraud in the marketplace 
legislation approved wednesday by the agriculture committee 
would grant permanent regulatory authority to the commodity futures 
trading commission which congress has reauthorized on a temporary 
basis every three or four years since its creation in 1974 
it also would impose restrictions on trading practices that have 
come under criticism following disclosure of the federal 
commodities probe 
during the daylong session the committee approved an amendment 
making insider trading on the commodity futures markets a felony 
punishable by five years in prison and a 500000 fine 
the panel also killed in an 1817 vote an earlier amendment 
outlawing front running whereby a broker trades for his own 
account before taking care of customers who want to make the same 
trade 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the subcommittee called 
the chicago indictments a dark day for the industry the types of 
wrongdoing alleged in the indictments cast a long shadow of doubt 
on how well the public has been protected as it participated in the 
futures markets 
but english said the pending legislation marks the dawn of a 
new day as well 
the session began hours before officials in chicago announced 
indictments stemming from a 2 year investigation into alleged 
trading fraud on the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange the charges ranged from tax fraud to 
racketeering 
us attorney anton valukas said traders broke the law as well 
as exchange rules by arranging deals with one another before and 
after the pits were open for trading 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas told 
the panel that the indictments were the us attorneys 
responsibility our responsibility is to see that there is law on 
the books to protect the public 
the committee later wednesday approved on a voice vote 
legislation based on a bill adopted last week by the conservation 
credit and rural development subcommittee 
the bill would go to the senate if approved by the full house a 
vote by on the house floor has not been scheduled 
the bill would severely limit the practice of dual trading in 
which floor traders can trade for themselves as well as their 
customers on the same day 
critics say the practice which is legal encourages brokers to 
take care of themselves to the detriment of their customers but in 
several days of testimony earlier this summer supporters 
including officials of the two chicago exchanges claimed dual 
trading helps ease market volatility when there are few customer 
orders 
the bill sponsored by english and rep e thomas coleman 
rmo would ban dual trading except in certain circumstances 
including small markets with an average daily trading volume of 
7000 contracts or fewer 
contract markets also would be exempt from the dual trading ban 
if they could prove that by later this year they would have 
adequate surveillance systems and procedures so investigators could 
track any given trade to within one minute of its conclusion 
tracking trades is known in the industry as following the audit 
trail 
no later than three years after the law took effect markets 
would have to be able to track trades to within 30 seconds to win 
the exemption 
amendments introduced last week by rep robin tallon dsc 
would have made the practice of front running a felony with a 
fine of up to 500000 upon conviction 
in a letter to de la garza on tuesday the justice department 
stated that front running is adequately addressed by exisiting 
law under the mail and wire fraud statutes and the amendments 
should be dropped 
the committee eliminated tallons amendments on a narrow vote on 
the ground that it might jeopardize the chicago probe by calling 
into question whether front running was illegal 
cftc chief of staff robert mackay told the committee that 
there is no doubt in the commissions view that front running 
was a crime under existing law changing the law now could indeed 
jeopardize ongoing investigations he added 
an amendment to raise the amount of money or collateral known 
as the margin requirement investors must deposit with brokers 
when buying or selling futures contracts was withdrawn after 
numerous committee members opposed it

a taiwanese businessman implicated last year 
in a major insider trading case with a junior analyst at a 
venerable wall street brokerage house has agreed to pay more than 
25 million to settle civil charges 
the securities and exchange commission announced wednesday that 
fred c lee 39 a taiwanese national living in hong kong agreed 
to pay 251 million in illegal profits and fines to a 
courtappointed receiver 
the sec sued lee in new york last year charging that he engaged 
in a 19 million insider trading scheme with stephen k wang then 
a 24yearold analyst with morgan stanley amp cos mergers 
department 
wang pleaded guilty sept 7 to one count each of securities 
wire and mail fraud for taking about 200000 to funnel 
confidential information to lee about at least 25 takeover deals 
that were being handled by morgan at the time there was no 
allegation of wrongdoing by morgan which suspended and later fired 
wang 
in a related development the sec settled a lawsuit with 
standard chartered bank a british bank that held 125 million of 
lees money at its hong kong branch 
the sec got a federal judge in new york to order standard 
chartered to turn over in new york an amount equal to the money lee 
had on deposit in hong kong the bank complied but sued claiming 
it was being put in a kind of financial double jeopardy because lee 
was suing for the release of his 125 million in the hong kong 
courts 
the case went to the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in 
manhattan which had yet to rule 
with the surrender of lees 25 million 300000 was turned 
over to the bank for expenses incurred in the new york and hong 
kong lawsuits 
the settlement of the case presents us with the outcome we 
were seeking and we are therefore pleased that we were able to 
discontinue our appeal martin hayman standard chartered groups 
chief legal officer said in a statement issued in new york 
the bank has 700 branches in 50 countries 
according to the sec lee made 19 million on trades for 
himself and about 30 other people by allegedly trading on the 
inside information he got from wang 
in an interview with sec attorneys in hong kong last year lee 
admitted using inside information supplied by wang 
sec officials said that until the record 650 million settlement 
by the investment banking firm of drexel burnham lambert inc 
pushed ivan f boesky down the list to no 2 the leewang case was 
the secondlargest insider trading scheme ever prosecuted 
as part of the settlement lee agreed to pay 19 million into a 
fund to reimburse investors defrauded by his scheme 
lee also will pay 15 million in fines and 45 million in back 
taxes with interest on his illegal trading profits

president mikhail gorbachev may be popular abroad 
but his lack of success at home has eroded his oncestrong support 
a writer said 
a migranyan wrote in an 18page commentary in the july issue of 
the literary journal novy mir that gorbachev was much more popular 
during his first two years in power gorbachev took office in march 
1985 and launched his program to make soviet society more open and 
reform the economy 
public opinion polls in many foreign countries show gorbachev 
wildly popular but although migranyan said the 58yearold kremlin 
chief has proven himself an adept and appealing politician the 
picture is different at home 
it is not enough to maintain popularity and mass support 
constantly if there are no positive results leaders need 
successes even small ones to consolidate their authority he 
wrote 
the writer blamed the problems not so much on gorbachev but on 
communist party functionaries gorbachev himself has admitted his 
program is faltering and has lashed out at party officials and 
bureaucrats resisting his reforms 
he has called for an urgent renewal of party and government 
ranks from the local to the national level 
migranyan did not specify how he believes his programs have 
failed but most soviets know the problems well 
soviets continue to be plagued by chronic shortages of housing 
food and consumer goods crime pollution and drunkenness are 
reported on the rise and the government faces a soaring budget 
deficit 
migranyan said gorbachev is in a difficult position as he tries 
to reform soviet society from the centralized corruptionplagued 
system of government that has existed for decades 
he wants to destroy the existing structures and at the 
same time personifies those structures for the public and 
certinaly lack of successes which are due to the clumsy 
functioning of the party and state structures weakens his role as a 
leader the commentator said 
the people he wrote are impatient and disappointed in 
perestroika and have become demoralized because they are left with 
the following picture the past is shameful the present is 
horrendous and the future is unpredictable 
he called for gorbachev and the rest of the leadership to take 
more radical steps to prevent the further dmiminishing of 
gorbachevs authority 
if that effort fails migranyan warned power might be taken 
by those forces who would motivate the forceful termination of the 
modernization process by the wish to restore law and order in the 
society and put a stop to chaos in the country

in passing the 295 billion military 
authorization bill the democraticcontrolled senate sets the stage 
for a clash with the house over key elements of president bushs 
strategic weapons programs 
the senate which approved the bill 954 wednesday left 
relatively intact the dollars and the structure of the strategic 
weapons programs the house last week made deep cuts denounced by 
the white house as irresponsible both in terms of national security 
and arms control 
in my judgment this will be the most difficult conference in 
a decade said sen john warner of virginia ranking republican 
on the senate armed services committee but im confident that we 
can emerge with a bill which will meet the presidents basic policy 
goals 
its going to be very difficult said sen sam nunn dga 
the committee chairman there are more profound differences with 
the house than we have had for a long long time 
nunn was asked how he will enter the conference that opens sept 
8 well armed he replied 
how does he expect to emerge alive nunn said 
about the cuts made by the house nunn said we will be very 
interested in hearing their logic it doesnt leap out at you 
the senate bill which conforms closely to bushs 
recommendations calls for a modest cut of 400 million in the 49 
billion request for the star wars antimissile shield 
it endorses the b2 stealth bomber if it meets flight test and 
radarevasion standards it takes only a token 300 million bite 
from the administrations 47 billion request for the batwinged 
aircraft 
the senate also backed the 11 billion request to make the mx 
missile a mobile rather than a stationary target by placing the 
weapons on railway cars 
and it left intact the 100 million earmarked for the 
singlewarhead midgetman missile 
the house took a sharply different course 
members strictly limited production of the b2 bomber pressing 
the pentagon to produce a program far cheaper than the 70 billion 
price tag for 132 planes now envisioned 
they slashed the star wars request by 18 billion and deleted 
502 million intended to help make the mx a mobile missile and 
they removed all of the 100 million for the midgetman 
as the senate completed work on the bill sen mark hatfield 
rore decried the evermounting spending for the military 
this congress a bipartisan majority of this congress has 
approved 22 trillion of the 23 trillion requested for defense 
spending during this decade alone hatfield said 
we seem to have lost sight of the fact that every dollar we 
spend on bombs and bullets means that we are underfunding programs 
to meet the nations desperate human needs health care education 
war on drugs low income housing aids research 
our motto ought to be in bombs we trust hatfield said 
in other action wednesday the senate 
brushed aside a final attempt to change the administrations 
strategic blueprint sidetracking a proposal to restrict the 
pentagons ability to conduct antisatellite tests 
urged bush to continue development of the marine corps v22 
osprey the tiltrotor aircraft the administration sought to 
cancel the osprey takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a 
plane 
approved an amendment requiring graduates of the nations 
military academies to give six years of service after graduation 
rather than the eight required by the bill the reason the longer 
term might discourage academy applications 
told the cia and defense department to report by sept 1 on how 
best to locate and rescue american hostages in lebanon 
voting against the bill were sens kent conrad dnd tom 
harkin diowa howard metzenbaum dohio and hatfield sen 
donald riegle dmich did not vote

the defense ministry today quoted a shiite 
moslem clergyman as saying that us marine lt col william r 
higgins may have been alive last week contrary to reports he was 
killed months ago 
an israeli official said the clergyman sheik abdul karim obeid 
may be given lie detector tests to help establish when higgins died 
a proiranian shiite moslem group the organization of the 
oppressed on earth claimed it hanged higgins on monday in 
retaliation for israels refusal to free obeid who was kidnapped 
by israeli commandos july 28 
higgins was abducted feb 17 1988 in south lebanon 
despite obeids statements about higgins israel officially says 
it received word months ago that higgins had been killed 
an israeli official said that during the interrogation obeid 
gave the impression that he was afraid to be extradited to the 
united states 
obeid has been isolated since his capture and has no knowledge 
of reports higgins has been hanged to avenge his abduction 
some israeli officials claim obeid was a central figure in 
the iranianbacked hezbollah an umbrella for factions holding 
foreign hostages that also is believed to have provided support for 
attacks and car bombings but other sources in israel and lebanon 
minimize his importance describing him more as a religious leader 
or a cheerleader 
a statement released today by defense minister yitzhak rabins 
spokesman eitan haber said in his interrogation sheik obeid 
stated that while he personally has no information concerning col 
higgins condition he heard through hearsay that col higgins is 
alive 
it said obeid told israeli interrogators higgins arrived in 
beirut shortly after he was kidnapped last year and was in good 
condition i am in no position to know what happened to him or 
might have happened to him afterward it quoted obeid as saying 
the statement quoted defense ministry sources as saying they 
wanted to emphasize and reiterate that in accordance with the 
information presently available to them col higgins was put to 
death in beirut already at the end of 1988 but that the ministry 
has no definite confirmation of this 
avi pazner a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
israel believes higgins died as a result of mistreatment and 
torture and that there is strong evidence he died more than a 
year ago 
an israeli official asking not to be identified said obeid may 
undergo a polygraph test to determine exactly what he knows the 
official said israel believes obeid is not telling all he knows 
about the marines fate 
higgins 44 of lexington ky was part of a un observer 
force in lebanon when he was abducted his captors accused him of 
spying 
after the july 1988 shooting down of an iranian jetliner by a 
us warship in the persian gulf the kidnappers announced that 
higgins had been sentenced to death 
israel said it captured obeid in an effort to use the cleric to 
free three missing israel soldiers in lebanon it has offered to 
exchange him and other shiite captives for three captured israeli 
soldiers in lebanon and the foreign hostages in lebanon hezbollah 
rejected a swap

israeli officials claim a shiite moslem 
clergyman kidnapped by israeli commandos was a central figure 
in the iranianbacked hezbollah providing guns and money for 
attacks and involved in car bombings and kidnaps 
but other sources in israel and lebanon minimize the importance 
of sheik abdul karim obeid describing him more as a religious 
leader or a cheerleader 
if i were to name the 50 hezbollah leaders who make decisions 
in south lebanon he obeid would not be on the list said a 
security source in lebanon who spoke on condition of anonymity 
since obeids kidnapping friday israeli officials and the media 
blamed the 33yearold sheik for crimes dating to 1983 including 
the kidnapping of us marine lt col william r higgins whose 
death was announced monday 
obeid has been described by israeli officials as a big fish 
and a valuable property for the possible swap of israels 
shiite captives for israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held in 
lebanon 
the defense ministry today said obeid told interrogators that 
higgins may have been alive last week 
despite obeids statements about higgins however israel 
officially has said it received word months ago that higgins had 
been killed 
obeid has been isolated since his capture and was unaware of the 
reports higgins has been killed to avenge his abduction the 
defense ministry statement said 
no body has been found and there is no way of knowing when the 
videotape showing higgins dangling from a gallows had been made 
an israeli official also said that during the interrogation 
obeid gave the impression that he was afraid to be extradited 
to the united states 
the foreign ministry issued a statement tuesday blaming 
hezbollah for killing more than 250 americans in the 1983 bombings 
of a us marines barracks and us embassy buildings in lebanon 
more than 70 frenchmen and dozens of israelis and then said it 
is in this context that israel seized obeid 
in a speech before parliament on wednesday rabin said obeid was 
hezbollahs leader in southern lebanon and had been a central 
figure in everything linked to attacks on israel and incitement 
of these 
obeid was involved in terrorist activities distributing 
money transferring weapons participating in and hiding means of 
attacks and above all approving nearly every act hezbollah carried 
out in south lebanon rabin said 
he said obeid admitted under interrogation that the planners 
of the capture of two soldiers from israels selfdeclared security 
zone in southern lebanon left from obeids house to carry out their 
attack in february 1986 
in the higgins case the three abductors were in obeids house 
the night before seizing the victim near tyre lebanon in feburary 
1988 and one of them returned there later rabin said 
he also said the car used in higgins kidnapping in february 
1988 was later kept hidden in obeids garage 
israel has the basis to assume obeid was involved in a car 
bombing north of israels border that killed 12 israeli soldiers in 
march 1985 rabin said 
while no one is claiming obeid is merely a clergyman sources 
and some israeli journalists draw a different picture of him 
one source in lebanon said that abbas musawi not obeid was the 
leader of hezbollah in southern lebanon musawi was also listed as 
the radical groups southern lebanese head in the englishlanguage 
jerusalem post 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said obeid drew 
his reputation from raged harb his predecessor as shiite spiritual 
leader in the village of jibchit harb a fiery antiisraeli 
preacher was assassinated in 1984 
while noting that israel spoke of obeid approving terrorist 
acts the source added that in southern lebanon approving is 
nothing what matters is who plans it and does it 
an israeli source who also insisted on anonymity said the 
death threats against hostages that followed obeids kidnapping 
came only because of shiite anger at an insult to the moslem clergy 
he said what little importance obeid had was diminished when the 
shiite militia amal took control of southern lebanon from hezbollah 
in bloody fighting after higgins kidnap 
israeli journalist uzi mahaneimi writing in the daily yediot 
ahronot made the same point and quoted lebanese sources as saying 
israel will not receive anything for obeid 
mahaneimi wrote that obeid had been a military commander but was 
only a religious leader after the amal victory another source said 
obeids main source of power was control of a martyrs fund for 
families of slain militiamen 
the israeli source said obeids lack of power was evident in 
that israel was able to abduct him easily by blowing open his 
door and killing a bodyguard or neighbor awakened by the blast 
if the guy was that important he would have had some jeeps 
outside and some guys on the roof the source said

a bank robbery suspect says he started out 
trying to disguise himself as a woman but the more makeup he put 
on the more he looked like the joker in the film batman 
richard hensarling jr 25 of deltona was arrested in the 
robberies of four central florida banks 
in a telephone interview from the volusia county jail he 
described for an interview published thursday in the orlando 
sentinel how he came to look something like the movie crook 
once i looked at myself in the mirror after i had the white 
stuff on i said wow you look like the joker so i painted the 
lips up a little 
he stuffed his cheeks with toilet paper to enhance the joker 
effect 
hensarling slight at 5foot7 and 135 pounds said he started 
out trying to disguise himself as a woman he wore a bra stuffed 
with toilet paper during one holdup he said but now regrets that 
when youre in jail with a bunch of men and they read a story 
that youre dressed up like a woman well all i can say is its 
not too much fun he said i dont think i could last long in 
state prison 
hensarling who was once convicted of forgery was charged in 
orlando wednesday with three counts of bank robbery said assistant 
us attorney bruce hinshelwood he faces up to 60 years in prison 
if convicted 
hensarling said he wants people to know he never used a weapon 
in the robberies he simply gave tellers notes advising them not to 
panic and to hand over cash 
and the joker wasnt his only costume 
a teller at the lake helen branch of the florida national bank 
robbed july 6 told police the bandit looked like a madeup dance 
hall girl but with a fake mustache 
hensarling said he wore dark makeup for that holdup trying to 
look mexican 
hensarling said he was terrified he would be killed during the 
robberies but felt he had no choice because drug dealers were 
threatening his family because a relative owed them money 
police havent verified that story but they havent discounted 
it either 
a dye that marked cash from mondays robbery of a freedom 
savings branch in southwest orange county led police to hensarling

the soviet union has accepted a us demand that 
both countries inspect each others chemical weapons stockpiles 
before a global ban on the weapons is agreed to a soviet official 
said today 
moscows shift was conveyed in a paper presented to us 
secretary of state james a baker iii by soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze when they met last week in paris the 
official said 
the soviets agreed with the us position that joint inspections 
begin before the ban is initialed by the 40nation geneva 
conference on disarmament said the official a soviet delegate to 
the conference who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
moscow previously wanted to allow checks only after the ban was 
signed and the shift was aimed at clearing the way for earliest 
possible inspections he said it is just a matter of time 
initialing comes before signing the official said who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the accord must be initialed by negotiators before its formal 
signing by each countrys head of state 
the disarmament conference has been debating a comprehensive 
chemical weapons ban for more than two decades but delegates have 
little hope of getting the draft accord ready for initialing in the 
immediate future 
disagreements at the conference include how to monitor 
compliance with a future ban 
the soviet shift in paris was part of separate superpower talks 
since 1986 on chemical weapons the united states and soviet union 
who have the worlds biggest poison gas arsenals say their talks 
may help the 40nation negotiations 
both superpowers reported they agreed to onthespot inspection 
procedures in the latest round of bilateral talks which ended in 
geneva in late june but they said an accord on exchanging chemical 
weapons data which would precede the inspections was not ready 
yet the talks are due to continue in the fall 
the soviet official said he could not give firm predictions 
about when data exchanges or inspections may begin 
moscow expects onsite inspections to back its official position 
that it has no more than 50000 tons of chemical armaments some 
western analysts have said the soviet stockpile is more than six 
times bigger

a stark new portrait of queen mother elizabeth 
that was unveiled today may cause controversy officials at the 
national gallery say 
the painting by 23yearold alison watt of glasgow shows 
britains most famous greatgrandmother without her customary hat 
wearing a simple dress and staring almost grimly out of the canvas 
i think it will shock people for about 10 to 15 seconds then 
they will get used to it and in six months time it will be one of 
the most popular portraits of her said robin gibson the 
gallerys curator of 20th century portraits it is taking the lid 
off the chocolate box 
the queen mother who marks her 89th birthday friday is the 
widow of king george vi and the mother of queen elizabeth ii 
ms watt admitted that the portrait didnt look particularly 
royal but that was her intention she always appears fluffy 
light wearing flowing clothes and i wanted to make her more solid 
she has a lot of character ms watt said i didnt want her to 
come across as a wee waif 
the queen mother ms watt asserted was happy with the 
portrait but that could not be confirmed 
i do not know what the queen mother thinks of it said a 
spokesman at her residence clarence house who spoke on condition 
of anonymity presumably she has seen it because she sat for it 
but we do not issue statements on silly little things like this

a hand grenade thrown at a passing israeli 
patrol today injured three israeli soldiers and three palestinian 
civilians in the occupied gaza strip the army and arab reports 
said 
troops opened fire after the blast wounding more than a dozen 
palestinians on the main street in khan yunis town hospital 
officials said 
in another development the supreme court ruled today that the 
armys firing orders for plastic bullets are legal 
use of the bullets introduced in august as a lesslethal 
alternative to lead bullets was challenged by israeli attorney 
felicia langer 
in the grenade attack the army said the soldiers were 
hospitalized with slight injuries 
a curfew ordering people off the streets was imposed on the town 
of more than 30000 people the army said 
doctors at nasser hospital in khan yunis said 16 palestinians 
were admitted with wounds but they were unsure if the grenade 
victims were among them 
those injured included a 2yearold boy a 75yearold man and 
60yearold woman the doctors said 
also today john kelly visiting assistant secretary of state 
for middle east affairs met with prime minister yitzhak shamir 
i am not going to be able to get into details of what we 
discussed but i did want to say it was a very useful discussion 
kelly told reporters after the hourlong meeting 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman said kelly met privately with 
shamir for 10 minutes and then was joined by aides to discuss 
israels peace initiative 
shamir has called for elections in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip to help end the palestinian revolt by selecting 
palestinians to open talks with israel on an interim autonomy 
agreement the plan also calls for arab countries to make peace 
with israel 
mr shamir said that for him it was particularly important 
that the united states should take up with the arabs the question 
of a change in their relationship with israel either make peace or 
sign nonbelligerency treaties pazner said 
he also said shamir complained about the us dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization saying it is interfering with 
israels efforts to get talks going with palestinians from the 
occupied lands 
the supreme court judges said they cannot rule on the legality 
of a particular weapon or ammunition only on its use 
there is no evidence of illegal orders being given the 
court concluded in response to a suit urging it to block use of the 
plastic ammunition or put strict limits on when it can be fired 
it is lethal and the regulations should be the same as for 
lead bullets ms langer had argued 
army rules call for lead ammunition to be used only when a 
soldiers life is in danger plastic ammunition can be fired to 
break up demonstrations the army says it is not lethal if fired 
from 230 feet or more 
human rights group say at least 100 of 527 palestinians shot to 
death in the 19monthold uprising died from plastic bullets 
thirtyeight israeli civilians also have died in the violence

in april 1975 until the vietnamese invasion an estimated 1 million 
people were killed or died of starvation under the brutal regime 
after hun sen and sihanouk met wednesday night the prince

described hun sens government and the khmer rouge as the key 
rivals in cambodia and himself as a sandwich between the hammer

the national transportation safety board voted 
today to oppose the public broadcast of airline cockpit voice 
recordings after crashes and indicated it would support legislation 
to keep the tapes secret 
the board said it was in the interest of safety to keep the 
tapes confidential and not made available for what one member 
called the lurid entertainment of the public 
the fivemember board voted unanimously to support the position 
of the federal aviation administration and the air line pilots 
association in deploring the courtordered release of a recording 
from a delta air lines plane that crashed in dallas a year ago 
the tape whose release was sought by radio and television 
stations captured the voices of crew members joking about politics 
and airliner accidents and also screaming just before the crash 
both faa and alpa said they would seek legislation keeping the 
automatically recorded tapes secret except for transcripts of 
material relevant to safety investigations the safety board 
indicated it concurred 
the ntsb which is still investigating the dallas crash that 
killed 14 of the more than 100 people aboard the flight said in a 
resolution we believe that transportation safety is better 
served by maintaining strict confidentiality of the actual audio 
recording 
board member john lauber said the recording are designed to be 
used only in safety investigations and certainly not for the 
lurid entertainment of the public 
ntsb member jim burnett said cockpit tapes are painful things 
to listen to and why anyone would entertain the idea of making 
either entertainment or drama out of them i dont know 
the ntsb rejected a proposal to strongly condemn the disabling 
of voice recorders by air crews lauber said members opposed such 
action which is illegal but wanted to focus on the importance of 
the recorders in safety investigations 
the pilots union withdrew wednesday a threat to order its 41000 
members to disable the recorders union president henry a duffy 
said he was confident that congress would correct the problem 
no other workers in america are subjected to routine constant 
tape recording of the performance of their duties so the mere 
existence of the cockpit voice recorder is an invasion of 
privacy duffy said 
he said pilots have agreed to have the recorders installed on 
the condition that they be used only for the purposes of safety 
investigations and that they never be released for public broadcast 
no pilot wants to hear broadcast to the public the agonized 
screams of his colleagues the moment before they die in a fiery 
crash duffy told a news conference the crew of the delta flight 
all survived 
duffy said the delta tapes release was insensitive and a 
violation of pilots agreements with federal investigators he said 
the publics right to know was not at issue since federal 
investigators release all relevant information from crash tapes 
the tape of delta flight 1141s last 30 minutes includes 
conversation and joking on the taxiway about news coverage of other 
crashes jesse jacksons politics and marilyn quayles looks 
the crew also joked that a plane wreck would one day expose 
their gleeful cockpit conversation to the public the conversation 
involved the cabin crew and a flight attendant 
the tape ends with a scream and the sound of the plane breaking 
apart 
duffy said scores of pilots called or sent messages to urge 
action he said many indicated they were ready and willing to 
disconnect the recorders although he acknowledged such an act 
probably would have been illegal 
faa spokesman fred farrar said pilots who disable the looptape 
devices could be subject to a 1000 fine and suspension of their 
pilots certification farrar said he could recall no incident 
where a pilot had taken such action 
farrar said that immediately after word that texas district 
judge adolph canales had ordered the delta tapes released the 
agency began considering ways to prevent such action in the future 
we are very disappointed we agree with the pilots right down 
the line this is an unwarranted invasion of privacy farrar 
said he said it was the first time in his memory that an actual 
cockpit audio recording had been aired publicly 
previous recordings of sounds and voice aboard airliners prior 
to crashes came from communications between pilots and air traffic 
control centers those tapes are regularly released after 
accidents but the cockpit voice recorders pickup all conversation 
in the cockpit including casual comments 
duffy also scored news media that aired the recordings saying 
the press sometimes lets sensationalism win out over responsible 
reporting 
delta last week accepted blame for the dallas crash saying the 
crew neglected to properly position wing flaps for takeoff the 
pilot copilot and flight engineer were all fired the airline said 
the pilots union protested the actions saying the airline 
should have waited for results of the safety board investigation

a man sitting on a grand jury hearing testimony 
from undercover narcotics officers was arrested after an officer 
identified him as a dealer who once sold him heroin 
anthony eisenberg 23 was listening to an undercover narcotics 
officer testifying before the grand jury he was serving on july 18 
the officer looked at mr eisenberg and mr eisenberg looked 
at him and there was a nod of recognition g christopher marzuk 
a prosecutor with the office of the special narcotics prosecutor 
told the new york times wednesday 
the next day after reviewing his notes about the may 26 sale of 
two glassine envelopes of heroin the officer returned to the jury 
room where the suspect was quietly removed and arrested 
a lot of people said that it was the stupidest thing in the 
world for him to go down there and sit on the narcotics grand 
jury marzuk said on the other hand it could also have been 
the smartest thing in the world because if mr eisenberg had gone 
for the full month of the grand jurys term sat through 100 or 
150 cases he could have learned who all of our undercover 
officers are and which ones were working in his area 
eisenberg saw seven undercover agents during his 1 days as a 
grand juror 
he was indicted on charges of felony sale of narcotics

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee says the senateapproved 885 million droughtrelief 
package is fair to all farmers who suffer crop and livestock losses 
the most important thing about this bill is that all farmers 
are being treated fairly panel chairman patrick leahy dvt 
said after the measure passed wednesday 
those who suffer a significant loss will receive the same 
payment rate 65 percent of the applicable target price or loan 
rate he said we will not discriminate against any farmer who 
needs help this legislation treats all farmers fairly whether 
they grow wheat corn hay or soybeans 
but the measure passed by voice vote toward the end of a long 
senate business day was considerably more modest than a 
housepassed version that many lawmakers criticized as too 
expensive 
members of the house and senate agriculture committees planned 
to begin negotiations on a compromise version today with the aim 
of completing that work before congress leaves friday on a 
monthlong recess leahys office said 
the senate bill makes farmers eligible for federal aid if they 
have crop losses this year because of drought flooding freezing 
hail high winds or similar severe weather it also provides for 
payments to livestock producers facing droughtrelated feed and 
water shortages for their herds 
but its price tag is about 463 million less than the 
agriculture department has estimated the cost of a rival 
housepassed package 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said winter wheat 
producers and other crop growers will be eligible for highpriority 
attention under provisions of the legislation 
this is not the best bill nor is it the kind of relief winter 
wheat producers and other program crops deserve he said but 
it is far better than the budgetbusting house bill which promised 
federal relief to every crop in america 
the senate also passed by voice vote late wednesday rural 
development legislation designed to promote business investment and 
expansion in small towns in rural america it also is aimed at 
improving schools and health care for residents 
proponents argued that federal assistance was needed because the 
61 million people living in rural areas face higher unemployment 
more hospital closings and higher poverty levels than their urban 
counterparts the rural economy also is more volatile because of 
its dependence on natural resources supporters said 
the centerpiece of the package called the rural partnership 
act is a revolving loan fund program to provide 300 million in 
seed money over five years for new and expanding businesses 
the senates disasterrelief bill provides for different 
eligibility standards for various crops but in all cases producers 
would receive payments designed to cover 65 percent of their lost 
income from crop losses 
in most instances the projected income levels will be based on 
federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have 
received had they not suffered losses 
the house bill required a minimum loss of 35 percent for any 
crop to receive assistance with payments covering 65 percent of 
lost income but unlike the senate bill the house measure called 
for 90 percent payments on crop losses of more than 75 percent 
the senate dropped the higher payment level as a way of cutting 
the overall cost of the assistance package 
farmstate senators objected to a provision in the house bill 
that would prevent spending on drought assistance to exceed the 
amount of agricultural subsidy savings and would have prorated 
relief payments to farmers if necessary 
in general spending on subsidy programs is expected to be lower 
this year because crop prices are higher as a result of smaller 
harvests linked to weather problems

the internal revenue service has billed exxon 
corp and texaco inc for more than 2 billion in back taxes and 
interest but the huge oil companies said they will challenge the 
claims in court 
texaco said wednesday the irs claims the oil company owns 179 
billion in taxes from 1979 to 1981 when it sold oil to its 
affiliates at belowmarket value 
exxon corp said the irs has billed it 269 million for 1979 in 
connection with oil the government of saudi arabia sold to exxon 
and texaco in a bid to stabilize the world crude market interest 
on the exxon payments could double the amount of money the irs 
seeks 
theyre trying to get us to pay for something we never earned 
and which the american public benefited from said exxon 
spokesman bill smith we sold oil at lower prices the american 
public got the benefit of those lower prices 
exxon said it had filed a petition in the us tax court in 
washington over the irs bill texaco based in white plains said 
it also would fight the irs claim 
the irs had notified texaco about possible claims stemming from 
the earlier oil transaction with the saudis during an audit last 
year in connection with texacos chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
the irs claims are over the handling of crude oil purchased from 
saudi arabia during 19791981 when the official price set by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries was 34 a barrel 
saudi arabia opecs largest exporter was selling its crude for 
28 a barrel to texaco exxon mobil corp and chevron corp its 
four partners in the arabian american oil co with the provision 
that if any of the companies resold the oil they could not resell 
it at a profit 
texaco said the irs apparently believed that when it resold the 
crude to its foreign affiliates it should have charged the 34 
rate despite the restrictions by saudia arabia and paid taxes on 
the difference 
because it did not texaco said it is being held liable for 
taxes on the profits that its foreign affiliates made by being able 
to sell refined products made from the cheaper saudi oil 
irs officials have declined to comment on the matter saying 
federal law prohibits the agency from commenting on the affairs of 
any taxpayer 
texaco maintains that the irss position is wrong and that it 
cannot tax the company for revenues it never received when it 
resold the arabian crude and which under mandate of the saudi 
arabian government it could not receive texaco said in a 
statement

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani was 
sworn in today as president and pledged to continue the 10yearold 
islamic revolution irans official islamic republic news agency 
reported 
despite the propaganda coming from the arrogant world powers 
our people will not accept anything but the continuation of this 
path which is the path of islam and the koran he said in a 
speech carried by the news agency 
rafsanjanis speech came after the swearingin ceremony attended 
by top religious and government leaders the onehour ceremony was 
held at a mosque attached to the home of the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini in the north tehran suburb of jamaran said irna 
which was monitored in nicosia 
rafsanjani apparently made no public reference to the first 
crisis facing his presidency a death threat against american 
hostage joseph cicippio held in lebanon by proiranian shiite 
moslem extremists 
rafsanjani 54 the islamic republics fifth president is 
considered a pragmatist who would like to ease tight governmental 
control of the economy and resume ties with the west 
he succeeds ayatollah ali khamenei who became the countrys 
spiritual leader after the june 3 death of khomeini irans 
patriarch of the 1979 revolution that deposed shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi 
in a statement read by khomeinis son ahmad the outgoing 
president urged rafsanjani to use the presidencys increased powers 
to solve the nations problems and ease hardships faced by the 
poor irna said 
ahmads reading of khameneis statement appeared to amount to a 
declaration of support for rafsanjani the younger khomeini has 
been considered a leader of the hardliners who are locked in a 
power struggle with the new presidents pragmatist faction 
rafsanjani won a landslide victory in fridays presidential 
elections capturing 945 percent of the vote constitutional 
reforms approved in a referendum during the election give him 
considerably enlarged powers by scrapping prime minister hussein 
musavis post 
earlier this week khamenei told musavi in a letter to continue 
his duties as prime minister until a new cabinet is set up by 
rafsanjani 
the presidential elections originally scheduled for aug 18 
were advanced by about three weeks to hasten the transfer of power 
after khomeinis death 
khameneis decision to step down as president before the end of 
his term appeared aimed at allowing rafsanjani to move quickly to 
start reforming irans sluggish economy

conference since a breakawy by a washington priest are preparing to 
shape their own agenda and prod church officials to address their

launched a splinter congregation is of major concern to those here 
for the fourday conference which starts today 
stallings was suspended for founding the imani temple which 
holds ceremonies that mix catholic prayers and liturgy with african 
and black american religious tradition 
stallings contends the church has failed to deal with racism he 
also says his brand of catholicism better addresses the cultural 
and spiritual needs of black parishioners 
now is the time for the laity to come forth and take a 
stand said the rev james goode a san francisco priest in 
atlanta for the conference you have to stand up and speak the 
truth and face the consequences 
goode praised stallings movement as a beautiful time of 
coming together of africanamerican catholics across the country 
the church has to be challenged no question about it we 
cannot continue as we are goode said things that people were 
talking about in the back room now are being talked about in the 
open 
people still see the catholic church as run white males he 
said that whole thing escalated with the father stallings 
issue 
walter hubbard executive director of the national office for 
black catholics said the laity conference wants to address what 
has been raised to a level of consciousness by reverend stallings 
theres a rich history in the church of african men and women 
being part of the genesis of the church its not told too 
frequently he said 
the church has to come to understand more and more that we 
have a need to exercise and focus on our own culture hubbard 
said weve got to shape our own agenda thats our goal 
what you have seen and what you have heard on this issue is an 
expression from the clergy seminarians and the deacons hubbard 
said you really have not heard from the lay people 
hubbard said stallings had not confirmed whether he would attend 
the meeting stallings did not return telephone calls thursday to 
imani temple 
about 400 people are expected to attend the conference 
sponsored by hubbards group and the national black lay catholic 
caucus workshops have topics ranging from catholicism and 
blackness is there a future to when the saints go marching in

a key figure in an alleged gunsfordrugs network 
aimed at financing the contras has arrived in miami after fleeing a 
costa rican indictment and a us senate committee wants to talk 
to him 
john hull 69 a usborn costa rican rancher was identified 
by federal prosecutors and the congressional irancontra committee 
as a point man in former national security council aide oliver 
norths efforts to funnel aid to nicaraguan rebels 
a costa rican investigation resulted in his indictment there 
earlier this year for violating that nations neutrality and drug 
trafficking laws although an investigating judge dismissed the 
drug counts wendesday 
hull surfaced in miami wednesdsay after jumping 37500 bail in 
costa rica saying he was seeking medical treatment for a heart 
ailment 
he acknowledged working with the cia accepting bodyguards from 
the agency and taking 10000 a month from a contra leader but 
strongly denied the landing strips on his costa rican farm were 
used by drug traffickers 
there have never been drugs on any of my air strips hull 
told the associated press on wednesday at this point i can 
honestly say i have never even seen cocaine 
five witnesses last year told a senate investigatory 
subcommittee headed by us sen john kerry dmass that drugs 
were flown through hulls farm back to the united states on the 
same planes that brought in weapons for the contras hull was 
subpoenaed by the committee to testify but never showed up 
jonathan winer counsel to kerry said on learning hull had 
returned to the united states that the subcommittee wanted to talk 
to him as soon as possible 
hull is under subpoena and has been for a year and we will 
seek to serve him winer said weve sought to serve him 
before but he has been in costa rica and from our point of view 
evading the subpoena 
hull blames the drug charges on a plot by his enemies to 
discredit him and us policy in central america 
its basically a misinformation campaign carried on by the 
communists and drug traffickers as a smokescreen he said and 
the fact is that the communists have to get people like me out of 
the way to subvert the country 
hull acknowledges receiving about 10000 a month from contra 
leader adolfo calero to feed and supply the rebels on nicaraguas 
southern border but he denies knowing the money was provided on 
orders from north 
hull from evanston ind denied working for north or the 
national security council he admitted meeting with norths aide 
rob owen in costa rica but said owen was simply an old friend

hurricane dean packing 85 mph 
winds veered away from puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
today on a wobbly course in the atlantic ocean forecasters said 
the national weather service lifted hurricane warnings for all 
the islands of the eastern caribbean including puerto rico and the 
us virgin islands 
forecasters said dean was moving farther out to sea and that the 
worst effects would probably miss the islands 
the government of the bahamas had a hurricane watch in effect 
for the turks and caicos islands southeast of the bahamas 
a flashflood watch remained in effect for the virgin islands 
but it was lifted for puerto rico where the national guard earlier 
had been preparing to evacuate 2000 people from floodprone areas 
at noon edt the hurricanes center was at latitude 195 north 
and longitude 633 west or 200 miles eastnortheast of san juan 
the weather service in san juan said if dean remained on its 
current course it would pass 125 miles north of the virgin islands 
and 150 miles north of puerto rico 
the biggest problem in the islands is usually flash floods and 
mudslides so there is some potential for that but its not going 
to be as if the core of the storm was coming across there said 
bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla 
he said the strom was curving northward away from land so 
there was no immediate threat to the united states 
dean the second hurricane of the atlantic season strengthened 
overnight as it moved irregularly in a westnorthwest course 
through the leeward island chain missing the nearest island 
barbuda 
by late wednesday it began veering northwest giving many 
residents and vacationers hope the hurricane would harmlessly go 
out to sea but just as quickly the hurricane darted back west and 
toward land 
this is dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly even 
though it is a minimal hurricane said an advisory from the 
national weather service in san juan 
police were on alert and at least 60 american and canadian 
vacationers were evacuated late wednesay to hotels from a marina 
resort on the east coast of tortola in the british virgin islands 
the national hurricane center near miami posted hurricane

former president habib bourguiba marked 
his 86th birthday thursday in the hospital where he underwent a 
prostate operation last month 
there was no celebration of his birthday in tunisia where it 
was once a national holiday and most tunisian newspapers took no 
notice of the event 
by coincidence the day was a public holiday in tunisia because 
it was the islamic new year 
the weekly magazine realites reported thursday without citing 
sources that bourguiba might need a second operation to clear his 
urinary tract 
the government authorized 27 members of bourguibas family to 
visit him in the hospital on the occasion of his birthday 
including his son former foreign minister habib bourguiba jr the 
magazine said 
when bourguiba tried to include four former members of his 
government in the list of his birthday guests these persons were 
not authorized to visit him it said 
bourguiba was ousted in a bloodless coup in 1987 by his prime 
minister zine elabidine ben ali who said the president was 
senile and unable to carry on his duties

images from the voyager 2 spacecraft 
revealed three previously unknown moons circling neptune 
scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory announced today 
the discoveries in addition to a moon spotted by voyager 2 last 
month bring to six the number of satellites known to be orbiting 
the blue planet laboratory officials said 
voyager was more than 22 million miles from neptune when the 
moons were confirmed by scientists wednesday indicating there may 
be many more discoveries as the space probe draws even closer in 
coming weeks 
the newly discovered moons were temporarily named 1989 n2 1989 
n3 and 1989 n4 the objects were tracked as candidate moons for 
five days and then confirmed when they followed predicted orbits 
the moons appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in 
diameter and are in circular equatorial orbits moving in the 
direction of the planets rotation neptunes big moon triton 
moves in the opposite direction 
the moon 1989 n3 is closest to the planet orbiting 17000 miles 
above neptunes cloud tops and completing one orbit every 8 hour 
and 10 minutes 
orbiting 23000 miles above the clouds 1989 n4 circles neptune 
in 10 hours and 20 minutes 
the farthest out of the three 1989 n2 is 30000 miles above the 
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes 
voyager 2 is on a course that will take it within 3000 miles of 
neptune on aug 24 the spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has

chinas tiny but prosperous private business 
community is the latest target of the governments crackdown on 
socalled bourgeois evils 
the bar owners and street vendors who once were the envy of 
their neighbors now worry they may be shut down in the leftist 
atmosphere that has followed the june army attack on student 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
things are no good now im trying to unload my business 
said a clothing vendor in one of the citys largest private 
markets but no one wants to buy 
in the past decade 145 million individually owned businesses 
have sprung up across china most of them vendors or offering 
services such as bicycle repairs and hair cuts they opened on the 
promise of senior leader deng xiaoping that after years of 
enforced egalitarianism it was permissible for some people to get 
rich before others 
soon teachers and office workers began discovering that barely 
literate snack vendors pulled in more money than they many young 
businessmen bought motorcycles a few could even afford cars 
what the chinese call the redeyed disease envy became 
epidemic 
hoping perhaps to bridge the deep gulf between the leadership 
and an alienated urban population communist party general 
secretary jiang zemin has seized upon this envy and made unfair 
distribution of income a key theme of his first month in office 
selfemployed traders and peddlars cheat embezzle bribe and 
evade taxation he wrote in the newspaper china labor on some 
small commodity markets over 80 percent of the selfemployed have 
an annual income exceeding 10000 yuan 2700 five times higher 
than that of the average government employee 
these upstarts indulge in a life of luxury he wrote 
this greatly hurts the confidence of workers who live on 
salaries it has affected social stability and corrupted social 
values 
jiang has repeated the message in other essays and speeches and 
newspaper commentators have chimed in all condemn alleged 
illegalities by private businessmen but the greatest offense seems 
simply to be making money 
how much do individual businessmen make asked the party 
newspaper the peoples daily no one really knows but them but 
the wives of some private bosses wear outfits that cost more than 
1000 yuan 270 and not one but several gold rings on their 
fingers 
such articles worry businessmen like duan who along with his 
brother opened the rose bar two months ago on a busy beijing street 
for two years weve been going south and looking at bars 
said duan who gave only his surname but we didnt dare open one 
in beijing earlier 
in recent months however even staid beijing began blossoming 
with private bars dance halls and pool halls 
so duan and his brother who had saved money as a private 
clothing seller pooled about 5350 to rent and renovate a 
storefront 
then the army declared martial law may 20 to quell the student 
protests and armed police began dropping by to inspect customers 
identification papers it was very bad for business duan said 
but he fears the newspaper criticisms bode even worse 
im worried the government might shut us down then well lose 
everything he said drinking a beer in his tiny smoky bar 
i dont like politics he said i dont understand 
politics 
bars are especially vulnerable because they represent a loose 
bourgeois lifestyle the aging revolutionaries now in the 
forefront are determined to wipe out 
two bars near the rose bar were shut down in the past month for 
running prostitution rings at the rose bar four bar girls 
keep company with the male customers flirting in exchange for 
drinks whether they do anything else was not clear 
already authorities have moved to increase controls on private 
businessmen the central government has announced special 
inspections of their books and the quality of their products 
several provincial governments have said businessmen will have to 
submit their salaries for approval to ensure they dont earn too 
much 
but duans drinking friend yang said hes confident the 
private sector wont be shut down altogether he reminded marx 
said socialism means to each according to his labor

the soviet unions european breadbasket is growing 
a bumper grain crop but shortages of spare parts and fuel are 
hurting chances that farmers will be able to bring all the crop in 
yegor k ligachev the communist party politburo member in 
charge of agriculture said on soviet tv wednesday night that such 
key farming regions as the ukraine byelorussia moldavia and the 
krasnodar stavropol and rostov regions of southern russia are 
looking forward to a bumper harvest 
the struggle to put more food on empty store shelves is not only 
an economic problem but a big political headache for president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
he has been tinkering with the inefficient staterun farm 
system almost constantly since taking power four years ago and a 
good growing season could give him the kind of sorely needed 
victory that has eluded his reform efforts 
newspapers follow the grain harvest which is just getting into 
full swing nearly every day with frontpage stories and the 
government newspaper izvestia on july 19 cited reports of high 
and in some places record harvests 
ligachev said the good news from the fields means we have all 
possibilities to harvest enough crop as a whole despite a 
serious drought in graingrowing regions of siberia and kazakhstan 
and the chronic struggle with spare parts and fuel for combines 
and storage 
the us department of agriculture which closely follows the 
soviet grain crops estimates the harvest will be about 210 million 
tons on a par with 1986 and 1987 and better than last years 
harvest of 195 million tons last years crop was damaged by a dry 
growing season but damp weather that slowed harvesting 
in story after story however izvestia has warned that a good 
crop doesnt guarantee a good harvest the newspaper ended a biting 
july 31 piece on the shortage of parts for combines in the ukraine 
and russia with the depressing observation the harvest is so 
inefficient that the more you grow the more you lose 
another story said fuel for the combines was in short supply 
throughout the ukraine 
ligachev said the soviet union loses 30 percent of its harvest 
because of poor processing and he cited conclusions by dutch 
specialists that soviet food processing is decades behind the west 
a western diplomat who specializes in soviet agricultural said 
the improved crop appeared to a result of good weather rather than 
anything gorbachev has done 
mild weather minimized winter kill of grain planted in fall and 
timely rain has kept both spring and winter grains growing well he 
said 
gorbachev has abolished a moscow superagency that oversaw 
agricultural policy and a meeting of the party central committee in 
march set the groundwork for allowing farmers to lease land to 
partially break away from the inefficiency of the staterun system 
moscow has also promised payments in hard currency to farms that 
delivery grain to the state over their assigned quotas 
but the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
specialists havent seen any indication that people are leasing 
land in great numbers 
he also said that inefficiencies in the harvest the weather in 
the next six weeks and the drought east of the ural mountains 
could seriously damage the final harvest 
estimates of last years harvest plummeted last fall because 
damp weather prevented farmers from getting into the fields he 
said

jewish emigration from the soviet union continued 
at more than twice last years rate in july with nearly 4000 
arrivals at a vienna transit center a resettlement agency said 
thursday 
soviet authorities allowed 3971 jews to leave last month six 
more than in june which raised the years total to 24133 
according to a spokeswoman for the genevabased intergovernmental 
committee for migration 
only 104 of the latest arrivals chose to move on directly to 
israel said spokeswoman regina boucault with 717 emigres 
resettled in the jewish state this year most are going to the 
united states 
in june 3965 jews left the soviet union making the total for 
the six months of 1989 already higher than last years flow of 
20082 
about 300000 soviet jews have emigrated since the resettlement 
program began in 1971 the largest official exodus 51328 was 
recorded in 1979 before the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
chilled eastwest relations

the bush administrations clean air bill 
attacked by environmental activists as a sellout to industry was 
introduced in the senate today with only three democrats joining 21 
republican sponsors 
despite a strong effort by the administration to line up 
sponsors from both parties only democratic sens donald w riegle 
jr of michigan j james exon of nebraska and john breaux of 
louisiana signed on as cosponsors 
the bill was introduced in the house with 57 democratic and 90 
republican cosponsors 
sen john h chafee rri and the bills chief senate sponsor 
referred to the lack of democratic support indirectly commenting 
the introduction of the presidents bill is not the end of the 
process but a major advance in the march 
chafee the ranking gop member of the senate environment 
committee added after eight years of silence from the white 
house on this issue we now have a chief executive who recognizes 
the need for a major overhaul of the clean air act 
the administration moved on wednesday to blunt criticism of the 
legislation by meeting with environmental groups that have 
criticized the bill 
at this point its an information discussion and not a 
negotiating session said assistant epa administrator william 
rosenberg assistant environmental protection agency commissioner 
who met with top white house officials and seven environmental 
groups 
the administrations bill stands as it is rosenberg said 
also telling reporters that president bush had briefly dropped by 
the meeting 
richard ayres head of the national clean air coalition 
characterized the administration officials at the meeting as very 
upset by the criticism the bill has got from the environmental 
community and members of congress 
we responded with equal vehemence that we dont think youve 
been unfairly attacked we believe what were saying is based on 
the facts 
participants said the administration promised future meetings 
the environmentalists who have characterized the legislation as 
a gift to industry said they told the administration the bill 
would not protect public health and in some cases weakens current 
law 
the invitations to wednesdays meeting immediately became 
controversial because the white house initially failed to invite 
ayres whose organization is the main environmental lobbying group 
on clean air he was summoned to the white house just 15 minutes 
before the meeting began 
an epa source said epa administrator william reilly and 
rosenberg assistant administrator for air programs were shocked 
that ayres was not invited and demanded the white house change 
its mind the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
the meeting concentrated on the portion of the bill seeking to 
curb acid rain a form of pollution caused by emissions of sulfur 
dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from power plants autos and other 
sources these pollutants can be carried thousands of miles through 
the atmosphere and eventually return to earth as sulfuric or 
nitric acids ruining lakes streams and forests 
environmentalists have considered the acid rain section the 
strongest part of the legislation because it would reduce sulfur 
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of 2000 and cap 
the lower emissions figure to prevent growth of the pollutant in 
the 21st century 
but even this section has aroused criticism with 
environmentalists contending the real sulfur dioxide decrease would 
be 9 million tons while nitrogen dioxide would actually grow by 1 
million tons by the end of 2000 
the major unhappiness however has been with the sections on 
urban smog and releases of toxic chemicals into the air and 
rosenberg promised to hold further discussions on both topics 
participants said

the house today passed legislation 
liberalizing abortion restrictions in the district of columbia and 
president bush immediately threatened a veto 
in a letter to congress bush urged lawmakers to protect the 
lives of americas unborn children 
the confrontation came over the first vote in either house of 
congress since the supreme court ruling last month permitting 
states to impose further restrictions on abortion 
on a 238189 vote the chamber approved a bill providing 532 
million in federal funds for the districts government that 
contained the abortion provision the bill now moves to the senate 
prochoice advocates hailed the house vote as a turnaround and 
predicted it will help reverse the tide nationwide against moves to 
restrict abortion 
the white house today released a letter bush sent congress on 
wednesday threatening the veto 
if the bill presented to me permits the use of appropriated 
funds to pay for abortions other than those where the life of the 
mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term i 
will veto it bush wrote rep julian c dixon dcalif chairman 
of the appropriations subcommittee on the district of columbia 
in a dramatic roll call that stunned lawmakers on both sides 
the house voted 219206 wednesday against an amendment banning 
public financing of all abortions in the district of columbia as 
the final tally became apparent prochoice lawmakers on the 
chambers floor embraced each other and roared with emotion 
it was the first congressional showdown on the issue since the 
supreme court decision last month enhancing state authority to 
limit abortion and a reversal of a 222186 house vote on the same 
question last summer 
abortion rights advocates said it was the first time since 1980 
that the house had rejected an effort to restrict public financing 
for abortions 
the amendment would have banned the use of federal or district 
funds to perform any abortions during the 1990 federal fiscal year 
which begins oct 1 
instead the bill now would liberalize current law by allowing 
the district to spend its own money for abortions and permitting 
the use of federal funds in cases of rape incest or to save the 
mothers life current law forbids the use of federal or district 
funds in washington unless the mothers life is at stake 
but the effect of the measures rejection carried well beyond 
the capitals borders thanks to the high courts july 3 ruling in 
the webster vs reproductive health services case abortion rights 
advocates said they said that with surveys showing most americans 
still support the right to choose abortion thursdays battle 
showed lawmakers know their constituents are watching them 
there is more emphasis on voting records in this issue now 
chairman julian dixon dcalif of the appropriations district of 
columbia subcommittee said after the vote the politics of it has 
been turned up somewhat 
people since webster understand this game is for real now 
said another lawmaker who backs the right to abortion rep barbara 
boxer dcalif 
supporters of the defeated provision credited the high courts 
ruling with making the abortion issue a more delicate one but they 
also blamed their loss on freshmen lawmakers more sympathetic to 
abortion than the legislators they replaced and to misleading 
lobbying by their opponents 
the amendment sponsored by rep robert dornan rcalif 
contained no exceptions to the ban on public money for abortions 
during the debate he and his supporters repeatedly said they 
intended to add an exception for pregnancies that threatened the 
mothers life but didnt because it would have left the provision 
vulnerable to being stricken from the bill for procedural reasons 
opponents of the amendment however stressed the provision 
contained no such language and that voters would look unkindly at a 
vote for such a harsh measure some of them stood at the entrance 
to the house chamber telling members as they arrived to vote that 
the exception for endangered mothers was lacking 
dornan noted that in a letter president bush sent to lawmakers 
earlier in the day the president promised to veto the bill if it 
permitted the use of federal money for abortion except for cases 
involving the mothers survival 
im disappointed that a prolife message did not go out but 
we are going to win in the end anyway he told reporters 
in the webster decision the supreme court ruled 54 that states 
may forbid public employees and facilities from participating in 
abortions even if patients are willing to pay their own expenses

attorney general dick thornburgh said today he 
wouldnt prosecute reporters who obtain news leaks about criminal 
investigations but would charge federal officials who are their 
sources 
thornburgh said a new policy of prosecuting officials who leak 
details of criminal investigations for theft of government property 
does not include charging reporters with aiding and abetting or 
receiving such information 
the statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in 
misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official 
capacity he said 
previous policy was not to use that authority we have changed 
that because of reasons ive stated more often then you want to 
hear the attorney general said at a news conference 
accurate leaks have a tendency to compromise ongoing 
investigations he said if they are inaccurate they have a 
tendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who are 
the subject of the leak 
the revision of the departments 11yearold policy intended to 
protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution was 
announced wednesday in testimony submitted to congress 
news reporters might be questioned about their sources in a 
grand jury under the policy if the attorney general approves the 
subpoena attorneys general historically have been reluctant to 
subpoena reporters often the only source of information about 
news leaks 
but civil libertarians said it could pose dangers for reporters 
first amendment protections to protect confidential sources 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press said today while i certainly am pleased to 
hear mr thornburgh say he does not intend to prosecute journalists 
who are the recipients of leaked information im very troubled by 
the probable implications of his plan to prosecute leakers 
once the government is able to say we need this information 
because its materal to a criminal investigation that raises the 
question of whether or not the protection of a confidential source 
is diluted said allan adler a washington media lawyer and 
former legislative counsel to the american civil liberties union 
adler suggested the policy might be a first step toward 
prosecuting journalists for aiding and abetting theft of government 
information or illegally receiving it 
but thornburgh denied that was contemplated i think that was 
made clear he said 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
constitutional and civil rights subcommittee i think it would be 
a definite misuse of the statute the statute was not designed with 
that in mind at all 
edwards said the law has to do with stealing government 
property it doesnt have to do with leaks 
the justice departments 1978 policy said it was inappropriate 
to prosecute an official for theft of property if the case involved 
government information obtained in an otherwise legal way and 
leaked to inform the public 
john c keeney a deputy assistant attorney general in the 
criminal division said in written testimony submitted to a 
congressional hearing we have recently reexamined the policy 
and concluded it is too broad accordingly it is no longer 
applicable to government employees who leak information obtained 
from a criminal investigation 
keeney said it may also be applied in leak cases not arising 
out of a criminal investigation if the employees conduct also 
violated some other provision such as the privacy act 
this could include the criminal investigation of leaks of 
derogatory information collected during an fbi background 
investigation of someone being considered for a cabinet post 
keeney said the department is in the process of deciding 
whether the policy should be changed in other respects 
keeney submitted his statement at a hearing convened in the wake 
of congressional criticism of leaks about an fbi investigation of 
the office of rep william h gray iii dpa 
the justice department which has said gray is not a target of 
the probe has begun a leak investigation in response to those 
complaints 
leslie harris legislative counsel at the aclu called keeneys 
announcement rather disturbing 
the question is whether they in fact intend to broaden it and 
intend to use it as an official secrecy act whenever they see fit 
we are going to be taking a look at this very carefully she said 
former pentagon employee daniel ellsberg was the first 
government official prosecuted under the theft statute for leaking 
the pentagon papers study of the vietnam war his case was 
dismissed in 1973 because of prosecutorial misconduct

hashemi rafsanjani was sworn in thursday 
as irans president and pledged to continue the 10yearold islamic 
revolution but he faced a crisis on his first day in office the 
threat of us retaliation over hostages in lebanon 
at a ceremony in a mosque that was attached to the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis home in north tehran rafsanjanis 
voice shook with emotion as he promised to follow in the footsteps 
of the revolutionary patriarch who died june 3 
despite the propaganda coming from the arrogant world powers 
our people will not accept anything but the continuation of this 
path which is the path of islam and the koran he told religious 
and government leaders a speech carried by tehran radio 
he did not mention the hostage issue 
rafsanjani 54 a middleranking clergyman from a wealthy 
pistachiogrowing family in southern iran captured 945 percent of 
the vote in the july 28 election to become the islamic republics 
fifth head of state 
he will wield considerably more power than his predecessors 
under constitutional reforms approved by 97 percent of voters in a 
referendum the reforms abolish the post of prime minister 
currently held by hussein musavi and allow the president to 
appoint and fire cabinet ministers 
but rafsanjani said to be eager to improve ties with the west 
is being tested almost immediately by the hostage crisis 
lebanese terrorists who claimed they hanged us marine lt 
col william r higgins this week threatened to execute another 
american hostage james cicippio if israel does not release a 
kidnapped moslem cleric 
president bush said he is pursuing every possible diplomatic 
channel to resolve the hostage crisis while prudently planning 
for military action if cicippio is killed 
nbc quoted unidentified administration sources wednesday as 
saying bush had made up his mind to strike back at the lebanese 
shiites and their iranian sponsors if a second hostage was killed 
an administration official said a message to iran the existence 
of which was disclosed tuesday had said in substance if anything 
happens to the hostages we hold you responsible and was conveyed 
to tehran through two channels the swiss embassy representing us 
interests there and through another government he declined to 
identify this official discussed the message on condition of 
anonymity 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united 
states was pleased with a statement tuesday by rafsanjani 
condemning the killing of higgins and all acts of terrorism she 
called on rafsanjani to act in accordance with that statement 
we remain convinced that iran is in a position to bring 
significant influence to bear on those who hold the hostages and 
call on it to do so ms tutwiler said 
the wildly popular rafsanjani is believed to want to erase 
irans image as a sponsor of international terrorism 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati said in tehran on monday 
before higgins was reported killed that the threat against the 
american has nothing to do with us but that iran condemned such 
action 
on sunday however interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
warned that islamic groups worldwide would strike at us and 
israeli interests throughout the world in retalition for the 
abduction of sheik abdul karim obeid by israeli commandos july 28 
in southern lebanon 
despite his sweeping victory rafsanjani may have to proceed 
carefully particularly in dealing with the west to avoid an open 
break with mohtashemi and other powerful radicals dedicated to 
preserving the ideological purity of khomeinis revolution 
the tehran times said thursday the west should follow the 
example of the french who succeeded in winning release of their 
hostages in beirut because they made an honorable deal 
all french hostages in lebanon were released in 1987 but details 
of the agreement were never made public rafsanjani has previously 
linked using irans influence to free american hostages to release 
of iranian assets frozen by the united states 
rafsanjani took over from incumbent ayatollah ali khamenei who 
succeeded khomeini as irans spiritual leader 
he was swept into office amidst widespread anticipation that in 
addition to trying to end irans international isolation he would 
seek to liberalize iranian life and revitalize the warravaged 
economy 
with his ready smile sharp wit and fondness for cracking jokes 
during his weekly friday prayer broadcasts the cleanshaven 
rafsanjani contrasts sharply with the grimfaced bearded ruling 
islamic clerical hierarchy 
he said at his inauguration that when i was preparing myself 
for candidacy in the presidential elections it never even entered 
my mind that i would not receive my confirmation from the imams 
hands 
the dignitaries wept at rafsanjanis reference to khomeini whom 
iranians call their imam or supreme spiritual leader said tehran 
radio monitored in cyprus 
although khamenei a longtime political ally of rafsanjani was 
present at the ceremony his inauguration message was read out by 
ahmad khomeini son of the late spiritual leader 
the move appeared aimed at emphasizing consensus at the top of 
the hierarchy since ahmad is considered a hardliner in the power 
struggle between radicals and rafsanjanis moderate faction

a fruit picker imprisoned more than 21 years 
after the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children filed a 35 
million lawsuit today for being wrongly convicted 
attorneys for 53yearold james richardson of arcadia filed the 
lawsuit in us district court 
richardson was freed last april after a state investigation 
ordered by gov bob martinez found that suppressed evidence and 
perjured testimony was used to convict him 
richardson stood trial only for the pesticide poisoning of his 
oldest child and was sentenced to die in the electric chair the 
sentence was commuted to life in prison when the us supreme court 
struck down the death penalty in 1972 
the lawsuit names the state of florida desoto county former 
state attorney frank schaub and former desoto sheriff frank cline 
roger young one of richardsons attorneys in sarasota said it 
was difficult placing a dollar amount on the time richardson spent 
in prison 
its hard you cant really do it young said he was 
without his family loss of liberty and everything thats 
guaranteed to him by the constitution those things were all 
stripped from him because of the actions of frank schaub 
schaub who retired in january prosecuted the case in 1968 and 
blasted special prosecutor janet reno for concluding that 
richardson probably was wrongfully accused ms reno announced in 
may that the state would not retry richardson whose sentence was 
vacated april 25 
efforts to reach schaub and cline by phone for comment were 
unsuccessful 
the suit seeks to compensate richardson for mental anguish loss 
of the capacity for the enjoyment of life loss of income pain and 
suffering and loss of his liberty and rights as a citizen of the 
united states 
since his release from a state prison near daytona beach 
richardson has worked at a diet clinic run by former comedian dick 
gregory in fort walton beach

president bush lost one of his options 
for a quick strike against iran in the latest hostage crisis 
because the logical fleet to execute it was 4000 miles away us 
military sources said thursday 
us forces in the mediterranean were within minutes striking 
distance of lebanon but the navy carrier force based in the indian 
ocean was making a routine port call in singapore 
the military option was there but the navy in the indian 
ocean wasnt said one of the sources all of whom insisted on 
anonymity 
he described it as just the breaks that the uss america and 
its eightship battle group were so far away when shiite moslem 
kidnappers in lebanon said monday they had hanged lt col william 
r higgins 
washington officials said immediately that all options were 
open including military response to the killing of the us marine 
officer who was on un peacekeeping duty in south lebanon when he 
was abducted feb 17 1988 
that seemed to be reaffirmed wednesday when bush asked about 
movements of us warships in the region said his administration 
was prudently planning the response to be made if a second 
american was killed 
us diplomatic sources have said potential targets include iran 
because of its support for lebanons shiite kidnappers of higgins 
and other westerners 
they likened the situation to april 1986 when president reagan 
used air strikes to punish libya for its alleged sponsorship of 
international terrorism 
the officials in washington confirmed the 79000ton america and 
five of its escorts had cut the singapore visit short but would 
not say where the ships were going or whether the move was linked 
to the hostage crisis 
sources said the carrier was returning to its current duty of 
patrolling the arabian sea as part of the navys joint task force 
middle east which covers that area and the persian gulf 
although the america could make the 4000mile voyage in about 
five days at its top speed of more than 30 knots that pace would 
leave some of the escorts behind 
its battle group has the carriers 80 aircraft and a variety of 
cruise missiles on the aegis cruiser mobile bay missile cruiser 
dale destroyers comte de grasse and lawrence and the frigate 
joseph hewes 
after a ceasefire was reached a year ago in the 8yearold war 
between iran and iraq the navy reduced its persian gulf force and 
began giving more port time to sailors who sometimes had spent 
weeks at a time at sea on high alert 
carrier groups in the arabian sea are rotated every three 
months but since the truce weeks sometimes pass with no carrier 
on station 
almost anywhere you go out there its a matter of great 
distance one officer said the indian ocean is not the 
mediterranean there just arent that many good liberty ports 
around there 
the nearest regular port of call for us carriers is karachi 
pakistan about 500 miles from the gulf 
they also visit djibouti a french base on the horn of africa 
1500 miles away the seychelles islands and mombasa kenya each 
2000 miles away and bombay india which is 800 miles from the 
strait of hormuz at the gulfs southern end 
sources said the america sailed 2500 miles to the indian ocean 
base of diego garcia for weapons training before setting out for 
singapore 
one said iran offered limited choices in targets the most 
obvious being kharg island the offshore oil terminal in the 
northern pesian gulf that handles most of irans oil exports 
kharg was a regular sometimes daily target of iraq air raids 
the united states attacked iranian oil platforms in the persian 
gulf twice during the war in reprisal for iranian attacks on 
usflagged vessels

racist laws and charges of police 
harassment and detentions of dissidents by guerrillas wont delay 
namibias independence the chief un official for the territory 
said thursday 
i am reasonably confident that we are three months away from 
holding an election un special representative martti ahtisaari 
of finland told a conference on the future of the south 
africanruled colony 
barring any unexpected major setback we should have elections 
nov 6 said ahtisaari 
sixty percent of the estimated 650000 eligible voters have 
registered he said 
un police are having difficulty monitoring territorial police 
on patrol in northern namibia because land mineresistant vehicles 
the police leased them have broken down ahtisaari said 
nevertheless he said the un police presence is having a 
reassuring and calming effect on people in the north where 
police are accused of harassing supporters of the guerrillabacked 
southwest africa peoples organization 
the organization ended its 23year bush war for independence 
when pretoria signed a usbrokered accord agreeing to grant 
namibia independence in exchange for the withdrawal of cuban troops 
in angola 
ahtisaari said the integration into the police force of about 
2000 members of a paramilitary unit called koevoet afrikaans 
for crowbar is unacceptable 
there is no place for the continuance of a counterinsurgency 
operation ahtisaari said they should be fulfilling normal 
police operations only 
police retraining koevoet men report only 15 percent are 
literate and others would be unable to take down a citizens 
complaint or crime report ahtisaari said their skills must lie 
elsewhere he said 
the south african administrator of namibia louis pienaar 
defended the presence of koevoet during the oneday conference 
organized by the university of pretoria he said koevet members are 
needed to counteract any possible invasion by armed guerrillas who 
remain across the border in angola 
ahtisaari said he continues to investigate charges by prisoners 
released by the guerrilla organization that up to 2000 more 
detainees are being held in neighboring countries where guerrillas 
have refused to allow un or red cross officials to inspect their 
camps about 200 detainees freed last month were accused of spying 
for south africa 
i am not yet satisfied that all political prisoners have been 
released and i am pursuing this with all concerned governments and 
with swapo ahtisaari said 
he said he also is continuing discussions with pienaar about 
repealing legislation that divides namibia into 11 ethnic 
governments providing schools and medical services on a racial 
basis 
this legislation is found by the majority of people including 
all the major political parties to be repugnant said ahtisaari 
pienaar wants to leave it to a new government expected to take 
office early next year 
he also said he is not content with the impartiality of the 
statecontrolled media and will suggest proposals to rectify the 
situation

flames neared californias palomar observatory and threatened a 
nature sanctuary today as firefighters elsewhere in the west 
struggled to consolidate gains made against hundreds of wildfires 
with the help of cooler weather 
an estimated 220000 acres of timber brush and grassland have 
burned throughout the west in a bout of fires that began july 26 
according to the federal boise idaho interagency fire center 
more than 20000 firefighters were on the lines in idaho oregon 
washington montana and california 
cool moist air slowed the spread of fires in idaho and oregon 
but a warming trend was predicted this afternoon and through the 
weekend 
things havent slowed down at all here said spokesman kris 
long at the federal fire center with supplies and manpower 
coming in and out it stays busy 
in southern california firefighters dropped water and chemicals 
and set fires of their own in a struggle to keep flames from a 
10300acre wildfire away from the eagle crag nature sanctuary in 
the cleveland national forest today the fire was within 5 miles of 
the palomar observatory a mountaintop astronomy center operated by 
the california institute of technology 
crews had cut lines around 60 percent of the blaze early today 
but their chances of containing the flames would be hurt if fire 
got into the eagle crag area about 90 miles southeast of los 
angeles said forest service spokeswoman audrey hagen 
no equipment is allowed in the area ms hagen said 
bulldozers might be authorized as a last resort but the terrain is 
so steep they probably wouldnt be able to get in she said 
in idaho a break in dry lightning that zapped the state in 
recent weeks was enough to prompt steppedup efforts to hack 
containment lines around the worst of the fires burning 90000 
acres of timber and range 
an estimated 36 million in resources have been destroyed in the 
boise national forest alone officials said 
cooler moister air eased the immediate danger to two small 
backcountry towns in westcentral idaho which most residents 
evacuated earlier in the week 
strategists called for at least 70 more 20member crews to join 
more than 6200 firefighters already committed in idaho hundreds 
of idaho national guardsmen also were activated to support the 
effort 
in the forests the first priority continued to be protection of 
small communities and pockets of summer homes and cabins 
soapy white foam was sprayed on structures and hundreds of 
firefighters were diverted from frontal assaults on the blazes to 
clear brush and other fuel from around private property 
besides the war on the ground dozens of helicopters were 
ferrying buckets filled with water from rivers to hot spots and 
air tankers have been dropping about a quartermillion gallons of 
chemical retardant a day 
the situation wednesday elsewhere in the west 
in eastern oregon teams worked to prevent erosion in the 
malheur and wallowawhitman national forests even before the fires 
that had claimed 88000 acres of timber and range lands were 
contained several smaller blazes were contained and the spread of 
the bigger fires around the towns of john day baker and enterprise 
had stopped said us forest service spokeswoman wendy evans in 
portland 
in california in addition to the cleveland national forest 
blaze a 3000acre fire burned out of control in the sierra nevada 
foothills in the center of the state but didnt pose a threat to 
structures 
in montana fire engines stood by to protect two mountain 
cabins as a lightningsparked fire in in dead timber grew quickly 
to 500 acres on the crow indian reservation southeast of billings 
an 800acre grass and timber fire in the custer national forest in 
the states southeastern corner was contained 
in washington firefighters were mopping up the 850acre 
lodgepole fire in the north cascades near the canadian border

opposition leader kim daejung said 
thursday a 22hour interrogation by security agents failed to 
implicate him in a secret trip to communist north korea by a 
lawmaker charged with espionage 
kim told a news conference at the headquarters of his party for 
peace and democracy that he was cleared of any suspicion and 
charged that his questioning by security authorities was a 
wellconceived government plan to undermine his partys image 
but the agency for national security planning the main 
government intelligence organization said that since questioning 
was legally limited to 24 hours and kim issued adamant denials 
they ran out of time and that kim might be questioned again 
they detained me for questioning without any evidence kim 
told supporters after returning from the interrogation that lasted 
until early thursday 
the head of the largest opposition party said investigators 
could not present evidence that he had any part in a trip to north 
korea last year by national assemblyman suh kyungwon 
suh was expelled from kims party after the lawmaker was 
arrested june 28 
south korea bans unauthorized travel to north korea and 
maintains that dialogue or contacts must go through official 
channels violators can be sentenced to prison terms under tough 
national security laws 
kim and senior party lawmaker moon tonghwan were interrogated 
after being detained on a court warrant wednesday 
government officials said kim was investigated to determine 
whether he funded a trip to north korea a year ago by suh whether 
kim sent a message to north korean leader kim il sung and how suh 
became involved in party politics 
suh is jailed on charges of security violations and espionage 
and accepting 120000 from communist agents nine people also were 
arrested in the case 
kim who has run twice for president has denied any involvement 
in suhs trip he accused the government of political harassment 
aimed at disgracing his party 
i rebutted pointbypoint all points of suspicion raised by 
the nsp agency for national security planning kim said i

opposition party was detained without sufficient grounds

president robert mugabes government 
said thursday it is under pressure to hand over whiteowned land to 
peasant farmers but promised it wont seize private farms 
i want to assure you the government is not a grabber rural 
development minister joshua nkomo told a meeting of the 
4000member commercial farmers union in harare 
but nkomo said the state will push ahead to redress continuing 
imbalances in land ownership in this southern african nation of 92 
million people 
about 4000 mainly white commercial farmers own onethird of 
land in zimbabwe a country slightly smaller than california eight 
million peasants occupy roughly the same amount of land as white 
farmers 
land hunger was a key issue of the sevenyear bush war that 
ended when the whiteruled former british colony of rhodesia became 
independent zimbabwe in 1980 
but since then only a few hundred white farmers have sold their 
properties to the state for peasant resettlement programs funded by 
britain and the united states the deals were made under a 
willing sellerwilling buyer clause in zimbabwes first 
constitution which expires next april 10 years after independence 
in the coming year when this provision ceases to be 
effective government will not grab land from anybody nkomo told 
about 200 white farmers at their annual convention 
but he said the government has been under pressure the 
people have been saying we believed that after independence 
things would change yet we still sit here in exactly the same 
manner as before 
mugabes government says it is socialist but encourages a mixed 
economy to flourish 
nkomo said the government plans a socioeconomic evaluation 
of commercial and peasant farming to find ways of releasing more 
land to peasants 
he urged white farmers to sit together as citizens of this 
country and address this problem 
zimbabwes agriculturebased economy produces 1 billion worth 
of crops a year including 500 million in foreign currency from 
tobacco cotton and other exports it is one of the few african 
nations that produces enough to feed itself and export food 
commercial farmers say they are the nations largest single 
employer supporting a workforce of 380000 people and 15 million 
of their dependents 
since independence 52000 peasant families averaging six family 
members have been resettled on about 12 million acres 
about 1 million acres 16 percent of total whiteowned 
farmlands were bought by the state the rest was former state land 
turned over to resettlement

to appreciate the immense potential for 
housing fraud in depressed oklahoma one needed only to look at the 
numbers at one point last year the state had 1459 foreclosed fha 
homes while new york city had 39 and boston had one 
potential turned into reality and now oklahoma has probably 
the largest fha fraud in the country says charles ming area 
manager for the federal department of housing and urban 
development which includes fha 
some estimates of the federal housing administration fraud have 
approached 1 billion a special team of federal investigators has 
been poring over records and mortgage documents for months and 
already more than 20 people have either been convicted pleaded 
guilty or agreed to do so 
the possible scope of the situation in oklahoma was spelled out 
by ming who estimated that fraud may have tainted up to twothirds 
of the 5600 fha loan defaults over the past 2 years some 
promoters were raking in illicit cash from 100 homes each he said 
oklahomas oilrelated economic straits provided a calamitous 
backdrop for illegal schemes thousands of homes stand vacant 
hundreds more are on the market with no buyers in sight along with 
the highrollers who made hundreds of thousands of dollars the 
lure of a few extra dollars also sucked in such people as a retired 
policeman and an air force mechanic 
ming and troy grigsby hud deputy field office manager 
described three basic forms of fraud 
submitting false documents to the fha in order to obtain 
mortgage insurance grigsby said this involved setting someone up 
as a straw man purchaser of a house often with money provided 
by the investor generally this straw man was an average 
person looking to make easy money officials said 
kiting a propertys value through sham sales grigsby said the 
fraud came when someone would purchase a property then sell it 
to a friend at several times its value then using appraisals 
based on the higher sale figure they would get an fha loan he 
said 
equity skimming where someone supposedly assumes a mortgage 
rents out the property but never makes any mortgage payments the 
lender never realized anything was wrong until the mortgage went 
into foreclosure grigsby said 
ming said homeowners faced with crushing payments were all too 
ready to bite when someone offered perhaps 1000 and an agreement 
to take over his mortgage never realizing that the buyer had 
no intention of making any mortgage payments he said 
dozens of surprised renters have been forced to move when the 
home on which they paid monthly rent was foreclosed even more 
surprised was the original owner who found himself liable for the 
defaulted mortgage 
an unusual twist was uncovered during the winter when 
investigators found unsuspecting families living in foreclosed and 
supposedly vacant homes in each case someone had removed the 
locks placed by real estate agents and posing as the owners had 
rented out the houses 
acting us attorney robert e mydans says 13 people have been 
convicted in connection with one scheme or another five others 
have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing and four more have 
agreed to plea bargains but have not yet entered their pleas 
mydans said 
a federal court jury earlier this year convicted a real estate 
investor a minister and an air force civilian employee of making 
false statements and using phony documents to obtain fhainsured 
loans in 31 transactions totaling more than 800000 all ended in 
default 
cecil r johnson was a typical illegal investor 
the government alleged that in a standard deal johnson would 
purchase a rundown property have it appraised at a highly 
inflated refurbished value and then obtain a conventional loan 
based on that higher value 
he would use only a small part of the loan money to repair the 
house while pocketing the rest then get someone to buy the home 
with an fhainsured loan the government said 
one of the straw men set up by johnson was robert mckittrick a 
retired oklahoma city police officer who admitted receiving 4000 
for participating in several deals he was placed on probation 
fined 50 and ordered to repay hud the 4000 
lloyde billman a retired meat salesman testified in court that 
he was almost broke and trying to care for an ailing wife when he 
became involved with johnson only when johnson placed 14000 in 
his bank account was he able to qualify for an fha loan billman 
said he was put on probation fined 50 and ordered to repay 
2400 to hud 
johnson was sentenced to four years in prison fined 3540 and 
ordered to repay 150000 to hud 
fha fraud isnt the only part of the burgeoning scandals at hud 
to touch on oklahoma city 
a hud audit has linked philip winn now ambassador to 
switzerland and two other former hud officials to a group alleged 
to have made millions of dollars in unjustified profits on 
multifamily rehabilitation projects including one here 
winn who served as an assistant secretary for housing for a 
year was partners with philip abrams former hud undersecretary 
and j michael queenan former director of huds regional office in 
denver 
jack g womack executive director of the oklahoma city housing 
authority said he had informed hud that rent on a twobedroom 
apartment in the oklahoma city project should have been about 250 
instead he said the winn group and benton mortgage co a 
nashvillebased company that has been suspended from government 
work insisted it should be 357 
after debt service for rehabilitation work was added to the 
357 the rent for a twobedroom apartment came to 479 womack 
said since the typical renter will pay only 100 to 150 the 
federal government has to pick up the rest he said

brothers donald jay alan merrill and wayne and from gasser and 
the two partnerships under which the government agency says the

suit filed concerning the 1980 loan 
the second complaint states that neither the whole or any

indictments of 46 commodities traders represent 
only the opening salvo in the governments crackdown on corruption 
at the worlds two largest futures exchanges according to the 
prosecutor 
this is an ongoing investigation not a concluded 
investigation us attorney anton valukas told reporters 
wednesday 
this is the first step in what we will be doing he said 
adding the investigation will continue as long as there are 
viable allegations of misconduct 
after a 2year undercover fbi investigation 46 traders at the 
chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange were accused 
of systematically conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts 
and attempting to hide earnings from the internal revenue service 
this probe is part of an expanding department of justice 
crackdown on whitecollar crime in all its various guises from 
wall street to chicagos lasalle street to main street with all 
stops in between said us attorney general dick thornburgh who 
came to chicago to announce the indictments 
the activities uncovered at these exchanges the largest of 
their type in the world cannot be tolerated 
the four separate indictments covering 1275 pages and hundreds 
of counts allege that brokers trading for their own accounts as 
well as customers accounts systematically and illegally cheated 
customers with the cooperation of locals traders trading only 
for their own accounts 
responding to a possible crisis of confidence the mercantile 
exchange announced early today it had approved several rule changes 
and increased surveillance to better protect customers 
the most significant change will not go into effect without 
membership approval however it would restrict dual trading in 
which a trader is allowed to trade his own account as well as those 
of customers 
leo melamed chairman of the mercs executive committee said 
the exchange hoped to put the fear of god into traders through 
increased scrutiny and stiffer penalties including automatic 
expulsion of any trader found guilty of a second offense involving 
a customers account 
the changes resulted from a comprehensive review of the exchange 
conducted by a blueribbon panel appointed in january when the fbi 
probe was revealed 
eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating the 
federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act which 
carries the stiffest penalties up to 20 years in prison these 
charges also empower the government to freeze defendants assets 
before trial for seizure upon conviction 
most of those indicted are charged with multiple counts such as 
prearranged trading racketeering conspiracy and income tax fraud 
in schemes that allegedly bilked hundreds of customers out of 
profits in thousands of trades said valukas 
he wouldnt say how much money customers may have lost to the 
alleged fraud but called the amount significant 
fourteen of those charged have agreed to plead guilty and 
cooperate with investigators according to government sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
some futures traders and defense lawyers characterized most of 
those indicted as smalltime players and guessed that the 
government was using them to net bigger prey 
these appear to be small fish who extended the rules and 
regulations at times that big brother was watching said one 
trader who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
attorney thomas royce representing indicted japanese yen 
futures trader gary wright said he expects the investigation to 
widen 
the government doesnt spend millions as they did here and 
bring in the attorney general and the fbi director if theyre only 
seeking 46 guys he said 
thornburgh fbi director william sessions and wendy gramm 
chairman of the federal commodity futures trading commission flew 
into chicago for the news conference 
ms gramm called the indictments the first results of the most 
extensive and aggressive law enforcement effort in the financial 
area ever 
four undercover fbi agents secretly taperecorded observed and 
even participated on exchange floors in the illegal transactions

engineers at three mile island site of 
the nations worst commercial nuclear plant accident are studying 
what could be two small cracks on the inside of the damaged 
reactor a spokeswoman said thursday 
it is not yet known if the small lines that showed up on a 
remote television inspection of the reactor bottom are indeed 
cracks said plant spokeswoman mary wells they could be scales or 
rivulets of molten material left over from the march 1979 accident 
she said 
we dont know the significance ms wells said adding that 
a team of six engineers has been set up to study the situation 
the possible cracks were discovered by a team of experts 
studying the unit 2 reactor which has been shut since the accident 
and is being cleaned and readied for longterm closure there are 
no plans to restart the reactor 
the bottom of the carbon steel reactor vessel is 5 inches thick 
at the point the possible cracks were found and is covered on the 
inside by a steel liner oneeighth inch thick 
there has been no indication of any leaks through the bottom of 
the reactor vessel ms wells said 
half of the 150ton radioactive core at tmi2 collapsed and 
melted in the accident when a series of mechanical failures and 
operator errors blocked vital cooling water radioactive gases were 
released 
the possible cracks were found in early july at the base of two 
of 52 nozzles where instruments once protruded into the core at a 
spot where temperatures were the hottest during the accident one 
of the lines is at the point where a nozzle is welded to the liner 
the other appears to extend from the weld to the liner itself 
many of the nozzles were covered with molten debris that flowed 
to the reactors bottom most of that debris was removed within the 
past month giving technicians their first good view of the reactor 
bottom since the accident 
technicians have done remote television inspection of all but 
five of the nozzles but also want to take another look at 10 
because of some visibility problems ms wells said 
in midaugust probing tools and for the first time a color 
television camera will be lowered into the vessel to give the study 
team a better idea of whether the lines are cracks 
one theory is that small cracks could have occurred because the 
stainless steel contracts at a different rate than the underlying 
carbon steel said spokesman doug bedell the possible cracks are 
on or near welds holding the nozzle bases to the vessel he said 
bedell said any conclusions on whether the cracks should they 
prove to be cracks meant the situation at tmi a decade ago was 
worse than previously thoughtwould have to await completion of a 
nuclear regulatory commission study in the study set to begin 
later this year samples of the steel will be taken and studied 
about 275000 pounds or 92 percent of the debris remaining 
fuel and other metal components have been removed from the reactor 
vessel 
by the end of next year the plant operator gpu nuclear corp 
plans to put the plant in longterm monitored storage the plan is 
awaiting approval by the nuclear regulatory commission

president bushs clean air bill was introduced 
in the senate thursday with just three democratic cosponsors and 
an administration official blamed majority leader george j 
mitchell for the lack of bipartisanship 
the three democrats joined 21 republican sponsors after the 
administration conducted a vigorous recruitment drive among 
democrats 
a source at the environmental protection agency speaking only 
on the condition he not be named said agency administrator william 
reilly became so upset with democratic attacks on the bill that he 
called mitchell to complain 
mitchell dmaine the chief sponsor of past clean air 
legislation which failed to pass said july 25 that the bush bill 
avoided virtually every tough choice in forcing cities and 
industries to clean the nations skies 
bush has made the legislation a top priority agreeing with 
environmentalists on the urgent need to clear the skies of smog 
toxic chemicals and acid rain but his decision to leave much 
discretion to the epa administrator and in some cases to industry 
caused environmental groups and their supporters to call the bill 
too weak to protect the nations health 
patrick quinn the epas congressional liaison called the 
paucity of senate democratic sponsors a reflection of unexpected 
partisan tactics by the majority leaders office we made the same 
kind of effort to line up sponsors as we did in the house 
where 57 democrats and 90 republicans backed the legislation 
its a rather shocking disparity reilly feels thats very 
unfortunate and wants to avoid any partisanship in the debate 
the epa source said reilly in his call to mitchell made a 
similar point stressing he does not want to get off to a 
partisan start in the clean air debate mitchell said he had real 
concerns about administration proposals on ozone and toxic 
chemicals and auto emissions 
sen john h chafee of rhode island ranking republican on the 
senate environment committee was the chief sponsor of the 
administration legislation 
the democrats who joined him were donald w riegle jr of 
michigan john b breaux of louisiana and j james exon of nebraska 
chafee noted the lack of democratic support indirectly saying 
the introduction of the presidents bill is not the end of the 
process but a major advance in the march 
after eight years of silence from the white house on this 
issue we now have a chief executive who recognizes the need for a 
major overhaul of the clean air act chafee said

mentally ill nursing home residents often are 
improperly drugged and denied adequate care because government 
policies discourage treatment and trained aides are in short 
supply experts told a house committee thursday 
janet pacatte of the national mental health association said 
insufficient federal funds and the lack of adequately trained staff 
contribute to warehousing hundreds of thousands of elderly 
americans who suffer from a mental illness 
there is a substantial unmet need for mental health services 
for the nursing home population she told the house select 
committee on aging 
several mental health experts testified that mental disorders 
affect from 50 percent to more than 90 percent of the nations 15 
million nursing home residents with nursing home populations 
likely to increase rapidly as the population ages 
mental illnesses frequently are undiagnosed or mistreated at 
nursing homes because medicaid and medicare reimbursement policies 
are biased in favor of the treatment of physical ailments they 
said 
dr barry fogel of the american psychiatric association said 
nursing homes shy away from diagnosing mental illness because they 
could be reclassified as mental institutions and ruled ineligible 
for medicaid payments if too many of their patients are being 
treated for such problems 
in addition fogel said medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
rates for psychiatric services in nursing homes are inadequate to 
attract enough psychiatrists and nursing home staffs often lack 
training for these problems 
the consequence is the treatment of mental and behavioral 
symptoms with psychotropic mindaltering drugs alone rather than 
with a comprehensive and holistic approach fogel said 
ms pacatte cited the experience of her own mother as a case of 
overmedication 
i cannot begin to share with the dismay and horror i felt when 
i visited my mother in a nursing home and found her in a 
drugrelated stuper hallucinating and completely out of touch 
because she was on inappropriate use of psychotropic drugs she 
said 
ms pacatte called for changes to radically alter the 
deplorable situation now found in so many nursing homes where staff 
are untrained lack professional support and residents go without 
essential mental health treatment and are often inappropriately 
restrained 
dr michael a smyer professor of human development at 
pennsylvania state university said more federal dollars should be 
earmarked for training geriatric specialists he also called for 
removing the barriers to mental health treatment that are built 
into the medicaid and medicare programs 
c ross anthony associate administrator for program development 
at the health care financing administration conceded that medicaid 
and medicare are heavily weighted toward acute medical care 
rather than mental health services 
but he added the medicare and medicaid programs now provide 
more and better ways to finance medically necessary services for 
the mentally ill than ever before 
committee chairman rep edward roybal dcalif has introduced 
legislation to shift more medicaid and medicare dollars toward 
mental health services in nursing homes and to target 30 million 
in community mental health money for the elderly 
for far too long mental health care has been a neglected 
priority in our american health care system roybal said

the soviet union has accepted us demands that 
the superpowers begin inspecting each others chemical weapons 
sites before a global ban on the weapons is signed officials said 
thursday 
moscows shift was conveyed in a memorandum from soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze to secretary of state james a baker 
iii when they met in paris last week 
the united states had been demanding that the inspections begin 
before a global ban is signed by the 40nation geneva conference on 
disarmament 
moscow previously wanted to allow checks only after the treaty 
was completed and signed 
the geneva disarmament conference has been debating a 
comprehensive convention to ban chemical weapons for more than two 
decades but delegates have little hope of getting the draft accord 
ready in the immediate future 
a soviet delegate to the geneva talks said moscows change of 
position was aimed at starting the inspections as soon as possible 
moscow expects onsite checks to back its official position that 
it has no more than 50000 tons of chemical armaments some western 
analysts have said the soviet stockpile is more than six times 
bigger than that 
the paris meeting at which the soviets decision was relayed 
was part of separate superpower talks on chemical weapons 
the united states and soviet union which have the worlds 
biggest poison gas arsenals say these talks could help the geneva 
negotiations 
disputes include how to monitor compliance with a ban on the 
weapons 
when the latest round of bilateral talks ended in june the 
superpowers reported agreement on technical procedures for 
inspections but officials said further negotiations were needed on 
exchanging chemical weapons data a step that would precede the 
inspections 
the geneva talks are to continue in the fall 
the soviet delegate in geneva said he could not give firm 
predictions about when data exchanges or inspections may begin 
a us arms control official while confirming the soviet shift 
said theres a lot that remains to be resolved on the details 
also thursday both superpowers indicated the latest round of 
talks on reducing longrange nuclear forces had made some progress 
but disagreements on major issues remain 
chief us envoy richard burt expressed hope the useful and 
constructive round paved the way for a productive discussion 
on the draft strategic arms reduction treaty when baker and 
shevardnadze meet next month in the united states 
soviet chief delegate yuri nazarkin reiterated that moscow views 
us plans for spacebased missile defenses as the main obstacle to 
a start accord which would reduce each sides arsenal of 
longrange missiles and heavy bombers by up to half 
referring to a bush administration proposal for testing 
anticheating measures before a treaty is completed nazarkin said 
the soviets will carefully analyze all of its aspects 
generally speaking the idea of test running verification 
methods appears quite useful he said

the senate approved legislation thursday that 
would give vietnamera veterans disability benefits for certain 
illnesses associated with us use of agent orange 
the bill provides payments on an interim basis through april 
15 1992 while providing for subsequent congressional votes to 
make the benefits permanent benefits would be paid to veterans 
with nonhodgkins lymphoma and softtissue sarcoma 
a broader version is pending in the house 
passage of the senate bill by voice vote was a victory for 
veterans advocates who have been battling government scientists 
they have accused various agencies of ignoring evidence about the 
deadly herbicide while government scientists have said that no 
clear causeandeffect relationship has been established 
it has been a long hard struggle said sen alan cranston 
dcalif a cosponsor of the bill and chairman of the veterans 
affairs committee too many vietnam veterans and their families 
have suffered anguish for far too long 
this bill is important obviously because it creates a 
presumption in favor of veterans said sen john kerry dmass 
a vietnam veteran he said the measure makes it clear that there 
will not be an adversariness in the attempt by veterans to seek the 
services that they are entitled to it does not open up a 
pandoras box of benefits because these are two very rare 
diseases 
the bill was discussed on the senate floor late wednesday and 
passed with little difficulty thursday morning 
an estimated 26 million military personnel were in south 
vietnam during the war in the late 1960s and early 1970s some 
250000 have told the veterans administration now the department 
of veterans affairs that they believe they were exposed and 
35000 have applied for disability benefits 
veterans already are allowed to receive outpatient and hospital 
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to agent orange 
approximately 12 million gallons of the herbicide were sprayed 
during the vietnam war to remove the foliage providing ground cover 
for the enemy agent orange contains dioxin one of the most toxic 
chemicals known as well as 245t and 24d also harmful 
chemicals 
the bill in the house would allow veterans to be compensated 
longer and for more diseases under it veterans with 
nonhodgkins lymphoma softtissue sarcoma melanoma and basal 
cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability benefits 
so would their survivors 
the house bill has been estimated to cost 40 million no such 
estimate was available for the senate version although it would be 
considerably less 
the senate bill establishes for the first time a presumption 
of service connection for any vietnam veteran with chloracne a 
skin condition provided it occurred within a year of the time the 
persons service tour ended 
both bills require extensive recordkeeping by the veterans 
administration based on health reports and tissue samples from 
veterans both would ask the national academy of sciences to review 
scientific studies on agent orange exposure every two years with 
the department of veterans affairs making its benefits 
determinations based on those reviews 
the senate passed an agent orange bill last year but the measure 
never emerged from the house veterans affairs committee 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of that 
committee and the senior minority member rep bob stump rariz 
sent colleagues a letter last month calling the house bill 
premature at best 
they cited a continuing study by the centers for disease control 
on the incidence of selected cancers among vietnamera veterans 
due for completion next spring and noted a federal court order to 
change the criteria used to evaluate agent orange studies and the 
recent creation of a us court of veterans appeals to review 
claims 
but supporters of the bill said the cdc and va had moved too 
slowly to determine whether a link exists between agent orange and 
the various afflictions 
during a house government operations subcommittee hearing in 
early july the cdc was accused of rigging its agent orange study 
to show no direct link officials of the health agency maintained 
that it dropped a massive study of agent orange exposure because 
there was no way to tell who was exposed

palestinians told a us envoy thursday there 
has been an alarming lack of progress in the usplo dialogue 
and urged the united states to change what they called its 
proisrael stance 
also thursday 17 people were wounded by plastic bullets when 
israeli troops opened fire on the main street of khan yunis in the 
occupied gaza strip hospital officials said 
the troops fired after their patrol was hit by a hand grenade 
injuring three soldiers and three palestinians the army and arab 
reports said 
the clashes came as the supreme court in jerusalem ruled that 
the armys regulations on the use of plastic bullets were legal and 
denied a request that the bullets be banned or put under stricter 
limits 
thirteen prominent palestinians from the occupied lands met with 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for middle east affairs 
who is on the first leg of a tour that will include egypt and 
jordan 
the palestinians said in a statement that they considered the 
session to be part of the ongoing usplo dialogue which was 
launched in tunis last december after plo chief yasser arafat 
renounced terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
they said that dialogue has so far demonstrated an alarming 
lack of progress in matters of substance and the levels of 
representation 
earlier kelly met for an hour with prime minister yitzhak 
shamir kelly told reporters after the meeting that they discussed 
the peace process but declined to give details 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman did not say if the meeting 
touched on the israeli abduction of lebanese shiite leader sheik 
abdul karim obeid on july 28 the abduction led to the apparent 
execution of a us hostage us marine lt col william r 
higgins by his lebanese captors 
higgins killing was to be high on the agenda at the fifth 
congress of the fatah movement the main component of the palestine 
liberation organization which opened thursday in tunis 
plo spokesman ahmed abdelrahman said the incident was to be 
discussed as part of the congress consideration of lebanon which 
has been wracked by a 14yearold civil war 
fatah on tuesday condemned the killing of higgins but put the 
blame on israel 
in his opening speech at the congress arafat said the plo 
disliked the original israeli plan for elections in the occupied 
territories but would have accepted it if it had been a step 
toward palestinian selfdetermination 
the israeli plan aimed at perpetuating the israeli occupation 
of the occupied territories and has now collapsed in failure 
arafat said 
shamir has called for elections in the west bank and gaza 
occupied by israel since 1967 to select palestinians to open talks 
with israel on an interim autonomy agreement the plan also calls 
for arab countries to make peace with israel 
radwan abu ayyash head of the arab journalists association in 
east jerusalem said the palestinians told kelly nothing could 
happen here without approval of the plo and that israel must be 
convinced to accept the usbacked concept of trading land for 
peace 
he said kelly in turn warned that while the united states 
would assist in the peace process it was up to the two sides to 
offer acceptable proposals 
we are not going to deliver you to israel neither are we 
going to deliver israel to you there is a table of negotiations 
and you have to make your own way to this table and you have to 
learn how to live together abu ayyash quoted kelly as saying 
in their statement the palestinians noted the united states had 
endorsed israels plan for elections in the occupied lands but not 
the plo plan which says the elections should lead to creation of a 
palestinian state 
we view with the greatest seriousness the lack of 
evenhandedness and objectivity in the us response the 
statement said

a federal judge today said commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher had no right to suspended enforcement of 
regulations to protect endangered sea turtles from drowning in 
shrimpers nets and gave the agency until monday to draft interim 
measures 
us district court judge thomas hogan said he would consider 
making the commerce department enforce regulations requiring 
shrimpers to equip their boats with turtle excluder devices or 
teds if the agency does not submit a plan to protect the sea 
turtles by mondays deadline 
hogans decision followed a twohour hearing on the national 
wildlife federations request for an injunction that would require 
the department to enforce requirements that shrimpers use teds 
mosbacher suspended enforcement of the teds regulations july 24 
after angry shrimpers who contend the devices reduce their catch 
by as much as onethird blockaded shipping channels along the 
texas gulf coast and threatened violence against law officers and 
the coast guard 
hogan said that while he is concerned about the shrimpers 
livelihood he said it is regrettable that shrimpers in other areas 
have learned to use teds but that texas and louisiana shrimpers 
cannot find it possible to use the devices even for a season 
the teds regulations were to take effect may 1 after 17 years 
of debate within congress and the courts but mosbacher limited 
enforcement of the rules to warnings until july 1 
later in the month mosbacher said he had no alternative but to 
enforce the teds regulations prompting the july 2223 protests 
mosbacher has now proposed new regulations requiring shrimpers 
to pull their nets every 105 minutes to keep endangered sea turtles 
from drowning but they have not taken effect 
hogan said mosbachers decision to suspend enforcement of the 
teds rules until the tow regulations take effect was a total 
abrogation of the law to protect sea turtles and appears to fly 
in the face of a congressional mandate 
his actions on july 24 leave them totally unprotected hogan 
said they have been totally abandoned by the secretary 
wildlife attorney jan goldmancarter testified the shrimping 
season in texas and louisiana is at its peak so the turtles are at 
maximum risk of being killed in their nets 
she said we are so close to the edge of extinction on the 
kemps ridley sea turtle 
government attorney michelle kurac said mosbachers decision to 
suspend the teds regulations was justified given the protests and 
the shrimpers vows not to comply with the rules

an american bar association committee that 
includes former nixon and carter administration officials urged 
congress on thursday to abandon efforts to outlaw desecration of 
the american flag 
the committee said the nations commitment to freedom of 
expression will be damaged by any attempt to reverse a supreme 
court ruling that americans have a right to burn the flag as a 
political protest 
all through human history tyrannies have tried to enforce 
obedience by prohibiting disrespect for the symbols of their 
power the task force said the american flag commands respect 
and love because of our countrys adherence to its values and its 
promise of freedom not because of fiat and criminal law 
headed by former internal renenue service commissioner randolph 
thrower an appointee of former president nixon the panel will ask 
the abas policymaking house of delegates to endorse its report 
next week during a convention of the lawyers group in honolulu 
the committee said that because congress appears to be rushing 
toward some action the aba should go on record now opposing either 
legislation or a constitutional amendment to reverse the court 
ruling 
lawyers have a special obligation to defend the constitution 
and its cardinal principles the task force said 
we agree that the burning of the american flag as a form of 
political protest is very offensive to the vast majority of our 
citizens the panel said but it is just when people take 
great offense because of disrespect shown to an honored symbol that 
the right of free expression needs protection not prosecution 
the bush administration and leading republicans in congress 
support a constitutional amendment that would permit states to 
outlaw flag desecration democratic leaders in congress are 
sponsoring legislation to make flag desecration a crime 
the senate judiciary committee is conducting hearings on the 
proposals and the house could vote on one or more of the measures 
after it returns in september from its august recess 
the high court on june 21 ruled that texas improperly prosecuted 
a man who burned the flag at a protest during the republican 
national convention in dallas in 1984 the ruling apparently 
invalidated flag desecration laws of 48 states and the federal 
government 
other members of the aba task force are barbara black dean of 
columbia university law school warren christopher deputy 
secretary of state under former president carter erwin griswold 
former dean of harvard law school and solicitor general in the 
nixon administration prof gerald gunther of stanford university 
law school robert mckay former dean of new york univrsity law 
school earl silbert a us attorney appointed by nixon and cyrus 
vance former secretary of state under carter 
in a separate development griswold and norman dorsen president 
of the american civil liberties union announced the formation of a 
20member committee opposed to the amendment charles fried a 
professor of law at harvard who was solicitor general in the reagan 
administration is cochairman with them 
the first amendment embodies this nations strong commitment 
to free expression the committee said in a statement it has 
stood for nearly 200 years as a guardian against government 
censorship or limitation of vigorous public debate we disagree 
with any effort to restrict the first amendment by constitutional 
amendment 
griswold said at a news conference that he is also opposed to 
efforts to overturn the courts decision by adopting a statute 
because he does not believe one could be enacted that would 
withstand consttitutional challenges in court 
other members of the committee called the emergency committee 
to defend the first amendment include derek bok president of 
harvard university benjamin civiletti attorney general in the 
carter administration william t coleman jr secretary of 
transportation in the nixon administration lloyd n cutler white 
house counsel in the carter administration hanna h gray

relief flooded over the family of 
american hostage joseph cicippio this afternoon as word came that 
an execution order already given two reprieves had been suspended 
by his kidnappers in lebanon 
this gives them much more time to get together and get this 
thing worked out said thomas cicippio brother of the hostage 
outside his home where family members had gathered when the 
execution order was announced 
this is what we were looking forward to thomas cicippio 
said of course we are all very happy 
the suspension of the execution came after a fourhour reprieve 
was granted this morning following a 48hour reprieve on tuesday 
this means that perhaps there is something in the making 
maybe to our liking and they need a little more time to resolve 
whatever is going on thomas cicippio said when the fourhour 
reprieve was announced 
the cicippio family then went to nearby holy savior catholic 
church where hourly masses were held today for all the hostages as 
the fate of the pennsylvania native remained in the balance 
thomas cicippio expressed hope that iran and its new president 
hashemi rafsanjani were behind the reprieves 
i have a lot of faith in rafsanjani thomas cicippio said 
i fully believe that rafsanjani and iran holds the key to the 
hostage issue 
he said he believes rafsanjani understands resolution of the 
crisis could improve relations between iran and other countries 
when the family first heard audio tapes of the hostages 
recorded plea with israel to release a moslem cleric it holds the 
hostages son david 27 couldnt believe it was cicippio but 
when the video was added and the tape replayed on television he 
was convinced 
its the first time ive heard his voice in three years i 
cant explain how i feel right now said david cicippio 
both son and brother said it was obvious cicippio was reading 
from a prepared text 
thomas cicippio has been keeping track of the captivity of all 
american hostages on signs in his front yard 
on wednesday night he walked across his rainsoaked lawn 
ignoring the clattering cameras of the media and silently added 
another day 
the totals edward tracy 1018 tom sutherland 1517 us 
marine lt col william higgins 534 joseph cicippio 1057 
robert pohill alann steen and jesse turner 923 terry anderson 
1602 and frank reed 1060 
back inside the cicippio home he spoke of the strain the family 
has faced as they await news of joseph cicippio whose captors the 
revolutionary justice organization had threatened to kill him at 
11 am edt today 
his kidnappers extended the deadline today to 3 pm edt after 
joseph cicippio appealed for the immediate release of a shiite 
moslem cleric held in israel 
cicippios appeal and the announcement of the reprieve were made 
in a videotape released to a western news agency in beirut by the 
revolutionary justice organization 
the death threat orginally set for tuesday is in retaliation 
for israels refusal to free sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite 
moslem religious leader kidnapped by israeli commandos last week 
its been hectic thomas cicippio said late wednesday but 
today will be the most hectic day of all 
family members had come and gone leaving cicippio alone with 
his wife frances and joseph cicippios lebanese brotherinlaw 
sami ghandour 23 in the family den 
after watching the television news which featured them they 
talked about how joseph cicippio 58 left his home in this 
philadelphia suburb to work abroad how he met his lebanese wife 
elham and how much he loved his work as acting comptroller at the 
american university of beirut 
he was kidnapped from the campus sept 12 1986 
joe never really felt he was in too much danger he always 
felt safe in that he worked at the american university of beirut 
he just enjoyed being there thomas cicippio said

declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution 
with an initiative said the 14line arabic statement 
it demanded that israel release sheik abdul karim obeid a 
shiite moslem cleric kidnapped friday by israeli commandos as well 
as palestinian and lebanese guerrillas held in israel lists of 
them are to be prepared later and presented to the red cross it 
said 
previously the group had only demanded freedom for obeid and 
two companions seized with him 
acceptance should be announced within days otherwise the 
initiative will be considered canceled said the handwritten 
message it did not say if the death sentence would then be 
restored 
earlier today israel said it would not free obeid until israeli 
soldiers and foreigners held in lebanon are freed 
that was in response to the earlier revolutionary justice 
message which included a videotape on which cicippio reading a 
statement appealing for freedom for obeid 
the group has put off the death order three times since tuesday 
earlier today the white house said president bush had not 
decided whether to take military action if cicippio was killed 
us warships were reported moving toward the mediterranean but 
the pentagon said today the moves were nothing unusual 
a shiite moslem leader threatened a ruthless reprisal in the 
event of a us attack 
un envoy marrack goulding was in lebanon searching for the 
body of us marine lt col william r higgins goulding told 
abcs good morning america that some people told him higgins 
may still be alive 
a shiite moslem group claimed it killed higgins on monday to 
avenge israels refusal to release obeid 
i appeal to each person having honor who can move to release 
sheik abdul karim obeid dont be late because they the 
captors are very serious said the statement cicippio on the 
videotape released earlier today 
cicippio with a bushy beard was shown from the waist up he 
was wearing eyeglasses and a blue track suit and looked haggard and 
distressed the statements poor english suggested his captors 
wrote it 
so to help me move i demand from the american people oblige 
israel to release sheik abdul karim obeid immediately because his 
kidnapping is not human cicippio said reading slowly 
we the american people are always the victims of israels 
politics and president bush has not helped to free us 
cicippio choked with emotion ended the statement with a 
message for his lebanese wife elham 
goodbye my wife if you dont hear my voice and see my face 
again i want you to look after yourself and dont be sad and always 
remember me 
the kidnappers handwritten statement accompanying the video 
said in arabic in response to cicippios request to delay the 
execution until 10 pm in the hope that his appeal would be 
fruitful and useful it has been decided to grant a delay in the 
new deadline 
a shiite source noted that revolutionary justice has threatened 
to kill hostages in the past but is not known to have carried out 
the threats 
israel has offered to trade obeid for three israeli soldiers and 
foreign hostages in lebanon the proiranian hezbollah of which 
obeid is reputed to be a member rejected a swap 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for factions holding 
most of the 16 foreign hostages in lebanon the captives include 
eight americans 
yossi ben aharon a senior aide to israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir today said israel was not changing its policy on 
obeid we took this gentleman for purpose of release of our three 
prisoners and this remains the objective he said 
cicippio 58 of norristown pa was acting comptroller of the 
american university of beirut when he was abducted sept 12 1986 
the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
earlier today un envoy marrack goulding held a closeddoor 
session in beirut with sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
hezbollahs spiritual guide 
in south beirut where most of the hostages are believed held 
sheik abbas mousawi a senior hezbollah leader said his groups 
response would be ruthless if the united states took military 
action 
president bush must think a million times before embarking on 
such a reckless adventure i dont think he has forgotten the 
truckbombing of the american marine base at beirut airport 
mousawi said referring to the 1983 attack that killed 241 us 
servicemen at a military base in lebanon 
pentagon officials said the uss belknap flagship of the us 
6th fleet and the fleet commander canceled a visit to the soviet 
city of sevastopol in case bush needs them but that a military 
strike was unlikely the aircraft carrier america cut short a visit 
to singapore and headed to the mediterranean 
goulding interviewed by telephone by abc said he had met two 
shiite leaders and the charge daffairs of the iranian embassy 
today 
some of them have told me that col higgins is probably dead 
others have said to me they think he may still be alive and i pray 
to god the latter group is right he said 
let me make clear that my mission is not confined to col 
higgins only he added but im also here to say whether the 
un can do anything to get under control the hostage crisis

a federal judge ruled thursday that four 6th 
century mosaics purchased by a suburban indianapolis art dealer are 
the property of the greek orthodox church of cyprus 
us district judge james e noland said in his ruling that peg 
goldberg never obtained good title to the mosaics and has no right 
to possess them 
the two plaintiffs the republic of cyprus and the autocephalous 
greekorthodox church of cyprus have made a proper showing in 
all respects for the return of the mosaics noland said 
noland ruled that under the circumstances of the case ms 
goldberg must return the mosaics but will not have to pay any 
monetary damages 
ms goldberg purchased the mosaics in july 1988 after learning 
of them in a trip to amsterdam and viewing them in a swiss airport 
she said she had no immediate comment on the ruling but would 
issue a statement later in the day 
the seller was aydin dikman a turk living in germany who 
claimed he was a former archaeologist for the turkish republic of

a new study indicates a drug called deprenyl 
delays serious symptoms of parkinsons disease and allows patients 
to work and function twice as long as people not taking it 
in a study to be published friday in the journal science dr j 
william langston of the california parkinsons foundation reported 
that patients with early symptoms of parkinsons who were treated 
with deprenyl postponed progression of the neurological disease for 
an average of almost eight months 
it seemed to slow the rate of symptom progression by about 
half and doubled the time before they needed treatment langston 
said in a telephone interview if the findings are verified by 
later studies he said it suggests that we are tapping into the 
basic mechanism that causes parkinsons 
parkinsons is a brain disease marked by a progressive loss of 
brain cells the symptoms include palsy a shuffling gait a fixed 
expression with unblinking eyes and sometimes emotional 
instability it affects about one person in 50 and strikes 
patients most frequently in their 50s and 60s 
the cause of the disease which affects about 500000 americans 
is unknown and it is not curable 
progression of parkinsons can be slowed with a drug called 
levodopa or ldopa but this drug can have serious side effects 
and it loses its effectiveness over time 
langston said his study was conducted to determine if deprenyl 
could slow the progress of the disease and thus give patients more 
time before they were forced to start taking ldopa 
the study involved 54 patients all of whom were evaluated by 
tests to be at approximately the same early stage of parkinsons 
half of the patients were treated with deprenyl and half with a 
placebo or sugar pill 
on average those patients receiving the placebo required ldopa 
therapy within 312 days but those taking deprenyl did not require 
ldopa for an average of 548 days 
this means said langston that serious symptoms of the disease 
as evaluated by five different assessment methods were delayed 
for more than 33 weeks on average 
overall there was about a 50 percent decline in the rate of 
progression said the researcher he said this translates into 
maintaining a quality of life that could allow patients to work and 
function longer 
dr erwin montgomery a professor of neurology at washington 
university in st louis who treats parkinsons patients said the 
study is of very major significance 
reducing the onset of symptoms has a tremendous effect he 
said this translates into people being employed longer this can 
have a great importance in their lives 
the precise effect of deprenyl on brain tissue cannot be 
determined without an autopsy langston said but if later studies 
show that the drug can actually protect brain cells that usually 
die in parkinsons then the findings may be a step toward finding a 
cure 
if we have altered the course of cell death in parkinsons and 
slowed it down it suggests that we are tapping into the basic 
mechanism that is causing those cells to die said langston 
thats a very exciting clue of the possible cause 
deprenyl manufactured by bolar pharmaceuticals co of copiague 
ny is approved for use with ldopa but langston said he used 
the drug alone as a clinical trail approved by the food and drug 
administration the drug will be sold starting in september under 
the brand name eldepryl 
langstons coauthor in the study was dr james w tetrud also 
of the california parkinsons foundation science which published 
the study is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

israel said thursday it will hold a kidnapped 
shiite moslem cleric until israeli soldiers are traded for him 
despite threats to american hostages in lebanon 
we still stick to our position that we are ready to exchange 
kidnap victims and hostages yossi ahimeir spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir told the associated press 
our goal is to rescue save our people in lebanon in the hands 
of several organizations there of course we are ready to make 
exchanges of hostages 
israel has offered to trade sheik abdul karim obeid and other 
lebanese shiite prisoners for three soldiers held in lebanon and 
the western hostages who include eight americans 
commandos abducted obeid from his home in south lebanon on july 
28 israel says he planned guerrilla raids and directed the 
kidnapping of lt co william r higgins a us marine serving 
with un peacekeepers in february 1988 
higgins captors said they hanged him monday in retaliation for 
the abduction of obeid a spiritual leader of hezbollah the 
proiranian group believed to be behind the kidnapings 
several hours later another group of kidnappers said they would 
kill american hostage joseph cicippio 58 unless obeid was 
released after two extensions of the deadline the death threat to 
cicippio was suspended on thursday in connection with several new 
demands on israel 
the kidnappers demanded the release of obeid as well as 
palestinian and lebanese guerrillas held in israel the group said 
it would provide a list of names of all the captives it wants 
released to the red cross 
ahimeir reported all kinds of consultations within the 
government about the hostage crisis 
yossi ben aharon a top aide to shamir said israel was in 
constant touch with the us government but he would not say 
whether shamir had talked by telephone with president bush 
the foreign ministry summoned the ambassadors of west germany 
italy and britain whose citizens are among the hostages in 
lebanon and also the japanese envoy 
israel radio said the japanese ambassador was called in because 
japan was involved in contacts with iran the radio gave no details 
and ministry officials could not be reached for comment 
italian ambassador alberto leoncini bartoli asked later whether 
his government was in touch with iran replied no i only know 
that through the diplomatic channels there have been initiatives 
he said other countries in the region were involved in these 
contacts but to the best of my knowledge there has been no 
response 
my government has made approaches through diplomatic channels 
to iran among other countries in the region to my knowledge there 
has been no response to these approaches yet 
aharon said israel would not change its position on obeid 
we took this gentleman for the purpose of releasing of our 
three prisoners and this remains the objective he said 
higgins captors released a poorquality videotape of a man who 
appeared to be the marine colonel hanging from a gallows there was 
no way of telling when the tape was made conflicting reports have 
arisen about when he was killed 
a defense ministry statement said obeid told interrogators he 
believed higgins was alive last week but quoted him as saying his 
evidence was hearsay 
the statement said israel continued to believe higgins was 
killed late last year officials said they might give obeid to a 
liedetector test to determine what he knew about the american 
officer

the government said thursday that its chief 
economic forecasting gauge declined in june for the fourth time in 
five months renewing concerns that the longest economic expansion 
in peacetime history may be nearing an end 
the commerce departments index of leading economic indicators 
edged down 01 percent in june following a may decline of 13 
percent which had been the steepest drop in 19 months 
the leading index still has not flashed the traditional signal 
of an impending recession which is three consecutive monthly 
declines decreases in february march may and june were broken up 
by a 06 percent rise in april 
but many economists cautioned that the threestraight rule is 
not infallible the steep 198182 recession had actually begun 
before the index recorded its third consecutive decline 
some analysts said they believed the economy is headed for a 
downturn based on the weakness already shown in the leading index 
and various other business barometers 
we are flirting with a mild recession said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co he predicted that economic growth 
would decline for two consecutive quarters beginning in the first 
three months of 1990 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch said he 
believed the 6year expansion has already ended and economic 
output will be contracting in both the current julyseptember 
quarter and the final quarter of this year 
but david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said the 
country should be able to skate by a period of very sluggish growth 
without an actual downturn although he cautioned its time to 
cross your fingers 
at the white house the administration remained optimistic of 
reaching its target for overall economic growth of 29 percent this 
year as measured by the gnp although officials said growth would 
be lower than in 1987 and 1988 
the weakness in the leading indicators over recent months is 
consistent with our view that economic growth is likely to remain 
relatively soft over the second half of 1989 said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the gnp the countrys total output of goods and services grew 
at a lackluster annual rate of 17 percent in the justcompleted 
apriljune quarter the slowest growth rate in almost three years 
economists who believe production will keep expanding in the 
last half of the year base their optimism on the fact that the 
federal reserve board switched from driving interest rates higher 
as a way of fighting inflation to easing credit starting in june 
in order to keep the economy expanding 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist of the us chamber 
of commerce said the debate over whether the economy would 
actually topple into a recession missed the point that the feds 
yearlong effort to slow economic growth had already produced 
unacceptable casualties 
he said that the slower growth even without a recession would 
translate into an extra 500000 americans without jobs and 50 
billion added to the budget deficit next year 
the economy is struggling and will continue to struggle as a 
direct consequence of the federal reserve boards past tight 
monetary policy hunter said 
in another report showing general weakness the labor department 
said thursday that productivity of american workers edged up a 
minuscule 02 percent in the apriljune quarter after having fallen 
by 13 percent in the first three months of the year 
the sluggish growth in productivity defined as output per hour 
of work was accompanied by rising employment costs unit labor 
costs rose at an annual rate of 52 percent in the second quarter 
after an even faster 62 percent rate of increase in the second 
quarter 
economists said this jump in labor costs meant that inflationary 
pressures would not abate quickly even though energy and food 
costs have moderated 
the 01 percent drop in the june leading index reflected 
widespread weakness with seven of 11 components declining 
the biggest negative impact came from drop in raw material 
prices while this is an indication of lessening inflation 
pressures it also can mean less demand which is viewed as a 
negative by the forecasting gauge 
other negative forces in june were a jump in unemployment 
claims a fall in building permits a speedup in business delivery 
times also viewed as a sign of falling demand a decline in the 
length of the average work week a drop in orders for consumer 
goods and a smaller backlog of unfilled orders for manufactured 
goods 
four indicators showed strength in june the biggest plus factor 
was a rise in stock prices followed by higher consumer confidence 
faster growth of the money supply and an increase in plant and 
equipment orders 
the various changes left the leading index at 1435 percent of 
its 1982 base of 100

national transportation safety board members 
on thursday condemned the public broadcast of a cockpit voice 
recording from an airliner crash as lurid entertainment and a 
threat to the boards work 
the board voted 50 to express regret at an order by a texas 
judge that led to release this week of a tape from a delta air 
lines crash in dallas last august that killed 14 people 
the boards vote indicated support for federal aviation 
administration and air line pilots association calls for a law that 
would bar release of automatically recorded audio tapes recovered 
from crash scenes the board however did not propose specific 
legislation 
the law already prohibits the safety board itself from publicly 
releasing the 30minute loop audio tapes which pick up sounds from 
microphones in airliner cockpits the board had turned over a copy 
of the delta tape to the texas court as evidence in lawsuits 
resulting from the crash 
delta appealed to the court not to release the tape but the 
judge granted pleas from the plaintiffs and news media for them to 
be played 
after each crash the board by law makes a transcript and 
releases a printed version only of portions relevant to its 
investigation 
pilot communications with air traffic controllers are regularly 
available to media but faa spokesman fred farrar said he can 
recall no previous instance where sounds from a cockpit recorder 
were aired publicly 
the delta tape played in radio and television news reports 
around the country included sounds of the pilots of delta flight 
1141 joking about politics and airplane crashes before the plane 
crashed on takeoff it also includes screams just before the crash 
the crew and more than 90 passengers survived 
the ntsb which expects to conclude its investigation of the 
dallas crash sept 26 said in a resolution we believe that 
transportation safety is better served by maintaining strict 
confidentiality of the actual audio recording 
the board said it opposed the tapes public release or any 
other actions which might inhibit effective communication between 
crew members or which might diminish its utility in the prevention 
of accidents and the saving of lives 
board member john lauber said the recording is designed to be 
used only in safety investigations and certainly not for the 
lurid entertainment of the public 
ntsb member jim burnett said cockpit tapes are painful things 
to listen to and why anyone would entertain the idea of making 
either entertainment or drama out of them i dont know 
the board deleted from a draft version of its statement language 
that would have condemned the disabling of voice recorders by air 
crews lauber said members oppose any tampering with the recorders 
which is illegal but wanted to focus the statement on the 
importance of the recorders in safety investigations 
the pilots union withdrew wednesday a threat to order its 41000 
members to disable the recorders alpa president henry a duffy 
said he was confident that congress would correct the problem

the white house today called the suspension of 
the death threat against hostage joseph cicippio an encouraging 
and hopeful development but said it still doesnt meet us 
concerns for release of all the hostages 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater issued a short written 
reaction about 45 minutes after the news from lebanon that the 
terrorists were holding off their execution threat 
fitzwater said we regard this as an encouraging and hopeful 
development but it still does not answer our continuing concern 
for release of all hostages we urge that all parties in the region 
use whatever influence they have to end the tragedy of hostage 
taking and to release those remaining in captivity and we express 
our appreciation to all those who have been thus far trying to 
help 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
if it is true it is a positive development that we welcome 
bush is pleased but still concerned fitzwater said adding 
that the white house had no independent confirmation of the actions 
asked if ships would be recalled from the region he said i 
urge everyone to keep in mind especially in regard to the ships 
that we stil have a serious problem in the middle east we still 
have hostages and that we will review the situation but i would 
not expect any quick changes in our situation 
he said bush had talked to a dozen world leaders in the past two 
or three days including those from most of the countries in the 
middle east 
asked if bush had sensed the death threat would be suspended he 
replied i dont think we had any signals from any of the heads 
of state 
we continue to press for the release of all the hostages he 
said 
terrorists first gave cicippio a fourhour reprieve in their 
deadline to kill him then announced 45 minutes before the new 
deadline that they had suspended his execution 
the latest statement from the kidnappers was delivered to a 
western news agency in beirut along with an instant photograph of 
cicippio looking into the camera with the trace of a smile on his 
face 
out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states 
with whom america pleaded to mediate and stop the execution we 
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution 
with an initiative said the 14line arabic statement 
it demanded that israel release sheik abdul karim obeid a 
shiite moslem cleric kidnapped friday by israeli commandos as well 
as palestinian and lebanese guerrillas held in israel lists of 
them are to be prepared later and presented to the red cross it 
said 
previously the group had only demanded freedom for obeid and 
two companions seized with him 
acceptance should be announced within days otherwise the 
initiative will be considered canceled said the handwritten 
message it did not say if the death sentence would then be 
restored 
before that announcement fitzwater had given a guarded reaction 
to developments in the troubled region 
its very difficult to express very much optimism when they 
still have one hostage whose life is under threat and others who 
are in captivity with no immediate prospects for relief 
fitzwater said before the terrorists announced they had suspended 
their deadline for executing cicippio 
asked about reports that bush had decided to take military 
action if cicippio were killed fitzwater said no final decision 
has been made 
obviously that would be a very grave situation and we would be 
prepared to deal with it as best we could and i would not preclude 
any option one way or another he said 
he said bush has made preliminary decisions of every 
kind 
you may be assured that all of the foundation planning has 
been done and consideration of every scenario has been taken and we 
will pursue this to the best of our ability fitzwater said but 
he emphasized the decisions not made til the decision is 
made 
asked if the united states would hold iran responsible if 
cicippio were killed he replied we dont have definitive 
information on who is holding the hostages or who is responsible 
and therefore we cant offer judgments at this point 
however another administration official said wednesday that a 
us message relayed to iran earlier through two channels had said 
in substance if anything happens to the hostages we hold you 
responsible that source spoke on condition of anonymity 
fitzwater said the bush administration was still pursuing every 
diplomatic channel to defuse the crisis 
clearly the winds are swirling in the region in terms of 
trying to secure their release and trying to influence the 
hezbollah and others who might hold these prisoners said 
fitzwater 
he reiterated that the president had no plans to hold a special 
strategy session with military and diplomatic advisers today as he 
had in previous days since the reported execution on monday of 
marine lt col william higgins 
a pentagon spokesman said there had not been any unusual changes 
in the deployment of the 6th fleet ships in the mediterranean 
today all units are conducting routine operations said lt 
col mel sunden the estimated 25 us vessels deployed in the 
region is usually what we have there he said 
the terrorists released a videotape of cicippio asking israel to 
save him by releasing the moslem cleric 
the deadline extension to 3 pm edt was announced in a 
statement delivered to a western news agency in beirut along with 
the 90second videotaped appeal by cicippio 
i appeal to each person having honor who can move to release 
sheik abdul karim obeid dont be late because they the 
captors are very serious said cicippio who appeared 
haggard and distressed 
so to help me move i demand from the american people 
oblige israel to release obeid immediately because his 
kidnapping is not human 
the presidential spokesman said we of course do not have any 
definitive knowledge as to why they extended the deadline we hope 
its because they have been swayed by world opinion and pressure 
from others that this was not appropriate behavior 
in one way its simply a testament to the cruelty of the 
situation that you keep having these deadlines extended there 
shouldnt be any deadlines at all he said 
fitzwater asked whether the united states was considering 
seeking the extradition of obeid from israel for possible 
involvement in the kidnapping of higgins said the justice 
department i am told is looking into the case 
a federal law enforcement source asking not to be identified 
told the associated press the fbi is investigating the murder of 
higgins as a possible violation of a 1986 antiterrorist act 
attorney general richard thornburgh declined comment on whether 
he would seek to extradite obeid

a contagious ailment called hand foot and mouth 
disease that is easily transmitted in schools and daycare centers 
is suddenly on the rise with outbreaks among youngsters and their 
families across the east and scattered in the midwest and west 
health officials say 
the information weve had definitely shows a picture of 
largescale activity this year when compared with previous years 
said mark pallansch of the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta 
hand foot and mouth disease is usually not dangerous although 
it is quite contagious said dr michael katz head of pediatrics 
at columbia presbyterian medical center in new york but the 
illness itself only appears in some individuals he said in a 
telephone interview thursday 
the illness is caused by a strain of coxsackie virus one of 
about 65 socalled enteroviruses that are a common source of 
infection hand foot and mouth disease is characterized by sores 
in the mouth and blisters on the hands and feet 
there is no treatment and the condition usually disappears 
within a week pallansch said it can sometimes be more dangerous 
in newborns or in a fetus exposed to it in the womb he said 
the risk of harm to fetuses is small said katz it is better 
for a pregnant woman not to be infected with anything said katz 
but coxsackie virus is not known to cause serious problems 
pallansch said precise estimates of the prevalence of the 
disease are not possible because doctors are not required to 
report it to their health departments 
he said the centers for disease control began receiving calls 
from the southeast in february and that the disease has spread 
since then it has moved up the east coast at least as far as 
boston through the summer he said scattered reports have come 
in from the midwest utah and california he added 
certainly this summer weve received many more calls than the 
summer before so its my impression its quite common at the 
moment said dr virginia dato of the new jersey department of 
health 
she said infectious agents like coxsackie virus tend to become 
more common every two to five years a child who has had hand foot 
and mouth disease is immune from future infection with the strain 
of virus that caused it but may get the disease again from a 
different strain of virus 
the only method of preventing the spread of coxsackie virus 
infections is frequent hand washing pallansch said dirty diapers 
also carry the virus accounting for the rapid spread of the 
disease in daycare centers he said 
young children with hand foot and mouth disease can become 
dehydrated when the stinging sores in their mouths lead them to 
refuse fluids pallansch said parents should be sure that infected 
children are getting enough fluids he said 
swimming pools are an important means of transmission during the 
summer said katz but because the disease is usually mild he did 
not recommend keeping children out of the pool when the disease is 
in the neighborhood i think thats cruel and unusual 
punishment he said 
enteroviruses usually cause only a mild upper respiratory 
typical summercold type illness pallansch said 
it is assumed that coxsackie virus can cause meningitis a more 
serious infection of membranes around the brain and spinal cord 
but progression of hand foot and mouth disease to meningitis is 
unlikely except in very rare instances pallansch said and that 
form of meningitis itself is normally not too severe said katz

prime minister czeslaw kiszczak on 
thursday offered a solidarity senator a cabinet position in his new 
government but the senator turned him down an opposition 
spokesman said 
kiszczak proposed the top post in the ministry of health to dr 
zofia kuratowska who is also a senior adviser to solidarity on 
health policy the spokesman said 
state tv later reported the offer but not the refusal 
ms kuratowska refused kiszczaks offer and told him that 
lawmakers belonging to the independent trade union movement did not 
plan to enter the government said grzegorz jaszunski who is also 
ms kuratowskas husband 
ms kuratowska appeared to be the first opposition lawmaker to 
be approached to enter the government since kiszczak was elected 
wednesday by the sejm the larger chamber of the national assembly 
efforts to reach opposition floor leaders in the sejm to learn 
of any further offers were unsuccessful 
in his acceptance speech wednesday kiszczak polands interior 
minister for the past eight years said he hoped to attract 
opposition members to his government and that he believed he could 
name the cabinet in about two weeks 
communist leaders would like some opposition legislators to join 
the government to share some of the responsibility for reform 
programs but solidarity says it cannot enter the government while 
the communist party holds a monopoly on power 
ms kuratowska is a leading critic of state medical policy that 
has led to overcrowded hospitals a shortage of medicine and a 
flight of poorly paid medical personnel to the west she favors 
establishment of small clinics to put patients in closer contact 
with doctors 
jaszunski said she informed solidarity floor leaders in the 
national assembly of her decision 
the sejm must approve the cabinet the communistcoalition holds 
a 299161 majority the solidaritydominated senate the smaller 
chamber of the national assembly does not vote on the government 
also thursday the main opposition daily protested the 
kiszczaks election as prime minister blaming him in part for a 
severe economic crisis 
society does not understand why someone who represents the 
party which is responsible for this situation has to take the lead 
of a cabinet that wants to call itself a government of national 
rescue the opposition gazeta wybcorcza newspaper said 
there was no immediate comment from lech walesa or other 
solidarity leaders 
official newspapers did not comment on the choice of the 
nations top policeman as the new head of government and instead 
focused on food price increases that took effect this week as part 
of marketoriented reform 
the official communist party newspaper trybuna ludu and the 
government daily rzeczpospolita carried only official news agency 
reports of the kiszczaks election without commentary 
the election of kiszczak completes a top level political 
reshuffle that began with the election of gen wojciech jaruzelski 
to the newly strengthened post of president on july 19 and the 
naming of outgoing prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski as first 
secretary of the communist party july 29

the productivity of american workers increased 
modestly in the second quarter of the year after declining in the 
first the government said thursday in a report that also showed 
workers got significant pay hikes but lost buying power because of 
inflation 
the labor department said nonfarm productivity rose at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 02 percent in the apriljune 
period as output climbed 17 percent and hours worked by just 15 
percent 
that was an improvement over the revised 13 percent decline in 
nonfarm productivity at an annual rate reported for the first 
three months of the year 
unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 52 percent in the 
second quarter the government said down from a 62 percent gain 
in the first three months of the year but still a significant 
increase that ultimately translates into higher prices 
merrill lynchs bruce steinberg said persistent wage gains would 
limit overall inflation declines 
i think the inflation environment is looking somewhat better 
than it had been but this is a cautionary note he said 
despite the wage gains hourly compensation rose at a 55 
percent annual rate in the apriljune quarter american workers 
still saw their buying power erode real wages compensation gains 
minus the toll of consumer inflation fell at an annual rate of 
09 percent in the second quarter the government said 
in some ways were in the worst of both worlds now said 
chief economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill the worker is 
seeing wages go up less than inflation and the manufacturer is 
seeing employment costs going up more than prices because of wage 
gains and the explosion of fringe benefit costs 
analysts said the declines or only modest productivity gains in 
recent quarters were consistent with an economy nearing the end of 
an expansion but said they were not necessarily a harbinger of 
recession 
improved productivity the output per hour of all workers is 
considered vital to sustaining economic growth at times of 
nearfull employment 
with the current slowdown in the economy productivity gains or 
declines also will have a large effect on business profits because 
uncertainty about the economy has left many businesses 
particularly in manufacturing reluctant to hire new workers as a 
means of improving output 
the report issued thursday was based on preliminary data that 
generally are revised in a more comprehensive report issued a month 
later 
manufacturing workers posted a significant gain in productivity 
in the second quarter 24 percent at an annual rate but that 
figure was influenced by a 03 percent drop in total hours worked 
another sign of the slowing economy 
inflations toll was even more pronounced on manufacturing 
workers whose hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 25 
percent in the second quarter while consumer inflation increased 
more than 6 percent meaning real wages paid manufacturing workers 
fell at an annual rate of 37 percent in the latest quarter 
the report also included revised productivity data for the years 
1986 through 1988 showing productivity growth was slightly better 
than originally believed rising by 2 percent in 1986 11 percent 
in 1987 and 21 percent in 1988 earlier data had put the increases 
in those years at 20 percent 08 percent and 15 percent 
respectively 
the bush administration which had been criticized for using 
unrealistic productivity estimates for its economic forecasts took 
satisfaction in the upward revision 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said that the administration was quite pleased that 
nonfarm productivity growth for 198688 was revised to a rate 
almost exactly in line with our current thinking about the 
economys long run growth potential

buried beneath the bigticket strategic 
weapons systems in the senates military authorization bill are a 
series of pay provisions that are stirring plenty of controversy on 
their own 
the senate overwhelmingly approved a 295 billion defense 
package wednesday that largely endorses president bushs star wars 
program the b2 stealth bomber and intercontinental ballistic 
missiles 
the measure also allows the defense and energy departments to 
pay 525 scientists and engineers more money than the vice president 
and gives law enforcement agents the final option of shooting down 
an aircraft suspected of transporting drugs 
by thursday house republicans and democrats alike were casting 
a wary eye on the pay provisions while an association of government 
executives expressed its outrage 
i dont think the house is willing to increase the pay of 
those affected by the legislation said rep william dickinson of 
alabama ranking republican on the armed services committee 
under the provision the defense department could raise the pay 
of 500 scientists and engineers and the energy department could 
boost the salaries of 25 employees up to 150 percent of the amount 
they would normally be paid under the current federal pay system 
the 525 employees could end up with 134250 per year more than 
the vice president who receives 110000 annually and members of 
congress and cabinet officers who get 89500 
the provisions objective is to retain firstclass scientists 
and engineers who might otherwise leave government for the private 
sector but in a congress still hurting from the rancorous debate 
earlier this year over pay raises for members the provision seems 
sure to face a tough road when house and senate members meet in 
conference in early september to craft a final defense blueprint 
i do not believe the house will accept that unless relief is 
given to members congress has to deal with the whole issue said 
dickinson who as the no 1 republican on the armed services panel 
will likely serve on the conference 
i dont see that having a chance to survive the conference 
said rep ronald dellums dcalif the chairman of the armed 
services subcommittee on research and development and a likely 
house conferee 
unlike the senate bill the house version of military spending 
legislation has no such pay provisions 
the senate package also allows defense secretary dick cheney to 
hire 1000 retired officers and the energy department 250 who 
could still draw full pensions 
the pentagon also would be authorized to set up four pilot 
programs under which the department could adjust rank and pay of a 
total of 100000 civilian employees giving the department a 
flexibility that current law forbids 
individuals could receive pay increases as long as total payroll 
costs did not change 
other government departments could operate a total of six such 
programs the office of personnel management would have to approve 
the provisions of these programs 
sen john glenn dohio in opposing some of the pay provisions 
during senate debate on the bill said late tuesday night that if 
enacted the measure will begin the dismantlement of the civil 
service as we know it 
the senior executives association in a statement released 
thursday called the legislation an illconceived poisonous stew 
that will sicken the federal executive corps and federal personnel 
management 
the organization represents about 7200 senior executives in the 
government 
the other defense measure that had garnered criticism and faces 
a tough fight in conference is a provision sponsored by sen mitch 
mcconnell rky that gives law enforcement agents the right to 
shoot down a plane suspected of carrying contraband if the plane 
refuses to land despite warning shoots 
the aircraft owners and pilots association is shocked at 
senator mcconnells absurd proposal to shoot down general aviation 
aircraft said patricia weil a spokeswoman for the group which 
represents operators of 290000 small planes 
to suggest that suspected aircraft be shot down is 
irresponsible impractical and could endanger the lives of innocent 
people ms weil said 
sen sam nunn dga and the chairman of the armed services 
panel opposed the measure and glenn a former astronaut and pilot 
expressed the fear that he could be one of the innocent people 
endangered by the provision 
the senate turned aside an effort to defeat the amendment by a 
vote of 5545 and then approved the measure by voice vote

police stormed egypts largest steel plant 
during a sitdown strike killing one worker injuring 14 and 
arresting hundreds officials and newspapers said thursday 
two policemen also were reported injured in the clash wednesday 
as up to 5000 workers sat at the exit gate of the plant 18 miles 
south of the capital cairo the reports said 
the governmentowned newspaper alakhbar said 81 workers 
probably would be charged with resisting arrest blocking 
production and destruction of public property at the sprawling 
plant which employs more than 24000 people it said 596 other 
workers were being questioned 
the daily alahram newspaper in its early friday edition said 
only 497 workers had been detained it said prosecutors ordered 82 
workers jailed for 15 days while 415 others had been questioned and 
released 
due to a moslem holiday security officials were unavailable for 
comment on the clash or the strike which was called to press 
demands for higher wages and better working conditions 
but diaa tantawi board chairman of the iron and steel complex 
at helwan said the strike was not a question of wages or 
incentive payments 
he said about 60 employees blocked the exit preventing about 
3000 workers from leaving at the end of wednesdays morning shift 
they used iron bars to stop the workers from leaving 
tantawi said 
there definitely were political elements involved in the 
strike he said he refused to characterize their motives except to 
rule out moslem extremist fundamentalism often at the center of 
unrest in egypt 
the board chairman estimated the loss of a days work cost the 
company 800000 and that property damage was about 5800 
work resumed at about half capacity thursday as investigators 
toured the site to assess damage there was no sign of unrest or of 
extra security at the grounds but 10 vans filled with riotpolice 
were at a police station about half a mile away 
the helwan complex employs 24600 workers tantawi said it was 
a showpiece of soviet aid to egypt during the time of the late 
socialist president gamal abdel nasser who led the coup that ended 
the egyptian monarchy in 1952 
the two alleged strike leaders who escaped were board members 
elected under a nasserera law that sets aside half the seats on 
the board of a public company for workers 
previous strikes and demonstrations at other staterun 
industries allegedly involved members of leftist political parties 
and communists 
strikes and demonstrations are banned under an emergency law in 
force since oct 7 1981 a day after moslem extremists 
assassinated anwar sadat nassers successor

it looks like a farmers worst nightmare 
fields overrun with velvet leaf cocklebur thistle and wild oats 
but its a dream come true for wendel moore who carefully 
cultivates these unlikely cash crops 
moore is the king of weeds 
people really think ive flipped my lid said moore 
chuckling through the years there have been a lot of horse 
laughs but im the one who gets the last laugh 
moore 58 operates fampj seed service with his wife and 
soninlaw he raises 60 varieties of weeds for seed on 44 acres in 
mchenry county sometimes harvesting weeds from other farmers 
fields as he travels the midwest 
much of moores crop is sold to universities and chemical 
companies for research 
we grow about 30 varieties and evaluate their response to the 
herbicides we apply said zach fore research biologist at the 
fmc corp farm in champaign county fore said moore was only one of 
three weed seed growers in the country of which he was aware 
moores fields may look ugly to other farmers but he figures 
hes helping to make farming more profitable 
where would world food production be without herbicides he 
said in a recent interview 
his adventure in weed farming began in 1976 when he bought the 
business from friends they taught him what they could and he 
picked up the rest from weed books and experience 
growing weeds may sound like childs play but moore has the 
same headaches as any other farmer perhaps more so since the 
average farmer plants only two or three crops where he must 
understand the growing habits of dozens 
there are different planting dates harvesting dates seed 
size and natural enemies said moore it presents monstrous 
problems 
and when its time to put in the crops he said i have to use 
all kinds of ingenuity 
for example moore plants an upright crop like flax so a 
lowgrowing one like bind weed has something to climb making 
harvest easier 
herbicides are out of the question on a weed farm so fields are 
likely to have more than one crop 
many weeds are harvested with a combine and the seeds 
handseparated by variety 
sulphur cinquefoil seed is as small as dust while some 
other seeds are bigger than soybeans said moore who uses a 
garbage can under the combine chute to keep the smaller seeds from 
blowing away 
black and red nightshade berries are squeezed of their juice and 
then dried in the sun to obtain the seeds moore puts other seeds 
in a garbage can and then pounds them with a baseball bat to thresh 
them from their husks 
afterward the seed is cleaned packaged and shipped all over the 
world some sell for as much as 3 an ounce 
in addition to what he grows on his farm moore combs the 
midwest looking for weeds 
once he recalled he found a field of wild proso millet in 
wisconsin persuaded the farmer to let him take it then hired a 
man with a combine to harvest the weeds he made a good buck and 
i got a lot of good seed 
moore who grew up on a mississippi farm and spent long hours in 
the sun hacking away at weeds said now its become a real 
passion

two of the frostiest spots in 
the country are trying to resolve their twoyear battle over which 
can call itself icebox of the nation 
fraser colo a mountain hamlet of 730 holds the federal 
copyright to the nickname but international falls a town on the 
canadian border with 5500 residents has challenged the claim in 
two cases before the us department of commerce patent and 
trademark office 
international falls wants the nickname to itself so it can 
promote its coldweather product testing which means more than 
300000 a year to the local economy the city also has been 
designated as the site of minnesotas coldweather resource center 
international falls has a mean temperature in january of only 
slightly above zero about 11 degrees colder than fraser but the 
yearround average is colder in fraser 
international falls has decided to offer 2000 if fraser will 
confine its use of the frosty title to colorado 
the offer is undergoing legal review so hadnt formally been 
made by thursday but fraser town manager clay brown said wednesday 
that the offer probably would be considered seriously 
the city council here voted 52 monday to pay the 2000 to help 
offset frasers court costs after discovering that it could cost 
international falls 20000 to keep up the legal battle

the air force said thursday it successfully 
completed a laboratory test for part of the star wars system 
designed to destroy enemy missiles by colliding with them 
the test the fourth in a series was conducted at the air 
forces astronautics laboratory at edwards air force base on 
tuesday 
the star wars system formally known as the strategic defense 
initiative would make use of spacebased interceptors to destroy 
hostile missiles orbiting interceptors would be launched at 
extremely high speeds and destroy targeted missiles by the force of 
impact 
tuesdays test involved technologies needed to locate enemy 
missiles and guide interceptors to destroy them 
the interceptor vehicle remained in a laboratory while it used 
sensors to target a missile on the test range said a statement 
issued at the pentagon 
the intercepter vehicle was able to detect and track the 
missiles plume and then distinguish between the plume and the hard 
body of the missile the statement said 
this ability is essential if the sbi spacebased interceptor 
is to function effectively in a ballistic missile defense system

the house ignored a veto threat by president 
bush and voted thursday to ease restrictions on public financing of 
abortions in the district of columbia halting nine straight years 
of house votes tightening control over government abortion aid 
the 238189 vote sent the measure to the senate where lawmakers 
are generally considered more sympathetic to the prochoice side 
the legislation is the first containing abortion language that 
congress has considered since the supreme court granted states the 
rights to impose new limitations on abortion last month 
thus the vote was seen by some as possessing symbolism far 
beyond the districts borders they argued that the high courts 
ruling has caught the attention of the majority of americans who 
favor the right to choose an abortion and that these voters are 
carefully watching their members of congress 
its not a turkey shoot any longer said rep les aucoin 
dore a leader of the prochoice lawmakers you cant vote 
antiabortion because you think thats the path of least 
resistance 
despite the vote aucoin conceded that the house still does not 
have a prochoice majority 
there isnt one he said but this tells you there is a 
sea change under way 
in fact the house approved a department of health and human 
services spending bill wednesday prohibiting federal aid for 
abortions unless the mothers life was threatened the provision 
which the house has renewed every year since 1976 was approved 
without debate 
bushs veto threat in a letter dated wednesday called on 
lawmakers to protect the lives of americas unborn children 
he warned that he would veto the measure if it allowed public 
money to be used for abortions other than those where the life of 
the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term 
the climactic fight on the bill occurred wednesday evening 
to the shock of members on both sides of the issue the house 
rejected 219206 an amendment sponsored by rep robert dornan 
rcalif that would have flatly prohibited the use of federal or 
district monies to perform abortions voting against the proposal 
were 179 democrats and 40 republicans while 71 democrats and 135 
republicans supported dornan 
we got enough votes to prove we have veto sustainability 
rep christopher smith rnj a leading antiabortion lawmaker 
said thursday congress can overturn a presidential veto only with 
a twothirds vote of each chamber 
the wednesday night vote was a reversal of a 222186 tally in 
favor of the same language last year according to a check of 
records by groups on both sides of the issue it was the first time 
since september 1980 that the house defeated an effort to restrict 
public financing for abortions 
with the amendments defeat language in the bill was left 
intact allowing the district to spend its own money for abortion 
and permitting federal funds for abortions in which the mothers 
life is at stake or rape or incest is involved 
currently public assistance is available in the district only 
when the mothers life is threatened 
dornan and his supporters said they lost because of misleading 
lobbying by their opponents who they said falsely told lawmakers 
arriving in the chamber to vote that the amendment would forbid 
public assistance for contraceptives 
what changed was a very deceptive effort said smith 
aucoin said his side was helped by the dornan proposals failure 
to allow an exemption for abortions involving mothers whose lives 
were in danger dornan said he omitted that exemption because he 
was forced to do so by house procedures

yasser arafat said thursday that although 
the plo disliked israels plan for elections in the occupied lands 
it would have accepted it if the plan had been a step toward 
palestinian selfdetermination 
the plo chief added that the plan was merely aimed at 
perpetuating the israeli occupation of the occupied territories 
and has now collapsed in failure 
arafat made the comments in an opening address to the fifth 
general congress of the fatah movement the main component of the 
palestine liberation organization 
the congress has drawn about 1050 delegates from throughout the 
arab world and spokesman abdul abdelrahman said that high on the 
agenda would be the hostage crisis in lebanon 
the fatah leadership on tuesday condemned the reported killing 
of us marine lt col william r higgins but blamed israel 
israeli commandos on july 28 abducted lebanese shiite leader sheik 
abdul karim obeid from his home in southern lebanon 
arafat did not mention the hostage crisis in his address 
the plo has rejected an offer by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to hold elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
and talks with elected palestinian representatives on interim 
selfrule for the 17 million arabs living there it has said no 
elections are possible under occupation and has demanded at least 
a partial israeli withdrawal 
shamir is sharply opposed to both notions 
speaking to frequent applause arafat said the plo would have 
accepted this plan if it had constituted a stage in the realization 
of the rights of the palestinian people to selfdetermination and 
freedom 
i take this opportunity to ask the american government how 
long it intends to continue ignoring the right of the palestinian 
people to selfdetermination and how many wars we will still have 
to fight to emerge from the vicious circle of blood and 
suffering he said 
the intefadeh uprising will not stop until the conclusion of 
a peace treaty and the realization of the palestinian peoples 
inalienable right to return to selfdetermination and to the 
establishment of a palestinian state with jerusalem as its 
capital 
the congress went into closed session immediately after arafat 
spoke and was due to elect half the members of a new 21member 
central committee three of the present members have been 
assassinated and two others have joined the hardline dissidents 
twice during the opening session the delegates observed a 
moments silence in memory of arafats deputy khalil al wazir 
better known as abu jihad and other martyrs abu jihad was killed 
in tunis in an israeli commando raid last year 
abu jihads widow intissar al wazir was given a standing 
ovation on entering the congress hall and is virtually certain to 
be elected to the central committee 
tunisian president zine abidine ben ali also spoke to the 
opening session claiming that the summit of the worlds seven main 
industrial countries held in paris during the bicentennial 
celebrations of the french revolution had endorsed the plo demand 
for an international conference on the middle east 
the acceptance by the seven of such a conference shows how 
israels isolation on the international scene has grown while the 
just palestinian cause has made new achievements even inside 
israel ben ali said

sleepy residents raced to bomb shelters 
thursday as syrian and christian gunners unleashed a barrage of 
shellfire on residential districts of the ravaged city killing 
three people and wounding six 
by police count 514 people have been killed and 2176 wounded 
in the 20weekold confrontation between gen michel aouns 
predominantly christian lebanese army troops and syrian soldiers 
the fighting has driven 13 million of the capitals 15 million 
residents from the city 
shell explosions and ambulance sirens echoed before the barrages 
ebbed into sporadic exchanges of gunfire across the dividing green 
line 
the few remaining civilians in this virtual ghost city emerged 
from underground shelters early in the day to inspect their 
apartments 
thousands of cars flooded the highway south of beirut which is 
the only road connecting the citys western moslem sector with the 
rest of the country 
most of those who have fled beirut returned for a short visit 
early in the day to check on their apartments and businesses after 
a night of shelling said a police spokesman who cannot be named 
by regulation 
he said it could not be determined who started the duels that 
erupted around 1 am with 155mm usmade howitzers and 130mm 
sovietdesigned artillery 
both sides targeted residential districts as well as enemy 
batteries at times blasting the city with eight shells a minute 
he said 
several shells scored direct hits on apartment buildings 
shattering walls and glass and hurling pieces of gutted furniture 
into deserted streets 
the renewed heavy shelling came two days after an arab league 
committee announced that a twomonth diplomatic effort to negotiate 
a lasting ceasefire in lebanon has failed because of differences 
with syria 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon and has 40000 troops 
in moslem areas of the country under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
aoun a maronite catholic and other christian leaders accuse 
the syrians of betraying their mandate by siding with the moslems 
christian leaders have welcomed tuesdays statement by the 
foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria because it 
explicitly accuses syria of blocking peace efforts 
king hassan ii of morocco king fahd of saudi arabia and 
algerian president chadli bendjedid were asked at an arab summit 
may 26 to find a peace settlement by november but their foreign 
ministers shuttled in vain between beirut and damascus 
iraq syrias main arab enemy called wednesday for an emergency 
arab summit to try and end the strife that has killed more than 
150000 people since lebanons civil war began in april 1975 
iraq supports the christians in lebanon and has been arming 
aouns 20000strong force 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said wednesday the bush administration is disappointed that the 
arab league has not received the necessary cooperation from all 
parties to the conflict both the lebanese and syrians to end 
immediate fighting lift blockades and address the underlying 
political issues 
we urge the arab league not to lay down its burden despite 
the enormous difficulties it has encountered she added 
the violence broke out after aoun blockaded illegal ports run by 
syrianbacked militias 
syrian and allied moslem forces retaliated by shelling and 
laying siege to the enclave that usually is home to 1 million 
christians

americas low productivity rate which has 
worried economists for years is not as bad as originally believed 
the labor department said thursday 
the department said that productivity has increased at an 
average annual rate of 18 percent over the last three years up 
from an original estimate of an average increase of 14 percent per 
year 
the 14 percent figure which reflected subpar productivity 
rates in 1987 and 1988 had analysts concerned about the countrys 
economic outlook rising living standards hinge on the ability to 
keep productivity increasing at a healthy rate 
economists had also questioned the bush administrations 
economic outlook which was based on a projection that productivity 
would grow in the years ahead at a 18 percent rate 
michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser took 
note of the labor department revisions in a statement released by 
his office 
we had been anticipating some upward revision in the 
productivity estimates and were quite pleased that nonfarm 
productivity growth for 198688 was revised to a rate almost 
exactly in line with our current thinking about the economys 
longrun growth potential he said 
the revised figures showed that nonfarm productivity increased 
by 21 percent in 1988 compared to a previous estimate of 15 
percent for 1987 the increase was put at 11 percent up from a 
previous estimate of 08 percent productivity growth in 1986 was 
unchanged at 2 percent 
some private economists however remained sceptical about the 
new figures 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
believed that the government was miscounting total economic output 
as covered by the gross national product he said this had the 
effect of inflating productivity which is defined as total output 
divided by the number of hours worked 
i think the commerce department has committed a serious error 
with their measurment of gnp evans said they have 
artificially raised real growth and this makes productivity look 
better than it is

the nuclear regulatory commission must tighten 
its controls over the shutdown of nuclear sites to assure they are 
properly decontaminated of radioactive wastes a congressional 
study concluded thursday 
the report by the general accounting office an arm of congress 
said the nrc in the past has approved the decommissioning of some 
nuclear facilities without adequate attention being paid to a 
thorough decontamination 
in two of eight cases reviewed by the gao investigators found 
that sites were allowed to be closed and the land opened for 
unrestricted use while there was still substantial radioactive 
contamination in the area 
each of the eight sites examined were locations of former 
nuclear fuel processing facilities 
at one site contamination was found to be as much as 320 times 
greater than allowed by nrc guidelines while at another site it 
was as much as four times greater although the government approved 
the facilities transfer to general use 
the gao found that in four of the eight cases licensees kept 
incomplete records on where contaminated wastes were buried on a 
site making it impossible to determine later where wastes had been 
buried at one location radioactive materials were discovered 10 
years after the nrc decommissioned the site and opened it for 
unrestricted use 
there has been no major nuclear power plant decommissioned in 
this country but the decommissioning process has concluded or is 
under way at seven smaller plants scores of research or military 
reactors as well as fuel processing plants 
the gao findings were released at a hearing of the house 
government operations subcommittee on the environment where nrc 
chairman kenneth m carr acknowledged past shortcomings in the 
agencys decommissioning program 
the gao conclusions are in line with our own conclusions 
and their report has highlighted actions we believe to be 
necessary said carr he said many of the closings approved by 
the nrc occurred years ago and decommissioning procedures that 
were once considered appropriate may no longer be so today

obviously we would very happy if the weather stayed the

temperatures and low humidity are going to complicate matters for 
firefighters

firefighters and national guardsmen struggled to hack containment 
lines around fires in the western and central parts of the state 
national guardsmen helped firefighters cut lines around the fires 
and protect scattered buildings in the boise and payette national 
forests 
in oregon army infantry troops joined the fight thursday 
against fires that have burned 85000 acres of forest east of the 
cascades 
about 650 soldiers from fort lewis wash joined 330 
firefighters on the lines around a 13300acre fire in the monument 
rock wilderness southwest of baker ore because machinery is 
barred from about 70 miles southwest of baker and three miles 
from a 13300acre fire in the monument rock wilderness because 
machinery is barred from wilderness areas the soldiers will be 
assigned to the tedious task of cutting fire lines with hand tools 
one more day of onthejob training was planned friday along 
relatively safe fire lines already established at the fire said 
us forest service spokesman steve sorseth 
a 23300acre fire on the boundary of the eagle cap wildneress 
area northwest of baker destroyed a small snowmobile hut but 
spared the lick creek guard station which is on the national 
register of historic places said bruce mcmillan wallowawhitman 
national forest spokesman 
in california where 35000 acres have been charred the weather 
was no help to crews fighting a fire thursday in the cleveland 
national forest 90 miles southeast of los angeles 
the 10300acre blaze was two miles from the eagle crag nature 
sanctuary home to spotted owls and bald eagles and was within 5 
miles of the palomar observatory said forest service spokeswoman 
rosalinda ewen 
the observatory which houses a museum gallery and telescope 
sits atop a hill and is surrounded by three smaller dwellings and 
by dry chaparral brush 
the fire had been headed toward the observatory but then turned 
away late thursday morning and didnt pose an immediate threat 
said forest service spokesman bill bruggema 
the blaze was 60 percent contained but if it reached the nature 
sanctuary the battle would be tougher because of rough terrain and 
a ban on using equipment 
the eagle crag area contains giant stands of native douglas firs 
and manzanita trees believed to be the oldest in the southwest

a group of governing party lawmakers thursday 
criticized the partys process for selecting the next prime 
minister saying the frontrunning candidate was chosen in 
backroom deals 
factions in the scandalridden liberal democratic party were 
expected to declare their support thursday for toshiki kaifu a 
former education minister who became the frontrunner wednesday to 
succeed resigning prime minister sousuke uno 
the partys largest group the takeshita faction indicated it 
will support kaifu for party president who is assured election as 
prime minister by the liberal democraticdominated lower house of 
parliament 
but members of a faction led by former finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa decided the closeddoor meetings from which kaifus 
candidancy emerged will disappoint the public a faction 
spokesman said 
this method of selecting a party president is not good for the 
party or for the people the spokesman said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
an election for party president is scheduled for tuesday but 
party officials say kaifu could be declared winner without a ballot 
if no other candidates enter before saturdays deadline 
the vote in the lower house of parliament is expected aug 10 
the upper house does not vote for prime minister 
we believe there should be at least one other candidate for 
the party presidency and will do our best to turn it into a real 
election the miyazawa spokesman said 
kaifu a 10term lower house member officially announced his 
candidacy wednesday after his factions leader toshio komoto 78 
was persuaded by other faction leaders not to run party officials 
have said the party needs a younger image for upcoming lower house 
elections 
analysts say kaifu 58 also was favored because party elders 
believe he will not threaten their own future bids for leadership 
since he has a small power base 
the conservative governing partys five major factions are 
differentiated more by personal and financial allegiances than by 
political differences 
shin kanemaru chairman of the takeshita faction indicated it 
will back kaifu but postponed an official statement of support 
kaifu is an excellent person and a suitable candidate for the 
presidency but other candidates may emerge so we want to wait to 
make a final decision the japan broadcasting corp quoted him as 
saying after a faction meeting 
uno announced his resignation after only two months in office 
because of the partys heavy losses in elections july 23 for the 
upper house of parliament uno also had come under criticism after 
allegations he kept paid mistresses 
kaifu acknowledged wednesday he received about 110000 in 
political donations in five years from the recruit co the firm at 
the center of a scandal that brought down unos predecessor noboru 
takeshita 
but he said the donations were properly reported and that he 
received no stock shares from the information and publishing 
conglomerate 
the company allegedly provided millions of dollars in political 
contributions and bargainpriced stocks to prominent people to 
obtain favors 
from 1974 to 1976 kaifu served as deputy chief cabinet 
secretary under the late prime minister takeo miki he later also 
served as education minister for two periods totaling about two 
years 
party officials have said the new party leader will serve only 
the remainder of takeshitas original term which ends oct 31 the 
party then will hold a new election

as bad as 1988 
extreme to severe fire conditions already exist in most western 
states and the situation is expected to worsen allan west a 
forest service deputy chief said at a new conference 
west said that no improvement is expected in the foreseeable 
future longrange weather forecasts indicate continuing severe 
fire conditions leaving this fire season with the potential to be 
as severe as last years 
last year was the worst fire season since 1910 with major fires 
burning through roughly onethird of yellowstone national park and 
more than 5 million acres scorched nationwide 
more than 39400 fires have been reported burning 138 million 
acres so far this year that compares with almost 61200 fires 
covering 237 million acres through the same time period last year 
west said that even though the pace of the 1988 fire season was 
almost double this years at the beginning of august the forest 
service concerns were prompted by the longrange weather forescasts 
we see no relief through the month of october in precipitation 
and temperature he said 
since sunday alone west said 66 major wildfires in idaho 
oregon california washington state and montana have swept over 
220000 acres destroying about 60 structures and forcing the 
evacuation of hundreds of people 
the worst fires are burning in southern and central idaho and 
eastern oregon 
west said that in one recent 24hour period 1000 
lightningcaused fires were reported in the boise national forest 
west said that large fires such as those that burned through 
yellowstone national park in 1988 were always a possibility he 
singled out an area including glacier national park in northwestern 
montana with overmature lodgepole pine damaged by insects where 
major fires could erupt 
extreme fire conditions exist in most of california and nevada 
large portions of wyoming and north dakota southern idaho eastern 
oregon and the cascade range in both oregon and washington state 
severe fire conditions exist in montana south dakota western 
minnesota central and northern idaho and throughout the remaining 
sections of washington and oregon 
despite scattered showers and cooler temperatures in some parts 
of the west over the past several days west said the moderation in 
weather will do little to reverse the dry conditions

two professional athletes including one who 
said he went from stardom to depression and near destruction 
because of drug abuse urged congress on thursday to expand drug 
prevention programs 
it is important we start at an early age said delvin 
williams who played football for the san francisco 49ers and the 
miami dolphins williams said he began experimenting with marijuana 
in grade school 
williams and john lucas a veteran guard in the national 
basketball association told the senate labor and human resources 
committee that drug education programs should stretch from 
kindergarten through high school 
drugs took my dreams and eventually it took my soul lucas 
told the senators i went from stardom to depression and near 
destruction i know firsthand what it means to hit bottom 
lucas described how his daughter at age 6 tried to sniff ashes 
through a straw imitating how her father snorted cocaine 
there are many examples that would frighten most of you but 
its happening every day he said 
it starts after the game when you lose it starts after the 
game when you win said williams you think you can handle it 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the committee said 
the type of prevention programs aimed at youth which both lucas 
and williams now participate in are a critical part of fighting 
drugs 
but kennedy said prevention as well as treatment programs are 
badly underfunded with about threefourths of the federal drug 
money going to law enforcement and interdiction 
it is a political fact of life that law enforcement and 
interdiction have an easier time obtaining funds but we will never 
purge our society of drug addiction with a strategy that 
shortchanges prevention and treatment kennedy said the war on 
drugs must be waged on all fronts and that means prevention and 
treatment too 
the senator said the department of health and human services is 
getting twice as many approved applications for local prevention 
programs as it can fund the governments commitment to 
schoolbased antidrug education programs through the education 
department equals 1 a month per student he said 
keema mcadoo who is entering her senior year of high school in 
the dorchester section of boston has been a peer counselor in 
local antidrug programs for the past 2 years in that time she 
said she has been to 16 funerals of teenagers who were either 
killed by drugs or were drug addicts and committed suicide 
it is time for the schools churches and businesses to invest 
now instead of having to invest later she said 
on the treatment side kennedy said the nation has the capacity 
to treat fewer than one of every six drug addicts seeking help 
new jersey public health commissioner molly coye said there are 
an estimated 50000 intravenous drug users and 150000 cocaine 
users in her state but treatment funds are available for only 
6000 addicts there are 3000 on a waiting list and she estimated 
that the majority of addicts would participate in drug treatment 
programs 
the evidence is overwhelming that drug users want treatment 
ms coye said we simply dont have the resources

afghan soldiers and about 700 
guerrilla defectors celebrated a peace plan thursday with hugs 
kisses and the slaughter of sheep in a dusty town in the barren 
mountains of western afghanistan 
the decision by the local guerrilla force to join the government 
marked a gain for president najibs program of national 
reconciliation to end the decadeold civil war 
but amid the festivities and show of arms there was a noisy 
reminder that the war goes on a rocket exploded behind a clump of 
trees 1500 feet from the crowd sending up a cloud of brown smoke 
as the official ceremony started 
a few government soldiers disappeared but the speeches went on 
and the former guerrillas defectors from the 
harkateenquelabeislami fundamentalist group led by maulvi 
mohammad nabi mohammadi were welcomed into the government fold 
the harkat guerrillas already had a threeyear informal 
ceasefire with the sovietbacked government so the official 
reconciliation was one of warm embraces and good food rocket or 
no rocket 
hayat ullah eldest son of faction commander ibrahim beg blamed 
the rival jamiateislami for the rocket 
beg sitting crosslegged in the mosque of this tiny town 250 
miles west of kabul said he lost only a few men in fighting 
against the government but he said between 200 and 250 of his 
fighters have died in clashes with rival guerrilla groups mainly 
jamiat and hardline fundamentalist gulbaddin hekmatyars 
hezbeislami 
he said he has 21000 supporters including 900 armed fighters 
without informing mohammadi beg said they decided to join the 
government after the feb 15 withdrawal of the last soviet troops 
in the belief najibs administration is the peoples 
government not one of infidels 
first we face shortages of food then we dont have enough 
weapons to fight with other groups so with the cooperation of the 
government we will fight against those who do not believe in 
national reconciliation beg said 
the guerrillas some unarmed but about half wearing rifles 
lined up with their heavy weapons including a rocketpropelled 
grenade launcher and two antiaircraft guns 
under the agreement they keep their weapons and will get 
additional ones one of begs younger sons was given five 
kalashnikovs when he and his men marched down the hills into town 
and the town itself received 10 tons of flour and the promise of 
more to come 
government officials also gave the guerrillas money but 
journalists were unable to find out how much 
afghan government forces have their headquarters in the 
provincial capital of chagcharan 25 miles away but hayat ullah 
said no troops came to taghai timur until four days ago when the 
guerrillas announced they were ready to join the government 
the town is in ghowr one of afghanistans poorest provinces 
whose 250000 people survive by raising sheep cattle and wheat 
several villagers said the journalists were the first westerners 
they have seen 
reporters watched locals in colorful turbans and baggy pants 
slaughtering sheep which a government spokesman described as a 
traditional sign of reconciliation 
ranking army officers and provincial officials exchanged hugs 
and some kisses with waiting guerrillas 
at a traditional feast of roasted sheep rice yogurt and flat 
nan bread some of begs followers asked journalists why the 
americans still supply weapons to the guerrillas 
if the united states pakistan and saudi arabia stop military 
assistance the war will finish in a few days said aji mohammad 
yaqub a bearded man of about 50 who said he has lost 50 friends 
and relatives in the war 
a deputy minister for state security who identified himself as 
lt gen jalal said that in the past month 5000 armed guerrillas 
and 10000 of their unarmed supporters have joined the government 
he estimated more than 200000 guerrillas are in afghanistan 
but said about 70 percent are not fighting 
this figure matched an estimate by peter tomsen a special us 
envoy to the guerrillas but tomsen has predicted najibs 
sovietbacked government will fall and the resistance will 
prevail 
afghan officials point out they have weathered the soviet 
withdrawal in february despite similar predictions the guerrillas 
would oust them then

less than 10 percent of people at high risk for a 
type of infection that can cause pneumonia meningitis and even 
death have ever gotten the vaccine for it and health officials 
thursday urged doctors to do better 
the national centers for disease control said 48 million 
americans are at high risk of pneumococcal infections but a 1985 
study found that not one in 10 of them have ever received the 
vaccine 
the vaccine a onetimeonly shot is recommended for adults 65 
and over and for adults with chronic illnesses such as heart and 
lung disease kidney failure cirrhosis and suppressed immune 
systems 
pneumococcal infections cause 150000 to 570000 cases of 
pneumonia and contribute to an estimated 40000 deaths annually 
the cdc said 
assuming an overall vaccine efficacy of 60 percent an 
estimated 12000 deaths related to pneumococcal disease might be 
prevented annually if only 60 percent of highrisk people were 
vaccinated the cdc said in its weekly report 
the cdc praised a twoyear california state department of health 
services program promoting the use of pneumococcal vaccines local 
health departments received more than 60000 doses and were 
encouraged to provide the vaccine during scheduled autumn 
fluvaccine clinics or other health department clinics 
from july 1986 through july 1987 56 participating health 
departments gave more than 24000 vaccinations the following year 
59 participating departments administered more than 44000 
vaccinations 
the cdc urged healthcare providers to give their patients 
pneumococcal vaccine along with their other vaccinations whenever 
appropriate

a senate committee voted thursday to spend 
200000 for renovations to vice president dan quayles official 
residence and 125000 to restore furniture in the living quarters 
of the white house 
the expenditures were approved by voice vote as the senate 
appropriations committee sent to the full chamber its version of 
the fiscal 1990 spending bill for the treasury postal service and 
a variety of other government agencies 
the 18 billion spending bill also contains a provision to 
prevent the internal revenue service from enforcing section 89 of 
the tax code designed to encourage companies to provide health 
plans to lowpaid employees the section has been attacked by 
businesses that contend compliance is too difficult and costly 
the money for the vice presidents residence an 1894 victorian 
mansion on the grounds of a us navy compound in the embassy row 
section of washington would be spent on constructing four new 
bedrooms an office for mrs quayle three bathrooms and a laundry 
room 
after last years election the quayles said renovations were 
needed to accommodate their family with three schoolage children 
they said repeatedly they would pay for renovations with private 
donations 
denise balzano marilyn quayles chief of staff said this week 
that 200000 has been raised and that the money will be used to 
buy furniture and other items 
the house has already approved the 200000 for the quayle 
residence renovations but the senate added the money for the white 
house furniture 
according to the committee that money would go toward 
refurbishing furniture now in storage because its worn out 
the spending bill covers a wide range of routine government 
programs and projects including the treasury and customs service 
the executive office of the president and the postal service 
the committee also included a provision in the bill designed to 
close a loophole in postal rules some credit card issuers have 
teamed up with charitable organizations in making their 
solicitations and have thus benefitted from subsidized mail rates 
and the committee language would attempt to end subsidies in those 
cases

forensic experts who have examined the 
videotape purporting to show the body of lt col william r 
higgins believe it shows evidence inconsistent with a person 
who has just been hanged an administration official said thursday 
other experts said in interviews that the body shown on the 
videotape appears to be that of a man who had been dead for a 
while not someone who was killed on monday as the kidnappers 
claimed 
a group calling itself the organization of the oppressed on 
earth sent the 30second videotape to a news organization in 
beirut saying the american marine was killed in retaliation for 
israels kidnapping of a shiite moslem cleric in lebanon 
the gruesome tape showed a crewcut man with a noose around his 
neck blindfolded his ankles and arms bound the tape had been 
reproduced several times by the time it was given to experts in 
washington and the quality was grainy and unfocused officials say 
no one can say for sure but there are many things there 
inconsistent with a man who has just been hanged said one 
official who spoke only on condition he not be named he declined 
to elaborate 
another official said experts who viewed the tape noted the 
bodys shoulders appeared rigid rather than slumped as they would 
probably have been on a man who died by hanging and the heavy 
clothing was inconsistent with lebanons summer heat 
pathologists will probably not know for sure whether the body is 
that of higgins when he died or how unless the body can be 
recovered a un envoy arrived in beirut thursday to search for 
the body 
michael baden director of forensic sciences for new york state 
police said that despite the poor quality of the tape experts 
should be able to study individual frames and determine whether it 
is higgins or not 
for instance he said there is a clear shot of the left ear 
lobe which is a distinctive identification mark for pathologists 
baden said the body in the videotape does not look bloated 
suggesting either it was kept refrigerated or the tape was shot 
within 12 hours of death 
us authorities have been hampered by the lack of reliable 
intelligence information about higgins and the other eight american 
hostages believed held in lebanon some reports have said the un 
peacekeeper was killed soon after he was kidnapped in south lebanon 
in february 1988 or in retaliation for the us downing of an 
iranian jetliner last december 
werner spitz a professor of forensic medicine at wayne state 
university in michigan said that as soon as he saw the tape on 
television i said to myself this body is not fresh 
spitz formerly the detroit medical examiner said the skin 
appeared dry and discolored that would be consistent with a body 
that has been dead a while and has undergone mummification 
especially in a hot climate he said 
other experts have noted the videotape indicates the mans 
tongue was not hanging out the eyes were not bulging and the face 
and neck did not appear to have turned dark all characteristics 
of death by hanging baden suggested this indicates the man was 
dead before being placed on the gallows 
but spitz and baden both said the absence of those conditions 
does not prove conclusively the victim was not hanged

the heating bill is unpaid theres 
controversy over those chosen to help run the joint and 
consultants may be spending money that doesnt exist 
worst the state probably doesnt have its share of the 
estimated 72 million needed to convert 750000 square feet of 
abandoned factory into the worlds largest contemporary art museum 
the states deepening money troubles have left it without cash to 
pay for schools police and other services 
still boosters of the planned massachusetts museum of 
contemporary art are pushing ahead 
pending the results of a 125 million feasibility study gov 
michael s dukakis one of the projects earliest backers remains 
committed to it press aide susan kaplan said thursday 
it is going to be a big boost for northern berkshire county 
she said 
dukakis has maintained that the town needs the museum and its 
estimated 600 jobs to revive its economy north adams unemployment 
rate is just 4 percent but it has little industry and most people 
have to seek work in other towns 
supporters claim the museum could attract 150000 visitors 
annually to the remote mill town of 18000 located in the states 
northwestern corner more than a threehour drive from artlovers in 
boston and four hours from new york 
the unlikely project was the brainchild of thomas krens former 
director of the williams college art museum who shortly after 
launching the project was named director of the guggenheim museum 
in new york 
ties between the private museum and an international committee 
headed by krens to review the feasibility study have come under 
question although they have denied any conflict of interest 
committee member carmen gimenez former director of national 
exhibitions for the ministry of culture of spain was recently 
hired by krens as a curator of 20th century art at the guggenheim 
the 72 million would go to convert the dingy 28building 
manufacturing complex into at least 380000 square feet of 
exhibition space for environmental art works and other contemporary 
sculptures too large for most museums 
among the works promised to the museum are abstract sculptures 
more than 20 feet high in such nontraditional materials as neon 
tubing and scrap metal 
count giuseppe panza an italian industrialist who has an 
extensive collection of american art from the 1960s and 1970s has 
agreed to lend many works to the museum the german architecture 
museum in frankfurt plans to send much of its collection of modern 
architectural drawings and models 
the 35 million state share of the cost would come from 
borrowing spread over two to four years kaplan said the remainder 
is to come from private donations 
but so far only the state has come up with any cash and thats 
fast disappearing at the end of june only about 170000 was left 
out of a 17 million state appropriation to hire staff of six and 
pay for the 125 million feasibility study 
the study split among nearly 50 outside consultants charging up 
to 300 an hour was to have been completed last month it is now 
expected to be finished in september according to joseph c 
thompson executive planning director of the museum project 
six weeks is not that late thompson said we are working 
as quickly as possible but weve been delayed by the number of 
reports and the fairly astounding types of technical analysis and 
engineering studies required topics that have to be studied 
range from the heating and ventilating system to art installation 
and transportation he said 
thompson said the group has not begun private fundraising 
although its quarterly financial report lists a net take of 13000 
from a 46000 ball last winter 15000 in donations from local 
supporters and a 100000 loan due in january from the state 
industrial finance agency 
its all about timing he said maintaining the feasibility 
studies include a blueprint for fundraising 
he was equally vague about what the museum is doing about an 
overdue 175000 heating bill berkshire gas co spokesman 
christopher farrell said that after carrying the unpaid heating 
bill for the buildings through the winter the utility cut off 
service in march 
thompson said the state grant does not include operating 
expenses and he declined to say how the museum planned to pay the 
bill or what it would do this winter 
we didnt apply for grants for it we will raise the money 
thats all the comment i will have about it thompson said

a federal judge thursday told the commerce 
department to protect endangered sea turtles from gulf coast 
fishermen by monday or face an order forcing shrimpers to use 
protective devices they detest 
if commerce secretary robert mosbacher fails to meet the monday 
deadline for protective measures us district judge thomas hogan 
said he would grant a request of the national wildlife federation 
to order the department to enforce its suspended regulations 
requiring turtle excluder devices teds on shrimp nets 
hogan issued those instructions in an oral ruling from the bench 
after a hearing on the federations request federation attorney 
jan goldmancarter said its not entirely clear what the judge 
is ordering but it was clear the department had to have 
something in place by monday 
we intend to submit regulations for publication by next monday 
which would permit shrimpers to either limit their trawl times or 
use teds the department said in a statement 
mosbachers decision monday is a true litmus test for the bush 
administrations commitment to this nations environmental agenda 
and the endangered species act said tom miller a spokesman for 
the center for marine conservation 
shrimpers contending that use of turtle excluder devices 
reduces their catch by up to onethird last month blocked shipping 
channels along the texas gulf coast and threatened violence against 
law enforcement agents to protest new regulations requiring use of 
the excluder devices 
on july 24 mosbacher suspended enforcement of the regulations 
and said that after 45 days shrimpers would be required to pull up 
their nets every 90 minutes experts say most turtles can survive 
that long without coming up for air 
mosbacher has since proposed regulations that would require 
shrimpers to pull their nets every 105 minutes spokesman brian 
gorman said the agency had not yet determined what interval would 
be required in mondays proposal 
hogan said turtles have been left totally abandoned by the 
secretary said hogan who ruled that mosbachers decision 
appears to fly in the face of a congressional mandate that 
several species of turtle be protected by may 1 
congress required that excluder devices be used but gave 
mosbacher authority to modify the requirement for good cause the 
federation contends mosbacher has not shown good cause 
environmentalists say 11000 turtles die each year in shrimp 
nets and that the excluder devices basically hinged boxes 
attached to the net hurt the catch only minimally 
protecting sea turtles from shrimpers has been at issue for 
nearly two decades congress hogan said acted after years and 
years of study and thousands upon thousands upon thousands of hours 
to determine the best method to preserve these species 
and while atlantic coast shrimper fishermen have successfully 
used the devices hogan said it is regrettable texas and louisiana 
shrimpers cannot find it possible to use the devices even for a 
season 
the wildlife federation argued that restricting tow times is not 
nearly as effective as the use of excluder devices 
while 3 percent of turtles caught will die if excluder devices 
are used raising nets after 90 minutes means a mortality rate of 
at least 44 percent the federation said 
government attorney michelle kuruc said mosbacher suspended the 
regulations after the protests because he felt the tempers were 
too high to propose an alternative strategy 
were not talking about rocket scientists were taking about 
a lot of seamen who dont feel theyre getting a fair shake with 
these regulations said robert mcmanus attorney for the 
concerned shrimpers of america

three new moons were discovered around 
neptune by cameras on the voyager 2 space probe as it hurtled 
toward the blue planet jet propulsion laboratory scientists said 
thursday 
the discoveries bring the number of known neptune moons to six 
including longknown triton and nereid and a moon found earlier 
this summer by voyager 
voyager 2 was 22 million miles from neptune when the moons were 
confirmed by scientists wednesday indicating there may be many 
more discoveries as the space probe draws closer in the next few 
weeks 
finding the moons may presage discovery of narrow rings around 
neptune similar to those around saturn that is because the moons 
are orbiting in a region where rings are thought to exist said 
richart terrile one of the team of scientists studying images 
transmitted by voyager 
the whole ring arc idea has it that satellites will be in 
association with the rings and the fact were seeing the moons 
already is encouraging richard terrile using a term for partial 
rings 
the new moons were temporarily named 1989 n2 1989 n3 and 1989 
n4 the objects were spotted in images from voyagers tv cameras 
and tracked for five days they were confirmed as moons when they 
followed predicted orbits 
the trio appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in 
diameter and are in circular equatorial orbits moving in the same 
direction as neptunes rotation triton for unknown reasons 
orbits in the opposite direction 
voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and has explored jupiter saturn 
and uranus now 27 billion miles from earth it is heading at more 
than 42000 mph on a course to pass within 3000 miles of neptune 
on aug 24 
the number of discoveries at such a great distance from neptune 
suggests more finds are likely according to terrile 38 a 10year 
voyager project veteran who is among two dozen members of the 
imaging team 
at this time in the last encounter uranus we had only found 
one moon i think the fact that we found four now bodes well for 
finding more he said 
the moons may shed light on how neptune formed neptune has a 
large atmosphere and little is known about what its core is made of 
and what is going on in there 
moons can provide a sample of material from a planet or be 
material captured by it terrile said 
a planet just normally doesnt form by itself it leaves 
behind debris he said adding that the debris can be in the form 
of moons or rings 
study of moons can also tell scientists about such events as 
heating collisions and geological activity in the solar system 
the moons have on them since they are surfaces an imprinted 
history of whats gone on terrile said 
for the moment the discoveries raise more questions than 
answers if there is a ring system is it regular or irregular 
we know very little about whats there yet were plunging a 
spacecraft right through the system terrile said 
scientists believe voyager 2 is in a fairly safe position he 
said but if there is an irregular system we might find that its 
a rather hazardous place to fly the spacecraft through 
the newfound moons were only points of light on the images but 
the resolution will improve about 5 percent each of the next 10 
days and then improve by 10 percent a day terrile said 
of the three 1989 n3 is closest to neptune orbiting 17000 
miles above the planets clouds and completing one orbit every 8 
hours and 10 minutes 
orbiting 23300 miles above the clouds 1989 n4 circles neptune 
in 10 hours and 20 minutes 1989 n2 is 30000 miles above the 
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes 
voyager 2 spotted the first new moon 1989 n1 on june 21 and 
tracked it until confirmation in july

guards beat to death two kurdish prisoners who had been on a hunger 
strike officials said the inmates died of dehydration as a result 
of their fasts 
according to accounts in turkish newspapers the prisoners 
members of the outlawed kurdish labor party were beaten with clubs 
and guns during a fight that broke out wednesday in the

the newspapers said the violence began when prison authorities 
refused to provide medical care for fasting inmates and the 
prisoners began protesting it said four prisoners were injured 
the anatolia news agency quoted the prosecutor in aydin nural 
ucurum as saying prisoners attacked guards when the guards told 
the inmates to strip for a medical examination 
ucurum said the two prisoners were not injured in the fight and 
that an autopsy showed they died of dehydration after refusing food 
for 35 days 
ucurum also said that four fasting prisoners were hospitalized 
but he said it was because of a hunger strike not because of 
injuries sustained in the prison clash

the author of a law that effectively denied a 
day in court to victims of radiation exposure from government 
testing on thursday urged that the law be repealed 
sen john warner rva told the judiciary committees 
subcommittee on courts and administratve practice his amendment to 
the 1985 defense authorization bill was intended to help not harm 
veterans and civilian workers who had been exposed to radiation in 
atomic weapons testing 
however what resulted was an unexpected dismissal of hundreds 
of damage suits brought by those affected said warner 
let me repeat that this was a completely unexpected and 
inadvertent result he said 
warners bill allowed defense contractors to have the government 
replace them as defendants in any suits brought by those who worked 
or lived near nuclear testing sites 
the amendment called section 1631 also placed all radiation 
victim cases under the federal tort claims act which granted the 
government certain immunities based on national security and 
defense concerns and denied exposure victims a trial by jury 
warner joined nevada democratic sens harry reid and richard 
bryan in urging passage of the radiation victims fair treatment act 
to repeal the earlier legislation he sponsored 
if this bill were to become law the litigant would still have 
to prove that the defendant was negligent said warner but as 
the law stands these veterans cant even have the opportunity to 
have a trial before a jury of their peers 
thomas r thomsen of atampt technology systems and james s kane 
of the university of californias office of laboratory affairs 
urged the subcommittee not to repeal the law because they said it 
rightfully made the government responsible for its weapons testing 
program 
they also argued the proposed repeal would flood the nations 
court system with new cases that could take years to resolve

reports from all 93 us attorneys outlining 
the structure of drugtrafficking organizations reflect that the 
nations heartland is suffering with killers hired even in rural 
iowa to dispose of informants officials said thursday 
at the outset we knew that the country was awash in narcotics 
and dangerous drugs but we did not expect to find significant 
cocaine operations for example in wyoming or heroin trafficking 
in iowa attorney general dick thornburgh told a news conference 
the report which named 43 drugtrafficking organizations 
ranging from the medellin cartel to the hells angels motorcycle 
gang divulged information only on completed investigations and 
prosecutions not ongoing projects 
us attorney charles w larson of the northern district of iowa 
said ironically it seems to be proportionally as bad there for 
us as anywhere although we have very very few disenfranchised 
people in a state such as iowa we still have more than our fair 
share of drugs 
larson recounted the story of an iowa farmer who was arrested 
several years ago running out his back door with a kilo of 
cocaine under his arm and no clothes 
larson said the drug trafficking done mainly by iowans who 
have moved to states on the nations borders or who have friends in 
those states has bred increasing violence in the state including 
three or four cases that involved hired killers 
one drug dealer was going to have an informant killed hired 
two people to come down from minnesota he said unfortunately 
they were going to kill the wrong informant but fortunately we 
stemmed that literally in the parking lot 
to give you an idea of how violent they can become they had 
taken steps to rent a woodchipper to dispose of the body once they 
had killed him larson said 
in three years the northern district of iowas federal 
organized crime drug enforcement task force has prosecuted and sent 
to prison more than 200 people for drug crimes including heroin 
trafficking 
thornburgh said the compilation prepared for president bush 
and for william j bennett the director of the office of national 
drug control policy might help develop a national drug control 
strategy which is due sept 5 
what we have found is that these crime conglomerates operate 
with various degrees of structure and sophistication he said 
they include highly publicized international operations such as 
the colombia medellin cartel as well as other groups operating on a 
regional basis such as the dixie mafia based in georgia and the 
miami boys gang in florida 
a common denominator of these organizations however is greed 
their relentless pursuit of money thornburgh said 
one of the salient features of this report is the 
changing nature of organized crime in this country he said no 
longer are we talking about the traditional organized crime 
families only were talking about new organizations the crips and 
the bloods asian organizations the jamaican posses the 
motorcycle gangs 
bennett in an interview after the news conference said he 
really didnt learn anything new from the report 
ive educated myself about this beforehand and i knew about 
these operations but i think its very interesting to see the 
extent of these investigations that they extend all over the 
country that the stereotype just big urban areas is mistaken 
that crack is everywhere and that were making some progress 
bennett said

mass demonstrations against authoritarian rule 
radio rangoon said thursday junior high schools will reopen aug 
14 and teacher training colleges on aug 21

restore the normal situation 
with the progress in the enforcement of the rule of law 
martial law will be lifted step by step 
it repeats government pledges to hold free and fair elections

doubts about this pledge increased after opposition party 
leaders aung san suu kyi and tin oo were arrested on july 20 and 
confined to their homes under military guard 
rangoonbased western diplomats reached by telephone from 
bangkok said ms suu kyi 44 has taken only water since the first 
day of detention the government denies she is on a hunger strike 
and no reports have emerged about her condition 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said she 
wants a transfer to insein jail to be with other detained political 
activists 
diplomats reported a wave of arrests of opposition party members 
in the past two weeks 
it coincides with a government amnesty for common criminals 
officials said thursday that 17558 have been freed since the 
amnesty was announced july 20 
the amnesty covers offenses committed before the sept 18 
military takeover and does not apply to martial law violations

the supreme soviet on thursday confirmed the first 
cabinet member who is not a member of the communist party a 
biologist who will grapple with the countrys ecological problems 
the national legislature also approved for a cabinet post a 
regional communist party chief who last year shocked a party 
conference by demanding that longtime kremlin leaders such as 
andrei a gromyko retire 
the tass news agency said nikolai vorontsov a 55yearold 
professor and biologist was confirmed as head of the state 
committee for nature conservation he replaced fyodor morgun 
it was not clear why morgun was not nominated again for the post 
the legislature also confirmed vladimir i melnikov 54 as 
lumber minister and leonid filimonov a 54yearold engineer as 
oil and gas minister according to tass 
nikolai rusak 55 was confirmed as head of the state sports 
committee and viktor gerashchenko 52 was chosen to head the 
state bank the news agency said 
although the communist party and government are separate in the 
past it has been impossible for anyone to rise in the government 
structure without solid party credentials 
vorontsovs selection indicated that premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
and the legislature now are willing to look outside the 
20millionmember party for government officials 
tass said vorontsov told legislators he favors mandatory 
ecological impact studies before the construction of new factories 
and giving the needs of the local population priority over the 
demands of national ministries 
during the twomonth legislative session which ends saturday 
the government announced it is quadrupling the environmental 
protection budget for the next 15 years to 612 billion 
melnikov the new lumber minister promised the supreme soviet 
he would pay particular attention to ecological problems tass said 
melnikov shocked last summers party conference by stating 
publicly that longtime kremlin figures such as former president 
gromyko and politburo member mikhail s solomentsev should retire 
less than six months later both were removed from the 
politburo gromyko died last month

the senate appropriations committee approved 
legislation thursday that would reduce the amount of money congress 
is expected to spend next year on mail 
the nearly 2 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill for congress 
earmarks 80 million for lawmakers postage compared to 1247 
million in the bill the house approved earlier this week 
official congressional mail expenses in the current fiscal year 
which ends oct 1 are expected to be 539 million however 
members of congress often feel a greatly increased need to 
communicate with their constituents in evennumbered or election 
years 
it provides plenty of money for what is needed to keep in 
touch with our constituents said sen harry reid dnev 
chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on the legislative 
branch 
we have to get after the mail monster and get it under control 
or it is going to eat us out of house and home said reid who is 
not up for election next year 
the senate which has 100 members would allocate 32 million 
for its mailings and 48 million for the house which has 435 
voting members 
the senate bill would set a variety of new rules for 
congressional mass mailings reducing from 6 to 2 per year those 
that go to all postal patrons in a district lawmakers who 
exceed individual mail allowances would have to make up the 
difference from their individual allowances 
the house voted to cut postal patron mailings from 6 to 4 but 
left a loophole so members could still advertise their town 
meetings 
congressional franking privileges are frequently the target of 
political reformers who claim they help incumbents stay in office 
at public expense 
the legislative spending bill is commonly an arena for 
housesenate battles 
the senate in its bill stripped out a housepassed provision to 
take away from senators the private hideaway offices they keep 
in the capitol 
the senate also would establish an office of senate health 
promotion which would run exercise classes and similar services 
for senators and their staffs

a lawyer has filed suit contending 
the state is illegally imprisoning a female inmates fetus citing 
missouris antiabortion law that says life begins at conception 
if life begins at conception then fetuses are supposed to be 
like anyone else theyre a person and they have constitutional 
rights michael box said thursday in a telephone interview from 
oak grove 
along with declaring that life begins at conception the 
preamble to missouris antiabortion law key portions of which 
were upheld last month by the us supreme court extends to the 
unborn all the rights privileges and immunities available to 
other persons 
im not prochoice or prolife or any of that stuff but i 
think theres some problems with the law and courts are eventually 
going to have to rule on it he said 
box filed suit earlier this week in federal court in jefferson 
city on behalf of lovetta farrars unborn child 
the suit on behalf of the fetus contends it has been imprisoned 
at the chillicothe correctional center without having been charged 
with a crime allowed an attorney convicted or sentenced 
it is also being denied adequate diet medical care and the 
opportunity to develop into a healthy live born child because of 
conditions at the prison the suit said all are violations of 
constitutional rights the suit said 
box filed a companion suit that contends the prison violated 
farrars constitutional rights by failing to provide her with a 
proper diet medical care exercise and a safe environment in which 
to carry the fetus 
farrars baby is due in november according to the suit 
prison officials said farrars release date is june 1991 she 
was serving a threeyear sentence for various counts of forgery and 
stealing when she was released in february to an honor center when 
she failed to return from a work release program in april she was 
returned to prison 
named as defendants in the fetus suit are gov john ashcroft 
attorney general william webster and five senior officials of the 
state department of corrections and human resources all but 
webster are named in farrars suit 
gail hughes deputy director of the corrections department said 
he did not know about the suits 
the one on behalf of the fetus is particularly interesting 
hughes said i dont know about that idea 
regarding the challenge to the conditions at the prison in 
chillicothe he said i think weve had suits like them and won 
them all 
early to bed early to rise three meals a day no alcohol or 
drugs is probably a conducive environment to pregnancy he said 
pregnant inmates havent had any difficulties brought about by 
any cause of their incarceration

the decision by shiite moslem leaders to spare 
the life of american hostage joseph cicippio followed an intense 
us diplomatic effort to gain cooperation from many countries 
including some longstanding us adversaries 
in addition private experts said the revolutionary justice 
organization the proiranian group holding cicippio also may have 
reached their decision to suspend the death sentence after deciding 
cicippio was worth more alive than dead 
for days us diplomats were in contact with countries which 
had either access to or influence with iran the country whose lead 
the lebanese shiites follow 
perhaps carried along by the international outcry that followed 
the reported hanging on monday of lt col william higgins both 
syria and the soviet union made diplomatic appeals on cicippios 
behalf 
but the apparent intervention by irans leadership us 
officials said may have been decisive irans new president ali 
akbar hashemi rafsanjani expressed regret tuesday over the 
reported death of higgins and condemned terrorist acts in general 
a shift in irans suppoort for international terrorism could 
eventually lead to steps toward an accommodation between the two 
onetime allies american officials have said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said iran 
had been the target of an intense us diplomatic campaign that 
included a variety of channels 
at this time we have no reason to believe that iran is not 
dealing with this matter in a serious way she said speaking 
less than two hours before the announcement of cicippios reprieve 
but officials cautioned cicippio and the remaining seven 
american hostages still face danger they noted the revolutionary 
justice organization statement did not drop its demand that israel 
free shiek abdul karim obeid the shiite cleric kidnapped last 
friday by israeli commandos 
the statement said acceptance of the demand should be 
announced within days otherwise the initiative will be considered 
canceled this implied the death sentence for cicippio would be 
reimposed 
still announcement of the reprieve lowered the temperature here 
considerably a sense of anxiety had permeated the administration 
since monday when higgins execution was announced and was followed 
quickly by the announcement that cicippio would be next 
the execution of cicippio officials said almost certainly 
would have triggered a response by president bush possibly 
including military action this in turn would have polarized 
factions in the middle east even more 
geoffrey kemp a national security council official in the 
reagan administration attributed the repreive partly to the 
realization by the revolutionary justice organization that any 
leverage they believe ciccipio gives them would have died with his 
execution 
hes not worth anything dead said kemp he suggested the 
organization had to take seriously the views of iranian officials 
who want to renew relationships with the united states

jaime paz zamora all but assured of 
becoming bolivias next president is a former seminary student who 
began his political career opposing former dictator hugo banzer 
suarez who jailed him in the early 1970s 
today the erstwhile opponents have joined together to form a 
new government 
paz zamora 50 is expected to be elected president by congress 
friday or saturday and sworn in as bolivias 77th president sunday 
the former vice president came in third in the may 7 presidential 
elections but received the support of banzer suarez the 
secondplace winner to gain enough congressional votes to be 
elected president 
paz zamora is the son of an army general and a mother from a 
prominant aristocratic family he is the nephew of president victor 
paz estenssoro 
after completing his high school at a jesuit school in his 
hometown of sucre he attended a roman catholic seminary in 
argentina but quit before he was ordained a priest he received a 
bachelors degree in philosophy in cordoba argentina 
he continued his studies in belgium where he began his political 
involvement upon his return in 1971 he founded the revolutionary 
movement of the left which opposed gen banzer suarez 
paz zamora was arrested in february 1974 along with hundreds of 
other political figures but was released five months later and 
exiled to venezuela 
his resistance to the banzer regime continued from exile and 
after his return in 1977 he participated in the 1978 presidential 
elections the results of which were nullified due to widespread 
fraud 
during the 1980 presidential campaign a private plane carrying 
paz zamora and four other candidates crashed near la paz paz 
zamora was the only surviver and suffered severe burns he was 
rushed to the united states for treatment and his face and hands 
still show scars from the suspicious crash 
in the 1979 and 1980 presidential elections he was candidate for 
vicepresident as part of the popular and democratic unity 
coalition the coalition won the largest number of votes in the 
1980 elections but was prevented from taking office due to a bloody 
military coup headed by gen luis garcia meza 
paz zamora was in the united states during the coup but members 
of his party and coalition were arrested persecuted or killed by 
armed civilians and soldiers on jan 15 1981 11 leaders of paz 
zamoras party were meeting at a private home when paramilitary and 
soldiers attacked all but one of the leaders were brutally 
tortured and killed 
in response to domestic political and labor as well as 
international opposition military rulers stepped down and congress 
elected hernan siles zuazo president and paz zamora vice president 
in 1982 
within months of taking over the banrkupt economy the coalition 
split and paz zamoras party left the government within his party 
the more radical leftist leaders broke away in response to tough 
austerity measures dictated by the government in an effort to 
control an inflation rate that reached 24000 percent by 1985 
while siles zuazo and paz zamora were slated to remain in office 
until 1986 serious social unrest and economic difficulties led to 
early elections in 1985 
paz zamoras party weakened by internal rivalries only won 8 
percent of the vote in 1985 elections 
in 1987 paz zamoras party however won second place in 
nationwide municipal elections with 26 percent of the vote by 
then the marxist tendency within the party gave way to a more 
pragmatic approach that tried to capture votes from the center 
paz zamora supports a free market economy flexible exchange 
rates and economic stability he now considers himself a 
nationalist leftist with ties to the the european social democratic 
movement and the international socialists 
he differs however with the governments current economic 
model because he favors greater protection for national industries 
programs to reactivate the economy and greater expenditures for 
health and education 
he is divorced and has two teenage sons

nonsmoking uranium miners died of lung cancer 
from breathing decaying radon far more often than the rest of the 
nonsmoking population confirming the radioactive gas is a potent 
cause of cancer even for people who do not smoke researchers said 
thursday 
many people figure that since they dont smoke theyre safe 
from lung cancer said richard waxweiler an epidemiologist at 
the centers for disease control in atlanta and one of the 
researchers who published the study in this weeks journal of the 
american medical association 
being a nonsmoker is no excuse for not having your home 
tested for radon waxweiler said 
researchers who studied 516 colorado uranium miners who had 
never smoked cigarettes pipes or cigars found that 14 had died of 
lung cancer between 1950 and 1984 a lung cancer death rate 127 
percent higher than for a comparison group of nonsmoking veterans 
the study found 
radon a radioactive decay product of uranium is a colorless 
odorless gas that can build up in closed areas such as mines and 
houses said robert roscoe an epidemiologist at the national 
institute for occupational safety and health in cincinnati and one 
of the researchers 
these results confirm that exposure to radon and related 
radioactve decay products of uranium in the absence of cigarette 
smoking is a potent carcinogen that should be strictly 
controlled the researchers wrote 
the uranium miners in the study worked an average of 146 years 
in the mine 
federal law today is much more restrictive on how long uranium 
miners can be exposed to radiation compared with the 1950s said 
victo archer an epidemiologist who has studied the history of 
uranium miners 
today uranium miners do not experience radiation levels 
anywhere near like the miners of the past roscoe said 
previous studies of radon and miners examined those who had 
already died of lung cancer and questioned friends and relatives 
about the miners smoking habits roscoe said this study selected 
a group of miners who said they never had smoked and followed them 
for three decades 
it took this long to finish the study because lung cancer is 
rare and we had to wait for miners to die waxweiler said 
because we keep track of them for years and recorded their habits 
when they were alive we think our study is more accurate 
uranium decays into radium a radioactive element waxweiler 
said radium further decays into radon gas which moves through the 
soil without combining with other gases 
the damage from radon occurs as the gas decays turning back 
into a solid waxweiler said inhaled through the nose or mouth 
the solid particles become little shortrange machine guns that 
fire off radioactive cancercausing particles he said 
the us environmental protection agency warns that children can 
be especially harmed by radon because they spend more time at home 
than adults 
weve been recommending testing for radon from the beginning 
of time said epa spokeswoman martha casey in washington

miami a p a study of254 hardcore juvenile crack cocaine 
users found they commit an astonishing total of 223000 crimes a 
year counting both drug possession itself and other crimes such as 
robbery assault and shoplifting 
the pioneering dade county research on children age 12 to 17 
shows that current drugprevention programs in the inner cities are 
too little and too late researchers and local officials said 
thursday 
a large segment of a generation is being severely put at risk 
because of crack cocaine said james rivers the countys top 
drug abuse official and author of the final report if they 
continue in this pattern it is very likely they are going to get 
into heavier crime serious health consequences and will never be 
able to integrate into society 
the research focused on juvenile violators known to be drug 
users nine out of 10 adolescents in the study had been arrested 
at least once all were interviewed about when they began abusing 
alcohol and drugs and how many crimes they committed to sustain 
their drug use 
first use is an average age of 7 for their first drink and by 
13 half of these kids had been behind bars said rivers 
the average age for the first time they became drunk was 8 years 
old first drug use occurred at 99 years and regular drug use 
began at age 11 
rivers said the adolescents confessed to an average of about 880 
crimes each in the previous year an amount he called stunning 
that average breaks down with some numbers rounded to 37 major 
felonies ranging from assault to burglary 101 prostitution and 
other vice offenses 205 petty property crimes such as shoplifting 
and 538 drug sale and possession violations 
but only one out of 555 crimes resulted in an arrest the study 
found and only 4 percent of the juveniles ever received drug abuse 
treatment 
weve got a population of adolescents out there we dont 
know how large it is that is heavily involved in drugs and 
crime said university of delaware sociologist james iniciardi 
who conducted many of the interviews the current methods of 
interdiction are really not doing anything for this group 
as other studies have shown crack generates far more crime than 
other addictive drugs such as heroin rivers said 
cocaine is a stimulant you remain agitated and alert he 
said the small dosage and the short duration of the high 
predisposes the user to use it again and again and again 
and when the users run out of money they turn to crime he said 
both rivers and iniciardi emphasized that those studied were 
hardcore cases not average adolescents and they said many had 
committed crimes even before becoming involved with drugs 
the interviews were done between october 1986 and november 1987 
it seems to be consistent with what were seeing on the 
streets and its scary said miami police lt jon brooks who 
runs the citys street narcotics unit 
solutions are difficult rivers and iniciardi said 
drugs are not the problem in the ghetto the ghetto is the 
problem in the ghetto iniciardi said drugs are a coping 
mechanism and for some drugs are seen as a mechanism for upward 
mobility to get out of the ghetto 
the men said drug programs especially in the inner city must 
begin as early as preschool

a michigan pediatrician selected to head the 
new national commission on aids said thursday the panel should try 
to reverse a lack of compassion she said has marked the fight 
against the disease 
dr june osborn dean of the university of michigan school of 
public health and a professor of pediatrics and communicable 
diseases said she will strive to bring greater humanity to the 
nations response to the epidemic 
its been hard for the country to get a sense that there are 
real people who are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus that causes aids she said 
but everybody who dies is somebodys son or daughter she 
said this is happening to real people 
at its first meeting thursday the 15 commission members 
selected osborn as chairwoman and david e rogers a professor of 
medicine at cornell university medical college in new york and a 
former president of the robert wood johnson foundation as vice 
chairman 
the commission began its work two weeks after president bush 
announced his two selections to the panel which was created by 
congress last year to advise the president and capitol hill on aids 
issues 
the members spent most of the day getting acquainted with each 
other picking their leaders and exchanging philosophies and ideas 
osborne said she sees the commission as a unique forum for 
giving people with aids a chance to say how their lives could be 
made easier 
if we can communicate commitment and compassion we will have 
added to something that has been lacking and the federal government 
cant provide on its own she said 
rep roy rowland dga a physician said the panel could 
provide some needed guidance to congress on how to respond to the 
aids epidemic 
i think they need some direction he said noting the 
country has no national policy on such aidsrelated issues as 
confidentiality of testing 
belinda mason a young mother of two who is infected with the 
aids virus said she hopes the panel will focus part of its efforts 
on discrimination against people with aids which she has 
experienced personally 
its getting harder and harder for people with aids to lead 
decent lives she said 
the commission will meet again aug 17 to make personnel and 
staffing decisions and meet again sept 1819 
the panel is to submit an interim report within a year and a 
final report within two years

proiranian kidnappers holding joseph 
cicippio said thursday they had temporarily lifted the death 
sentence imposed on the american hostage 
the captors who call themselves the revolutionary justice 
organization said they would give israel several days to meet new 
tougher conditions but did not say what would happen if the 
israelis refused 
when the original threat to kill cicippio was made monday his 
captors demanded the release of a shiite moslem cleric abducted by 
israeli commandos july 28 the new terms include release of 
unspecified palestinian and lebanese guerrillas 
israel has offered to trade sheik abdul karim obeid 33 and 
other lebanese shiites it holds for western hostages and three 
israeli soldiers held prisoner in lebanon obeid is a spiritual 
leader of hezbollah or party of god an iraniansponsored group 
thought to be behind the kidnappings 
in jerusalem defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel would 
examine the new demands on a positive basis he would not 
elaborate 
sheik naim qassem a hezbollah leader said there had been no 
direct or indirect negotiations with israel on a prisoner exchange 
and would not be 
after learning of the reprieve cicippios lebanese wife elham 
told the associated press by telephone i am very happy i never 
lost hope i hope this part of the ordeal is all over 
a short written statement from the white house said in part 
we regard this as an encouraging and hopeful development but it 
still does not answer our continuing concern for release of all 
hostages we express our appreciation to all those who have 
been thus far trying to help 
the latest word about cicippio came in a handwritten statement 
from the revolutionary justice organization delivered to a western 
news agency 45 minutes before the deadline of 10 pm 3 pm edt 
it had set for killing him 
it was the third time the group held off on its threat to kill 
cicippio 
a photograph of the 58yearold captive from the waist up with 
the trace of a smile on his face accompanied the arabiclanguage 
statement 
out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states 
with whom america pleaded to mediate and stop the execution we 
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its subsitution with 
an initiative the captors statement said 
none of the mediating nations was named but press reports in 
beirut have said iran syria and algeria were believed to have 
interceded 
in addition to obeid the latest demands said israel must free 
palestinian and lebanese guerrillas whose names the kidnappers 
said they would provide to the red cross 
acceptance should be announced within days otherwise the 
initiative will be considered canceled the statement said 
without explaining what was meant 
revolutionary justice stated its intentions with similar 
vagueness last year and in 1987 when it allowed death threats 
against cicippio another american hostage and a french captive to 
fade 
earlier thursday cicippios captors had announced a fourhour 
postponement of the death deadline and released a videotape in 
which he read a statement asking israel to free obeid 
on monday the captors of lt col william r higgins said they 
had hanged him in retaliation for obeids abduction the us 
marine officer was kidnapped feb 17 1988 while on un duty in 
southern lebanon 
several reports have said higgins was killed months ago on 
thursday the israeli defense ministry said obeid told 
interrogators higgins was alive last week but israel has said it 
received word of his death long ago 
other than higgins 16 westerners are missing and assumed 
captive in lebanon including eight americans held longest is 
terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press kidnapped march 16 1985 
hashemi rafsanjani known as a pragmatist was sworn in thursday 
as president of iran he made no comment about the hostages and 
there was no indication what role if any he played in the 
decision about cicippio 
the tehran times said other countries should follow the french 
who succeeded in winning release of their hostages in beirut 
because they made an honorable deal 
all french hostages in lebanon were released in 1987 but 
details of the agreement were not revealed rafsanjani has tied 
using irans good will to free americans to the release of 
iranian assets frozen by the united states 
on two occasions in 1988 revolutionary justice made death 
threats against cicippio and another american edward austin tracy 
58 a writer kidnapped oct 21 1986 but did not carry them out 
in march 1987 the kidnappers said they would kill french 
hostage jeanlouis normandin unless france suspended arms sales to 
iraq with which iran was at war they canceled the death threat 
after three postponements covering nearly two weeks and normandin 
was freed in november of that year 
on the videotape also delivered to a western news agency 
cicippio said i appeal to each person having honor who can move 
to release sheik abdul karim obeid dont be late because they are 
very serious to hang us and the period become very soon and the 
hours very little 
he had a bushy beard and was shown from the waist up reading 
from a statement the poor english suggested it was written by his 
captors 
cicippio wore glasses was dressed in a blue track suit and 
appeared haggard and distressed 
my dear wife and people and all the human society and 
especially the red cross dont leave me he said so to help 
me move i demand from the american people to oblige israel to 
release sheik abdul karim obeid immediately because his kidnapping 
is not human 
we the american people are always the victims of israels 
politics and president bush has not helped to free us said 
cicippio who was acting comptroller of the american university of 
beirut when he was abducted sept 12 1986 
his voice broke with emotion when he ended the appeal with this 
message for his lebanese wife elham ghandour a secretary at the 
us embassy in beirut 
goodbye my wife if you dont hear my voice and see my face 
again i want you to look after yourself and dont be sad and 
always remember me 
marrack goulding un undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping 
operations met in beirut on thursday with shiite leaders and 
iranian embassy personnel 
i still do not know whether col higgins is dead he said 
but if he is dead i hope that whoever is holding his body will 
make it available so it can be returned to his family for a decent 
burial in his home country 
higgins kidnappers called themselves the organization of the 
oppressed on earth 
addiyar a conservative beirut newspaper said iran had told 
the united states delivery of the body was conditional on obeids 
release irans official news agency described the report as 
baseless allegations

television evangelist robert schuller said he 
prayed with president bush on thursday over the ordeal of the 
hostages in lebanon and was confident bush would take action 
americans will be proud of if another american captive were 
killed 
schuller host of televisions hour of power religious show 
and pastor of the crystal cathedral in garden grove calif said 
he was invited to the white house before the hostage crisis erupted 
he said the conversation turned to the plight of the hostages 
and that bush made it clear he would take appropriate action if 
another hostage were killed in the wake of mondays reported 
hanging of lt col william higgins 
without specifying what that action might be schuller said 
if there is the loss of another life americans will be proud of 
the response that president bush will take i feel that very 
certainly 
he added i think that if the president felt that for the 
preservation of life and liberty that drastic action is necessary 
he was the will to take such an action 
schuller spoke with reporters in the white house driveway before 
the announcement from lebanon of a suspension in the threatened 
execution of hostage joseph cicippio 
the pastor praised bush for calling world leaders to try to 
bring about a peaceful resolution 
he said that at bushs invitation they prayed together in the 
oval office for the hostages 
he allowed me to continue to pray even though the phone was 
ringing and a head of a powerful state abroad was on the line

the bush administrations efforts to forestall 
the disbanding of nicaraguas contra rebels amount to a breach of 
an agreement with congress and could lead to a cutoff of all aid to 
the rebels a leading contra critic said thursday 
im convinced that if the administration succeeds in 
pressuring the presidents of the central american countries to 
delay disbanding the contras that you will see humanitarian aid 
to the contras cut off on nov 30 said sen christopher dodd 
dconn chairman of the senate foreign relations western 
hemisphere subcommittee 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs went to guatemala on wednesday to urge diplomats preparing 
for a weekend meeting of the central american presidents to keep 
the rebels together until after nicaraguas national elections 
scheduled for feb 25 
at a capitol hill news conference contra leader adolfo calero 
welcomed the bush administrations position we are elated that 
president bush has come out unequivocally in favor of having the 
resistance remain as a viable force he said 
calero said he is confident that the regional presidents have 
enough information and realism to recognize that it was through the 
efforts of the resistance that a political process was made 
possible this is still under way and cant be demobilized until 
the process reaches a conclusion you do not take down a scaffold 
before a building is finished 
in a related development the house intelligence committee 
delayed action on a democratic proposal to bar cia political aid to 
opposition parties in nicaragua bowing to a request from secretary 
of state james a baker iii 
the administration wants to keep the option of covert aid to 
antisandinista candidates but the intelligence panel may take up 
the issue again when congress returns in september from a 
monthlong recess 
a senior state department official briefing reporters on the 
aronson trip cited complaints that the sandinista government is 
raiding suspected contra sympathizers in northern nicaragua and has 
failed to create fair conditions for political opponents 
that is hardly the kind of action that the government should 
be taking if it wants to create the conditions that would allow the 
resistance to reintegrate said the official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
frankly it is not clear that the sandinista government really 
wants to embrace national reconciliation and reintegration of the 
resistance their narrow goal appears to be simply to take away 
their weapons and let them scatter to the winds 
but dodd in an interview with a group of reporters said the 
administrations efforts to influence the regional peace process 
threaten to unravel a bipartisan accord on us policy reached 
between bush and congressional democrats on march 24 
that agreement called for some 40 million in renewed 
humanitarian aid to the rebels through feb 28 1990 but it also 
provided that the aid could be used for voluntary relocation of 
rebel fighters back into nicaragua and stipulated that it could be 
cut off nov 30 if key democrats on capitol hill believed the 
administration was not adequately supporting peace efforts 
both sides said they believed that approach would permit the 
armed opposition to be reintegrated into nicaraguas political life 
and would encourage the sandinista regime to make bona fide reforms 
in the electoral processes and to restore political freedoms 
but if bush is bringing pressure on the central american 
presidents to put off demobilization of the rebels until after the 
february elections dodd said the bipartisan accord may well 
become a dead letter 
dodd said he was not suggesting that demobilization of the 
rebels begin immediately or be completed before the elections but 
he said neither should the start of the process be postponed until 
after the balloting 
he released a letter to secretary of state james a baker iii 
asking that the administration release some of the 70 million in 
us economic aid to honduras appropriated for the current year but 
which is being held up 
the administration clearly is using the money as leverage to 
pressure the hondurans into continuing to host the contra camps 
along their border with nicaragua and into opposing demobilization 
he said

the board of the denver symphony orchestra which 
is 4 million in debt meets friday to decide whether the entire 
concert season should be canceled for the first time in the 
orchestras 55year history 
last season was cut short in march two months early because of 
financial problems 
the next symphony season usually 41 weeks beginning in 
september already has been sharply scaled back with a tentative 
start date in january there is a chance there may be no season at 
all orchestra officials have said 
i am hesitant to say it is an absolute decision day denver 
symphony association chairman john low said of the meeting 
nevertheless i am hopeful we will reach a decision 
the orchestras problems have been blamed on the regions 
declining economy the citys 10 percent seat tax and management 
turnover said josi callan the marketing director the orchestra 
must raise 600000 a month to keep operating 
maybe thats more than this area wants to pay for it ms 
callan said 
the orchestra averages 15000 to 16000 attendance at classical 
concerts in the 26000seat boettcher concert hall but has sold 
out the hall for pops concerts 
earlier this summer the board rejected a proposed 27week season 
which was to have begun in november the board cited the symphonys 
unresolved 4 million debt and the fact that musicians had not 
agreed to contract modifications and other concessions 
the recovery plan the board will examine friday calls for the 
symphonys endowment fund trustees to forgive a 25 million debt 
from the orchestra 
symphony executives have also asked the city council to write 
off 700000 the symphony owes the city in back rent on the concert 
hall 
city councilman ted hackworth opposes forgiving the back rent 
and said the symphony should declare bankruptcy 
what its going to take is for them to wake up and realize 
they have to operate like a business not a charity hackworth 
said 
earlier this week the symphony notified its 81 musicians that 
their dental and health benefits were canceled effective wednesday 
saving the association about 30000 a month 
three years ago the musicians agreed to 20 percent pay cuts to 
keep the symphony solvent 
since then the symphonys financial woes have multiplied 
a year ago thenboard chairman robert e lee threatened to put 
the orchestra into chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings because of 
debt then resigned the next month after a fundraising drive 
brought 700000 in private and corporate contributions 
later music director phillippe entremont and executive director 
chris dunworth resigned 
low said that the recovery plan the board will consider would 
have the orchestra spend less money on highpriced guest artists 
and rely more heavily on the music provided by the orchestra 
itself 
orchestras in oakland and san diego calif new orleans and 
nashville tenn have filed for bankruptcy and then resumed 
operations after reorganizing

police confiscated 106 
elephant tusks and arrested people allegedly involved in the 
biggest ivory smuggling operation yet uncovered in south africa 
authorities said thursday 
police found the ivory in the cape town home of michael shen a 
37yearold taiwanese citizen who has lived in south africa for the 
past nine years shen and an unspecified number of other men were 
arrested wednesday police said 
it was not immediately clear whether the tusks came from 
elephants in south africa or elsewhere on the continent police 
said one rhino horn also was confiscated they said 
south africas wellmanaged wildlife parks have few reported 
incidents of poaching but conservationists say the country is a 
major transit point for smugglers in other parts of africa 
the african elephant population has fallen from about 15 
million in 1978 to as few as 400000 today mostly because of 
poachers who seek the valuable tusks 
several western nations including the united states have 
banned the import of ivory in recent months the 102nation 
convention on international trade in endangered species will 
consider a worldwide ban on the ivory trade in october

israel welcomed the decision of lebanese 
captors to suspend their death sentence on an american but stuck 
to its position of freeing a shiite moslem cleric only in a trade 
for hostages 
the revolutionary justice organization had said it would kill 
joseph cicippio but released a handwritten statement 45 minutes 
before the deadline saying it had suspended the death threat and 
including new demands 
in addition to sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem cleric 
abducted by israel it now wants the release of palestinian and 
lebanese guerrillas in israeli jails it said the names would be 
given to the red cross 
acceptance should be announced within days otherwise the 
initiative will be considered canceled the kidnappers said 
without explaining what the vague language meant 
i can tell you that all the sides now have more time said a 
senior defense ministry official 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told reporters in jerusalem if 
indeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposal for 
prisoners exchange we shall examine it on a positive basis 
officials declined to say whether they believed the new demands 
provided an opening for negotiations 
what remains to be seen is whether hezbollah is ready to do 
business and ready to negotiate the exchange we have proposed this 
is why we are cautious said avi pazner spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
obeid is a spiritual leader of hezbollah a proiranian group 
believed to be responsible for the kidnapping westerners in lebanon 
yossi ahimeir a top shamir aide insisted cicippio be freed 
before negotiations 
cicippio should be released immediately he added he 
should go back to his family he is an innocent man 
other israeli officials expressed concern over a reference to 
freeing palestinian prisoners from the uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip that could include more than 8000 
palestinian detainees 
earlier thursday israel issued a plea for the shiites not to 
carry out the threatened killing of cicippio but said it would free 
obeid only if it got back israeli soldiers and foreign hostages 
we still stick to our position that we are ready to exchange 
kidnap victims and hostages ahimeir said our goal is to 
rescue save our people in lebanon in the hands of several 
organizations there 
the lebanese captors on thursday released a videotaped plea from 
cicippio who called for the release of obeid and added dont be 
late because they are very serious 
israeli commandos abducted obeid from his home in south lebanon 
on july 28 israel says he planned guerrilla raids and directed the 
kidnapping of lt co william r higgins a us marine serving 
with un peacekeepers in february 1988 
higgins captors said they hanged him monday 
ahimeir reported all kinds of consultations within the 
government about the hostage crisis 
yossi ben aharon a top aide to shamir said israel was in 
constant touch with the us government but he would not say 
whether shamir had talked by telephone with president bush 
the foreign ministry summoned the ambassadors of west germany 
italy and britain whose citizens are among the hostages in 
lebanon and also the japanese envoy 
israel radio said the japanese ambassador was called in because 
japan was involved in contacts with iran the radio gave no details 
and ministry officials could not be reached for comment 
higgins captors released a poorquality videotape of a man who 
appeared to be the marine colonel hanging from a gallows there was 
no way of telling when the tape was made conflicting reports have 
arisen about when he was killed 
a defense ministry statement said obeid told interrogators he 
believed higgins was alive last week 
the statement said israel continued to believe higgins was 
killed late last year officials said they might give obeid to a 
liedetector test to determine what he knew about the american 
officer

america is better at recalling 
automobiles than it is at warning medical implant recipients of 
defects in their devices the director of a new alert system said 
thursday 
there are people who are dying in this country every year 
because the device they are wearing is malfunctioning and they 
dont know it said donald nichols executive vice president of 
international implant registry 
nichols visited the bionics and transplants display at the 
science museum of minnesota to call attention to his fledgling 
nonprofit service which has been spurned by several large 
manufacturers of medical implant devices 
the registry part of turlock califbased medic alert seeks 
to create a computer data base of implantable devices and notify 
physicians of government warnings or manufacturer recalls the 
physicians would use addresses provided by the registry to contact 
their patients 
although federal regulations require medical device makers to 
report product hazards to the us food and drug administration 
the agency has no direct way to notify hospitals physicians or 
patients of product recalls nichols said manufacturers forward 
the warnings to the medical institutions and doctors who purchased 
the devices he said but patient addresses are often outdated 
nichols estimated that the contact rate in some alert cases is 
as low as 30 percent the registry he said could consistently 
achieve a contact rate of more than 80 percent 
the record overall is not a good one nichols said right 
now in this country we can recall automobiles more quickly than we 
can recall the devices that are in peoples bodies 
in washington dc however a consumer group said the fda was 
negligent and reckless in failing to enforce the notification 
law 
public citizen health research group said fda documents showed 
makers of heart pacemakers wheelchairs and breast implants ignore 
the reporting requirement and that the fda has failed to seek 
prosecution of the companies 
the fda said it disagreed with the assessment and that the group 
had incorrectly interpreted some data in evaluating the public 
health risk 
kent milton of the national highway traffic safety 
administration in washington dc said the notification rate on 
automobile recalls is never below 50 percent 
nichols said the importance of prompt patient warnings was 
underscored in 1985 when a defect in a series of bjorkshiley 
artificial heart valves resulted in about 100 deaths he said the 
registry would have speeded the warnings and possibly saved lives 
a spokeswoman for irving califbased bjorkshiley said the firm 
was checking whether or not this was a problem for them in 1985 
nichols said only a few device manufacturers are interested in 
paying for the service the registry charges an initial fee of 25 
a patient and 10 a patient each subsequent year 
dick reid a spokesman for fridleybased medtronic inc one of 
the largest manufacturers of heart pacemakers said the registry 
would be a costly duplication of a service medtronic already 
provides 
we have our own patient implant registry and we keep it 
updated reid said at least in the pacemaker area we feel it 
tracks 98 percent of the medtronic pacemakers in place in the 
united states 
nichols said medtronic has a good record of notifying customers 
of defects but he said the industry as a whole is weak more than 
11 million people receive medical implants annually and the 
industry produces an array of more than 200 devices 
a spokeswoman for the fda in chicago said the agency is not 
aware of the registry and therefore could not comment on whether 
there is a need for it 
mark wood an account manager in the risk management department 
at st paul companies the largest medical malpractice insurance 
underwriter in the us said there is room for improvement in 
warning patients of implant defects but he said he is not familiar 
with the international implant registry 
having some kind of a standardized system where you could 
track a product to its end user could be helpful wood said 
still in its first year the registry has only 15000 entries 
nichols said it must add 10000 to 12000 entries a year to be 
successful and the first eight months of this year have yielded 
only 3000 additions 
nichols said the registry is planning to appeal directly to 
implant patients to pay for the service its too early to tell if 
that approach will work he said

the leader of ugandas roman catholic 
church condemned the recent suffocations of 69 civilians by 
government troops and called for an independent investigation into 
the killings a newspaper said thursday 
we condemn in the strongest terms this criminal act of the 
murder of innocent citizens in cold blood by the national 
resistance army said cardinal emmanuel nsubuga we hope that 
such atrocities will never be repeated in our nation 
he was quoted in the governmentowned newspaper new vision 
the government has said the victims were among 238 youths 
detained june 10 and held in unused railroad cars in wartorn 
northeastern uganda the soldiers who were fighting rebels in the 
area at the time had rounded up the people in villages near the 
city of kumi 155 miles northeast of kampala 
 
the government has also said that those who died were innocent 
because the rebels already had been taken to army headquarters 
the army has arrested 14 officers in the case the officers 
could face the death penalty if convicted of murder 
nsubuga urged an independent inquiry into the incident

parents of two boys shot to death 
by police concealed in crates on a truck won an early victory 
thursday in their fight to prosecute the officers for murder 
supreme court justice dm williamson rejected a request by the 
13 defendants one army officer and 12 policemen that he order 
the parents to post a deposit of 360000 to cover possible legal 
costs in event of acquittal the parents lawyers doubted such a 
sum could be raised 
williamson noted the government is paying the defendants legal 
costs and said granting the request may be loading the scales in 
favor of the accused 
the defendants went on trial for murder tuesday in an 
unprecedented private prosecution 
the parents decided to pursue the case on their own after the 
attorney general for cape province declined to prosecute despite an 
inquest magistrates finding that police were negligent 
it is the first murder trial to proceed under a law allowing 
private citizens to press a prosecution in certain instances where 
the government declines 
the killings took place in 1985 during antiapartheid unrest in 
a mixedrace township near cape town the case became known as the 
trojan horse incident because white police concealed themselves in 
what looked like a delivery truck 
according to evidence at the inquest an army commandant and two 
senior police officers ordered the truck into athlone to draw 
attacks from stonethrowers 
gunfire from the hidden policemen killed shaun magmoed 16 
michael miranda 11 and jonathen classens 21 the magistrate 
concluded no evidence emerged that the three were among a handful 
of youths who threw stones 
mirandas mother and magmoeds father instituted the 
prosecution their lawyers are to be paid from a fund set up last 
year which has received contributions from overseas human rights 
organizations

a congressional study released thursday said 
cable television charges have risen 29 percent since federal 
regulation ended three years ago several legislators complained 
about inadequacies in the report and one called it virtually 
useless 
the report by the general accounting office an investigative 
arm of the congress was presented to the telecommunications 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
shortly afterward sen al gore dtenn issued a statement 
saying the study is badly flawed and virtually useless to 
congress 
gore who has introduced a senate bill to reregulate the cable 
industry and encourage competition called the study results out 
of date and pointed out that the agency had surveyed less than 20 
percent of the industry 
indeed members of the subcommittee itself were critical of the 
report because while it examined rate increases instituted in the 
22 months following deregulation it contained no information about 
cable companies capitalization costs the selling of franchises 
advertising revenue or the industrys financial picture 
the committee chairman rep edward markey dmass asked the 
gao to prepare a second study by next spring addressing a wider 
range of concerns 
there are some things that need to be looked at in a little 
more detail than our study shows conceded john m ols jr 
director of housing and community development issues for the gao 
but he said the survey released thursday was patterned on 
instructions from the subcommittee 
as for the gao data ols said we stand behind those figures 
from a statistical standpoint he said the survey of 1950 of the 
nations approximately 9000 cable operators was roughly a 
national sample we took really more than we had to 
but rep rick boucher dva said he suspected that the 25 
percent of cable operators that did not respond to the survey had 
imposed substantially higher rate increases than those that did 
respond 
the gao report found that the average monthly rate for the least 
expensive basic cable service increased 29 percent from december 
1986 when government regulations were lifted to october 1988 the 
average basic fee rose from 1123 to 1448 during the study 
period the gao said 
despite the stiff increase for basic service the gao said the 
average subscribers monthly bill rose a smaller 14 percent from 
2158 to 2468 
industry representatives told the panel that customers are 
getting a better value for their money now than in 1986 because the 
quality of cable offerings has improved and the average number of 
channels offered by cable systems has risen from 24 to 30 
cable companies channeled 246 million in 1986 292 million in 
1987 and 417 million in 1988 into upgrading equipment and adding 
channels said james p mooney president and chief executive 
officer of the national cable television association 
under deregulation the federal communications commission 
allowed cable television operators who since 1972 had to receive 
permission from local authorities to raise prices for basic 
service to set their own rates

sen jesse helms rnc on thursday delayed 
senate action for at least a month on president bushs nomination 
of a senior black diplomat to be director general of the us 
foreign service the nations professional diplomatic corps 
exercising his rights under the rules of the senate foreign 
relations committee helms put a hold on the nomination of 
edward j perkins until recently the us ambassador to south 
africa 
normally that would delay action for a week only but because 
the senate is ready to leave on its summer vacation helms move 
effectively postpones perkins confirmation for more than a month 
until the beginning of september at the earliest 
helms refused to give a reason for his action 
but he acted after complaining about delays in senate 
consideration of three ambassadorial nominees all major 
contributors to republican campaigns and causes who have been 
rated as unqualified by the american academy of diplomacy 
he also complained that some career foreign service officers on 
a promotion list had been targets of state department 
investigations in the past for alleged expense account abuse 
and he made clear he is also upset that no senate action has 
been scheduled on bushs nomination of donald p gregg to be us 
ambassador to south korea 
in two lengthy senate hearings gregg denied that he while 
serving as bushs vice presidential chief of staff was ever part 
of the secret network set up by former marine lt col oliver l 
north to provide illegal military aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
but sen alan cranston dcalif has said he questions greggs 
truthfulness 
the committee did approve and send to the senate a number of 
diplomatic nominations 
one of the nominees julia chang bloch who was born in china 
and emigrated to the united states as a refugee would be the first 
asianamerican ambassador in us history 
named to be us ambassador to nepal she most recently served 
as an assistant director of the agency for international 
development

politicomilitary affairs eugene p kopp to be deputy director of 
the us information agency usia henry e hockeimer to be an

the federal aviation administration announced 
thursday a design review aimed at increasing the safety of all 
widebodied jetliners bercause of accidents where inflight 
failures damaged control devices 
at the same time a us senator called for the immediate 
grounding and alteration of all widebodied dc10s if news reports 
suggesting flaws in their design are true 
the faa said an industry and government task force would 
recommend whether changes are necessary in all existing and 
future widebody aircraft which would include planes made by 
boeing lockheed mcdonnell douglas and the airbus industrie 
consortium in europe 
tony broderick head of faa safety regulations said he believes 
safety improvements that will ensure against failure of flight 
control systems when another component fails are within the realm 
of technical and economic feasibility 
broderick said in an interview he had no detailed idea of how 
that might be done but expects the best minds in industry and 
government can solve the problem 
the aegncy announcement came two weeks after the crash of a 
united airlines dc10 in iowa that killed 111 people investigators 
believe an explosive engine failure knocked out all three hydraulic 
flight control systems designed to back up each other 
the plane crashed broke apart and burst into flames but 186 
people including the cockpit crew survived 
the faa cited the sioux city iowa crash as well as a 1985 
japan airlines crash of a boeing 747 and a 1981 incident in which a 
lockheedbuilt l1011 lost hydraulic control both dc10s and 
l1011s are no longer in production although hundreds are flown 
throughout the world 
the review will look into survivability of aircraft after major 
inflight structural damage said faa administrator james busey 
busey said the task force will explore ways of improving the 
ability of an aircraft to survive after it suffers major inflight 
structural damage 
the task force will explore feasible improvements to the 
backup flight control systems the faa said 
other aircraft with similar controls to those that failed would 
also be included at a later stage in the study the agency said 
it also will examine engine design with an eye toward possibly 
preventing crippling damage to an aircraft in the event of an 
engine explosion the faa said 
the aviation agency approves design construction testing and 
operation of all airliners used by us carriers and many foreign 
governments follow its lead it now requires that jet engines be 
built to contain fragments of fans compressors or turbine blades 
that may break off in flight 
but the faa said its regulation recognize that there is no 
practical way to contain the parts on which the blades are mounted 
the disks when they fail becuase of their weight and the speed 
at which they travel 
investigators are exploring the possibility of such a failure in 
the iowa crash 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio in a letter to the faa cited 
news accounts saying that if the dc10 had four rather than three 
hydraulic systems as the l1011 does or a shutoff valve to 
prevent hydraulic fluid loss lives might have been saved 
if these allegations are true the faa should ground all 
dc10s and correct their design flaws immediately he said 
broderick speaking for the faa said there are no design 
flaws in the dc10 or any other aircraft presently flying that 
warrant its grounding 
he said the agency would respond promptly to metzenbaums letter

the justice department is reviewing 
antiterrorist laws to determine if a shiite moslem cleryman 
kidnapped by israel can be charged with the kidnapping and murder 
of us marine lt col william r higgins sources said thursday 
the justice department is trying to determine if a case could 
be built for extradition of sheik abdul karim obeid who was 
seized last week by israeli commandos at his home in lebanon said 
a us official 
bringing a case against the shiite muslim clergyman involves not 
only complicated legal but very sensitive political and diplomatic 
issues as well 
if the government decided a criminal case could be made against 
obeid the bush administration would have to decide whether it 
would risk the lives of americans still held hostage in the middle 
east by taking the moslem leader into custody for prosecution 
the fbi meanwhile is reviewing two statutes that empower the 
the arrest detention and prosecution of terrorists for the 
kidnapping of americans overseas and the murder of us citizens in 
foreign countries according to a law enforcement source 
the source declined to describe the review as an active 
investigation saying the bureau was determining if it had 
enforcement jurisdiction 
officials interviewed about the case spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
asked if the bush administration was considering extradition of 
obeid for possible involvement in higgins kidnapping presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the justice department i am 
told is looking into the case 
it is unclear if the statements obeid has made to his israeli 
interrogators so far would provide justice department prosecutors 
with enough evidence to swear out an arrest warrant 
the statements from the interrogation that have been shared with 
us authorities do not amount to anything more than possibly 
aiding and abetting the kidnapping one official said 
it is also unclear whether the statements obeid made to his 
israeli interrogators would be admissable in an american courtroom 
because he was presumably not advised of his right under the us 
constitution to remain silent the official said 
based on interrogations of obeid israeli authorities say the 
three people who kidnapped higgins in february 1988 were in the 
sheiks house before the abduction and one of them returned there 
later 
the car used to kidnap higgins was hidden in obeids garage 
israeli officials have said 
israeli officials say obeid admitted that those who planned the 
1986 capture of two israeli soldiers left from obeids house to 
carry out their mission 
such evidence may not be enough to charge obeid with 
participation in the kidnapping 
whether they can make a case is the crucial fact in 
extradition said another us official who also spoke on 
condition of anonymity to actually use formal extradition you 
to to have a charging document a complaint indictment 
information or something 
in us federal law an information serves the same purpose 
as an indictment but does not involve a grand jury because either 
the defendant has waived his right to grand jury consideration of 
an indictment or a magistrate has found probable cause to believe a 
crime has been committed 
a former federal prosecutor familiar with extradition issues 
said the usisraeli extradition treaty does not contain serious 
legal obstacles to extraditing a terrorist being held by israel 
but the former prosecutor who requested anonymity said the 
real obstacle is israels willingness to give up obeid if it does 
so terrorists holding israel citizens will see israel as 
assisting the great devil and react with no holds barred 
the statutes being reviewed by the fbi were passed by congress 
in recent years in response to terrorist attacks on american 
citizens and officials overseas 
a 1984 statute forbids the taking of americans as hostages to 
compel a foreign government or third party to do or or abstain 
from any act as a condition of the prisoners release the crime 
is punishable up to life imprisonment 
the 1986 law a provision of the omnibus diplomatic security and 
antiterrorism act allows federal prosecution of terrorists who 
murder us citizens overseas the murder or conspiracy to murder a 
us citizen in a foreign country carries a maximum life sentence 
under federal law if investigators could prove that obeid 
participated in higgins kidnapping last year he could be 
prosecuted for the marine officers murder because that killing was 
a consequence of his abduction 
but as fitzwater told reporters at the white house there is 
no warrant for his arrest no charges at this time 
the case would have to be reviewed as a legal matter and 
pursued through normal legal channels

joseph cicippio always worked hard his family says so it was 
no surprise that he left home an hour early on sept 12 1986 for 
his job as acting comptroller of american university 
it also was no great surprise to his relatives that cicippio 
58 was kidnapped at the university gates in moslem west beirut 
which had become a hunting ground for kidnap gangs seeking foreign 
victims 
we kind of expected it his brother thomas 63 said in 
norristown pa we tried to keep him from going to beirut but he 
had made up his mind 
the decade before his abduction was one of great change for 
joseph cicippio 
in the early 1970s he was a norristown bank manager with seven 
children who led a veterans of foreign wars drum and bugle corps 
his travels began after his 20year first marriage ended in 1974 
and a second broke up a few years later 
i think at the time he had a lot of things on his mind just 
wanted to get things sorted out said his first wife theresa 
at the time it appeared to me he just wanted to get as far away 
as he could 
family members say he worked for a helicopter company in 
pennsylvanias bucks county was a shipping manager in jidda saudi 
arabia then for a hotel in london 
he took the job at american university in 1984 after a brief 
stay in california 
none of us wanted him to go but he had applied for the 
job and this is what he wanted his brother said he was used 
to working overseas 
in my view he should have had some fear because we were all 
very concerned but he was the type of person once he made up his 
mind to do something he did it 
joseph cicippio was born in norristown on sept 13 1930 the 
youngest of nine children in a roman catholic family his father 
worked for the pennsylvania railroad 
he graduated from norristown high school and attended banking 
classes at the university of pennsylvania bucknell and rutgers but 
did not receive a degree 
cicippio served in the army in the early 1950s and when he left 
norristown was assistant vice president in charge of an american 
bank branch 
in 1985 in beirut cicippio married elham ghandour a 
25yearold lebanese secretary at the us embassy he was 
kidnapped shortly before he had planned to take her to the united 
states 
helen fazio a sister said he had a lot of work to do that day 
and had left for the university an hour early 
his lawyer james j oliver said cicippio sometimes joked in 
letters about the dangers of beirut 
if things get too bad i may not have any time to do anything 
but just run he wrote on march 25 1985 
the war has been getting hotter in the last two weeks have 
not been off the campus in four weeks the university feels i could 
get kidnapped because of my position nonetheless its safer than 
living in ny ha ha 
on feb 18 he told oliver i am well still ducking from the 
bombing and bullets flying all over the place i hope to be in the 
usa sometime in june

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said thursday that south africantrained police in namibia are 
intimidating the civilian population and should be dismissed from 
duty 
the un chief said the territorys independence plan is on 
track but the biggest problem is the presence of members of the 
counterinsurgency force called koevoet in the namibian police 
force 
koevoet which means crowbar in afrikaans was a force 
organized by south africa to fight guerrillas of the southwest 
africa peoples organization the main group that fought for the 
countrys independence 
koevoet was disbanded last year under the un plan for 
namibias transition to independence from nearly 75 years of south 
african rule but most of its members joined the southwest africa 
police 
in the years preceding implementation of the united nations 
plan koevoet had earned an evil reputation in northern namibia 
perez de cuellar told the security council in a private briefing a 
copy of his remarks was obtained by the associated press 
un officials in namibia have clearly established that 
exkoevoet elements in the southwest africa police have not 
adjusted to the new political situation in namibia and have 
continued to harass and intimidate the civilian population he 
said 
they are not suitable for continued employment in the police 
force under the terms of the united nations plan said perez de 
cuellar 
under the un plan however south africas 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar is responsible for civil 
administration in namibia pienaar has said he will not fire 
exkoevoet members outright but will investigate specific charges 
of mistreatment 
the united nations has more than 5000 soldiers and policemen in 
the territory but their role is largely supervisory 
the chief un administrator in namibia martti ahtisaari said 
that officials who are trying to retrain the 2000 former koevoet 
members say 85 percent of them are illiterate and unable to take 
down a citizens complaint or a crime report 
perez de cuellar said the second major problem relates to south 
africas fear that the guerrillas will invade northern namibia from 
their bases in angola 
more than 1600 armed guerrillas did enter the north in early 
april apparently in an attempt to surrender themselves to un 
peacekeepers hundreds of guerrillas and dozens of namibian 
security forces died in patched battles before calm was restored 
the un chief said he had instructed his officials in angola to 
make sure all guerrillas stay in their bases about 90 miles north 
of angolas border with namibia 
perez de cuellar was briefing the security council in closed 
session on his midjuly tour of namibia and meetings with south 
african officials in pretoria 
the guerrilla movement has suspended its 23yearold war and is 
now a legal political party in namibia 
south africa which has ruled namibia since world war i agreed 
to the un independence plan under the terms of a regional peace 
accord signed in december

a record 34 million fine thursday against a south korean steel 
manufacturer for alleged customsfraud violations the justice 
deparment said

with steel imports from 1980 through 1982 the civil case was filed

customs service false declarations of the price of steel it was 
shipping to the united states to avoid paying duties for 
dumping the product at low prices 
the civil investigation found about 800 alleged violations in 
connection with 235 importations of steel the department said 
the largest customs penalty before thursdays fine was a 25 
million fine imposed in 1982 on volkswagen usa

noncommunist southeast asia 
leaders are disappointed by talks in paris to end 10 years of war 
in cambodia but still hope for a peaceful settlement malaysias 
prime minister said thursday 
the foreign ministers of 19 countries who met this week in 
paris set up working committees to help monitor vietnams 
withdrawal from cambodia and an ensuing ceasefire deal with 
sovereignty questions and plan for repatriation of refugees 
but talks between cambodian premier hun sen and leaders of the 
threeparty cambodian resistance alliance led by prince norodom 
sihanouk reached an impasse july 25 after two days of negotiations 
the talks were aimed at bringing warring cambodian factions 
together and ensuring peace after vietnam withdraws its troops from 
cambodia which it has occupied since december 1978 
we are a little bit disappointed said malaysian prime 
minister mahathir mohammed but we are realistic people we know 
we cant resolve things by sitting and looking at each other more 
discussions are needed 
mahathir made the statement between meetings with indonesian 
president suharto president corazon aquino of the philippines and 
prime minister lee kwan yew of singapore 
mahathir is scheduled to meet prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan of thailand when the thai premier visits malaysia on 
friday 
southeast asian leaders were gathered here for wednesdays rites 
symbolizing the coming of age of the eldest son of bruneis 
sultan hassanal bolkiah 
indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand are 
bruneis partners in the association of southeast asian nations 
the main proponents of the paris conference 
asean china the united states and other western countries back 
sihanouks alliance which includes the khmer rouge whom the 
vietnamese drove from power 
vietnam does not want the khmer rouge blamed for slaughtering 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians during their three years in 
power to play a major role in any new government 
in paris hun sen blamed the faction for the breakdown in talks 
among the various cambodian factions he said the khmer rouge 
refuses to resume the talks 
this is a problem that cannot be resolved overnight or over 
one month mahathir said weve been working on it for years 
a spokesman for suharto told reporters earlier that the 
indonesian president and mahathir agreed during their meeting that 
prospects for peace in cambodia remain good 
but the spokesman moerdiono would not elaborate he said 
mahathir and suharto agreed to meet again in bali later this year 
to review the cambodian situation and discuss other issues

azt the only governmentapproved antiaids 
drug significantly slows progression of the disease when given to 
people with early symptoms according to result from a new clinical 
trial officials said thursday 
the drug was approved for use in people with aids but new trial 
results for the first time show that azt also benefits patients 
with early symptoms of infection with the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv that causes aids 
results were so good the trial has been stopped and patients on 
placebo offered the drug instead 
the finding could potentially benefit an estimated 100000 to 
200000 people with early symptoms of hiv infection said dr 
anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases 
it also emphasizes how critical it is that persons at risk for 
hiv infection be tested and seek prompt medical care fauci said 
this is real good news said frank young commissioner of 
the food and drug administration which he said will work quickly 
to translate these important results into wider availability of 
zidovudine azt for earlier treatment of the disease 
the trial has been underway in 29 locations since august 1987 
according to an announcement late thursday by the department of 
health and human services the parent of both niaid and fda 
the trial included 713 hivinfected people who had one or two 
hiv associated symptoms such as oral thrush chronic rash or 
intermittent diarrhea and levels of immune system cells called t4 
cells between 200 and 800 per cubic millimeter some participants 
received placebos and some received azt over a period of three to 
20 months 
as of july 50 of the participants had progressed to 
aidsrelated complex or aids of these 36 had been taking placebos 
and 14 were on azt 
fewer than 5 percent of the participants experienced serious 
side effects from the azt said margaret fischl a doctor at the 
university of miami who coordinated the trials 
this study clearly shows that early intervention is important 
in hiv infection and that zidovudine is well tolerated in persons 
with early arc aidsrelated complex she said 
on the recommendation wednesday from the data and safety 
monitoring board reviewing the trial data fauci stopped the trial 
because the results were so promising he said all study 
participants now will be offered azt 
azt is manufactured by burroughs wellcome co and is marketed 
under the trade name retrovir it was approved in march 1987 for 
treatment of aids patients who had recovered from pneumocycstis 
carinii pneumonia the leading killer of people with aids and 
patients with advanced arc 
young said we pledge to analyze the data as rapidly as 
presented to us so that we can make the appropriate recommendations 
to practicing phsicians 
it is important to emphasize in the meantime that physicians 
do have the capability of prescribing drugs for different uses than 
are on the label and we fully recognize this on the other hand 
we know the medical community relies on the analysis by fda and we 
want to complete this as expeditiously as possible he said 
in another aids development thursday the fda licensed the first 
diagnostic kit to detect the presence of hiv by detecting the 
proteins or antigens of the virus other licensed kits detect the 
presence of the bodys response the antibody to these proteins 
the kit is designed to help physicians monitor changes in the 
infection rate of people with the virus the kit is not recommended 
for use in screening blood or plasma donations

up to 30000 gypsy fundamentalists 
opened a conference thursday to celebrate a biblethumping 
protestantism they say has made them and their lifestyle more 
acceptable to a stillwary outside world 
more than 4000 caravans mobile homes and circus wagons are 
camped on the outskirts of amsterdam for the fourday world 
conference of christian gypsies 
the fourday gathering will include twicedaily services dozens 
of prayer sessions and plenty of fireandbrimstone preaching 
according to the organizers the frenchbased life and light 
mission 
the rev charles welty a life and light pastor said that 
despite the aura of conservative respectability many old gypsy 
traditions remain including some that are likely to raise frowns 
among more conventional churchgoers 
were first of all gypsies when a french gypsy gets together 
with a dutch gypsy its not a frenchman and a dutchman meeting 
each other its two gypsies welty said 
most of the worlds 40 million gypsies are roman catholics but 
in 1951 life and light began an evangelical movement among 
european gypsies that now claims 100000 members the parisbased 
preacher told the associated press over a beer outside his 
26footlong caravan 
like other fundamentalist protestants the life and light 
gypsies insist that a personal acceptance of jesus and strict 
adherence to the bibles teachings are essential to a believers 
salvation 
but they have maintained their wandering lifestyle and most 
still work as tinkers musicians or itinerant salesmen said the 
burly mustachioed welty as his wife was doing household chores 
in the 5000seat tent that dominates the campsite a group of 
elders debated the days business others sat around a campfire 
played the guitar or repaired their mercedes limousines dogs and 
chickens strutted around everywhere and children cavorted in the 
mud or played chess 
welty 48 maintained that acceptance of the gospel has helped 
us to make ourselves better known to the outside world we have 
preached in their churches and theyve been among us its removed 
prejudices 
he added that the gypsy tradition of fortunetelling has fallen 
by the wayside among converts because it is regarded as the work of 
the devil but said another custom has survived in an adapted form 
under gypsy law a couple get married by the simple act of 
eloping and staying away for four days they still do today but 
marry formally before a minister and civil authorities after the 
wedding is consummated welty said 
conventionally minded protestant preachers are a little 
shocked because its not their way of getting married welty 
said when abraham married sarah they didnt go to the mayors 
office either

former death row inmate randall dale adams 
settled his lawsuit against the man who helped free him the thin 
blue line filmmaker errol morris by getting the rights to his 
life story attorneys said thursday 
adams whose conviction of killing a dallas police officer was 
questioned in morris film will receive full rights to any 
commercial movies or books about his life according to the 
settlement charges against adams ultimately were dismissed 
adams now living in ohio sued morris in houston district court 
on june 22 for rights to the story which depicted his account of 
his arrest and conviction for the murder of a dallas officer robert 
wood 
both sides expressed relief over the settlement thursday and 
each blamed the other for what they termed an unnecessary legal 
action by adams 
im pleased that we were able to settle this but im not 
pleased with the way it had to come about it never should have 
gone to litigation adams attorney randy schaffer said 
after being a prisoner of the justice system for 12 years mr 
adams should not have been required to be a prisoner of errol 
morris for life schaffer said 
morris attorneys released a statement from the cambridge 
mass filmmaker in which he said he had agreed to return the book 
and commercial movie rights to adams 
as part of the agreement morris said adams dropped his demand 
that he be paid 60000 for the thin blue line although 
schaffer said thursday that was never part of the lawsuit 
nothing can erase the terrible tragedy of what happened to 
randall adams in dallas in 1976 and in his subsequent 13 years of 
imprisonment morris said it is my hope that both of us can 
now return to our lives and that we can put this lawsuit behind 
us 
the case was transferred to us district judge lynn hughes 
court june 30 and settlement negotiations continued for about a 
month before all parties completed signing the agreement wednesday 
attorneys said 
adams was freed from state prison in march after an appeals 
court overturned his conviction earlier this year and dallas 
county prosecutors declined to retry him 
the former inmates lawsuit asked for a judgment on who owned 
the rights to his life story 
a written agreement between adams and morris said that adams was 
owed 10 if morris produced a documentary about adams or 60000 
and 2 percent of profits if a commercial film was produced 
schaffer had contended that the thin blue line although 
produced in a documentary style was actually a commercial film 
the film was released in commercial theaters around the country 
i was unwilling to pay money to adams for the thin blue 
line a documentary motion picture for which i received no 
profits and for which i am still approximately 100000 in debt 
morris said in his statement thursday 
i am relieved that this lawsuit has been settled morris 
said in my opinion it was unnecessary and uncalled for it has 
never been my intention to deprive randall adams of the opportunity 
to make money from his life story 
schaffer said the lawsuit became necessary because morris 
refused to yield rights to adams despite attempts at a friendly 
resolution 
adams has received numerous letters of inquiry from filmmakers 
and writers interested in his story and those materials were 
packaged and mailed to him thursday schaffer said 
he has retained the william morris agency to represent him in 
those matters schaffer said i assume he will end up striking 
a deal with somebody there has been a substantial amount of 
interest

a state law requiring criminals convicted of 
sexrelated offenses to be tested for aids was struck down as 
unconstitutional thursday by a cook county circuit judge 
judge patrick morse upheld the right of two chicago prostitutes 
to refuse to submit to the test ruling that the law amounted to 
unwarranted search and seizure in violation of the fourth amendment 
of the us constitution 
the women had pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of 
prostitution 
the law approved by the illinois general assembly in 1987 took 
effect last year was one of a number passed by state lawmakers 
in recent years to deal with the spread of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
al tomaso who prosecuted the case said no decision had been 
made on whether to appeal the decision but defense attorneys in 
the case said he had advised them there would be an appeal 
state rep ralph c capparelli one of the sponsors of the 
legislation said he found it difficult to understand why the judge 
would not allow mandatory testing of prostitutes 
prostitutes are out there making business and they pass the 
disease he said its just one way of trying to control the 
disease 
the american civil liberties union called medical experts who 
testified the law would not prevent the spread of aids 
when someone listens to what an expert evaluation really is of 
forced testing then its quite clear that kind of approach is 
almost never useful said aclu attorney john hammell 
women in prostitution dont want to die from aids either 
condom use among prostitutes is extremely high 
fred wellisch an assistant cook county public defender who also 
worked on the case said the state law was weak in that there was 
no reasonable basis to suspect the prostitutes had aids 
it was just the fact these people fell into a 
classification he said 
under the law a judge must order the aids test if a person was 
convicted of any of 13 sexrelated offenses the judge had the 
discretion to release the results if deemed in the public interest 
thursdays ruling comes as gov james r thompson is considering 
whether to sign legislation repealing a 1988 law that requires 
couples to be tested for aids before being issued a marriage 
license 
a spokeswoman for the governor said thompson had no immediate 
comment on the judges decision

the house voted thursday to make permanent the 
ban on cigarette smoking on airline flights lasting two hours or 
less a restriction the tobacco industry fought two years ago but 
now sees as preferable to threatened broader limits 
the measure would prevent the current ban which covers four out 
of five domestic us flights from expiring as scheduled in april 
in a victory for the cigarette industry however antismoking 
forces were blocked from adding language that would have spread the 
prohibition to all domestic flights 
this is probably the most popular bill weve passed around 
here in two years said rep richard durbin dill sponsor of 
both the existing and the new restrictions 
the extended prohibition was contained in an 119 billion 
transportation bill for fiscal 1990 that the house passed 36650 
the measure will next be considered by the senate where an effort 
is expected to broaden the smoking restrictions 
the key fight on the smoking question occurred wednesday when 
lawmakers adopted the ban on a 259169 vote that vote was a 
procedural one that included other issues but the cigarette 
restrictions dominated the days debate 
when congress enacted the initial ban two years ago the tobacco 
industry actively fought the proposal with claims that growers 
would lose business and assertions that smoking was a health hazard 
were unproven the house approved the ban in 1987 by a slim 198193 
margin 
this year after early votes by house committees indicated that 
lawmakers were not receptive to completely killing the 
restrictions the tobacco lobby decided it could live with a 
permanent extension of the ban on twohour flights the industry 
reasoned that making the restriction permanent would eliminate 
opportunities for the ban to be expanded every time it expired 
they counted noses durbin said of the tobacco industrys 
tactics 
asked about the cigarette lobbys decision to do little to block 
the permanent extension of the ban rep walter jones dnc 
whose district relies heavily on tobacco growing said wednesday 
this is the best compromise we can get 
the bill limits spending to 12 million for the program that 
pays subsidies to airlines serving small communities about 31 
million is being spent this year on the program a tiny portion of 
the transportation budget that bigcity lawmakers say is largely a 
waste of money 
the measure also provides 73 billion for the federal aviation 
administration 960 million more than this year 29 billion for 
the coast guard about 100 million more than 1989 32 billion 
for mass transit and 615 million for amtrak which got 584 
million this year 
the bill provides 119 billion in new spending but also allows 
an additional 153 billion to be spent from revenues from various 
user fees

a federal judge thursday ordered a us art 
dealer to return to the greek orthodox church of cyprus four 6th 
century mosaics purchased for 11 million last summer in 
switzerland 
us district judge james e noland said in his ruling that peg 
goldberg of suburban indianapolis never obtained proper title to 
the artworks and has no right to possess them 
the court finds that the evidence and testimony of the 
plaintiffs is more credible and persuasive noland said the 
plaintiffs have made a proper showing in all respects for the 
return of the mosaics 
we never had any doubts that the mosaics were unlawfully 
stolen and illegally taken away from cyprus president george 
vassiliou said in a statement issued by the government news agency 
in cyprus 
we always had confidence in the american courts and in that 
sense we can say that the decision of the court comes as no 
surprise but it still fills us with joy because it shows that 
despite difficulties despite adversity justice at the end 
prevails 
michael e sherifis who presented his credentials thursday to 
president bush as the cypriot ambassador to the united states 
called the mosaics an invaluable and integral part of our rich 
cultural heritage 
it will have a great impact on the flow of stolen art around 
the world added june walton a washington attorney for the 
cypriots certainly it will make purchasers think twice before 
they buy stolen art 
ezra h friedlander an indianapolis attorney for ms goldberg 
said his client was very upset 
she feels wronged by the decision he said she doesnt 
think the decision reflected what the evidence presented 
friedlander said an appeal was likely 
goldberg who is coowner of goldberg and feldman fine arts inc 
in carmel bought the mosaics in july 1988 from aydin dikman a 
turk living in germany who claimed he was a former archaeologist 
for the turkish republic of northern cyprus 
the mosaic fragments each roughly 2 feet square were taken 
from a larger work on the ceiling of the panagia kanakarai church 
in northern cyprus in 1979 three years after greek cypriots fled 
the area 
dating back to the year ad 525 the mosaics depict christ as a 
boy the apostles james and matthew and an archangel they are 
among only a few to have survived the rule of the iconoclast 
byzantine emperors of the eighth century who ordered such images 
destroyed 
ms goldberg borrowed 12 million from an indianapolis bank to 
purchase the mosaics she paid 11 million for the art then used 
120000 to pay for the shipping and restoration of the mosaics 
which are stored in an indianapolis bank vault the rest of the 
money was used to cover her expenses 
ms goldberg offered the mosaics last january to the j paul 
getty museum in malibu calif for 20 million the museums 
curator marion true contacted authorities in cyprus who said the 
antiquities had been stolen according to a deposition 
the church and the cypriot government filed suit against ms 
goldberg and her dealership last march the trial began may 30 and 
lasted six days 
during the trial ms goldberg maintained that she bought the 
mosaics in good faith and had tried to determine whether they were 
stolen 
she said the cypriots had not notified interpol customs 
officials in europe or the united states or the international 
foundation for art research that the mosaics were missing 
ms goldberg said she relied solely on ifar a new york 
clearinghouse for information on stolen art which had not 
registered the mosaics as stolen property 
although indiana law does not allow the purchase of stolen 
property under any circumstances ms goldberg and her attorneys 
claimed that swiss law should apply to her case because she had 
purchased the art in switzerland swiss law allows the purchase of 
stolen art if such transactions are made in good faith 
noland however ruled that goldberg is not a goodfaith 
purchaser under swiss law 
the judge said suspicious circumstances surrounding the sale of 
the mosaics should have caused an honest and reasonaably prudent 
purchaser to doubt whether the seller had the capacity to 
convey property rights 
noland also said ms goldberg failed to conduct a reasonable 
inquiry to learn whether the art work was stolen 
noland said in his ruling that further proceedings might be 
needed to determine damages any remaining claims and the transfer 
of the mosaics

police officers from throughout the country 
voted thursday to back legislation being considered by congress to 
restrict ownership of military assault weapons as long as officers 
could still buy them 
this is not gun control but commonsense gun legislation to 
protect the police and the citizens dewey stokes of columbus 
ohio national president of the fraternal order of police said 
after the vote 
there are some of our brothers who have not yet had this 
problem and i hope they never do stokes added but we have to 
do what we can do to help our brothers and sisters who face these 
weapons 
it was an emotional issue for the delegates at the groups 49th 
biennial convention although all outsiders were barred from state 
fair arena while resolutions were debated it was possible for 
people outside to hear some of the arguments 
at one point after the assault weapons resolution was declared 
adopted some of the delegates roared a demand for a count of 
hands after minutes of confusion and shouts from the floor a 
decision was made to pass by the resolution so delegates could 
study it further 
it was brought back up more than an hour later and passed on 
what sounded like a very close voice vote 
i think that once they realized that this would not prevent 
their brother officers from purchasing such weapons many of them 
changed their minds stokes said 
theyre coming across the border with military weapons 
argued duane wilson from pima county ariz who said he and his 
fellow officers had to patrol thousands of miles infested by drug 
smugglers 
wilson said his county which covers nearly 10000 square miles 
probably was the nations no 3 area for illegal drugs imports 
and a number of our officers already have purchased assault 
weapons a lot more are going to have to 
in addition to approving restrictions on the ownership transfer 
or sale of assault weapons the delegates easly adopted resolutions 
calling for a sevenday waiting period for the purchase of guns and 
opposing any weakening of current laws dealing with ownership of 
machine guns and silencers 
and they went on record for a boycott of any music group that in 
their songs advocated assaults on police 
the resolution originally was targeted only toward a rap music 
group known as nwa the delegates were told that one of that 
groups songs called on young people to go out and kill a cop 
 
after one delegate heatedly called the original resolution 
racist it was amended to cover any group that advocated assaults 
on police the amendment also called on police to refuse to provide 
security for such groups

hurricane dean veered away from the 
us virgin islands and puerto rico on thursday carrying its 85 
mph winds farther out to sea and reducing the threat to the florida 
coast forecasters said 
they said the seasons second hurricane would probably sweep 150 
miles north of puerto rico on its way up the atlantic ocean 
the national weather service lifted hurricane and flood warnings 
for all the islands of the eastern caribbean including the virgin 
islands and puerto rico where authorities had begun putting 
emergency measures into effect 
the puerto rican national guard canceled plans to evacuate 2000 
people from floodprone areas 
a hurricane watch was issued for the turks and caicos islands a 
british colony at the southern tip of the bahamas chain 550 miles 
south of miami a watch which is less serious than a warning 
means hurricane conditions could pose a threat to coastal or inland 
communities 
dean turned toward the bahamas but was expected to resume its 
northwesterly course out to sea later thursday the weather service 
reported 
at 9 pm edt the hurricanes center was at latitude 201 north 
and longitude 640 west or 175 miles northeast of san juan puerto 
rico dean was moving northwest at 5 mph 
bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla said puerto rico and the us virgin islands could 
get some heavy rain and gusting winds but no real problems 
the biggest problem in the islands is usually flash floods and 
mudslides so there is some potential for that he said but 
its not going to be as if the core of the storm was coming across 
there 
sheets said the storm which had been heading toward florida 
was curving to the north away from land and did not pose an 
immediate threat to the us mainland 
it is not a problem for the next two to three days and 
probably will not become a problem he said there is still a 
chance it might get blocked and turned back to the west but thats 
unlikely at this moment 
the storm strengthened overnight as it zigzagged westnorthwest 
of the leeward island chain missing the nearest island barbuda 
repeated warnings on television and radio that dean was headed 
for the virgin islands and puerto rico caused a shopping rush as 
people stocked up on food drinking water and buckets batteries 
candles and tape 
in san juan a city of 11 million people the windows of many 
houses and condominiums were taped or boarded up and some 
businesses closed 
government workers on both us islands at first were given the 
day off but later those in the virgin islands were told to report 
for work 
dean grew into a tropical storm monday night

an economic agreement with the international monetary fund that 
will allow the country to receive more than 4 billion in new loans

suspend debt interest payments to keep the countrys money reserves 
above an adequate level brazil paid less than half the 812

according to the central bank 
the congress is not willing to impose more sacrifices on the 
brazilian people in order to pay the debt said sen franco 
montoro

equipment bought by the lab in addition stump did not tell the 
truth to investigators when asked whether other employees knew 
about procurement fraud the prosecutor said no charges were filed 
in connection with those allegations

senators expressed doubts thursday about 
claims of innocence from us district judge alcee l hastings of 
miami as a panel of 12 lawmakers in his impeachment trial finished 
gathering evidence against him 
i just have problems fitting together your actions sen joe 
lieberman dconn said as lawmakers asked their final questions 
of the 52yearold jurist accused to taking part in a 150000 
payoff plot 
sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of the panel expressed 
doubts about the judges explanation of how information may have 
found its way from his miami courtroom to a washington lawyer 
soliciting a bribe he added it seems to me this is a major 
problem in our ability to believe your case 
sen arlen specter rpa said he wondered if documents 
hastings offered in an effort to refute claims by prosecutors were 
an after the fact contrivance 
lawmakers and lawyers stayed late thursday for closing arguments 
to enable the 12member senate panel to wrap up its work a day 
before the scheduled start of the congressional recess which will 
last through labor day 
a report on weeks of hearings by the panel is to be prepared for 
offering to the whole senate to lay groundwork for a vote on 
removing hastings from the federal bench and depriving him of his 
89500 annual salary 
hastings was impeached by the house a year ago on charges of 
plotting with washington attorney william borders to obtain a 
150000 bribe lying to a jury that acquitted him in 1983 and 
improperly disclosing wiretap information 
borders who unlike hastings was convicted in the case has 
refused to testify before the panel lawmakers say the 
oncepolitically influential attorney is risking jail for contempt 
heres a man who literally walked the corridors of the white 
house lieberman remarked 
in their closing arguments prosecutors from the house of 
representatives battered away at hastings explanation that he knew 
nothing of any bribery plot and that borders claimed to be able to 
influence his actions as a way of drumming up business 
they said there was too much evidence to explain away and that 
the explanations are not plausible for example borders boasted to 
an fbi undercover agent masquerading as a convicted racketeer that 
he could make hastings appear in any restaurant on any day and time 
of the racketeers choosing 
hastings did appear on schedule in the main dining room of the 
fontainebleu hotel in miami beach at 8 pm on sept 16 1981 the 
judge says borders had merely invited him there for a social 
meeting 
prosecutors note that the attorney set the time and place 
without consulting hastings the judge made a reservation for two 
himself and a woman companion and that he made little if any 
effort to hunt for borders when the attorney failed to show up 
the tangled web of alcee hastings now unravels in the senate 
of the united states declared rep george w gekas rpa as 
congressmen prosecuting the case made their closing arguments 
attorney terence anderson defending hastings struck at what a 
number of senators have conceded to be the circumstantial nature of 
the evidence 
this is a man who in my view is touched with greatness 
anderson declared and you must decide are you satisfied is 
there that degree of certainty on this occasion that you are 
willing to say he should be thrust aside and consigned to infamy

the bush administration called thursdays 
reprieve in the threatened execution of hostage joseph cicippio 
an encouraging and hopeful development but said it did not 
fulfill us demands for the release of all the hostages 
the announcement by cicippios captors lowered tensions at the 
white house and elsewhere but it appeared unlikely to lead to an 
immediate recall of us naval power converging on the eastern 
mediterranean a precaution taken in the event cicippio were killed 
and president bush ordered a military strike 
i urge everyone to keep in mind especially in regard to the 
ships that we still have a serious problem in the middle east 
said bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater hostages are still being 
held he said adding that he did not expect any quick changes 
in the military deployment 
earlier fitzwater said bush had made preliminary decisions of 
every kind about how the united states would respond if 
terrorists killed cicippio following the reported monday execution 
of marine lt col william r higgins 
thursday was the threatened execution date of cicippio by the 
revolutionary justice organization however 45 minutes before the 
deadline the radical group said it would spare his life 
temporarily 
the captors indicated cicippio still could be killed within 
days unless israel met new tougher terms including release of 
unspecified palestinian and lebanese guerrillas originally they 
had demanded only the release of a shiite moslem cleric kidnapped 
by israel abdul karim obeid 
fitzwater asked whether the united states was considering 
seeking extradition of obeid from israel for trial in connection 
with possible involvement in the kidnapping of higgins said the 
justice department i am told is looking into the case 
a federal law enforcement source said the fbi was reviewing 
statutes to determine if the murder of higgins was a violation of a 
1986 antiterrorist act 
there was an obvious sense of relief in washington that cicippio 
had been spared 
i would guess just offhand it could ease the tensions 
said senate minority leader bob dole rkan it might give 
diplomacy a chance to work 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said were 
all gratified of course at the socalled extension 
mitchell said that the obviously proper and humane course of 
action would be to release mr cicippio and the other innocent 
persons who are being held hostage and we hope very much that will 
be the result 
at the white house fitzwater said we regard this as an 
encouraging and hopeful development 
but it still does not answer our continuing concern for 
release of all hostages fitzwater said in a written statement 
we urge that all parties in the region use whatever influence 
they have to end the tragedy of hostage taking and to release those 
remaining in captivity and we express our appreciation to all 
those who have been thus far trying to help 
fitzwater said the president made telephone calls to at least a 
dozen leaders in the middle east and elsewhere over the past two 
days 
i dont think we had any signals from any of the heads of 
state that cicippio was about to be spared the press spokesman 
said 
the us diplomacy was aimed at friends and foes alike 
fitzwater said it was impossible to say what prompted the 
reprieve for cicippio we certainly think the diplomatic 
overtures made a difference but we cant read hezbollahs mind and 
they havent told us he said 
asked if the soviet union had been influential he replied 
its difficult to say we have had some feedback from the soviets 
that indicated they were sympathetic to the problem 
fitzwater said the blitz of diplomatic contacts and intense 
focus on the issue may open up some opportunity over the long 
haul in resolving the hostage problem 
its impossible to point to any specific improvement but the 
hope it it wont settle back to the way it was i dont think 
were back at square one he said 
as parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani was sworn in as irans 
new president the united states made an open appeal for his nation 
to turn away from the radicalism of the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini iran is believed to exert considerable influence over the 
kidnappers in lebanon 
we certainly are hopeful that the elevation of rafsanjani is a 
positive sign for us relations said fitzwater adding 
however that our optimism is very guarded 
nevertheless fitzwater said we are hopeful that his presence 
would spell some opening for a changed relationship with the west 
and feel there must be some cracks in the structure that khomeini 
created against the united states 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler asked about 
irans role in the situation indicated that authorities there were 
trying to be helpful 
we have been in touch with iran through a variety of channels 
and at this time have no reason to believe that iran is not dealing 
with this matter in a serious way she said she added that the 
soviet union has tried to be helpful and that syria has expressed a 
similar desire 
while insisting that bush had not made a final decision about 
military action fitzwater said all of the foundation planning 
has been done and consideration of every scenario has been taken 
military sources speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
the aircraft carrier coral sea was within striking distance of 
lebanese shores carrying some 65 planes including fa18 attack 
fighters and a6 bombers 
the carriers battle group was bolstered by the nuclearpowered 
cruisers mississippi and virginia as well as the aegis cruiser san 
jacinto also in the area 
nbc news reported thursday night that jets from the coral sea 
were electronically sparring with air defense systems in lebanon 
racing towards the coast to get syrian batteries to turn on their 
radar that would enable spy plans to analyze the radar signals and 
later use the same signals to jam the defense systems during an 
attack 
lt cmdr edward lundquist a pentagon spokesman said we 
dont discuss operations i cant confirm the network report 
the new york times said in friday editions that bush had all 
but decided to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern lebanon 
including the baalbek base of 2000 iranian revolutionary guards 
if a hostage had been killed 
a white house spokesman reached at home thursday night who 
spoke only on condition of nonidentification said to my 
knowlegde that is not true but added we just dont discuss 
those sorts of things 
the flagship of the 6th fleet the guidedmissile cruiser 
belknap was on station east of crete with fleet commander vice 
adm james d williams aboard the sources said 
steaming towards lebanon from the midmediterranean was the 
battleship iowa armed with 16inch guns and bristling with harpoon 
and tomahawk cruise surfacetosurface mssiles the tomahawks have 
a range of some 450 nautical miles 
the aircraft carrier america which broke off its port call in 
singapore earlier this week was headed across the indian ocean and 
expected to be on station in the north arabian sea in about four 
days the sources said 
that places the carrier with about 85 planes within range of 
possible targets in the persian gulf and iran the sources said

romania has recalled its ambassador to 
budapest for consulations to protest a interview broadcast by 
hungarian television with exiled romanian king michael state radio 
said thursday 
the report did not say when romanias ambassador traian pop 
would return to budapest 
the move marked a blow to already strained relations between the 
two warsaw pact countries over alleged discrimination against the 
17 millionstrong hungarian minority in romania 
romanian president nicolae ceausescu also opposes hungarys 
economic and political reforms 
romania said the interview part of which was broadcast on july 
31 included antiromanian antisocialist and fascisttype 
attacks against the independence and sovereignty of romania 
the hungarian foreign ministry said in a statement reprinted by 
the state news agency it is unacceptable that statements made by 
the hungarian media are viewed in bucharest as reflecting official 
hungarian views 
hungarian television on july 31 carried an excerpt from its 
interview with the exiled monarch the full program is scheduled to 
be broadcast within the next two weeks 
i have always as a monarch supported human rights and 
restored the 1923 romanian constitution which strengthened the 
role of parliament and stipulated some rights and freedoms king 
michael said in a part of the interview in romanian 
the present leadership in bucharest is an absolute monarchy a 
dynasty the members of which all rule at the same time bleeding 
the country dry 
the implication was that by contrast his was an enlightened 
monarchy 
king michael toppled romanias pronazi leader gen ion 
antonescu in 1944 and signed a peace treaty with the allies but 
the communistdominated government forced him to abdicate in 1947 
the interview was recorded two weeks ago at king michaels 
residence outside geneva

the playboy channel the troubled 
cabletelevision arm of playboy enterprises inc will be folded in 
december and replaced with a new payperview television service 
playboy announced thursday 
playboy also announced that it will launch a new onehour 
european television show this fall titled playboy late night 
because european broadcast standards are less stringent than those 
in the united states the magazineformatted show will include 
nudity but no explicit sex 
playboy has already reached agreements in principle with 
television companies in italy france and spain for playboy late 
night said christie hefner playboys chairman and chief 
executive officer 
the name of game we think is to find multiple outlets for 
product hefner said and because playboy has differentiated 
product and a global trademark were in a pretty good position in 
that regard 
hefner said that launching a payperview service with an entire 
evenings entertainment for a flat fee was more economical than 
retooling the companys struggling paysubscription cable channel 
there is much more opportunity for us by running a playboy 
service as a payperview service than as a subscription service 
she said its pretty obvious that the cable industry is not 
perceiving the paysubscription business as a growth business no 
one is launching new paysubscription services 
hefner said that the new playboy service will be available in 
25 million homes with payperview capability making playboy the 
thirdlargest payperview service 
the playboy channel launched in november 1982 claims 400000 
subscribers said playboy spokesman bill farley it has been 
plagued by a high churn rate in which cable subscribers sample 
the service but drop it 
hefner said that playboys payperview will run 10 hours a 
night and feature original programming and quality rrated 
movies such as crimes of passion and betty blue

roman catholic bishops in this central 
american nation said thursday that because of the political 
violence coupled with labor unrest day by day guatemala is 
falling more deeply into chaos 
the paralyzing of essential services such as mail telegraph 
education and public works and the violent death of a noted 
politician are signs of a profound breakdown of the national 
situation the bishops statement said 
they recalled the bleak days of the early 1980s when political 
slayings by the hundreds and the militarys bloody campaign against 
foes or suspected foes of the government made guatemala an 
international pariah 
remembering the vivid horrors of only a few years ago and in 
fear of returning to those tragic days we turn to god in 
humility the bishops said 
the only civilized way to find just and equitable solutions is 
a frank sincere and respectful dialogue 
about 50000 government employees including teachers and postal 
workers have been on strike for nearly two months for higher 
wages president vinicio cerezo has rejected the demands saying 
the government doesnt have the money 
the strike has closed public schools nationwide and brought mail 
service to a halt daily demonstrations by strikers have snarled 
traffic in the capital and blocked border crossings into mexico 
the strike and the violence that followed it have raised fears 
about the stability of guatemalas fledgling civilian government 
cerezos inauguruation in 1986 came after more than 30 years of 
military or militarydominated rule in guatemala he has survived 
two military coup attempts in 14 months and said recently he was 
the target of a rightwing assassination plot 
in the past few weeks dozens of bombings and bomb threats and 
several killings have hit this nation of about 9 million people 
including the slaying tuesday of danilo barillas a leader in the 
governing christian democratic party 
students sympathizing with the strikers on thursday freed the 
rector of the university of san carlos roderico seguro and about 
50 other university officials after holding them hostage for 24 
hours 
hector adolfo cifuentes the university secretary said none of 
the hostages were harmed 
fourteen public school teachers also ended an 18day hunger 
strike in guatemala citys main plaza outside the national palace 
mario guillermo munoz a strike leader told reporters they 
ended their fast because they had made their point the 14 on 
the verge of collapse were given first aid by red cross volunteers 
and rushed to the hospital 
negotiations continued between strike leaders and government 
officials without cerezo who walked out early wednesday saying he 
was fed up 
education minister ricardo gomez galvez said he was optimistic 
about reaching an accord striking teachers said in a statement 
they might consider going back to work if the government reinstated 
500 fired strikers 
the military on thursday blamed sundays shooting death of 
refugee leader marco juan baltazar on leftist rebels 
baltazar represented repatriated guatemalans on the national 
reconciliation commission set up to discuss an end to the 
27yearold civil war which has displaced tens of thousands of 
people

in passing the 295 billion military 
authorization bill the democraticcontrolled senate sets the stage 
for a clash with the house over key elements of president bushs 
strategic weapons programs 
the senate which approved the bill 954 wednesday left 
relatively intact the dollars and the structure of the strategic 
weapons programs the house last week made deep cuts denounced by 
the white house as irresponsible both in terms of national security 
and arms control 
in my judgment this will be the most difficult conference in 
a decade said sen john warner of virginia ranking republican 
on the senate armed services committee but im confident that we 
can emerge with a bill which will meet the presidents basic policy 
goals 
its going to be very difficult said sen sam nunn dga 
the committee chairman there are more profound differences with 
the house than we have had for a long long time

hauling garbage in the same trucks that carry 
food to stores is like serving potato salad from your cats 
litter box an educator says but truckers say its common and 
food manufacturers want to put a stop to it 
the idea of garbage being hauled in food trucks seems more 
than disgusting said rep william clinger rpa who organized 
a hearing wednesday by a house public works subcommittee it 
seems dangerous 
would you serve potato salad from your cats litter box 
asked penn state university food science professor manfred kroger 
two truckers testifying from behind a screen to conceal their 
identities told the subcommittee they hauled garbage in 
refrigerated food trucks which also are used to carry meat 
poultry dairy products fresh fruits and vegetables to market 
campbell soup co heinz usa geo a hormel amp co and 
hershey chocolate usa are among at least a dozen food producers 
taking steps in the last two months to ensure that their products 
are not carried in the same trailers that haul waste to landfills 
according to correspondence from the firms released by the 
subcommittee

elaine chao has always been comfortable with 
numbers but the highest ranking asianamerican in the bush 
administration says shes still learning to deal spontaneously with 
the problems of running an agency with 100000 employees 
the deputy transportation secretary who spoke no english when 
she came to america as a thirdgrader in 1961 aboard a freighter 
went from a career in private banking to head the federal maritime 
commission in february she was nominated by president bush to the 
no 2 job in the farreaching transportation department 
in her mid30s ms chao is described in a department biography 
as the youngest deputy secretary in the administration 
she has represented the department in white house cabinet 
meetings traveled to oil spill sites given speeches around the 
country and in an emotional moment visited a memorial honoring 
the 270 victims of pan am flight 103 in lockerbie scotland 
when a united airlines dc10 went down in sioux city iowa last 
month killing 111 people she went to the white house to monitor 
news of the crash and brief chief of staff john sununu as 
developments unfolded 
sitting in her transportation department office on a soft couch 
under a delicate chinese painting handed down by her grandmother 
she cuts an image in sharp contrast with fastmoving backslapping 
transportation secretary samuel skinner a former federal 
prosecutor 
she describes herself as wellorganized and structured framed 
signal flags on her wall express a major goal smooth sailing 
i like to be prepared ms chao said but im learning how 
to handle things a little bit more spontaneously 
she praises skinner as a man of vision and a man of great 
courage at a time when the nation faces crises and challenges in 
air sea and land transportation skinner has been overseeing 
cleanup of the alaskan oil spill helping to lead international 
efforts against air terrorists pushing for tighter mileage 
standards for automobiles and trying to put together a national 
transportation policy 
the secretary moves at 800 miles per hour so his deputy has 
to be able to pick up the ball and run with it said catherine 
bedell ms chaos press deputy 
as deputy secretary ms chao is chief operating officer for an 
agency that has 100000 employees and a 284 billion annual 
budget with responsiblity for program and policy guidance over 
surface sea and air transportation 
ms chao said that as a student a banker for bankamerica and 
citicorp and as a maritime commissioner and commission chairman 
she had always been able to read enough and learn enough to know 
issues better than most people around her 
now she said the transportation department covers such a wide 
range of issues that she has to depend more on her staff 
born on taiwan of parents who fled mainland china ms chao said 
that although she has had little involvement in asian issues she 
remains proud of her chinese heritage and grateful for the 
sacrifices of her parents who took the risk of coming to america 
she recalls learning english by copying strange words off the 
blackboard and having her father painstakingly translate them for 
her at home so she could learn her lessons 
america has been the land of golden opportunity for our 
family she said at ceremonies where thenvice president bush 
swore her in as maritime chairman we came with our hopes dreams 
and aspirations and america received us with open arms and with 
her opportunities her values and her decency 
her parents james and ruth chao live in harrison ny where 
he is a businessman they have four other daughters including one 
still in high school 
im actually very comfortable with numbers said ms chao

the ways bugs bite sting and pinch are as varied as the insects 
among the most common pestiferous bugs 
mosquitoes with its annoying itch persistent whine and 
syringelike mouth the mosquito is one of mans universal 
scourges more than 2000 species thrive in the united states alone 
most mosquitoes live only a few weeks the average female lays 
more than 100 eggs which can lie dormant for a year in some 
species only the female requires a blood meal males eat pollen 
and nectar 
the female inserts her mouth into the victims skin and secretes 
an anticoagulant ensuring a steady stream of blood bug experts 
believe this anticoagulant causes the itch 
ticks the tick is like a miniature tank and perhaps more 
impregnable with eight legs no antennae or wings few natural 
predators and remarkable abilities to multiply and survive long 
periods without food ticks are considered by entomologists to be 
one of natures most adaptable creatures 
the common american dog tick for example produces 5000 eggs 
at a time each larva must find a host animal to feed upon 
soviet scientists have kept members of one tick species alive for 
14 years without food said robert hall professor of entomology at 
the university of missouri in columbia 
the tick mouth includes a central needle covered with barbs to 
lock it in place like a fishhook once attached the tick exudes a 
gluelike liquid that also helps prevent dislodging a tick 
infected with diseaseproducing organisms can infect the host when 
it feeds 
numerous tick species are found in the united states most of 
which live in woodsy surroundings although they can be transported 
by animals 
flies a plague recorded from biblical times flies fall into 
two categories those that thrive on garbage and waste and those 
that bite thousands of species abound 
flies that breed on filth dont bite or draw blood although 
they can spread disease if they land on an open wound 
male and female biting flies such as the stable fly feed on 
blood they have piercing mouthparts and feed like the mosquito 
most flies lay rapidly hatching eggs in summer a housefly will 
hatch in 12 hours it reaches adulthood in about 10 days

imagine youre surrounded by hordes of 
roaches flies mosquitoes fleas moths beetles and a couple of 
dozen hairy tarantulas devising new ways to kill or repel them 
its a way of life for the scientists at the sc johnson wax 
entomology laboratory the biggest corporate research facility 
devoted to the demise of biting and annoying pests to these 
antibug commandos who helped develop such pioneering products as 
raid and off the battle never ends 
people ask if insects are going to take over the world they 
already have says lab director roger grothaus who has studied 
bugs for more than 25 years 
john randall a senior research scientist at the lab said the 
33 johnson wax entomologists have a healthy respect for the 30 
species of bugs that live there which form a population exceeding 
35 million 
these are high quality insects randall said we think of 
them as precision lab instruments we know exactly how old each 
cockroach is 
the lab consists of several buildings in a suburban neighborhood 
near racine headquarters of johnson wax a privately owned 
consumer products company 
johnson wax does not disclose its bugstudy budget but company 
spokeswoman cynthia georgeson said it allocates more money for 
research and development on urban entomology than all competitors 
combined 
like the members of his staff grothaus is fascinated with bugs 
and the ingenious ways they survive on his desk sit metal 
sculptures of a grasshopper and a scorpion and he drinks from a 
mug illustrated with insect drawings the workers keep a tank of 
hairy tarantulas as lab mascots 
working with entomology lets you stay like a kid grothaus 
said its like being the 8yearold kid who runs around with a 
jar collecting bugs 
in an average week approximately 100000 houseflies and 150000 
mosquitoes are hatched for testing as well as more than 50000 
cockroaches of the american and smaller german varieties 
lab rooms are specially designed for insect habitat their 
temperatures set at 80 degrees with 50 percent relative humidity 
the flea testing area uses an apparatus that the researchers 
call an artificial cat they place fleas in tiny containers 
with cat hair and the fleas pierce a skinlike surface to feed on 
blood 
the researchers scrutinize the insects 365 days a year and even 
though the labs hold racks of containers with thousands of flying 
bugs company officials report few escapees 
i get bit more on the outside than in here randall said 
tests range from freeing houseflies in chemicalfilled cubicles 
to spraying a persons arms with repellent and sticking them into a 
mosquito swarm if a product successfully passes through several 
experiments its tested in homes 
formulas for the insect sprays however must be changed 
routinely because the bugs are so good at adapting to different 
environments grothaus said 
aside from studying ways to kill insects with chemicals the 
center is researching the behavior of insects and ways to modify it 
did you know you can condition a cockroach grothaus said 
now if you could just teach them to leave the house 
one new product devised by johnson wax uses mild electrical 
currents to disrupt the equilibrium of houseflies which then 
crashland on a sticky surface grothaus said the company is 
marketing the product as a safe way to keep kitchens flyfree 
one of the toughest jobs however is finding ways to rout the 
cockroach an insect that arouses particular disgust for grothaus 
i truly dont like them he said i consider them filthy 
grothaus said he thinks the typical household cockroach inspires 
revulsion because it crawls in garbage and then it goes onto your 
plates 
if you see a big bad ugly spider you might be startled 
he said but then the next day you tell people i saw the 
biggest spider but you dont go telling people gee whiz i have 
a house full of cockroaches 
some of the rarer roaches however are treated more fondly at 
the lab 
the scientists keep a container of 4inch madagascar hissing 
cockroaches and randall said theyre viewed more as pets than 
research tools 
these are oh my roaches he said people say oh my 
when they see them

savagely attacking poland a 
halfcentury ago adolf hitlers armies sparked a conflagration 
that killed more than 50 million people and spread worldwide in 
historys costliest war 
world war ii drew in every major power leaving behind a bitter 
legacy from fighting and holocaust that shape the thinking of 
nations to this day 
the reverberations range from the tensions between the 
capitalist west and communist east to lingering uneasiness over the 
possibility of ever reunifying the two germanys 
and there are more individual problems such as in japan with 
the diplomatic difficulties that arose over the attendance of 
foreign dignitaries at the funeral of emperor hirohito last 
february and in austria where president kurt waldheims war 
record as a german officer is under divisive scrutiny 
the holocaust the nazis extermination of an estimated 6 
million jews shocked the world like no other atrocity known to 
mankind and still casts the longest shadow of the war 
last november philipp jenninger had to resign as speaker of the 
west german parliament just 48 hours after making a clumsily worded 
speech that sought to explain the german peoples antisemitism and 
fascination with hitler 
however good his intentions jenninger offended many germans 
jewish and nonjewish 
the war is remembered too in small daytoday details like 
the seats reserved for war invalids on french trains or the 
christmas tree in londons trafalgar square an annual gift from a 
grateful norwegian people for the british war effort 
it was an arena for giants good and bad hitler winston 
churchill josef stalin franklin roosevelt and it produced 
postwar leaders such as charles de gaulle architect of modern 
france and marshal josip broz tito who ruled yugoslavia until his 
death in 1980 and helped found the movement of nonaligned nations 
every nation shapes its own lessons from the war often with 
distortions or exaggerations 
for the french there is the painful knowledge that ones 
parents or grandparents may have collaborated with their nazi 
conquerors 
for eastern europe decades of official heroworship of the 
soviet forces are giving way to greater objectivity in large part 
as a result of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
openness 
in the vision of the war we used to get only the russians 
were brave in fighting the germans said anna radziwill who has 
taught high school history for 30 years and was elected to polands 
newly created senate 
the vision of the west was that they were just sending us 
canned food said ms radziwill a member of one of polands old 
noble families 
german sailors aboard the old battleship schleswigholstein 
fired the first shots of world war ii shelling a small polish 
garrison at westerplatte near the free city of danzig at 445 am 
on sept 1 1939 the german army poured across the polish frontier 
while hitlers warplanes pounded the country from overhead 
two days later britain and france declared war on germany but 
not until 1941 did the fighting become a true world war with the 
german invasion of the soviet union and the japanese attack on the 
us fleet at pearl harbor in all more than 50 nations joined the 
fighting 
still uneasy neighbors 40 years after their creation the two 
germanys present vastly different accounts of world war ii and its 
causes 
in communist east germany a high school textbook from 1986 
states world war ii was unleashed by german imperialists and 
militarists spurred by a desire for profits and conquests 
but just over the border teenagers in west germanys hesse 
state are taught that nazism was an allembracing affair a 
terrible aberration to which an entire people was able to be driven 
by ideological blindness ignorance and cowardice 
revised history books for soviet high school students still 
insist moscows forces defeated japan virtually singlehanded even 
though the kremlin did not declare war on japan until three days 
after a us bomber dropped an atomic bomb on hiroshima 
the textbook for the 11th grade says that the use of the 
atomic weapon was not militarily necessary 
by this crime unprecedented in the history of mankind 
imperialist circles in the usa wanted to demonstrate its 
thenstrategic superiority before the whole world the textbook 
says 
but soviet students do learn that their countrys agreement to 
divide up poland with the germans was unjust 
in warsaw a newly emboldened communist government is moving 
closer to blaming the soviets for the massacre of more than 4000 
polish officers in katyn to reverse the official line that the 
nazis did it would constitute a monumental act of historical 
revisionism in east european minds 
momo kapor a bestselling yugoslav author and satirist summed 
up the distortions of the past this way during the past 40 years 
or so grandpas and grandmas uncles and old aunts have been 
correcting secretly official lessons from textbooks 
from our earliest days to finish school somehow we had to 
pretend that we believed in official stories while in fact we 
believed in things that were forbidden kapor said in a recent 
column in the belgrade daily newspaper politika 
while britain remains unabashedly proud of its wartime role 
other western european nations such as france and italy have had 
to face up to the darker side of their war record 
france was easily defeated in 1940 and was then divided into an 
occupied zone and a french puppet regime headquartered in the town 
of vichy the germans later occupied the whole country 
historian henri rousso said in an interview that many fellow 
frenchmen have long thought their country was made up mostly of 
brave resistance fighters who ultimately helped the allied victory 
he said textbooks began to tell a different story in the early 
1970s 
french nazi hunter serge klarsfeld said many french people do 
not know that the country actively collaborated with the germans 
and thanks to de gaulles diplomatic genius many french people 
think that france really won the war 
the period was like a civil war with two opposite camps de 
gaulle and the resistance on one side and the vichy 
collaborationist regime on the other klarsfeld said in an 
interview 
alessia jannece a high school student in rome said they 
really dont teach us much about fascism i learn mostly from tv or 
what i remember from middle school 
the lessons are important for a country haunted by its past 
under fascist dictator benito mussolini professor renzo de 
felices highly respected 1982 biography of mussolini contends 
there was general consensus for fascism in italy 
last years 50th anniversary of austrias annexation by nazi 
germany and a select commissions finding that waldheim was in 
close proximity to nazi war crimes also prompted soulsearching 
although the second world war is now far distant its shadows 
are long its echoes loud british historian martin gilbert says 
in a new history of the war how else could it be with an event 
lasting for nearly six years in which courage and cruelty hope 
and horror violence and virtue massacre and survival were so 
closely intertwined

at times adolf hitlers legacy is 
painfully visible across the landscape of western europe 
other times you must look twice and you will still not see it 
so farreaching has been western europes transformation from 
rubble to riches 
in west berlin the black stunted steeple of the kaiser wilhelm 
gedaechtniskirche has been deliberately left unrepaired as a 
reminder of the war while the rest of the city is full of posh 
shopping centers and trafficchoked streets 
young skiers and model airplane enthusiasts atop the teufelsberg 
could easily forget that the 360foot hill is a pile of 
grassedover bomb rubble 
londons east end heavily bombed in the war is now the site of 
europes largest urban redevelopment project although work is 
occasionally delayed when an unexploded german bomb is discovered 
the dutch belgian and french coast lines are dotted with 
fortifications the nazis built against an attack from the west but 
many others were removed to make room for seashore apartments 
hotels and amusement parks 
near the southern dutch town of den bosch a former 
concentration camp has been transformed into a housing project 
europeans older than 50 can still remember digging makeshift 
homes out of the rubble eating dogs and cats begging gis for 
chocolate bars 
whole towns were flattened london alone endured 57 consecutive 
nights of bombing during the blitz in which 15000 people died 
today the 320 million west europeans enjoy a standard of living 
surpassed in the west only by the united states 
the economic jumpstart for the postwar miracle was us aid 
through the marshall plan and other programs which by 1952 had 
poured 45 billion into europe 
it was followed in 1957 by the creation of the european 
economic community 
now comprising 12 countries britain france west germany 
italy spain portugal greece ireland the netherlands belgium 
luxembourg and denmark the eec accounts for 20 percent of world 
trade compared with 13 percent for the united states and 12 
percent for japan 
more important than statistics however is the fact that by 
interweaving their economies the western europeans have made war 
among themselves unthinkable 
the road to european integration is littered with disputes about 
everything from farm prices to the color of the european passport 
but the success story is still being written 
the eecs internal borders are scheduled to come down by 1992 
creating a single tarifffree trading bloc this is to be followed 
by monetary union including a central bank and eventually a 
single european currency

the opening shots of what would become the worlds most 
devastating war wasnt enough to displace the classified ads that 
filled the front page of the times of london in those days 
at war with germany the headline proclaimed spread over 
two columns on page 8 
two days earlier readers of moscows izvestia had to turn to 
page 4 to find a terse piece on the german invasion of poland on 
sept 1 1939 the start of a war that eventually would claim at 
least 14 million soviet lives the headline military action 
between poland and germany 
on the same day the nazi party newspaper voelkischer 
beobachter hardly made plain what was behind the german invasion 
the fuehrer announces the struggle for the rights and security 
of the reich said the redink banner headline counterattack 
has started added a smaller subtitle reflecting german 
propaganda claims of polish border violations 
some commentators on both sides thought the conflict could be 
contained 
said a wishful editorial in the koelnische zeitung of cologne 
the voluntary confinement of our strategy and the respect of 
belgian dutch luxembourg and swiss neutrality by germany could 
make it easy for london and paris to let the germanpolish conflict 
pass as a local dispute 
in paris le temps commented we are certain that the 
government will do everything to avoid a catastrophe if this is 
possible the entire country stands behind it to fight for the 
freedom of the peoples and its own independence but it is ready 
too to listen to all voices that may still be raised in favor of 
appeasement 
but the new york times warned against further yielding to the 
nazis 
the german government has used its strategic position in the 
center of europe to blackmail the small countries on its borders 
it has used every sign of hesitation on the part of its larger 
neighbors every offer of mediation on their part and every 
gesture of good will as a wedge for ever greater demands and 
threats and seizure 
the times of london had led the british press in calling for the 
appeasement in the 1930s but now it had no doubts 
britain and france will not cease from war until the defeat of 
hitler and their duty to themselves and the civilization have been 
fully and finally accomplished they have entered upon the war 
without illusions no setbacks no sacrifices will turn them from 
that end

everybody has a solution for getting rid of 
fishmunching sea lions at seattles ballard ship locks so far 
everybodys been wrong 
a biological consultant wants to put the bewhiskered mammals on 
a diet by putting the fish out of reach greenpeace says feed them 
more fish other folks have suggested killer whales polar bears 
and even alligators to scare them 
state officials say theyve tried everything feasible and are at 
wits end after four years of firecrackers painful underwater 
noises barrier nets and transporting the animals all the way to 
the pacific ocean coast only to see them swim hundreds of miles 
back to their easy seattle supper 
those four years effort cost more than 200000 and officials 
have spent more than 70000 this year said joe scordino of the 
national marine fisheries service theyre smart animals they 
adapt very quickly and theyre very keen and sensitive to 
everything in their environment 
now frustrated wildlife managers are seeking permission to kill 
the animals before they eliminate a valuable run of steelhead trout 
the sea lions may be pushing a unique strain to extinction 
and must be stopped for steelhead populations to return to normal 
in the lake washington watershed said bob byrne of the state 
department of wildlife 
steelhead are migratory fish born in streams and spending the 
first two years of their lives in fresh water before swimming out 
to sea they live in the ocean for two years then return to their 
birth streams to spawn the sea lions 39 different animals have 
been trapped so far wait for returning fish in the narrow locks 
that connect puget sound with lake washington 
the wildlife department has asked federal permission to to kill 
the sea lions and scordino said it may be allowed to do so under a 
public health safety and welfare clause in the marine mammal 
protection act 
if given the ok the state would kill the sea lions if no 
other option were available to protect that run of steelhead 
byrne said about half the 250 people attending a public hearing in 
june favored killing them he said 
an answer is expected from the marine fisheries service this 
month 
greenpeace spokesman ben deeble warned that the environmental 
group would do whatever it takes to prevent the killing of sea 
lions 
the ballard locks steelhead arent worth saving since they have 
mingled with fish released from hatcheries and are no longer truly 
wild he said if they want more steelhead to get past the sea 
lions at the ballard locks they can do it by putting more 
steelhead in the system 
jim neilsen head of the state migratory fish program said the 
steelhead have retained a separate identity in spawning time if 
theyre not identical to the native fish theyre certainly 
successors to them 
wild fish are important because as indicators of environmental 
quality byrne said because they exist and can actually thrive 
in the watershed we see we are doing a pretty good job of managing 
that environment 
biologist steve shanewise of olympia said killing sea lions 
wouldnt solve anything others will continue to find the locks 
requiring more killing 
the problem is an artificial habitat where the fish are 
confined in a narrow place said shanewise president of coot 
co a consulting firm fish in the wild can hide beneath logs and 
other obstructions he said but those in the locks have to run a 
straight shot through the gauntlet of sea lions 
at the june hearing shanewise and colleague bill way presented 
a plan to build an artificial cover for the fish including an 
internal wall of prison bars parallel to the channel walls at 
the locks the bars would run from the surface to the bottom 
spaced far enough apart for fish but not sea lions 
the plan was a real good idea but its going to be 
expensive byrne said it will go into an environmental 
assessment along with others received before aug 15 which is to 
be reviewed before a decision is made

researchers who created geneengineered cells 
immune to a class of viruses that causes footandmouth disease and 
diarrhea say it could lead to farm animals that are hereditarily 
immune to such diseases 
researchers yehudit chebat and michel revel of the weizmann 
institute of science reported that they have created a gene that 
immunizes cells and that they have produced a line of 
virusresistant hamster cells 
cells were rendered immune by introducing an altered gene which 
triggered the production of antiviral enzymes revel said the 
next step is immunizing a whole animal through a genetic 
engineering process known as transgenics 
that entails removing a newly fertilized egg from an animal 
inserting the altered gene and reinserting the treated egg into a 
fostermother the newborn animal would be expected to have the 
immunizing gene throughout its body 
it will then posses a genetically inspired resistance to a class 
of viruses called picornaviruses which cause diseases such as 
polio and the common cold in humans the animal would pass on this 
immunity to its offspring 
commercial production of virusresistant animals which may 
prove ethically controversial is years away 
his type of genetic engineering is also theoretically possible 
with humans revel said but it would be ethically 
inconceivable to attempt such an experiment 
until now the only genes that produced antiviral enzymes were 
those treated with interferon a protein known for its 
virusfighting abilities the newly created gene operates without 
prompting from interferon 
the altered gene known as the 258synthesis is also unique in 
that it does not adversely affect the normal activities of the 
cell a hurdle that had previously proved insurmountable the 
researchers said 
revel predicted that with adequate funding the research team 
would be able to produce a fully resistant farm animal in two to 
five years 
similar research involving a different virus of the influenza 
family is being conducted at the university of munichs center for 
molecular biology the 2yearold project uses similar techniques 
to genetically modify mice 
that experiment has proved inconclusive because the hopedfor 
resistance has not been strong enough said ernst winnacker the 
munich centers director in addition creating genetically altered 
animals has aroused considerable controversy in west germany 
winnacker said we have a series of selfimposed guidelines on 
genetic research the west german cabinet recently recommended that 
these guidelines be made into law 
the limitations unlikely to take effect for two years would 
not affect research under way he said adding he has no doubt 
commercially producing genetically altered farm animals will be 
extremely controversial 
amos shapira an expert on biomedical ethics at israels tel 
aviv university said stringent precautions should be observed by 
the scientists in cases where altering genes are involved he 
advocated limiting altered animals to the laboratory for several 
generations to study potential side effects 
revel said the genes used in his experiment are taken from a 
human

after missing out on the last 14 lunar 
eclipses north america on aug 16 will get its first glimpse in 
seven years of the earths shadow slowly advancing across the face 
of the moon 
recent lunar eclipses have been visible only from the eastern 
hemisphere because that was the side of earth facing the moon or 
they have begun before moonrise or ended after the moon set 
astronomers say 
for the past seven years weve been in the wrong place for 
all 14 lunar eclipses said university of florida astronomer 
billy cooke this time we happen to lie smack dab where you want 
to be to see the whole darn thing and it will be a spectacular 
sight 
the east coast will have the best view of the eclipse which is 
expected to turn the moon orange or bloodred at its peak viewers 
on the west coast will be able to see only the tail end of the 
eclipse 
the full moon will darken slightly beginning at 823 pm and 
will be its most brilliant from 1020 to 1156 pm skywatchers 
will be able to see the earths shadow taking bites out of the 
moon cooke said but instead of being black where the bite is 
the moon will glow orange or red 
earths atmosphere bends light onto the surface of the moon 
causing the orangered color he said 
unlike solar eclipses lunar eclipses can be watched with the 
naked eye as well as through binoculars or telescopes

girls who get bad sunburns as teenagers double 
their risk of dangerous melanoma skin cancer later in life a new 
study shows 
sunbathing should be recognized as a potentially hazardous 
behavior conclude brigham and womens hospital researchers the 
findings add to growing evidence that sunburn during childhood and 
adolescence is especially dangerous 
the study found that teens who got five or more blistering 
sunburns between ages 15 and 20 had twice the risk of melanoma as 
those who avoided bad burns 
it turned up no evidence of a link between blistering sunburns 
after age 30 and skin cancer but researchers cautioned that this 
doesnt mean unlimited sunbathing is safe for older people 
the analysis directed by dr martin a weinstock was based on 
130 women with melanoma who participated in harvard medical 
schools longrunning nurses health study 
the doctors recommended that people try to stay out of direct 
sun between 10 am and 3 pm when the sun is strongest and 
cover up with clothing and sunscreen they noted that the incidence 
of melanoma is increasing rapidly and is likely to exceed colon 
cancer among people born after 1950

monte briner was trapped in a silent world where 
he couldnt sing write letters or talk to his children he now can 
talk to the world with a computer system developed to help lou 
gehrigs disease victims 
it was a godsend to us said his wife debbie a month 
after we got the computer monte lost his voice completely 
briner 47 has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which destroys 
nerve cells controlling almost every muscle within two to five 
years while leaving a persons mental capacity intact there is no 
known cure 
using communimate briners eyebrow muscles send commands from 
a sweatband he wears 24 hours a day to the computer which has a 
menu of over 2000 words 
with it he can write letters or talk to his daughters 
elizabeth 5 and emily 9 more importantly he can signal nurses 
in times of crisis 
it gives off an earpiercing house alarm hes set it off 
several times during the night one particular time it saved his 
life when it alerted people that a breathing tube was 
disconnected mrs briner said 
the former hospital executive an excellent athlete was 
diagnosed in 1984 and given no more than four years to live as his 
condition deteriorated his wife began to look around for some way 
to communicate with her husband 
she settled on the 4yearold system designed by steve wells and 
tim ryan it uses an applecompatible computer printer monitor 
voice synthesizer and switches to control up to 250 household 
appliances it can be used by anyone who can move onesixteenth 
of an inch anywhere on the body wells said 
briner has developed a menu system of commonly used phrases and 
questions a medical menu and a sports and trivia file 
this is a breakthrough for patients who have no hope said 
wendy fisher executive director of the les turner als foundation 
which rents it for 25 a month sixteen other people are using the

whenever christopher marten posed for a 
picture his parents would say close your mouth stick your 
tongue in 
for christopher downs syndrome made that a struggle 
the genetic disorder meant saliva would trickle from his mouth 
his teeth were unevenly spaced and a large protruding tongue 
threatened to dislodge his front teeth a dentist and orthodontist 
suggested tad and karen marten allow corrective plastic surgery to 
reduce the size of his tongue 
while plastic surgeons admit they cant cure downs syndrome 
they say a procedure known as craniofacial reconstruction may 
increase their patients selfesteem by giving them more normal 
facial features 
we are trying to simply change those characteristics that make 
the children look like they have down said dr kenneth salyer of 
dallas but he urges parents not to expect a change in their 
childs intelligence 
therein lies a controversy some doctors and parents believe 
that when surgery is done on down individuals for mainly cosmetic 
reasons society will expect too much from mentally retarded 
children made to look normal 
most plastic surgeons who treat down children believe improving 
their appearances lessens prejudice toward the one in 800 people 
born with it they also say it helps raise societys low 
expectations of down children and helps ease them into the social 
and educational mainstream 
such surgery for down children began in the mid1970s in europe 
so were really just beginning to see studies about the effect 
not only the functional improvement for the children but more 
importantly their psychological and intellectual capabilities when 
theyre older said plastic surgeon michael stalnecker at 
columbiapresbyterian medical center in new york city 
the national down syndrome congress doesnt advocate the surgery 
but does encourage thoughtful investigation to find the most 
appropriate team to assist you in the investigation said diane 
crutcher executive director 
that team would ideally include not only the plastic surgeon 
but also a psychologist and speech therapist 
certain characteristics make down children easily recognizable 
their intellectual abilities are stunted they develop slanted 
eyes flattened nose bridges protruding tongues small sometimes 
rotated ears disproportionately low on their heads generally 
chubby appearances and short broad fingers 
as recently as the 1970s they were institutionalized by doctors 
who felt nothing could be done and parents who couldnt cope with 
the idea of a lessthanperfect child but the 80s have brought 
research showing early intervention helps down children thrive 
outside institutions 
downs hasnt kept christopher 20 from being a boy scout 
swimmer bowler drummer church acolyte and usher or member of the 
chappaqua drama group and volunteer fire department he has also 
collected a special olympics athlete of the year award and holds a 
parttime job at a fastfood restaurant 
christopher enjoys the lifestyle of most any normal young man 
though he cant read or realize when he doesnt have enough money 
for something 
weve always encouraged him to do whats possible says tad 
he is very selfconfident and has a good selfimage he thinks 
hes hot stuff 
christophers surgery was done in september 1984 at new york 
university medical center one of the leading centers for 
craniofacial reconstruction by dr joseph mccarthy a prominent 
plastic surgeon 
we had no guarantees of the outcome but we knew that the 
tongue would be so swollen it would be difficult for him to eat 
karen says adding that christopher was drinking milkshakes by the 
time he returned home 
a 1986 israeli study found that reducing the size of the tongue 
improved speech made eating easier and eliminated drooling said 
stalnecker adding he believes that many parents seek to eliminate 
traits others find troubling 
in christophers case however it was strictly to save his 
teeth karen says theres no dramatic change in his speech 
but people who have known him say they understand him better on the 
telephone 
salyer head of the international craniofacial institute in 
dallas has treated more than three dozen children and says there 
is no evidence supporting parents belief they can understand their 
children better after the surgery 
it depends on what was done and how your particular child 
heals says a guidebook for parents published by the foundation 
for craniofacial deformities 
only a relatively small percentage of down individuals make 
acceptable candidates for the surgery said dr garry brody 
associate clinical professor of surgery at the university of 
southern california 
it should only be performed on children whose social 
interaction can be improved by the procedures he noted in the 
israeli study rehabilitation of the face in patients with downs 
syndrome 
some downs children have a relatively high iq and function 
relatively well in society he said these children are truly 
handicapped by the stigma of their appearance and do benefit from 
the surgery 
the cost can vary depending on where the surgery is done and the 
doctor doing it there is debate over whether parents should bear 
the cost or health insurers who now make the decision on a 
casebycase basis 
if were doing it to correct a functional defect then it 
should be covered if its for strictly cosmetic reasons it may 
not be covered said attorney austin rinella of the new york 
insurance department 
if we start paying claims that are purely elective not 
medically necessary premiums will skyrocket said rinella 
elective surgery will adversely affect everybody in the insurance 
pool 
frances cooke macgregor an anthropologist and authority on the 
psychological effects of deformity believes even if there are few 
functional improvements to be gained the other benefits are 
plentiful 
they become more socially acceptable and if they have 
siblings the siblings feel better too siblings dont feel 
that this is rubbing off on them they dont feel maybe ashamed or 
afraid or guilty or unhappy 
the best time to have the surgery done stalnecker said is 
about age 5 when children are just becoming aware of their 
differences in appearance before classmates begin to ridicule 
the child about his appearance and before the child begins to 
develop any type of complex about it 
it is difficult he acknowledged for parents to make a decision 
on whether to permit surgery before children are able to express 
their own feelings 
and parents might reject surgery if they know their child will 
be limited intellectually he said they feel that if the child 
is made to look normal he wont have any excuse for any behavior 
that isnt considered normal 
if a child has traits typically associated with downs then 
everyone says oh well i can understand that he doesnt have 
his full intellectual capabilities but if he looks normal they 
say whats wrong with that person and the behavior is not 
accepted

the internal revenue service has billed exxon 
corp and texaco inc for more than 11 billion in back taxes but 
both of the huge oil companies said they would challenge the claims 
in court 
the claims concern oil the companies purchased from saudi arabia 
a decade ago at prices below those set by the opec oil cartel and 
in turn sold to refiners at those lower prices 
texacos claims could total nearly 18 billion including 863 
million in back taxes and 925 million in interest while exxon 
said wednesday it was being billed 269 million in back taxes but 
declined to give an interest figure 
theyre trying to get us to pay for something we never earned 
and which the american public benefited from said exxon 
spokesman bill smith we sold oil at lower prices the american 
public got the benefit of those lower prices 
texaco based in white plains ny said the company 
vigorously disputes the irss interpretations of the law and will 
contest the agencys position 
the irs had notified texaco about possible claims stemming from 
the earlier oil transaction with the saudis during an audit last 
year in connection with texacos chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
the claims are based on an irs theory concerning the handling of 
crude oil purchased from saudi arabia during 19791981 when the 
official price set by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries was 34 per 42gallon barrel 
saudi arabia opecs largest exporter was selling its crude for 
28 a barrel to texaco exxon mobil corp and chevron corp its 
four partners in the arabian american oil co 
one provision of the arrangement was that if any of the 
companies resold the oil they could not resell it at a profit 
texaco said the irs apparently believed that when it resold the 
crude to its foreign affiliates it should have charged the 34 
rate despite the restrictions by saudia arabia and paid taxes on 
the difference 
because it did not texaco said it is being held liable for 
taxes on the profits that its foreign affiliates made by being able 
to sell refined products made from the cheaper saudi oil 
the irs is saying you have used too low a price in 
calculating your profit youve calculated according to a 28 
oil price but really it should be 34 thats all the irs is 
saying said paul ting analyst with oppenheimer amp co 
irs officials have declined to comment on the matter saying 
federal law prohibits the agency from commenting on the affairs of 
any taxpayer 
analysts said it was not unusual for the irs to contend that a 
multinational company had wrongly booked to its foreign affiliates 
revenue that actually should be attributed to the parent and 
therefore taxed in the united states 
texaco maintains that the irss position is wrong and that it 
cannot tax the company for revenues it never received when it 
resold the arabian crude oil and which under mandate of the saudi 
arabian government it could not receive the company said in a 
statement 
texaco began setting aside reserves to cover its possible 
liability last year when the irs notified the company that it could 
owe back taxes 
exxon also was notified of possible tax claims but said at the 
time that it would not set aside any money because it believed the 
new irs theory was flawed and that if the irs did lodge a claim it 
would be dismissed by the tax court 
both companies said current reserves were adequate to cover any 
tax liabilities stemming from the claims 
exxon said wednesday it filed a petition in us tax court late 
last month challenging the irs claim after being notified june 29 
that it owed the taxes texaco said it planned to file a formal 
challenge within 90 days

the mexican government has announced tax 
breaks to lure back money that investors took abroad to escape 
mexicos financial crisis and made a deal with auto manufacturers 
to offer lowpriced compact cars 
a recent agreement on reducing the 107 billion foreign debt 
has generated confidence in mexico and desire among many 
investors to repatriate their capital the treasury department 
said wednesday in a statement 
the measures apply to capital returned to the country after jan 
1 1989 
officials hope the debt reduction agreement signed with foreign 
creditor banks last month will ease economic uncertainty and 
stimulate the private investment needed to revive mexicos stagnant 
economy 
the agreement gives the more than 500 creditor banks the options 
of writing off 35 percent of mexican debt lowering interest rates 
to 625 percent or granting mexico new loans it covers 53 billion 
of the debt which is the secondhighest in the developing world 
after brazil 
under the treasury department decree deposits abroad over the 
past three years earned no taxable income 
it establishes a 37 percent tax on deposits or investments made 
abroad in 1985 and a 5 percent tax for those made before 1985 the 
maximum income tax for private indivduals is 40 percent 
a second decree wednesday provides tax exemptions for lowpriced 
compact cars and imported component parts used to make them it 
applies to cars that sell for no more than 5500 and use lowlead 
gasoline 
the high prices of vehicles are outside the reach of most 
national consumers the decree said 
volkswagen whose popular beetle is the lowestpriced 
mexicanmade car immediately took advantage of the new regulation 
setting its new price at 20 less than the 5500 limit and 1377 
below its previous price 
morgan guaranty trust one of mexicos main creditor banks 
estimates that 84 billion in capital left the country between 1977 
and 1987 but a private economist estimated the figure at about 50 
billion 
capital flight began when after years of stability the peso 
currency was devalued against the us dollar in late 1976 
in 1982 overborrowing abroad and falling oil prices quickly 
deflated the countrys oil boom mexico could no longer keep up 
with its foreign debt payments and the currency began a slide 
in late 1982 about 70 pesos were equal to one us dollar but 
that rate is 2500 to one today

the board of avon products inc plans to discuss 
an unwanted 41ashare 285 billion takeover proposal from 
investor irwin l jacobs who has indicated hes prepared to 
persevere to gain control of the cosmetics maker 
as the board holds a regular meeting today at avons 
headquarters here members are expected to renew their resolve to 
keep the company on its current course 
jacobs bid represents the third unsolicited offer for avon this 
year 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive issued a 
brief news release wednesday in which he revealed jacobs request 
for a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase of avon the worlds 
biggest direct sales company 
preston said the request would be reviewed at the boards 
meeting and that he had sent a letter to jacobs informing him that 
in the past board members stressed that avon is not for sale 
jacobs who oversees his investment empire from minneapolis 
said in a telephone interview wednesday that hes never been in a 
better position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicated 
he would be tenacious in his quest for avon 
weve had the best year weve ever had jacobs said all 
these things play a part i have never been more serious about a 
commitment in my life 
in three separate deals in the past year jacobs and investment 
partners reported making more than 164 million 
jacobs offer for avon is worth about 225 billion based on 
5491 million shares of common stock outstanding jacobs also said 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that he 
contemplates redeeming avons preferred shares which would cost 
3350 per share or a total of about 603 million raising the 
price tag on avon to roughly 285 billion 
in composite new york stock exchange trading wednesday avon 
stock jumped 1 to 3650 a share on word of jacobs proposal 
but investors may have refrained from bidding avon sharply 
higher due to past disappointments the company has slammed the 
door on at least two suitors in recent months 
in may the avon board rejected a hostile 39ashare bid from 
rival direct selling company amway corp and indicated that it 
would resist future acquisition attempts 
only days later mary kay corp parent of doortodoor makeup 
seller mary kay cosmetics inc disclosed its interest in acquiring 
avon but also got a cold shoulder 
although amway withdrew its bid of about 21 billion the 
company still has a stake in avon 
through a partnership with jacobs amway has an interest in 
about 103 percent of avons common stock outstanding jacobs 
controls about 55 percent of the avon stock owned by aj 
partnership as the alliance of amway and jacobs is called 
the partnership didnt act jointly in making the initial bid for 
avon and jacobs said they are not acting together now 
if he prevails in his takeover attempt jacobs said he would 
keep avons core directselling business in the united states and 
retain a significant interest in the companys international 
division 
there are about 475000 avon sales representatives operating in 
the united states and 1 million selling avon cosmetics toiletries 
and jewelry in foreign markets 
jacobs said if he gets control of avon he would sell avons 
retail division which consists of some of the countrys 
bestselling perfumes sold at department store counters including 
giorgio beverly hills and red 
he also would finish divesting the health care businesses that 
avon has been selling 
the divestitures have been part of avons strategy to enhance 
profitability in the second quarter avon earned 395 million on 
sales of 778 million compared with a loss of 825 million and 
sales of 704 million a year earlier 
jacobs said he had no intention of selling any piece of avon to 
amway or to mary kay he said he has not had any contact with avon 
executives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his 
letter 
jacobs said he has hired an investment banking arm of citicorp 
to help him arrange financing for the allcash offer for avon

the six defendants convicted of racketeering in 
the landmark princetonnewport securities fraud case must forfeit a 
total of 38 million significantly less than what the government 
wanted a jury ruled 
federal prosecutors had asked that the defendants relinquish 
salaries and other interests of more than 21 million 
the largest forfeiture amount decided wednesday 3 million was 
against james sutton regan a former partner in princetonnewport 
partners lp a defunct securities house 
his partnership interest was placed at 133 million and his 
salary at 175 million 
four other defendants were each ordered to forfeit 200000 
they are former drexel burnham lambert inc trader bruce lee 
newberg and former princetonnewport partners charles m zarzecki 
jack z rabinowitz and paul a berkman 
the sixth defendant former princetonnewport controller steven 
b smotrich must forfeit 124585 the jury ruled 
we thought that what the government asked for was 
exorbitant said juror michelle rodriguez 
another juror judith t larabee said she was not comfortable 
having to decide the forfeiture question 
it is just very difficult for a lay person no matter what 
their education and background to assess something like forfeiture 
when you are dealing with such large sums of money she told the 
new york times 
defense attorneys who have said they will appeal the 
conviction argued that the forfeiture the government sought was 
excessive and violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual 
punishment 
after the forfeiture verdict assistant us attorney mark 
hansen said he planned to file a motion that said the defendants 
were liable under the racketeering statute to forfeit all the 
partnership interests and salary that the government sought 
us district judge robert carter indicated that he agreed 
im definitely going to rule that way if the government makes 
a motion carter said in my view the partnership interest is 
totally forfeitable 
the judge then softened his remarks by saying he would review 
the matter when both sides submitted written arguments 
on monday the jury in us district court in manhattan 
convicted the defendants after a fiveweek trial of racketeering 
racketeering conspiracy conspiracy and numerous counts of mail and 
wire fraud 
the jurors returned to court to consider forfeiture because the 
federal antiracketeering law allows it 
the case marked the first time securities professionals were 
accused of racketeering under the controversial law aimed at 
combating mobsters and drug pushers the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations law provides heavy fines and lengthy prison 
terms 
the trial received widespread attention because it grew 
indirectly out of the ivan boesky insidertrading scandal that 
rocked wall street three years ago 
were pleased with the verdict because we hope it sends a 
strong message to the securities industry that the justice 
department is committed to a course of vigorous enforcement said 
us attorney benito romano 
when asked about criticism of use of the racketeering statute in 
this case romano said we will use the rico statute where 
appropriate we never viewed the rico statute as being on trial in 
this case 
the government had sought 25 million from newberg and the 
following forfeiture from the other defendants zarzecki 11 
million partnership interest and 267483 in salary rabinowitz 
791191 partnership interest and 454507 in salary berkman 
762613 partnership interest and 558328 in salary and smotrich 
124583 in salary 
the case involved a series of prearranged stock transactions 
between 1984 and 1986 the government alleged that the defendants 
illegally bought and sold stocks to generate phony tax losses 
the case overlapped the governments 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment of former drexel junkbond chief michael 
milken much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at 
milkens trial scheduled to begin in march 1990 
princetonnewport based in princeton nj and newport beach 
calif went out of business after the indictment was brought last 
august defense lawyers said at the time that the charges alone 
though unproven destroyed the firms ability to do business 
besides forfeiture the defendants face up to 20 years in prison 
on each of the two racketeering counts three to five years for the 
other charges and fines carter scheduled sentencing for oct 16

private pension funds are losing billions of 
dollars through corruption says a labor department study that 
warns of a possible scandal to rival those involving the savings 
and loan industry and the department of housing and urban 
development 
the vulnerabilities in this assetrich employee benefit plan 
arena today are being exploited by a new generation of racketeers 
attorneys bankers accountants investment advisers raymond 
maria the labor departments acting inspector general told a 
house subcommittee on wednesday 
losses from the misuse of pension funds could total 4 billion 
twice the estimated losses in the hud scandal according to a labor 
department study cited by rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of 
the house government operations subcommittee 
the level of corruption among 870000 private pension plans has 
mushroomed despite enactment of the 1974 employment retirement 
income security act the subcommittee was told 
when similar early warnings were ignored about the savings and 
loan industry and about hud program administration the cost to the 
american taxpayer and economy became staggering lantos said 
maria said there are several parallels between the savings and 
loan crisis and problems that have surfaced in reviews of pension 
plan audits 
among them are the size of the amounts of money involved he 
said noting pension funds hold about 17 trillion in assets 
compared with nearly 1 trillion in federally insured deposits held 
by sampls 
also he said the government ultimately must insure pensioners 
against the loss of promised benefits just like sampl depositors are 
insured against the loss of their deposits 
however maria said there are fewer than 300 federal auditors 
examining pension funds about onetwelfth the number of federal 
sampl examiners 
maria said efforts by his office to address the problem have 
been frustrated by opposition from officials in a department 
which historically has turned its back on criminal sanctions 
he cited a justice department opinion last march sought by the 
labor departments former solicitor that limited his offices 
investigative role to unionaffiliated plans 
in a sample study of 168 private pension plans with 67 billion 
in total assets marias office found 187 million in misused 
funds that was either lost or undisclosed in private audits by 
public accountants 
the independent auditors failed to perform suggested audit 
procedures in 31 percent of the cases he said and 51 percent of 
the audits lacked one or more disclosures required under the 1974 
pension law 
further we found that independent audit reports do not give 
a fair opinion of the state of these plans because pension law 
and labor department regulations allow limited scope reviews 
maria said 
those audits omit examination of any pension plan assets held in 
trust by banks insurance companies sampls and other financial 
institutions regulated by the government he said he suggested the 
pension law be changed to eliminate exemptions in auditing 
procedures 
maria said labor secretary elizabeth dole and her staff appear 
sensitive to the problem in direct contrast to previous 
years but added he remains skeptical that recommendations for 
reforms will be adopted 
deputy labor secretary roderick dearment questioned whether full 
audits would be worth the cost but said his department is examining 
the proposal 
he also characterized as an historical phenomenon marias 
complaint that the department has thwarted the pursuit of criminal 
charges for violations of pension and other labor laws 
i certainly dont have any aversion to criminal 
investigations dearment said stealing from pensioners is 
about as odious a crime as i can imagine

a move to make a large california thrift a 
bank may deprive the troubled savings and loan insurance fund of 
millions of dollars and raise the taxpayer cost of the sampl bailout 
officials say 
members of congress who oversee banking agencies criticized the 
move wednesday but said the federal home loan bank board may not 
have had a choice 
the bank board ruled that home federal savings and loan 
association of san diego the eighth largest sampl in the nation 
could leave the insolvent federal savings and loan insurance corp 
the move comes as the house prepares to pass a massive bailout 
of the sampl industry 
the legislation in response to the worst financial crisis since 
the depression would pump an immediate 50 billion into government 
deposit insurance funds depleted by hundreds of sampl failures due to 
poor and often fraudulent loans 
it also would institute a major overhaul of the governments 
regulation of the nations nearly 3000 thrifts and require their 
owners to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk 
home federal is only one of several big sampls trying to escape 
fslic and join the federal deposit insurance corp the commercial 
bank fund that charges its members less for the same federal 
insurance of 100000 per account 
but a bank board attorney said the home federal decision which 
must be ratified by the fdic and by state regulators in a process 
expected to take at least several months doesnt set a precedent 
making it easier for other institutions to flee 
nevertheless the ruling is generating criticism in congress 
as part of the price for the bailout sampls will continue to pay 
higher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years even 
if they convert to a bank 
home federal is hoping to escape the higher premiums under a 
provision of a 2yearold bill that permits institutions to leave 
provided they applied before march 31 1987 home federal filed its 
applications a day before the deadline 
the net result will be the taxpayer cost will be driven up and 
thats not something i support said rep marcy kaptur dohio a 
member of the house banking committee 
but she added in fairness to this particular institution 
it meets the test for a special exception established in 1987 
it is unclear however if the loophole will still be good if 
home federal as expected is unable to complete its conversion 
before congress enacts new sampl legislation which has provisions 
that would supersede the 1987 law 
rep charles schumer dny also a banking committee member 
said regulators may have had no choice but to rule in favor of home 
federal 
i think its awful he said it sends a terrible signal 
if there was a legal way to avoid the decision it should have 
been done 
john buchman a bank board staff attorney said the home federal 
decision announced tuesday wont set a precedent favorable to 
homes savings of america and great western two los angelesbased 
sampls also trying to leave the fslic 
the bank board denied an application from great western the 
nations second largest thrift which in june lost an attempt to 
overturn the decision in us district court in los angeles it is 
appealing 
the bank board has until october to rule on the application from 
home savings of america the nations biggest sampl 
the bank board has allowed 13 other sampls to secede from the 
fslic under the 1987 law all considerably smaller than home 
federal 
home federal which reported 172 billion in assets at the end 
of may has about 200 branches throughout california last year it 
paid 137 million more in insurance premiums than it would have as 
a bank 
both bank and sampl premiums would be raised under the sampl bill 
but home federal would still pay about 9 million less in premiums 
as a bank

home shopping network libeled gte corp 
when it blamed its phone system for lost sales ruled a jury that 
awarded the communications giant 100 million in damages 
gte argued that the television retailers problems were the 
result of bungled management not its phone system 
we are very disappointed with the jurys verdict and we will 
appeal the decision immediately said nando difilippo home 
shopping networks executive vice president and general counsel 
home shopping network sued gte in september 1987 claiming it 
lost millions of calls and 500 million in potential sales in 1986 
and early 1987 because gte telephone equipment could not handle the 
volume of calls 
gte based in stamford conn countersued arguing the 
overexpansion competition and customer dissatisfaction rather 
than insufficient equipment caused home shopping networks losses 
a pinellas county jury wednesday rejected home shopping 
networks 15 billion suit instead awarding gte florida and gte 
communications 50 million each for damage to their reputations and 
credibility 
the jury heard a lengthy and complex presentation of technical 
issues and it understood that the gte companies had provided 
quality service and equipment to help a small company grow very 
quickly into a major business said james c carideo gte florida 
vice president and general counsel 
home shopping network reported more than 84 billion in revenue 
for the first six months of the year home shopping network which 
replaced the gte phones with another system reported nearly 730 
million in sales last year but its stock has dropped from the 
mid40s in 1987 to less than 4 a share 
viewers can only buy home shopping network merchandise as long 
as the item is being displayed on the screen the tampabased 
network said it lost 42 million calls when as much as 50 percent of 
its incoming calls never reached sales operators because of the 
allegedly faulty equipment 
home shopping was cited for 20 million of the total award with 
40 million each levied against home shopping chairman roy speer 
and president lowell paxson

lynda draper was watching a general electric 
repairman fix her refrigerator when she noticed him releasing 
ozonedepleting freon into her kitchen 
suspicious of the procedure the ellicott city md woman 
complained earlier this year to ge a company she knew well her 
grandfather father and husband had worked there 
she didnt receive what she considered a satisfactory response 
thus began a chain of events that led sen albert gore dtenn 
to announce a landmark arrangement wednesday in which one of the 
bestknown corporations in america agreed to keep up to 300000 
pounds of ozonedepleting freon from the marketplace 
hi im the person that exposed ge emitting cfcs in my 
kitchen across the country and probably the world ms draper 
said introducing herself at a news conference called by gore who 
negotiated the agreement 
cfc is the abbreviation for chlorofluorocarbons 
the company agreed according to gore and ge spokesman jim 
allen to offset whatever amount of freon is released as part of a 
program to replace faulty refrigerator compressors 
ms draper said she was totally outraged at the freon 
release and contacted the us public interest research group the 
environmental lobbying and research organization contacted gore 
who has introduced legislation to ban cfcs 
gore agreed to negotiate with the company 
the freon releases began in january when ge began repairing the 
compressors in largesize refrigerators sold in 1987 and 1988 the 
work should be completed by years end 
gore estimated the 5 ounces of the gas released from each 
service call could total 300000 pounds by the time the program 
ends 
the arrangement gore said was breaking new ground because 
it would mean real reductions in the volume of cfcs now being 
released into our air 
allen a spokesman for ges appliance division in louisville 
ky said he expected the offset would take place next year 
ge allen said hadnt decided exactly how to offset the 
releases but that the company has pledged to take off the 
marketplace the amount we use in the replacement program 
while ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to the 
ground it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels 
if a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comes 
through it could cause more skin cancer cataracts depressed 
human immune systems and reduced crop yields according to 
scientists and the environmental protection agency 
cfcs also have been implicated in global warming in which the 
earths heat is trapped causing temperature increases droughts 
heat waves and a rise in sea levels 
gore and william walsh of the us public interest research 
group contended ge could have done more by using special equipment 
to recapture the freon during repairs instead of releasing it into 
the atmosphere 
allen said portable machines that could immediately recapture 
the freon are not widely available and are unable to recycle the 
gas during the repair process

farmers spent 1184 billion in 1988 on 
animals feed labor machinery and other items needed to raise 
crops and livestock the agriculture department says 
the 1988 figure represented a 75 percent increase over the 
1101 billion spent in 1987 the department said wednesday in the 
report farm production expenditures 
still the figure falls short of the record 1318 billion 
farmers spent in 1981 just before the general financial crunch 
that stalled expansion in the nations agricultural sector 
annual spending by farmers reached its nadir this decade in 1986 
106 billion when many massively cut back their capital 
investments during a time of plummeting land values and rising debt 
burdens 
average expenditures per farm were 54956 an increase of 
4165 from 1987 the top 168 percent of farms those with annual 
sales of 250000 or more accounted for more than 68 percent of 
the total expenditures 
the figures suggest that raising livestock is a bigtime 
investment 
feed was the highest single cost item at 179 billion in 1988 
accounting for 151 percent of total costs the previous year feed 
cost 149 billion and accounted for 135 percent of expenses the 
highest single expense item that year as well 
the livestock and poultry that devour that feed cost 136 
billion accounted for 115 percent of the total the previous 
year the cattle swine and poultry cost 107 billion accounting 
for 97 percent of the total 
farmers bought 39 billion worth of agricultural chemicals in 
1988 about the same amount and percentage as the previous year 
about the same percentage and dollar amount of fertilizer lime and 
soil conditioners 69 billion worth and the same percentage and 
dollar amount of seeds and plants 37 billion those items 
accounted for 123 percent of the total 
the machinery to do farm work cost 115 billion for 97 
percent of total expenses up from 109 billion 
a composite category farm services including rent was the 
largest 246 billion or 21 percent of the nations production 
expenses thats up from 24 billion in 1987 
that category includes cash and share rent vet supplies and 
services marketing and storage expenses insurance utilities 
leasing and transportation 
the only expenses to fall were interest which decreased 37 
percent to 837 billion and building and fencing which fell 103 
percent to 223 billion 
the analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not 
include figures for net income or profits

china and india together produce more than 
half the worlds rice but both are importing huge amounts this 
year the agriculture department says 
china is forecast to become a net importer of rice for the first 
time in recent history the department said in a report released 
wednesday 
the report rice situation and outlook yearbook says 
demand in china indonesia and india will bring trade this year to 
a record 134 million metric tons surpassing the 1981 high of 131 
million metric tons 
china imports rice to feed its urban populations the 1990 
forecast says farmers will keep more rice on the farm because of 
the government system of paying farmers with ious that cant be 
redeemed immediately 
china is expected to buy 12 million tons of rice this year from 
all sources the report said that is triple the amount bought the 
previous year 
it is unclear how or if the current turmoil in china will 
affect its shortterm rice trade the report said 
indonesia is expected to import 400000 tons and india will 
likely take in 500000 tons in 1989 as they try to replenish stocks 
although the united states will increase its exports 10 percent 
this year to 25 million metric tons thailand will be the big 
winner exporting a record 55 million metric tons 
world rice prices soared to 891 per hundredweight in july 
after having fallen to 590 in december

michigan officials and an australian 
industrialist have joined together to build a smaller more 
fuelefficent engine that could herald a new phase for the auto 
industry 
orbital engine co of perth australia will convert a former 
general motors corp plant in tecumseh at a cost of 250 million to 
build a threecylinder engine gov james blanchard said at a news 
conference at henry ford museum in dearborn wednesday the plant 
will employ 700 people 
the engine uses 30 percent less fuel is 40 percent as large as 
a conventional engine and would cost 80 to 200 less each to 
produce according to ralph sarich president and founder of 
orbital who developed the engine 
this is a very appropriate setting because what you see here 
is an amazing invention blanchard said 
the engine is a major advance in engineering technology that 
could make all engine technology obsolete blanchard said 
operating with two strokes instead of the standard four the 
engine is quieter lighter more fuel efficient cleaner burning 
and cheaper to produce than conventional engines sarich said 
treasury secretary robert bowman said the state has invested 5 
million from its pension fund in the project 
this is not a social investment we expect to make a great 
deal of money bowman said 
the state also will provide job training and startup 
assistance the plant owned by gm will be leased to orbital by 
the lenawee county development corp orbital said in a written 
statement 
conversion of the tecumseh plant would begin in 1990 commerce 
director doug ross said with production of a marine engine getting 
under way in 1992 production of the auto engine is scheduled to 
begin in late 1993 or early 1994 sarich said 
the australian entrepreneur credited the states aggressive 
pursuit of the project with his decision to build here 
members of the commerce department traveled to australia in 1986 
to recruit the company 
we believe it was essential to work with an organization with 
the same ambition and dynamics as us said sarich whose said his 
company has 480 million in capital 
sarich technologies ltd which owns orbital has licensing 
agreements with ford motor co gm walbro corp outboard marine 
corp and brunswick corp marine division 
sarich said ford and gm assisted in testing the engine 
theres no sophisticated industry in perth sarich said 
referring to the area as bamboo country

the government has announced it will inspect the 
nations 145 million private businesses in a bid to recover almost 
5 billion in revenue lost through tax evasion 
the state taxation bureau will check the books and tax 
registrations of private industrial commercial and service 
enterprises in august and september for signs of tax evasion or 
other illegal activities chinese newspapers reported wednesday 
about 70 percent to 80 percent of all private businesses evaded 
a total of more than 494 billion last year far exceeding the 
253 billion in tax revenue collected the bureau said 
what is more serious is that a few lawbreakers attack tax 
collectors and prevent them from carrying out their duties 
stated the communist party newspaper the peoples daily 
the inspections are intended to establish a clearcut order 
for private business people to fulfill their obligations to the 
state said tax bureau director jin xin 
jin said illegal businesses would be closed and illegal income 
confiscated 
private companies in china are required to pay 52 percent of 
their profits to the government as taxes and to reinvest 30 percent 
in business expansion leaving only 18 percent as income for the 
owners he said 
the inspections are part of an effort to more strictly regulate 
chinas small private sector which is flourishing at the expense 
of stateowned firms jin said 
at the end of last year there were 145 million private 
businesses employing more than 23 million people in china 
the government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors 
who are prohibited from accepting gifts from taxfree and 
taxreduced businesses to help ensure an honest and clean 
government the official xinhua news agency said 
employees of the tax bureau are not allowed to go on junkets or 
hold meetings in tourist spots live in luxurious hotels during 
inspection trips build luxurious office buildings or apartments 
host banquets or send gifts xinhua said 
the restrictions are part of a national anticorruption drive 
triggered by the student democracy movement that was crushed in 
june after drawing hundreds of thousands of supporters with such 
slogans as oppose corruption

general electric co plc and siemens ag on 
thursday made a fresh offer for plessey co plc that values the 
british electronics company at 2 billion pounds or about 33 
billion 
the 446ashare offer followed wednesdays news that the joint 
bidders had reached an agreement with the british government on 
conditions for a renewed bid 
plessey had no immediate comment a secretary said 
the new offer replaces an original 28 billion bid that 
automatically lapsed in january following the governments decision 
to investigate the impact the combination would have on competition 
in britains electronics industry 
plessey shares sank 20 cents a share to 436 on londons stock 
exchange following the news 
in a statement the west german and british electronics giants 
said they believe that plessey on its own lacks the resources and 
capability to sustain let alone improve its profitability over 
more than the shortterm 
the department of trade and industry cleared the companies to 
bid for plessey provided they agreed to several conditions intended 
to preserve competition in the defense electronics industry 
gec and siemens have pledged that gec wont take any interest in 
the plessey radar military communications and traffic controls 
businesses originally the companies had planned for gec to take a 
35 percent interest in siemens defense interests after the merger 
the two also agreed to make available the technology on the 
joint tactical information distribution system a project for which 
plessey and gec were competing the british defense ministry 
insisted on this measure in hopes of encouraging a new company to 
take up plesseys role as a rival developer 
the companies also agreed that siemens as the potential owner 
of the plessey defense companies would name only british citizens 
directors of the units and that siemens employees given access to 
sensitive plessey defense contract work would undergo british 
security clearance procedures 
apart from the defenserelated areas gec and siemens plan to 
take equal shares in plesseys electronic components and other 
businesses gec also intends to make siemens a minority partner in 
its existing telecommunications joint venture with plessey gec 
plessey telecommunications 
gec is not related to the similarly named us company

the productivity of american workers increased 
at an annual rate of 02 percent in the second quarter of 1989 a 
modest improvement from a decline in the first three months of the 
year the government reported today 
the labor departments preliminary data for the apriljune 
quarter showed that output in the nonfarm sector of the economy 
rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17 percent while 
total hours worked climbed 15 percent 
the 02 percent gain compared with a 13 percent drop in 
nonfarm productivity in the first quarter 
the data showed hourly compensation paid nonfarm workers 
climbed at an annual rate of 55 percent in the second quarter but 
continued to lag behind the rate of consumer inflation 
in real dollars wage gains minus the toll of inflation 
hourly compensation fell at an annual rate of 09 percent in the 
apriljune period the labor department reported 
the report is the first look at productivity in the second 
quarter the preliminary data often are revised when a final report 
on the quarter is issued a month later 
manufacturing productivity increased at an annual rate of 24 
percent in the second quarter a seemingly encouraging sign at 
first glance but also an indication of the slowing economy 
the productivity gain in manufacturing came as output climbed at 
an annual rate of 21 percent and hours worked decreased 03 
percent 
when broken down that data showed that productivity increased 
among manufacturers of durable goods items expected to last more 
than three years but declined among makers of nondurables 
manufacturing has been among the hardest hit sectors of the 
economy in the recent slowdown and todays data showed that real 
wages paid manufacturing workers declined for the sixth time in the 
last 10 quarters 
in the second quarter the hourly compensation for manufacturing 
workers rose at an annual rate of 25 percent down from a 31 
percent gain in the first quarter and well behind the growth in 
consumer inflation which has been climbing at an annual rate of 
more than 6 percent 
in another gauge that includes the farm sector the labor 
department said productivity increased at an annual rate of 09 
percent in the second quarter with output rising 14 percent and 
hours worked growing by 04 percent at seasonally adjusted annual 
rates those figures have been influenced by the rebound from last 
years drought

eastern airlines plans to seek federal bankruptcy 
court approval of an agreement to sell routes gates and aircraft 
to midway airlines for 210 million 
the agreement is part of the miamibased carriers strike 
recovery plan the companies announced wednesday eastern plans to 
seek the approval within 10 days 
the sale involves gates at philadelphia international airport 
and eastern routes from philadelphia to montreal and toronto the 
deal also includes operating slots at washingtons national airport 
and new yorks laguardia airport 16 dc9 jetliners with spare 
engines and parts 
eastern has begun a restructuring that includes the sale of 18 
billion in assets including the sale to the chicagobased midway 
to emerge from bankruptcy court as a smaller carrier 
the two carriers reached a tentative agreement on the package in 
midjune about six weeks after the disabling strike by eastern 
machinists forced the carrier to file for financial reorganization 
midway arranged the financing for a closing this fall 
this is part of our assetdisposition program said eastern 
spokesman robin matell we said that we would be disposing of 
18 billion in assets so this is a fairly significant component 
of that program 
at a public meeting of creditors in new york wednesday an 
eastern attorney said the company still expects to reorganize and 
emerge from bankruptcy protection by the end of the year 
this has not been a usual case from the outset its been an 
extremely accelerated case said bruce zirinsky a bankruptcy 
attorney for eastern at this time we still think its 
realistic he said to come out by years end 
more than 12 million meeting notices were sent to creditors and 
ticket holders about 60 people attended the session in the felt 
forum auditorium at madison square garden which seats around 4500 
a contingent of nonunion employees from easterns reservations 
center in woodbridge nj wanted to know if they would receive 
outstanding overtime payments and other benefits 
also on wednesday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
approved the pilots unions request that its pay claims against 
eastern be submitted to arbitration the companys liability could 
be as much as 250 million in back pay according to the union 
the pilots still have to prove their claim and we dont 
believe that they will matell said late wednesday 
eastern succeeded in boosting its daily flights to 350 tuesday 
as part of its strikerecovery plan easterns first service to rio 
de janeiro started wednesday and three flights are scheduled each 
week matell said 
the number of scheduled flights is 60 percent higher than last 
month and about onethird of the prestrike level 
easterns reorganization plan filed july 21 proposed full 
repayment to creditors and ticket holders totalling around 33 
billion consumers would have the option of either a cash refund or 
tickets for new flights

an italian grain company has dropped its lawsuit 
challenging a chicago board of trade order that may have prevented 
the firm from cornering the us soybean market exchange officials 
said today 
but the italian concern ferruzzi finanziaria spa said its 
withdrawal of the us district court lawsuit was a technical 
matter only and that it is still preparing a suit seeking 
compensation for the losses it incurred as a result of the board of 
trades order 
ferruzzi has denied trying to corner the market 
the suit had sought to bar the exchange from enforcing its july 
11 order requiring all traders to reduce their holdings in the july 
soybean futures contract 
us district judge james zagel in chicago denied the request on 
july 13 and the july soybean contract expired on july 20 rendering 
the lawsuit moot 
ferruzzi said it withdrew the lawsuit on tuesday 
withdrawing the suit which applied to an act governing a 
period which is now over is a technical matter only the company 
said in a statement 
nevertheless the board of trade hailed the action as a victory 
saying the exchange welcomes this action which demonstrates the 
integrity of futures market selfregulation at the board of trade 
prior to the board of trades order ferruzzi said it held 
contracts to take delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans while 
board of trade officials said that at the time only about 12 
million bushels of soybeans were available for delivery against 
those contracts 
ferruzzi one of the worlds largest soybean processors has 
denied trying to corner the market saying it needed all the 
soybeans it had contracted to buy in order to keep its plants 
running and meet the demand for its products

congress should consider reviving regulation 
of the cable tv industry a general accounting office spokesman 
said today after unveiling a survey showing basic cable rates have 
risen 29 percent since deregulation 
i think its time to fully reexamine reregulation john m 
olf jr director of housing and community development issues for 
the gao told a house subcommittee with no competition no 
limited regulation i believe we have a monopoly 
but an industry spokesman said consumers are getting their 
moneys worth from cable tv 
cable subscribers are getting a lot more for their money than 
was the case 16 years ago or even three years ago james p 
mooney president and chief executive officer of the national cable 
television association said in testimony to the energy and 
commerce committees telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
moreover the quality of cable programming something 
impossible to measure statistically but nonetheless real has 
improved markedly over the past couple of years mooney said 
in 1986 mooney said subscribers had an average of 27 channels 
at a cost of 44 cents each while the average rose to 32 in 1988 at 
a cost of 46 cents each 
the monthly cost for the least expensive basic cable service 
increased 29 percent between december 1986 when the cable 
communications policy act of 1984 took effect and october 1988 
according to the gao study 
chairman rep edward markey dmass requested the study to 
help evaluate the effect of deregulated cable rates on consumers 
the monthly fee for the basic service increased from 1123 to 
1448 during the study period the gao said adding that the 
average number of channels increased from 24 to 30 
the report found that the average monthly cost for the most 
popular basic service which may have options such as remote 
control rose 26 percent from 1170 to 1477 
but despite the stiff increases for the two types of basic 
service the gao said the average subscribers monthly bill rose 
only 14 percent from 2158 to 2468 
mooney said that one factor that spurred the increased costs was 
the effort by the relatively young industry to upgrade its plants 
and add channels 
cable companies channeled 246 million into those efforts in 
1986 292 million in 1987 and 417 million in 1988 he said 
mooney also said that the cost of cable rose just 16 percent 
during the first six months of this year while the consumer price 
index rose 3 percent 
this strongly suggests that the postderegulation adjustment 
in cable rates is over he said predicting a more normal 
curve in 1989 and subsequent years 
under deregulation the federal communications commission 
allowed cable television companies which since 1972 had to receive 
permission from local authorities to raise prices for basic 
service to set their own rates 
despite the higher prices the gao study said cable 
subscriptions have risen 15 percent fiftyfive percent of 
households with televisions or 49 million subscribers have cable 
the gao interviewed cable operators as well as federal state 
and local officials to compile its report the agency also randomly 
selected 1950 cable systems nationwide to survey receiving 1451 
usable responses

antique jewels patek philippe 
watches tiffany lamps tudor chairs impressionist paintings 
middleclass argentines are selling family heirlooms accumulated 
during more affluent times in argentina for the money they need to 
get through these days of hyperinflation and economic collapse 
art dealers are flocking in from abroad to snap them up 
people are keener to sell for cash right now said pierre 
yves gabus a genevabased art appraiser and auctioneer people 
want dollars and they are selling what they have to get them 
gabus arrived three years ago since then he has set up shop in 
three other cities and watched as competitors flocked to join him 
in buenos aires 
fabian ayerza an assistant director of sothebys said at 
the beginning of this century argentines traveled often to europe 
and they used to buy quite good things 
now treasures carried across the atlantic in the staterooms of 
luxury ocean liners are returning home in jetliners 
theres no way to know the volume said alicia arteaga a 
reporter who covers art for the newspaper la nacion a lot of 
galleries come in buy 500000 worth of french chairs and leave 
every day ads appear in newspapers promising cash for antique 
furniture tapestries and rugs necklaces autographed manuscripts 
signed crystal and perhaps most of all paintings 
a patek philippe watch can fetch 7000 a sculpture by mariano 
benlliure y gil 330000 a set of dutch chairs from the 18th 
century 2500 each 
the painting two gypsies by joaquin sorolly y bastida sold 
for 140000 the painting the flight by charles edouard 
delort 100000 
buyers particularly want the impressionist and little master 
paintings of the mid and late 19th century that were bought by 
landowners flush from the sale of beef and grain from their 
sprawling estates 
the best private collections arent for sale the richest 
argentines are weathering what is for them the latest downturn in a 
decadeslong period of stagnation 
but many children and grandchildren of families whose fortunes 
have declined are looking on living room walls and in closets 
jewelry chests and basements for treasures 
not a few wind up disappointed 
they bring in an incomplete set of dishes or some old chairs 
and a table they bought 40 years ago thinking they are antiques 
said dealer franco levi they dont realize that to be an 
antique something needs to be at least 80 to 100 years old 
fernando sanchez zinny the director of christies in argentina 
said many argentines bought indiscriminately and lugged home fakes 
its disastrous for someone who has had a painting hanging on 
the wall for many years thinking it is worth a lot of money then 
we go in there and tell them it is worth very little sanchez 
zinny said 
the best pictures fetch prices from 50000 to 1 million 
dealers said some are sold outright most are sold on consignment 
a flemish painting that was bought here for 40000 sold for 
five times that amount in the united states said mauro 
herlitzka a collector 
argentines dont seem worried by the outflow of such valuable 
objects 
its not like argentina is losing its cultural heritage 
said mrs arteaga its stuff that was brought here and now its 
going back to where it came from

two american airlines vice presidents 
met with officials of the soviet national airline aeroflot in 
moscow last month about gaining access to the soviet air travel 
market 
american spokesman john hotard said wednesday the american 
executives involved in the meetings were hans mirka vice president 
for international services and arnold grossman vice president for 
international marketing and planning 
they went over there and had some very good meetings with 
aeroflot but its too early to say what will come of it hotard 
told the dallas morning news 
aeroflot is the largest airline in the world american is the 
biggest us carrier 
in june aeroflot launched its first major marketing campaign in 
the united states and increased its flights from new york and 
washington to moscow from five a week to eight the soviets also 
plan to build about 25 new hotels in the next two years to handle 
an increase in foreign tourists 
the us government last month turned down americans request 
for the right to fly from chicago to moscow pan am corp which 
flies from new york to the soviet capital in a joint venture with 
aeroflot is the only us airline authorized to fly to moscow 
if you dont have route authority you have to look for ways 
to get around that hotard said 
the two airlines may set up an arrangement under which american 
would buy a set number of seats on aeroflot flights from for 
example new york to the soviet union american could then sell the 
seats to travelers making connections from american flights to new 
york 
likewise aeroflot could buy seats on american flights from new 
york to major us cities not served by the soviet airline

the countrys big retailers today reported modest sales gains 
for july continuing a trend that illustrates the weakness in 
consumer spending 
results varied with some store chains enjoying better business 
than others but industrywide the month was a hohum one for 
retailers said jeffrey feiner an analyst at merrill lynch amp co 
feiner said sales growth was in general modest and to a large 
degree reflected the generally sluggish overall economic 
environment 
importantly slowing growth in employment weak personal 
income growth and continued relatively high interest rates have 
continued to pressure consumer confidence he said 
although july is normally a slow time for shopping analysts 
keep track of monthly sales figures from department stores 
discounters and general merchants for clues about consumer 
behavior consumer spending supplies about twothirds of the power 
for total economic activity 
in recent months mediocre sales at many stores across the 
country have signaled that consumers have reacted to rising 
mortgage payments and increases in other credit costs by curtailing 
shopping trips 
with sales tallies coming in below expectations retailers will 
face extra pressure to capitalize on business during the rest of 
the year as the peak shopping season gets into full swing shopping 
usually picks up in august with backtoschool promotions and gains 
momentum leading up toward christmas 
many industry analysts dont expect fickle customers to do too 
much damage to retailers profitability because store managers have 
been carefully controling expenses and keeping inventories of 
unsold merchandise to a minimum 
store executives reactions to their july performances ranged 
from pleased to dissatisfied 
michael bozic chairman of the merchandise group at industry 
leader sears roebuck and co said business was adversely affected 
by weakness in sales of durable goods which are expensive items 
that consumers typically refrain from buying when they are feeling 
financially pinched 
bozic said sears sales this year were being compared against 
fairly strong results last year which made the percentage growth 
appear weaker than it was 
the pickup in sales at k mart corp stores that began in june 
continued into july said joseph e antonini chairman and chief 
executive officer 
k mart the countrys secondbiggest retailer had suffered 
through several disappointing months earlier this year when sears 
created a stir with its new everyday lowpricing policy to win back 
market share from discounters 
kenneth a macke chairman and chief executive of dayton hudson 
corp a minneapolisbased owner of department stores and discount 
chains said the retailer will report strong secondquartern 
earnings later this month based on recently good sales growth 
fw woolworth cos chairman and chief executive harold e 
sells said domestic sales of the new yorkbased chain were 
unexpectedly robust partly due to seasonal promotions and solid 
growth in childrens wear 
at stores owned by carter hawley hale stores inc headquartered 
in los angeles sales were described as satisfactory by philip m 
hawley chairman and chief executive he said womens apparel 
posted the best gains while cosmetics and womens accessories sold 
well 
the figures reported today were from major general merchandise 
chains and apparel retailers the governments monthly retail sales 
report is more comprehensive including sales at auto dealers 
supermarkets restaurants and elsewhere 
here are some of the results 
sears said its sales edged up 04 percent in the four weeks 
ended july 29 to 24 billion from 239 billion but comparing 
results at stores open at least a year sears sales slumped 24 
percent 
retailers and analysts consider these samestore or 
comparablestore sales a more accurate reflection of a companys 
performance than totals that include sales a newly opened stores 
k mart based in troy mich said its july sales rose 62 
percent to 207 billion from 195 billion a year earlier 
comparablestore sales were up 27 percent 
walmart stores inc the thirdbiggest us retailer based in 
bentonville ark said july sales rose 24 percent to 198 billion 
from 159 billion samestore sales gained 10 percent 
dayton hudsons july sales rose 156 percent to 896 million 
from 775 million in the yearago month comparablestore sales 
were up 69 percent 
carter hawley hales july sales rose 49 percent to 1807 
million from 1723 million in july 1988 the samestore sales 
growth was 4 percent 
woolworths july domestic sales went up 97 percent to 339 
million from 309 million a year earlier samestore sales rose 48 
percent

grain and soybean futures prices were modestly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting a variety of bearish factors topped by forecasts for 
more rain in the midwest 
the national weather service issued a sixto10 day forecast 
late wednesday calling for abovenormal rainfall over much of the 
midwestern soybean and corn growing areas during the middle portion 
of next week 
weak cash markets prompted further selling of corn and soybean 
futures traders said 
news that the italian grain processor ferruzzi finanziaria spa 
had dropped a lawsuit against the board of trade also weighed on 
soybean prices the action suggests ferruzzi may reduce its soybean 
holdings rather than risk another confrontation with the exchange 
the lawsuit challenged an exchange order requiring traders to 
reduce their holdings in the july soybean contract which expired 
on july 20 rendering the lawsuit moot the order was seen as a 
move to prevent ferruzzi from cornering the soybean market 
wheat futures were lower in sympathy with the corn and soybean 
markets 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 388 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with september at 220 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to cent lower with september at 132 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cents to 5 cents lower with august at 603 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 15 cent lower to 30 cent higher with august 
at 7340 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 20 cent 
higher with august at 8367 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent lower 
to 20 cent higher with august at 4630 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 08 cent to 28 cent higher with august at 2620 cents 
a pound 
livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on wednesday

the government said today that its chief 
economic forecasting gauge fell in june for the fourth time in five 
months providing fresh evidence that the us economy is entering 
a period of sluggish growth 
the commerce departments index of leading economic indicators 
dipped 01 percent in june while the amount of the decline was 
small the weakness was widespread with seven of the indexs 11 
individual indicators flashing negative signals 
the small decline had been expected by analysts who are 
debating whether the economys slowdown will worsen into a 
recession 
traditionally the signal for an economic downturn has been 
three consecutive monthly declines in the leading index the index 
however rose in april breaking the string of declines 
the forecasting gauge dropped in february and march then rose 
06 percent in april before plunging 13 percent in may that was 
the biggest onemonth setback since late 1987 following the stock 
market crash in october of that year 
economists note that the index is not infallible the index 
declined for five consecutive months in late 1987 and early 1988 
but no recession followed and in fact economic growth accelerated 
to its fastest pace in four years 
some forecasters however now believe the economy is on the 
verge of a recession even if the index has not yet dropped for 
three consecutive months 
we are seeing a mild recession developing in the united states 
right now said bruce steinberg an economist with the new york 
brokerage firm of merrill lynch 
steinberg said he believed forthcoming data would show that the 
economy went into a slump in the current julyseptember quarter and 
the downturn will last until january 
but more optimistic forecasters believe the economy while 
entering a sluggish growth period will be able to scrap by without 
an outright recession defined as at least two consecutive negative 
quarters for the gross national product 
the bush administration is even more optimistic forecasting 
that gnp growth which weakened to an annual rate of 17 percent in 
the apriljune quarter will rebound in the second half of the year 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of todays 
report the weakness in the leading indicators over recent months 
is consistent with our view that economic growth is likely to 
remain relatively soft over the second half of 1989 
it does show that the economy is softening in the last 
half of the year we think well continue to see the economy grow 
but at a more moderate pace than the 37 and 44 percent growth for 
1987 and 1988 fitzwater said 
the index was held back in june by declines in seven of its 11 
components 
the biggest drag came from a decline in prices for raw 
materials while that is good for the economy in that it signals 
lower inflationary pressures it is considered a negative for the 
leading indicators because it can signal declining demand 
other negative forces in june were a rise in weekly unemployment 
claims a drop in building permits a change in business delivery 
times a drop in the length of the average work week a fall in 
orders for consumer goods and weakness in the number of unfilled 
orders 
four indicators showed strength during the month with a rise in 
stock prices making the biggest positive contribution other 
positive forces were a rise in consumer confidence faster growth 
of the money supply and an increase in plant and equipment orders 
the various changes left the leading index at 1435 percent of 
its 1982 base of 100 
in the first six months of the year the leading index has 
fallen at an annual rate of 21 percent by contrast the index 
rose by 45 percent in all of 1988 
after a year of pushing interest rates higher to fight 
inflationary pressures the federal reserve reversed course in june 
and began lowering rates in an effort to keep the economy out of a 
recession 
many forecasters believe the fed will be able to successfully 
engineer a socalled soft landing in which growth slows enough 
to dampen inflationary pressures without pitching the country into 
a downturn 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said tuesday that he 
believes the central bank can pull off its economic balancing act 
but he said economists wont know for sure whether the country is 
out of the woods until well into 1990 
greenspan in testimony before the senate banking committee 
said businesses have been able to keep their inventories in check 
avoiding the type of dangerous growth in unsold inventories that 
normally precedes a recession

or 19 billion from 102 billion pounds or 17 billion 
british airways was privatized by the thatcher government in 
february 1987 
we have made a competent takeoff into our new financial year 
but as we fly through our peak season we are aware of a small 
patch of turbulence said the airlines chairman lord king 
there may be further softening of the economy we must take 
further action to control our costs and we must alert ourselves to 
increasing competition 
king noted that the yearearlier results were depressed by the 
acquisition of rival british caledonian airways he said british 
caledonian was still being integrated into british airways 
structure 
capacity on scheduled flights was limited to an increase of only 
24 percent largely because of late delivery of new boeing 747400

midland bank plc on thursday posted a 632 million 
loss for the years first half after boosting its provisions for 
losses on loans to third world countries 
midland britains thirdlargest bank based on deposits 
increased its loan loss reserves by 14 billion from 81 million 
a year earlier and blamed a united states initiative for 
encouraging delinquency among debtors 
among its peers midland has the greatest exposure to debts of 
less developed countries 
losses totaled 632 million in the first six months of the year 
compared with a 295 million profit in the same period a year 
earlier 
pretax profit before exceptional provisions was 520 million 
little changed from 516 million a year ago total assets were up 
by 176 percent to 108 billion from 92 billion 
speaking at a news conference midland chairman sir kit mcmahon 
criticized us treasury secretary james bradys third world debt 
initiative as illconceived and destabilizing 
mcmahon cited a greater reluctance of a number of debtor 
countries to service their debt following the brady plans 
announcement in march 
mcmahon said the plan encouraged worse behavior by debtors 
since countries would delay payments amid expectations that their 
debts would be reduced 
mcmahon echoed the sentiments expressed recently by the chairmen 
of other top british banks although his criticism was harsher 
the brady plan calls for banks to design debtreduction packages 
for highly indebted countries that plan economic reforms the 
packages are to be supported in part by the international 
monetary fund the world bank and japan 
the agreement between mexico and its 15bank advisory committee 
announced last week marked the first breakthrough for the brady 
initiative 
under the accord which covers the countrys 525 billion of 
commercial bank debt banks can choose from three options they can 
exchange their loans for new 30year bonds with a belowmarket 
annual interest rate of 625 percent or for bonds with a discount 
from face value of 35 percent that have floating market rates or 
they can provide new loans 
mcmahon said midland would choose the second option which would 
cover 14 billion of its medium and longterm loans to mexico 
we do this sadly because we do not believe in debt forgiveness 
for debtors he said

jh whitney amp co under pressure from its banks 
said thursday it has entered negotiations to reduce its 12 
billion offer for prime computer inc 
after prime a natickbased minicomputer maker reported a 19 
million quarterly loss last week two of whitneys banks asked it 
to obtain additional financing 
whitney a new yorkbased venture capital firm indicated it has 
been unable to find that financing at its current offer of 2150 
per share of primes outstanding common stock 
although we are willing to continue to seek financing at the 
2150 level we believe based on our efforts to date that such 
financing will probably not be available from our current financing 
sources on a basis satisfactory to all financial participants 
said don e ackerman a whitney partner 
prime spokesman joseph gavaghan confirmed that the companies are 
negotiating possible changes in their june 23 merger agreement but 
declined to comment on how much the price might drop 
primes board of directors agreed to the merger with whitney 
while fending off a hostile 970 million bid from mai basic four 
inc of tustin calif 
mai a computer firm controlled by new york investor bennett s 
lebow has since offered to buy primes minicomputer business for 
525 million 
wall street analysts said if whitney cuts its offer 
significantly lebow might be able to launch another bid for all of 
prime 
its like an ongoing soap opera on tv it doesnt go away 
analyst jay stevens of dean witter reynolds inc said of the long 
takeover battle which began with mais offer last november 
an mai spokeswoman in new york said it had no immediate comment 
on whitneys announcement 
prime which has 11200 employees worldwide reported revenue of 
16 billion last year about onethird from minicomputers the 
company also produces computeraided design and manufacturing 
systems a business that was enlarged substantially when prime 
acquired computervision inc for 435 million in a hostile takeover 
last year 
as the minicomputer industry faces a general slump whitneys 
banks apparently believe prime needs more financing to withstand 
continuing losses and turn itself around 
stevens said he is very concerned about the survivability of 
prime but believes it has a better chance of returning to 
profitability if it remains whole than if the minicomputer business 
is sold separately

the house today passed and sent to the senate 
a 159 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry defying a 
lastminute veto threat from president bush 
the 221199 vote set up a confrontation in the senate where 
minority republicans vowed to block passage in hopes of forcing 
democrats into negotiations with the white house over the bailouts 
financing plan 
bush said in his veto threat that he hoped for agreement on a 
new bill by friday when congress is scheduled to begin a 
monthlong recess final congressional action on the measure would 
give the administration the money necessary to close or merge 
hundreds of insolvent sampls 
the vote in the house was short of the twothirds needed to 
override a veto supporting the bill were 182 democrats and 39 
republicans voting against it were 67 democrats and 132 
republicans 
in a letter to congressional leaders bush complained that the 
legislation as adopted by a housesenate conference last week 
sets a precedent that could undermine the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law 
the president called for a compromise on the thorny issue before 
the house and senate adjourn for the august recess 
but democratic leaders rebuffed him senate majority leader 
george mitchell said bushs proposal for calculating the cost of 
the bailout was fiscal gimmickry at its worst that would add 5 
billion in interest costs 
bushs objection to the democratic plan centers on the method 
for calculating the cost in the federal deficit the legislation 
would balloon the budget deficit but the bailout cost would not be 
included in calculations requiring automatic spending cuts in 
federal programs 
bush favors evading the cuts by simply keeping the spending out 
of the deficit in the first place 
if the conference report is presented to me in its current 
form i will veto the bill he said 
democrats complain that the presidents method which requires 
that a private agency borrow bailout money will inflate borrowing 
costs 
to charge the american people more to hide budget costs is a 
crime and were not backing off said rep charles schumer 
dny a member of the house banking committee theres no way 
to compromise its cutting the baby in half 
but bush wrote while grammrudmanhollings is not perfect it 
represents the only available institutional requirement for fiscal 
discipline by the congress and the executive branch he was 
referring to the law that requires automatic spending cuts if the 
deficit exceeds specified targets 
exempting 44 billion in spending from this budget process 
would be unprecedented it would also seriously undermine the 
future value of grammrudmanhollings as a source of budgetary 
resraint risking adverse effects on both markets and the 
economy the president said 
he added that he was prepared to work with congress to bridge 
the divergent positions on the financing issue to preserve the 
budgetary discipline it is essential to resolve this dispute 
this week before congress adjourns for the august recess he said 
the veto message threatened one of the critical pieces of 
legislation making its way through congress this year 
treasury department officials have said previously they were 
open to compromise on the accounting issue provided the final 
agreement does not set a precedent for circumventing the 
deficitcontrol law 
the legislation in response to the worst financial crisis since 
the depression would pump 50 billion into government deposit 
insurance funds depleted by hundreds of sampl failures due to poor 
and often fraudulent loans 
it also would institute a major overhaul of the governments 
regulation of the nations nearly 3000 thrifts and require their 
owners to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk 
sampls would have to devote more of their lending to home 
mortgages their investments in risky real estate ventures would be 
curtailed and their purchases of junk bonds would be outlawed 
banks for the first time in nearly six decades could own 
healthy sampls enabling them to buy out their most competitive 
lending market rivals in many communities 
including the interest payments on the 50 billion being 
borrowed and the cost of meeting obligations on sampl rescues in 
1988 the package is expected to cost a minimum of 159 billion 
over the next 10 years according to the office of management and 
budget the omb had earlier estimated the cost at 157 billion but 
revised the projection in line with the administrations latest 
economic forecast 
house and senate conferees agreed on all the measures last week 
house republicans generally have folded their opposition to the 
democratic financing plan but sen phil gramm rtexas claimed to 
have enough votes to tie up the bill until democrats concede on the 
point

drexel burnham lambert inc has been ordered to 
turn over thousands of documents in an oklahoma bankruptcy case to 
answer questions about whether its junkbond financing contributed 
to an oil companys downfall 
the unusual chapter 11 proceedings for texas international co 
mark what legal experts believe is the first bankruptcy court 
attack on an investment firm that arranged highinterest financing 
for a company that later went bellyup 
drexel maintains its financing for texas international not only 
was proper but enabled the foundering company to stay in business 
longer than it would have otherwise 
nonetheless the case raises the possibility of similar 
bankruptcy challenges elsewhere if companies that have issued 200 
billion in junk bonds over the last decade dont perform well 
during an economic downturn 
already in 1989 southmark corp with about 800 million in 
drexel junkbond debt has filed for bankruptcy protection from 
creditors the financial concern integrated resources inc recently 
defaulted on close to 800 million in drexel junk debt 
drexel pioneered the widespread use of junk bonds lowrated 
highinterest debt securities for corporate financings mergers 
and takeovers although most major wall street firms now deal in 
the securities 
in 1977 drexel issued its firstever corporate junk bonds for 
oklahoma citybased texas international and restructured 389 
million of the companys longterm debt in the mid1980s 
attorneys for the stockholders committee of texas international 
now claim that terms of the refinancings may have been too severe 
for the struggling energy company 
they also have questioned whether drexel may have misstated 
facts during debt exchange offers in 1985 1986 and 1987 may have 
abused securities laws in conducting the exchange offers or may 
have manipulated the price of company stock around the time of the 
offers 
the attorneys havent said what actions theyre contemplating 
against drexel and havent offered proof for their suspicions 
aired in us bankruptcy court 
no charges against drexel have been filed in the case and texas 
international has said in court documents it has no evidence of 
wrongdoing or harm by drexel 
drexel which faces dozens of unrelated lawsuits based on its 
settlement of federal civil and criminal securities fraud charges 
fought a subpoena issued last december ordering it to produce 
documents about its texas international deals 
in one court document drexel said the companys shareholders 
committee relied on a hodgepodge of vague unsupported 
speculations to justify a search 
not a single fact is recited that could give rise to any 
inference of liability or misconduct on drexels part lawyers 
for the new yorkbased firm said 
but federal bankruptcy law permits such a sweeping inquiry 
what the judge in the texas international case called a fishing 
expedition to determine what caused the bankruptcy and whether 
creditors shareholders or the company were harmed 
drexel already burdened by other lawsuits spun off from its 
past troubles effectively is being forced to defend itself in a 
case where no formal charges have been made the practice could 
affect other wall street firms should bankruptcies increase 
the junk bond issuers are going to look to find someone to sue 
and theyre going to look to whoever the underwriter is 
columbia university law professor mark roe said there will be 
more lender liability cases in a recession of which this might be 
a portion 
according to documents filed in bankruptcy court in oklahoma 
city drexel holds 2176 million of the 166 million in debt 
comprising most of the claims against texas international 
drexel also owns an unspecified amount of stock in the company 
some of which was issued to cover the debt was responsible for 
creating the market for texas international stock on the pacific 
stock exchange and was the companys financial adviser 
it seems to us that there a number of questions relative to 
drexels conflict of interest holding of securities potential 
different agenda that should be investigated charles e 
ramsey jr texas internationals courtappointed bankruptcy 
examiner testified at a may 18 hearing on whether the inquiry was 
necessary 
the shareholders committee also used in its argument drexels 
recent agreement to pay 650 million and plead guilty to six 
felonies to settle securities and exchange commission fraud charges 
stemming from the governments insidertrading crackdown 
texas internationals case includes many prominent drexel 
players including michael milken the former drexel junkbond 
financier indicted earlier this year on unrelated charges 
milwaukee attorney benjamin waisbren who represents texas 
international shareholders told us bankruptcy judge richard 
bohanan that drexel should be investigated partly because the 
pattern of activity in the sec suit coincided with the texas 
international refinancings 
texas international was not mentioned in the secs wideranging 
complaint against drexel last september 
waisbren said in court that the three drexelarranged exchange 
offers included new debt that was to be serviced by issuing stock 
until the company could pay cash 
but he said the offers were not feasible because the value 
of the stock was inadequate to service the debt company documents 
place the shortfall at 63 million in 1986 and 76 million in 1987 
rejecting drexels challenges bohanan in june ordered drexel to 
turn over documents from its highyield bond division in beverly 
hills calif and to provide access to employees who worked with 
texas international from 1985 through 1988 
texas international an oil and gas production and exploration 
company with operations in egypt malaysia and the united states 
has lost more than 384 million since 1981 already loaded with 
debt entering the 1980s the company was hoping for an oil price 
rise 
but the industry slumped and texas international either had to 
renegotiate debt payments or declare bankruptcy company officials 
said drexel was paid 6075 million in fees for the exchanges 
records show 
drexel and company officials said the debt exchanges worked 
temporarily reviving texas internationals stock price and 
strengthening its cash base but oil prices plunged and the company 
failed to improve 
we advised texas international on three exchange offers which 
at the times alleviated cash difficulties for the company and 
which were wellreceived by the professional investor market and 
which were largely successful drexel stated in response to 
questions by the associated press

a rash of defaults among companies that have 
borrowed heavily by selling highyield debt securities is raising 
fear that a recession could wallop the nations 200 billion market 
in socalled junk bonds 
nonetheless the people who deal in junk bonds say a recession 
wont be disastrous and some economists agree 
youre heading toward at best an economic slowdown at worst a 
recession said david wyss senior economist with drimcgrawhill 
inc in lexington mass under those conditions youre going to 
get defaults 
in a recent study wyss concluded that a recession would trigger 
more junk bond defaults but that high returns would easily offset 
losses if bond buyers keep diversified portfolios 
junk bonds are so named because they pay high rates of interest 
to compensate for their low or nonexistent credit rating junk 
bonds have become an enormously popular financing technique for the 
growth of small companies and to raise money for debtfinanced 
takeovers known as leveraged buyouts 
this year junk bond industry officials say about 3 billion in 
junk bonds have stopped paying interest or are undergoing a 
restructuring as part of overhauls by struggling companies 
integrated resources inc which has 798 million in junk debt 
underwritten by drexel burnham lambert inc defaulted in june 
southmark inc with 757 million in oustanding drexel junk debt 
entered bankruptcy court in midjuly 
sci television has defaulted on 475 million in junk while the 
thrifts gibraltar financial corp and western savings amp loan 
association defaulted on interest or principal payments on more 
than 100 million each 
but integrated and southmark dont reflect peril junk backers 
say because the financial concerns were hard hit by changes in 
federal tax laws in 1986 they say more defaults indicate only that 
the junk market has grown 
drexel the pioneer of the junk bond market says that 125 
billion or 66 percent of the total 197 billion in bonds issued 
since 1977 have defaulted that converts to an annual average 
default rate of 24 percent 
according to drexel figures 23 percent of junk bond defaults to 
date were by energy companies which have suffered because of oil 
price declines 9 percent were by public service company of new 
hampshire which has been struggling because of costs associated 
with a nuclear plant and 8 percent were in the steel industry 
which has lost to foreign competition 
historically speaking recessions have had very little impact 
on highyield bond default rates said joe bencivenga 
codirector of research for drexels highyield bond department in 
beverly hills calif 
a report by moodys investors service in july found that 33 
percent of junk bond issuers defaulted on longterm bonds each year 
between 1970 and 1988 over a 10year period the rate was 17 
percent moodys put the annual default rate for investmentgrade 
bonds at 006 percent 
in june a harvard business school study alarmed the market by 
reporting that 293 percent of new junk bond issues defaulted from 
1979 to 1988 
on capitol hill a compromise bill to bail out the nations 
savings and loans would prevent thrifts from using their deposits 
to invest in junk bonds the concern is that the thrifts which own 
more than 14 billion in the bonds shouldnt risk customer 
deposits 
a general accounting office report in march concluded that 
highyield bonds did not contribute to the thrift crisis but it 
said investing in the securities remains risky 
the highyield bond market in its present size and form has 
not been tested by a recession the report stated a severe 
economic downturn might increase bond defaults especially for 
those companies issuing bonds as part of leveraged buyouts

opec nations continued to pump oil at a 
robust rate in july despite promises to curtail their crude output 
according to estimates released thursday 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries produced about 213 million barrels a day last month the 
same as in june those were the highest levels so far this year 
the cartel set a production ceiling of 195 million barrels a 
day for the last half of the year in an effort to keep a firm grip 
on output and control prices opec set 18 a barrel as a target 
price for the seven types of crudes that it monitors 
but production has remained strong and prices have weakened 
west texas intermediate the american benchmark crude which 
normally sells at about 2 above opecmonitored crudes has fallen 
nearly 6 since april when it sold at more than 24 a barrel after 
stabilizing in the 1920 range for several weeks this spring and 
summer prices recently slipped to the 18 level 
analysts see few signs that nations ignoring their new supply 
quotas will cut back and their actions may spur others to cheat as 
well opec ministers raised their production ceiling in june from 
185 million barrels a day in the first half of the year to 195 
million 
the situation is becoming more dangerous for opec said 
fergus macleod analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london 
opecs eightmember monitoring panel will meet in geneva on 
sept 23 to take a look at the market and decide whether to boost 
the production cap to 20 million barrels a day in the final three 
months of the year 
the meeting was officially scheduled for just the eight 
committee members but ministers of the other five member nations 
also were expected to attend 
macleod said chances were diminishing that the cartel would lift 
its output ceiling in the last quarter because of a slowdown in 
demand for opec oil 
figures supplied by the international energy agency put demand 
for opec oil in the second half of this year at about 213 million 
barrels a day some 400000 barrels above earlier estimates 
demand however is expected to tumble to about 207 million 
barrels a day in the januaryjune period of 1990 analysts said 
the opec nations sharply trimmed their production starting late 
last year year to comply with an output accord fashioned in 
november to boost prices their cutbacks combined with accidents 
in oilproducing regions like the north sea and perceptions of 
supply problems due to the exxon oil spill in alaska helped kick 
prices up to unexpected levels last spring 
prices have eased recently however 
the average price of seven major crude brands monitored by opec 
was 1658 in the last week of july under the 18 target but it 
was well above the average price of 1234 recorded at the end of 
last november 
to meet the present target a number of countries would have had 
to cut their output but the energy agencys figures indicate that 
hasnt happened 
kuwait for example produced an estimated 16 million barrels a 
day in july above its opec quota of 11 million barrels a day 
output for the united arab emirates a persistent cheater was 
about 18 million barrels a day well over its quota of 1 million 
barrels 
nigerias output was estimated at 16 million barrels a day 
higher than its quota of 14 million barrels 
saudia arabia the worlds no 1 oil exporter pumped 47 
million barrels a day last month about the same as its quota 
iraq and iran were recorded at their quota levels of 28 million 
barrels a day as was venezuela at 17 million barrels the energy 
agency reported 
the other opec members produced near their targets indonesia 
12 million barrels ecuador 300000 barrels algeria 700000 
barrels qatar 400000 barrels libya 11 million barrels and 
gabon 200000 barrels 
opec recently acknowledged that its members supplied more crude 
to the world market in june than allowed under their production 
agreement 
opec differs from other analysts in the way it measures 
adherence to its production agreements it calculates a nations 
quota by figuring crude production and then subtracting or adding 
the amount of oil put into or drawn out of stocks 
the international energy agency is part of the organization for 
economic cooperation and development which is made up of 24 
western nations including the united states japan france and 
west germany

soybean futures prices plummeted to their lowest 
levels in more than 20 months thursday on the chicago board of 
trade on selling linked to the italian grain merchant ferruzzi 
finanziaria spa 
traders said several brokerages that are believed to have close 
ties to ferruzzi were heavy sellers in the soybean pit 
the selloff followed news that ferruzzi had dropped a lawsuit 
it had filed against the board of trade challenging the exchanges 
july 11 order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the 
july soybean contract 
the order was widely perceived as a move to prevent ferruzzi 
from cornering the us soybean market 
but a federal judge had denied ferruzzis request for an 
injunction and the july soybean contract expired on july 20 
rendering the lawsuit moot 
ferruzzi was believed to have complied with the order by 
shifting its huge market position from the july contract into the 
august contract which sustained the steepest losses thursday 
at the close soybeans were 2 cents to 26 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in august at 582 a bushel the lowest close 
for a nearmonth soybean contract since nov 19 1987 
wheat was 1 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 387 a 
bushel corn was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 
217 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with 
september at 135 a bushel

american airlines significantly boosted its 
presence at miami international airport thursday by announcing that 
its commuter carrier american eagle will open a hub at the home 
base of strikecrippled eastern airlines 
american eagle president robert e martens said the commuter 
carrier plans to open the hub oct 1 with 20 flights daily from 
miami to the florida cities of key west and west palm beach it 
plans to expand to 66 a day by adding flights to fort myers 
marathon and naples all in florida by the end of the year 
the commuter service also will seek approval from the us 
government and the government of the bahamas to schedule flights 
from miami to the bahamian towns of freeport marsh harbour and 
treasure cay 
the announcement at a news conference at the airport marked the 
latest in a series of moves by american the nations largest 
carrier to expand operations out of miami a market once dominated 
by eastern 
american set up a pilot and flight crew base in miami last 
january announced plans to expand in the market last april and 
last week opened a new concourse at miami international 
by closely coordinating the miami schedules of american eagle 
and american martens said we are able to provide our 
customers with the convenient connecting service that they have 
come to expect from us 
most of easterns flight attendants and pilots walked off the 
job march 4 in support of striking machinists and the airline has 
been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while struggling to 
stay in the air as a smaller carrier 
eastern managed to boost the number of its flights tuesday to 
350 about a third of its 1100 prestrike daily flights american 
eagle announced thursday that combined american and american eagle 
flights from miami should total 144 a day by the end of the year 
barbara lind manager of sales development for american eagle 
denied that the miami expansion of the commuter service and of 
american was prompted by easterns weakened position 
american has always planned to have a miami hub ms lind 
said it has been part of our 5year plan for quite a few years 
so its not something that happened overnight because of the 
misfortunes of eastern airlines 
the new connecting hub would mark the start of american eagle 
operations in miami 
american eagle now serves 138 small and mediumsized cities ms 
lind said feeding passengers into major cities for american 
she said american eagle which has acquired a 5500squarefoot 
passenger lounge at miami international has begun hiring for the 
approximately 75 positions it expects to open in miami 
we would like to keep our hiring local to all of the cities 
that we are opening she said 
asked if american eagle would hire striking eastern employees 
ms lind responded yes if they qualify 
she also confirmed americans interest in buying easterns 
profitable latin american routes if the routes come up for sale 
we would love to expand in central and south america and 
miami would be a perfect place to do that from she told the 
associated press 
but both ms lind and american spokesman jim brown at the 
carriers dallas headquarters refused to say if american and 
eastern were negotiating such a deal 
im afraid i cant comment on any specific negotiation 
brown told ap we are a buyer of assets of route authorities a 
buyer of gate facilities a buyer of slots whenever a company 
approaches us we certainly listen to what they have to say

the nations major retailers thursday posted minor to moderate 
july sales gains with some chains benefiting from further good 
results in womens apparel 
but the sales growth at store chains around the country partly 
reflected improvements from weak business last summer and didnt 
imply that a rebound in consumer spending has begun retail 
industry analysts said 
although july is normally a slow time for shopping analysts 
keep track of monthly sales figures from department stores mass 
merchandisers and discounters for clues about consumer behavior 
consumer spending supplies about twothirds of the power for total 
economic activity 
a relatively poor performance by industry leader sears roebuck 
and co illustrated the consequences of the sluggish pace of 
consumer spending sears tiny sales increase of 04 percent held 
down the industrys average 
an index compiled by investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
showed sales at 40 general merchandise chains apparel and 
furniture retailers rose 46 percent in july following junes 47 
percent rise 
michael bozic chairman of the sears merchandise group said 
overall results were adversely affected by softness in sales of 
durable goods which are expensive items such as ovens or 
dishwashers that consumers typically refrain from buying when they 
feel financially pinched 
consumers have reacted to rising mortgage payments and other 
credit costs lately by curtailing shopping trips or postponing 
purchases of items usually financed with loans until interest rates 
recede 
bozic said sears sales last month were being measured against 
fairly strong figures for the company in july of 1988 which made 
the percentage growth appear weaker than it was 
in contrast to sears weak performance the secondbiggest us 
retailer k mart corp reported business momentum continued to 
build while thirdranked walmart stores inc outperformed the 
industry as it usually does 
the pickup in sales at k mart that began in june continued into 
july said joseph e antonini chairman and chief executive officer 
k mart had suffered through several disappointing months earlier 
this year when sears created a stir with its new everyday 
lowpricing policy to win back market share from discounters 
drexels jeffrey edelman said retailers specializing in womens 
wear had the best news to report women have been updating their 
wardrobes this year after boycotting fashions for two years 
he said discounters also did better than earlier this year 
but i would not look at this as an indication that theres been 
an upturn in consumer spending edelman said 
jeffrey feiner an analyst at merrill lynch amp co said the 
sales gains were in general modest and to a large degree 
reflected the generally sluggish overall economic environment 
with tallies coming in below plan for many months of 1989 
retailers will face extra pressure to capitalize on business during 
the rest of the year as the peak shopping season arrives shopping 
usually picks up in august with backtoschool promotions and 
gathers momentum to christmas 
between 65 percent and 75 percent of retailers annual earnings 
come from business done in the second half of the year 
many industry analysts dont expect lower sales to damage 
retailers profitability much this year because store managers are 
controlling expenses and keeping inventories of unsold merchandise 
as low as possible 
the figures reported thursday were from major general 
merchandise chains and apparel retailers the governments monthly 
retail sales report is more comprehensive including sales at auto 
dealers supermarkets restaurants and elsewhere 
here are some of the results 
sears based in chicago said its sales edged up 04 percent in 
the four weeks ended july 29 but comparing results at stores open 
at least a year sears sales slumped 24 percent 
retailers and analysts consider these samestore or 
comparablestore sales a more accurate reflection of a companys 
performance than totals that include sales at newly opened stores 
k mart based in troy mich said its july sales rose 62 
percent and comparablestore sales were up 27 percent 
walmart with headquarters in bentonville ark said july 
sales rose 24 percent and samestore sales gained 10 percent 
jc penney co inc based in dallas reported a 12 percent 
overall sales gain in july and a 97 percent rise in samestore 
sales 
dayton hudson corp a minneapolisbased owner of department 
stores and discounters said july sales rose 156 percent and 
samestore sales were up 69 percent 
may department stores co based in st louis said last months 
total sales rose 81 percent while samestore sales were up 6 
percent 
specialty apparel retailer limited inc based in columbus 
ohio said july sales went up 12 percent and by the same percentage 
on a comparable store basis

general electric co plc and siemens ag on 
thursday made a fresh 34 billion bid for plessey co plc and 
quickly boosted their stake in the british electronics company to 
299 percent 
sources said the joint bidders spent 495 million snapping up 
plessey stock bringing their holdings to the maximum allowed under 
british takeover rules 
plessey rapidly rejected the offer as totally inadequate 
saying the british and german electronics giants had made a major 
price miscalculation 
analysts conceded that the price was at the low end of plesseys 
recent trading range but noted that the joint bidders were likely 
to be successful 
the 446ashare offer came one day after the british 
government announced an agreement with the bidders on conditions 
for renewing their bid for plessey 
the new offer replaced the original 28 billion bid that gec 
and siemens launched in november that bid automatically lapsed in 
january when the government decided to investigate what impact such 
a combination would have on competition within britains 
electronics industry 
the purchase of 113 million plessey shares lifted gecs and 
siemens stake a further 15 percent sources said the bidders are 
prohibited from buying more plessey shares until after the first 
closing date of their offer 
on londons stock exchange plessey sank 15 cents a share to 
finish at 441 
analysts said they were doubtful that plessey could find a white 
knight or devise an effective defense at this stage but several 
said the offering price might not be high enough to win over some 
institutional shareholders 
im surprised that theyve made it a final offer said john 
tysoe an analyst with shearson lehman hutton securities in london 
gec and siemens said they wouldnt increase the offer under any 
circumstances including the emergence of a counteroffer 
in a statement they said plessey on its own lacks the 
resources and capability to sustain let alone improve its 
profitability over more than the shortterm 
but the bidders may have provided plessey with a slight 
possibility of fending off the bid as too low tysoe said 
it does give plessey the chance to wriggle away said an 
electronics industry analyst at a london brokerage firm speaking 
anonymously 
plessey chairman sir john clark said in a statement to have 
offered such a low price for plessey after an attempt which has 
lasted almost nine months shows a total lack of understanding of 
plessey and of its immediate and longterm value to its 
shareholders 
plesseys strategy has been to criticize the lack of value that 
the bidders have placed on plesseys recent acquisitiondriven 
expansion into such areas as computer equipment as well the 
companys core electronics businesses 
it also has said that in trying to put together a merger plan 
that was palatable to britains defense and trade ministries gec 
and siemens have come up with a contrived structure that has 
nothing to do with industrial logic 
the department of trade and industry cleared gec and siemens to 
bid for plessey provided they agreed to several conditions intended 
to foster competition in the defense electronics industry 
among other things gec and siemens have pledged that gec wont 
take any interest in the plessey radar military communications and 
traffic controls businesses originally the companies had planned 
for gec to take a 35 percent interest in siemens defense interests 
after the merger 
gec is not related to the similarly named us company

italian grain merchant ferruzzi finanziaria spa 
said thursday it had dropped a moot lawsuit challenging a chicago 
board of trade order apparently aimed at preventing ferruzzi from 
cornering the us soybean market 
the board of trade termed the move a victory but ferruzzi said 
its withdrawal of the us district court lawsuit was a technical 
matter only and that it still planned to sue the exchange for 
losses incurred when it was forced to sell more than 20 million 
bushels worth of soybean futures contracts 
ferruzzi has denied trying to corner the market 
the withdrawn lawsuit filed in chicago sought an injunction 
overturning the board of trades july 11 order requiring all 
traders to reduce their holdings in the july soybean futures 
contract to 1 million bushels by july 20 
judge james zagel denied the injunction request on july 13 and 
the july soybean contract expired on july 20 rendering the suit 
moot 
ferruzzi said it dropped the lawsuit tuesday noting the suit 
applied to an act governing a period that now was over 
we continue to prepare a lawsuit that will seek compensation 
for the damages ferruzzi suffered as a result of the order the 
milanbased company said 
nevertheless the board of trade said it welcomed the suit 
withdrawal which demonstrates the integrity of futures market 
selfregulation at the board of trade 
ferruzzi has said that before the board of trades liquidation 
order it held contracts to take delivery of 23 million bushels of 
soybeans in july 
board of trade officials said only about 12 million bushels of 
soybeans were available for delivery against those contracts 
the exchange said it issued the order which did not mention 
ferruzzi to prevent defaults on contracts to deliver soybeans and 
to ensure the orderly expiration of the july contract 
ferruzzi one of the worlds largest soybean processers has 
denied trying to corner the market saying it needed all the 
soybeans it had contracted to buy in order to keep its plants 
running and to meet the demand for its products 
traders said the company appeared to comply with the order by 
selling july contracts and buying august contracts effectively 
rolling its huge market position into the next delivery month and 
potentially setting up another confrontation with the exchange 
but traders said that since the beginning of this week brokers 
who often handle ferruzzis orders have been selling large amounts 
of soybean contracts an indication the company was not seeking 
another showdown 
it doesnt look that way right now said one soybean trader 
who asked not to be named things could change but it really 
doesnt appear that way 
the august soybean contract expires aug 22

r david thomas the hamburger restaurant chain 
founder starring in the new wendys commercials has no interest in 
elbowing chryslers lee iaccoca aside as one of americas 
bestknown executive pitchmen 
the beefy highschool dropout who amassed a fortune peddling 
fast food said hed just as soon retreat to corporate obscurity if 
wendys admakers could devise an alternative campaign that would 
sell hamburgers 
but for now thomas is trying to project grandfatherly sincerity 
and folksy charm in a series of ads designed to reignite growth at 
the company he named after one of his daughters 20 years ago this 
fall 
if it works its fine thomas 57 said as he discussed his 
new role in an interview if it dont work im gone im 
history when i get up in the morning id rather see our stock go 
up than me on tv 
he owns about 8 percent of wendys stock worth about 40 
million at recent market prices 
the ad campaign comes at a potentially pivotal time for wendys 
international inc a dublin ohiobased concern that has lost 
ground by some measures over the past few years among the nations 
fastfood chains 
average sales at wendys 3762 restaurants rose 24 percent to 
759000 per store last year breaking a threeyear slide but 
sales per store were well below the companys peak of 871000 in 
1984 when clara pellers commercial battle cry wheres the 
beef helped stir consumer appetites for wendys 
in those days wendys ranked third among the fastfood chains 
behind mcdonalds corp and burger king corp which continue to 
claim the top two spots but hardees food systems inc reported 
average sales of 920000 at its 3200 restaurants in 1988 moving 
ahead of wendys by that measure 
industry analysts say part of the reason for the decline is that 
wendys advertising message became muddled after 1984 
an ad called russian fashion show designed to emphasize the 
choices wendys customers enjoy generated laughs and awards but 
sales per store fell in 1985 campaigns over the next two years 
using the themes choose fresh choose wendys and this is the 
good stuff failed to halt the decline 
in 1988 wendys and its new ad agency backer spielvogel bates 
inc scored some points with its funny hamburger ahamburger b 
ads in which a pitchman asked strange people to choose between a 
fresh hamburger from wendys or an obviously inferior product from 
someone else 
the weirdos always picked brand x 
but that approach was a reprise of ads another agency had made 
for wendys years earlier backer senior copywriter jim mckennan 
looked for something new 
thomas saw a few suggested approaches didnt like them and 
decided to urge the admakers himself to stress the basics of what 
made wendys different fresh meat choice of toppings and custom 
preparation i didnt think they knew what they was really 
dealing with he said 
after hearing thomas out mckennan said backers creative 
director bob lenz suggested that they try to talk thomas into 
being in the ads himself 
thomas had appeared in wendys ads in 1981 but his short 
introductions to the commercials were overshadowed by the 
controversy that arose over use of a double negative in the same 
ads aint no reason to go anyplace else 
wendys executives persuaded thomas who had stepped back from 
company operations in 1982 by becoming senior chairman to return 
to the front lines 
mckennan viewed it as a rare opportunity thomas founded the 
first wendys in columbus ohio in 1969 and named it after his 
daughter melinda who was then 8 years old and known to her brother 
and sisters as wenda 
putting thomas in ads would give the company a personality 
mckennan felt 
the theme is that wendys is in his image american ideals 
and hard work and giving people a lot for their money what better 
way to say that than have the guy who started the whole thing 
deliver it mckennan said 
on the days they shoot ads mckennan said he and thomas go over 
what the admakers would like him to say and thomas decides how he 
would say it 
in one ad a curlyhaired teenager sits beside thomas at a 
wendys and thomas says howdy dude 
that was thomas idea the founder grinned in the script he 
called me dude but i told them to let me call him dude seeing 
that he looked like one with that earring and all he said 
thomas performances in a halfdozen ads to date are unpolished 
mckennan said that makes them more believable 
but there are limits to realism thomas tools around in a 1952 
studebaker in another ad but it wasnt his thomas said he didnt 
even like the car 
his homespun appeal evidently isnt universal bob garfield an 
ad critic for the trade journal advertising age called thomas a 
steer in a halfsleeve shirt and said the ads wouldnt help 
sales but wendys executives say sales have improved in the past 
two months 
some viewers find it jarring that thomas says biness rather 
than business in the closing line our hamburgers are the 
best in the business or i wouldnt have named the place after my 
daughter 
thomas said the slurred word was simply a mistake and promises 
that he will pronounce it correctly in future ads 
mckennan plans to argue against it you dont want to take all 
those edges off its one of those things that makes him 
particular he said

with twitching antennae buzzing wings and bloodsucking barbed 
mouthparts that embed themselves in flesh like fishhooks armies of 
carnivorous insects this summer have caused a run on the sprays and 
lotions that repel them 
the unusually heavy infestation of flying and crawling pests 
that prey on humans is giving the companies that make and market 
repellents a lucrative season sales of insect repellents could 
rise by 40 percent this year over 1988 to 70 million some 
industry insiders estimate 
its incredible i just cant keep enough on the shelves 
said john learned manager of brooks drugs inc in burlington vt 
part of whats become known as the tick belt that stretches 
from new england to the midwest 
learned said hes selling 10 times the amount of repellents 
compared with last year and that many customers are buying a 
halfdozen cans at a time 
sc johnson wax which makes off and dominates the repellent 
market declined to disclose sales figures but richard j 
palmersheim product manager of off said the company expects 
sales to be stronger this year because of a general increase in the 
populations of all biting bugs nationwide 
even businesses that dont peddle chemical repellents are 
benefiting via sales of items ranging from screens to other 
natural antibug defenses like garlic and brewers yeast 
skinsosoft bath oil for example is said to be a hotselling 
insect repellent avon products inc which makes the oil doesnt 
advertise it as such though users have sworn by its bugdeterring 
qualities for years 
entomologists attribute part of the repellent boom to 
backtoback summers of drought and heavy rains which resulted in 
double populations in many regions because dormant eggs from dry 
1988 hatched in this seasons moisture 
they also credit the boom to a scare over lyme disease a 
potentially crippling ailment named after the town in connecticut 
where it first surfaced in the 1970s the disease is carried by the 
ixodes dammini commonly known as the deer tick a tiny but tough 
critter that lurks on grass and leaves 
although these ticks are multiplying rapidly because of the 
rising deer population which the bugs breed on when theyre young 
scientists say the furor over lyme disease has reached unfounded 
proportions 
were not likely to see an invasion of the bodysnatching 
ticks carrying off children said robert hall professor of 
entomology at the university of missouri in columbia he said 
products that profess to protect against lyme disease are an 
effort to capitalize on the mild hysteria 
many repellent makers are revamping marketing strategies to 
highlight their products effectiveness against deer ticks which 
hop on humans in the woods and can silently latch into flesh with 
barbed mouths 
in may for example eclipse laboratories inc of boca raton 
fla introduced tick garde a repellent that uses the same recipe 
as other well known products that cost a third as much eclipse 
peddles its potion with advertisements that proclaim this tick 
is a time bomb 
some reports project 5 million in tick garde sales this season 
which would be considered a remarkably strong showing for a new 
repellent in an already crowded market 
were not trying to scare or alarm said eclipse president 
harvey sosin all were trying to do is help educate the public 
of something that does exist and is spreading 
he attributed tick gardes higher price to packaging and 
advertising costs the product comes in a sleek 
pharmaceuticalstyle box that looks like it might contain an 
antiperspirant the box also contains a brochure that explains the 
proliferation of lyme disease and preventive measures 
we spent a lot of money on that insert that is very 
educational to the consumer sosin said 
but tick garde has aroused anger among competitors because of 
what they call its excessive price and unfounded claims of 
exclusivity 
for example both eclipse and littleton nhbased tender 
corp which sells a rival product called bens 100 market a 
formula made by speer co of memphis tenn 
tick garde sells for 895 a sixounce aerosol can nearly 
triple the price of a comparable can of bens 100 aerosol which 
tender president boyd bush called an identical product 
like virtually all other repellents used on the body they are 
based on the chemical compound nndiethylmetatoluamide 
commonly known as deet it was developed by the government in the 
1950s and first used by the military 
deets aroma repels bugs by blocking their ability to identify a 
warm moist body it could feed on said roger grothaus entomology 
director at johnson waxs bug lab near racine wis 
johnson wax began using deet commercially in 1957 with the 
introduction of off which it claims was the first massmarketed 
insect repellent 
deet does not thwart bees wasps and hornets though it has been 
found to deter mosquitoes biting flies and ticks 
experts say any compound containing more than 20 percent deet is 
effective against ticks tick garde is about 25 percent deet but a 
number of other products contain even more increasing the length 
of protection 
in fact many 100 percent deet products are available like 
maximum protection off miles laboratories incs cutter maximum 
strength and scheringplough corps muskol lotion but these 
products are used almost exclusively by avid outdoorspeople and 
usually are found only in sporting goods stores 
eclipses sosin said tick garde works not just because of deet 
he said deets combination with four other active ingredients make 
the product the best repellent you can buy 
but entomologists are skeptical hall said deet remains the 
crucial element of any repellent safe for the skin and hes not 
aware of any breakthroughs in synergistic chemistry that would 
target lyme disease 
there is a more powerful antitick protection based on a 
chemical called permethrin but its only safe to apply to clothes 
and lawns 
johnson wax estimated to control between 50 percent and 65 
percent of the repellent market credits itself with the foresight 
of developing in mid1988 a campaign targeting lymeendemic areas 
with special ads 
miles laboratories of elkhart ind waited until june to launch

making the soviet ruble into a useful world 
currency will require farreaching reforms of the soviet economic 
system according to a report to moscow by a panel of soviets and 
westerners 
the 60page report released thursday was sought by soviet 
officials who are searching for ways to bring their rigid 
unproductive economy into the modern world of trade and finance 
i hope that this is something that is to be carefully looked 
at we hope to distribute it widely in the soviet union vladimir 
popov one of the soviet participants said in a telephone 
interview 
the report was released at the geonomics institute think tank in 
middlebury vt the meeting place for the panel which was made up 
of scholars from the united states canada france and the soviet 
union 
because the ruble cannot be freely exchanged for dollars yen 
marks and other western currencies it has virtually no value 
outside the soviet union 
making the ruble convertible would permit expanded trade with 
the west and impose a market discipline on inefficient soviet 
enterprises in keeping with the perestroika campaign of soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
it also would encourage more foreign investment in the soviet 
union leading to a transfer of technology from the west western 
business executives favor it because they feel it would open a huge 
untapped market for their goods and services 
the panel proposed a fivestep plan for achieving full 
convertibility of the ruble possibly by as early as the year 2000 
but it noted that the obstacles to even a partial 
convertibility of the ruble are daunting it could trigger 
spiraling inflation cause shortages throw people out of work and 
exacerbate differences between rich and poor the panel said 
although the soviet council of foreign ministers last december 
ordered up a plan for partial convertibility of the ruble 
beginning with a 50 percent devaluation this coming jan 1 many 
observers believe the concept could run afoul of internal politics 
id say that the odds of a plan that would get the soviet 
union to meaningful convertibility being adopted are probably 
5050 in the foreseeable future said josef c brada an arizona 
state university professor who led the vermont panel 
as a first step toward convertibility the panel said hard 
western currencies should be sold to the highest bidding state 
enterprise instead of allocated by central planners as is 
currently done after that it said the auction should be 
broadened to a wider range of state enterprises 
in a third phase cooperatives private enterprises and 
sovietwestern joint ventures should be allowed to bid for hard 
currencies in an open auction which gradually would turn into a 
genuine foreignexchange market the panel said 
households would be allowed to own foreign currencies in a 
fourth phase although the government could maintain a twotier 
exchange rate finally foreigners would be given the right to 
exchange rubles freely 
the official exchange rate for the ruble is about 160 but the 
black market rate ranges from 40 cents to as little as 9 cents to 
the ruble 
making the ruble convertible would destroy the soviet pricing 
system under which industrial goods and raw materials are cheap 
and consumer goods are expensive 
entrepreneurs could exploit the discrepancy by selling cheap 
soviet oil to the united states at a huge markup for example 
using the dollars to buy japanese tape recorders and selling the 
tape recorders in the soviet union at another huge markup 
such trades would leave soviets short of oil and quickly put the 
soviet tape recorder factories out of business 
to prevent that the panel favors controls on trade that 
gradually would be phased out as soviet pricing came into line with 
world pricing 
many people have hoards of rubles with nothing to spend them on 
if they were allowed to exchange them for dollars a giant 
reservoir of money would be opened and inflation would soar 
the soviet and western participants disagreed on several points 
popov said he favored heavy borrowing from the west to ease the 
pain of a five to sevenyear transition to a market economy 
brada the group leader said that would lead to a debt crunch like 
polands 
brada said he favored wiping out the existing ruble hoards by 
issuing a new ruble something that josef stalin did in 1947 popov 
said such a step would be unpopular and rumors of it would trigger 
a run on stores as people spent their soontobeworthless currency

a consumer group said thursday that government 
regulators have been negligent and reckless in failing to 
enforce a law requiring makers of medical devices to report deaths 
and injuries associated with their products 
public citizen health research group said its analysis of food 
and drug administration documents found that manufacturers of 
devices such as heart pacemakers wheelchairs and breast implants 
routinely ignore the reporting requirement and that the fda has 
failed to seek prosecution of the companies 
the fda has been negligent and reckless in not enforcing this 
law said dr sidney wolfe director of the health research 
group in addition medical device companies are doing a reckless 
and dangerous job in failing to report these deaths injuries and 
malfunctions he said 
fdas inaction has meant that hazardous devices remain in use 
causing further needless harm to patients the group said in 
letters asking members of congress to investigate the matter 
the fda through spokesman jeff nesbit said it does not agree 
with public citizens assessment he said that while many of the 
figures the group used are correct they have been incorrectly 
interpreted as to the actual public health risk 
as to the delay public citizen cited between the time a company 
is alerted to a problem and the fda issues a reprimand he said 
that when fda inspectors find a violation they inform the company 
of it during the inspection if the problem warrants a recall the 
fda advises the company on the spot he said 
reps john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee and henry waxman dcalif chairman of the 
panels health subcommittee cited the public citizen study in 
announcing thursday that they have introduced a bill to tighten the 
reporting provision of the law 
in addition to device makers hospitals and physicians would be 
required to report deaths and injuries associated with malfunctions 
the documents obtained by public citizen through the freedom of 
information act contained the findings of routine fda inspections 
of medical device manufacturing companies between december 1985 and 
june 1988 
the documents also included letters called notice of adverse 
findings that the fda sent to companies failing to report deaths 
injuries and malfunctions 
wolfe called the fda letters a slap on the wrist 
i believe the general attitude at fda is you treat industry as 
your partner not your adversary wolfe said 
the law requires manufacturers of medical devices to report to 
the fda within five days a malfunction that results in death or 
serious injury he said but the groups review found that an 
average of eight months passed from the time the company was 
alerted to a problem to its discovery by the fda 
further the group said the fda took an average of six months 
to issue a reprimand 
during the period reviewed fda inspectors found reports of at 
least seven deaths 109 serious injuries and 265 malfunctions and 
one design defect none of which had been passed on to the fda 
wolfe said 
also 33 companies had failed to report device problems within 
the required deadline he said 
the group found serious violations relating to 76 products he 
said 
in one case four infant deaths and four serious injuries were 
associated with alarm failures on an infant respiration and 
heartrate monitor the group said in another two deaths a 
serious injury and 178 malfunctions were linked to use of 
intraaorta balloon catheters it said 
also 21 serious injuries were associated with a pacemaker and 
at least 31 serious injuries resulted from leaking breast 
prostheses the group said 
for violations that are shown to be deliberate the law provides 
for a fine of up to 10000 and three years in prison violations 
that are not deemed to be deliberate can be punished with a fine of 
up to 1000 and up to a year in prison said katherine meyer a 
lawyer with the group 
a general accounting office report in february said the fdas 
system for handling medical device reports was not adequate to 
handle the volume of reports currently received it pointed to 
long delays in getting information into the system and analyzing 
submitted reports

last years drought devastated many midwestern 
farmers but the federal government says crooked traders in the 
soybean pits of the chicago board of trade reaped illegal profits 
from the parched fields 
as the searing sun dried up soybean fields concern grew over 
how much damage the crop would suffer 
the potential for profit was high enough for legitimate traders 
because fears of a scarce crop sent the price of futures contracts 
skyrocketing but the government says 19 traders in the chaotic 
soybean pit wanted more 
with orders to buy abundant and orders to sell scarce the 
crooked traders held sell orders off the open market and illegally 
passed them to friends who profited the government alleges 
in those instances the orders of thousands of other customers 
were unfulfilled said us attorney anton valukas 
traders later split the substantial profits realized from 
the illegal trades according to a federal indictment 
in all a federal grand jury returned indictments wednesday 
against 46 traders at the board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange alleging they systematically conspired to skim profits 
from customer accounts and attempted to hide earnings from the 
internal revenue service 
the indictments the first stemming from a 2year 
investigation offer an insiders view of what the government says 
were widespread fraud schemes in four trading pits at the worlds 
largest futures markets where deals are made with a flash of a 
hand signal and fortunes made or lost in the wink of an eye 
in more than 700 charges the government alleges 19 traders in 
the frenzied soybean pit ran illegal schemes designed to cover 
their losses and increase their profits 
the indictment uses the colorful language of the trading pits to 
describe the alleged scheme traders hold decks or handfuls of 
customer orders bagmen are traders who agree to bagged or 
prearranged trades that are used to cover theft 
the government said traders used a variety of tactics to run 
their scheme including destroying trading cards and rewriting 
cards to conceal illegal trading the indictment alleged the 
traders even kept account ledgers to record money due to and from 
one another on illegal deals 
the methods the government says martin j dempsey used to handle 
a losing day last year provide an example of one of the more common 
frauds alleged in the indictments 
dempsey was charged with racketeering conspiracy 37 counts of 
mail and wire fraud and 83 counts of violating the commodities 
exchange act 
but on june 28 1988 dempseys troubles amounted to a 70000 
personal trading loss 
the government said he tried to shift the loss to other traders 
and succeeded in laying off 34000 but his willing accomplice was 
undercover fbi special agent richard ostrom posing as a crooked 
trader 
the scheme worked like this 
a broker who wanted to offset personal losses would prearrange 
trades with an accommodating trader and later repay the 
accommodating trader by misappropriating customer money 
in dempseys case the government said he assured ostrom that 
he would repay him by offsetting the loss against previously 
converted customer funds as well as through future thefts

little news to drive the market forward 
on the new york mercantile exchange the september contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
fell 7 cents to close at 1821 a barrel after trading as high as 
1850 during the session the contract had finished 25 cents

analysts said nervousness about the us hostage situation in 
the middle east helped buoy prices early in the day but once the 
crisis passed investor concern about excess oil returned 
traders have attributed some price strength in recent days to 
investor concern that political events involving the us hostages 
could disrupt oil shipments from the middle east 
gasoline and crude oil prices have weakened recently in the face 
of slowing demand and growing inventories refineries are pumping 
at over 90 percent capacity the highest level in several years 
but high gasoline prices have softened demand

avon products incs directors on thursday 
spurned investor irwin l jacobs 285 billion takeover proposal 
and reiterated their belief that the cosmetics giant should remain 
independent 
the move the latest in a string of rejections the direct sales 
company has doled out to unwanted suitors had been expected 
but speaking from his headquarters in minneapolis jacobs said 
he would take avon chairman and chief executive james e preston up 
on an offer to meet and discuss avons business plans 
preston said in a letter to jacobs that he would be willing to 
meet with the investor as he would with any major shareholder 
but not to negotiate a sale of the company an avon spokesman 
also noted that jacobs would not be allowed to meet with the entire 
board 
we are going to take the high road in this thing jacobs 
said in a telephone interview i will very happily meet with him 
which is more than others have gotten to do 
jacobs said he thought a meeting could be held within the week 
preston officially responded to jacobs offer by letter but 
phoned the investor before the letter was released jacobs 
described the call as very friendly and amicable and one that i 
was pleased to get and yet i wished the results were a little 
better 
on wall street avon stock slid 62 cents a share to 3587 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading indicating dealers 
were skeptical of jacobs 41ashare offer 
on wednesday jacobs tried the solo approach with avon 
directors who less than two months ago rejected a bid engineered 
by jacobss partner and avons rival direct sales company amway 
corp 
in his brief letter to jacobs preston said the board 
thoroughly reviewed the proposal with its investment banker 
morgan stanley amp co at a regularly scheduled board meeting 
the board unanimously rejected your proposal preston said 
the board believes that the best interests of the shareholders 
would be served by avon remaining an independent company and being 
allowed to execute its business plan 
through a partnership with jacobs amway controls about 103 
percent of avons common stock jacobs controls about 55 percent of 
the avon stock owned by the alliance known as aj partnership 
in may the avon board rejected amways hostile 39ashare 
takeover bid and indicated it would resist future acquisition 
attempts days later avon also rebuffed overtures from mary kay 
corp parent of the doortodoor makeup seller mary kay cosmetics 
inc 
in addition to paying 225 billion for avons 5491 million 
common outstanding shares jacobs also said he might redeem avons 
preferred shares at 3350 each or a total of about 603 million 
raising the price tag on avon to roughly 285 billion

soybean futures plunged to a 20month low thursday on selling 
linked to good growing weather poor demand and apparent 
liquidation of a large holding by italian grain merchant ferruzzi 
finanziaria spa 
on other markets precious metals rallied strongly energy 
futures were lower cattle were mostly higher and pork futures were 
mixed 
at the chicago board of trade soybeans for delivery in august 
settled 26 cents lower at 582 a bushel the lowest settlement 
for a nearmonth soybean contract since nov 19 1987 
wheat settled 1 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 387 
a bushel corn was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september 
at 217 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with 
september at 135 a bushel 
forecasts for a continuation of nearperfect growing conditions 
in the midwest provided a bearish atmosphere for the soybean 
market but traders and analysts said the steep decline probably 
was triggered by signs of weak demand and selling by ferruzzi a 
leading european grain dealer that has had a large holding in 
soybean futures 
the slack market for soybeans and soybean meal also reflected a 
reluctance among users to make large purchases ahead of the 
september harvest period when new supplies typically drive prices 
down 
analyst dale gustafson of drexel burnham lambert inc said cash 
soybean meal prices had dropped 2 to 4 a ton on wednesday and the 
futures market reacted from the opening bell 
the sharp drop in august soybean prices occurred near the close 
on heavy selling by central soya co and refco inc thought to be 
on behalf of ferruzzi which owns central soya 
i think the trade suspects that yes said analyst dale 
gustafson of drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago a 
one soybean trader who spoke on condition of anonymity was 
more certain 
it was ferruzzi that sold he said that pressured most of 
the beans and meal and down we went 
central soya president david swanson said the company was an 
aggressive buyer in the cash market but declined to comment on 
futures market activities 
heavy selling by ferruzzi would suggest the company is 
liquidating its position in the august contract possibly because 
of the increased availability of supplies on the cash market 
earlier in the day the board of trade announced that ferruzzi 
had dropped a lawsuit against the exchange challenging its july 11 
order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the july 
soybean contract 
the exchanges order was widely perceived as a move to prevent 
ferruzzi from cornering the us soybean market 
a federal judge had denied ferruzzis request for an injunction 
on july 13 and the july soybean contract expired on july 20 
rendering the lawsuit moot 
ferruzzi was believed to have complied with the order by 
shifting its huge market position from the july contract into the 
august contract raising the potential for another confrontation 
before the contracts aug 22 expiration 
gold and silver futures posted strong gains on new yorks 
commodity exchange despite a rise in the dollars value against

the hundredpage indictments the government 
dumped on the commodities world may have created an initial 
spectacular splash and could signal more charges to come but 
defense lawyers and other experts see weakness behind all that 
paper 
ive been doing this for 25 years and nobodys ever written 
this much attorney ed genson said wednesday hefting the legal 
documents that federal prosecutors produced several hours earlier 
in indicting 46 traders at the worlds two largest futures 
exchanges 
and if it takes that long to explain what they did wrong he 
added then my position is that they havent done much wrong 
genson has two clients indicted in the first wave but another 
two dozen have retained his services because they expect to be 
indicted his skepticism about the charges is shared by others 
what is being alleged is serious from the point of view of 
rulebreaking at the exchanges but as far as massive amounts of 
money being stolen from customers that just hasnt been shown 
yet said daniel siegel a futures market specialist and 
assistant professor of finance at northwestern university 
people knew what was coming when the investigation was first 
revealed he added and quite frankly i dont think people 
will stop using these markets as a result 
us attorney general dick thornburgh said the charges were part 
of a crackdown on whitecollar crime in all its various guises 
from wall street to chicagos lasalle street to main street and 
all stops in between 
prosecutors charge that a variety of illegal schemes took place 
at the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
during the 2year undercover investigation all to the detriment 
of customers 
thornburghs presence at the news conference announcing the 
indictments which ranged from mail and wire fraud to racketeering 
for allegedly bilking profits from hundreds of customers lent a 
certain weight to the proceedings 
but anton valukas us attorney for the northern district of 
illinois sais the alleged activity involved hundreds of customers 
and thousands of trades but he declined to place a dollar amount 
on the fraud other than to say it was significant 
defense attorneys and traders suggested a deeper look into the 
indictments themselves reveal few significant abuses actually took 
place 
they acknowledged that a handful of traders likely made large 
profits through illegal trades but also hinted that motives other 
than a serious desire to fight crime may have driven some the 
investigation 
just hours after the indictments were announced a house 
committee approved legislation reauthorizing the commodity futures 
trading commission the federal agency that regulates the commodity 
futures exchanges 
the legislation approved by the agriculture committee would 
grant permanent regulatory authority to the cftc which congress 
has reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four years 
since the agency was created in 1974 
the measure which now goes to the full house also would impose 
restrictions on trading practices such as dual trading that have 
come under criticism following disclosure of the commodities probe 
there are a few practices that they want to choke out of the 
markets said one trader who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
and nobody the exchanges or the regulators has the guts to do 
it 
among the market practices the trader identified were the 
openoutcry system and dual trading both of which lend 
themselves to abuse by dishonest traders 
under openoutcry traders shout orders and wave hand signals to 
each other in the freeforall auction of contracts dual trading 
allows a client to trade for his own account as well as his 
customers 
im not sure there was an ulterior motive but the 
prosecutorial mentality assumes that if a person can do something 
immoral or illegal they will said genson 
siegel like several defense attorneys interviewed wednesday 
predicted a second wave of indictments would follow as more traders 
at the cbot and merc are persuaded to cooperate with the government 
but unlike most of the defense attorneys he found something to 
be encouraged about 
i doubt if getting rid of the openoutcry system is what the 
feds had in mind with the indictments but people have been 
complaining about it for a long time he said 
what this might do is enable the exchanges to overcome the 
resistance out there and quiet the cries about accountability by 
moving to electronic trading that is the big battle just over the 
horizon the fight to be the preeminent futures market and the 
international competition is ferocious he said

burger king corp said thursday it has selected 
the texasbased agency sosa amp associates to handle promotions and 
advertising directed at the hispanic market 
the nations secondlargest fastfood chain behind mcdonalds 
corp has been looking for a new hispanic ads agency for about a 
month 
niether the agency nor burger king would disclose how much the 
miamibased restaurant company plans to spend on the hispanic 
market 
in another development sosa disclosed thursday that it had 
agreed in principle to sell a 49 percent stake to darcy masius 
benton amp bowles usa a new yorkbased agency recently hired as one 
of burger kings main ad agencies 
a burger king spokeswoman said the sosadarcy deal was not a 
major swing factor in the selection of sosa for burger kings 
hispanic account 
sosa based in san antonio texas is one of the nations 
largest hispanic ad agencies handling billings of 40 million and 
counting among its clients companies such as cocacola co 
anheuserbusch companies inc and gte corp 
on wednesday cocacola unveiled the first of a series of ads 
from sosa that it plans to run through 1992 saluting hispanic 
contributions to america 
at burger king sosa succeeds the new yorkbased ad agency 
castor which resigned last month after three years as burger 
kings hispanic ad agency 
gary l langstaff burger kings executive vice president of 
marketing said sosa was selected because of its keen sensitivity 
to the various elements of the hispanic market 
he said in the statement that sosas partnership with darcy 
will greatly enhance our determination to deliver excellence and 
sustainability to our integrated marketing strategy 
sosas job will be to create mostly spanishlanguage ads and 
promotions for burger king according to agency president lionel 
sosa 
the 8yearold agency was one of about a halfdozen agencies 
considered for the job burger king officials said 
lionel sosa said the agency will resign its assignment as the 
hispanic ad agency for dominos pizza to avoid a potential conflict 
burger king has been reviewing its advertising agencies in the 
wake of the acquisition of its parent company pillsbury co by 
the britishbased grand metropolitan plc earlier this year 
in may burger king said it would divide its main 215 million 
advertising assignment between darcy and saatchi amp saatchi 
advertising based in new york 
on the matter of the sale of a stake in the sosa agency lionel 
sosa said a number of different ad agencies have approached us 
over the years 
but he said darcy offered the best chemistry of creative 
approach and opportuntity in terms of serving our clients and 
theirs 
he said the talks with darcy lasted about a year and grew more 
serious after darcy won the burger king assignment 
sosa said he figures burger king viewed his agencys affiliation 
with darcy as a big bonus 
clayton wilhite president of darcy said the agency made the 
investment in sosa both out of recognition that advertisers are 
turning to hispanic agencies for advertising directed at that 
market and to improve profit margins 
he said darcy handles billings of about 18 billion a year

longterm bond prices sank thursday driving 
yields higher even though a government report added to signs that 
the economy might be slipping into a mild recession 
a recession would be good for the bond market because it would 
help squelch inflation which erodes the value of interestpaying 
securities 
the commerce department said its index of leading economic 
indicators edged down 01 percent in june it was the fourth 
decline in five months and renewed speculation that the longest 
peacetime economic expansion may be at an end 
bond prices fluttered slightly higher after the figures were 
released but sank later and ended with a substantial loss 
the us treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 2132 point or 
about 656 per 1000 in face value its yield which moves in the 
opposite direction from price rose to 790 percent from 784 
percent late wednesday 
shorterterm bonds had smaller declines the 30year bond was 
the biggest loser evidently because of a threat by president bush 
to veto a savings and loan bailout in favor of his own plan 
bushs plan would bring a huge supply of longterm bonds from a 
new agency onto the market to finance the savings and loan debt 
depressing prices many bond investors had speculated that bush 
would yield to congresss plan in which the money would be raised 
with bonds of all maturities instead of just longterm ones 
for the bond market the threatened veto was the straw that 
broke the camels back said ward mccarthy of stone amp mccarthy 
research associates inc 
also hurting bond prices was general nervousness that the 
markets recent rally was overextended some traders saw unwelcome 
signs of economic health in figures this week on auto sales chain 
store sales and new home sales 
the market had run an awful long way in this rally and it was 
beginning to get some cold feet said william griggs a principal 
in griggs amp santow inc 
some traders were mildly concerned by the weakness in the 
dollar if the dollar continues to fall it could limit the federal 
reserves willingness to lower interest rates for fear of weakening 
the dollar even more said hugh a johnson a senior vice president 
at first albany corp 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were down between 332 point and 316 point 
intermediate maturities fell point to 732 point and longterm 
issues were point to 1116 point lower the telerate inc 
financialinformation service reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was down 449 to 120080 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities 
of five years or longer fell 030 to 33530 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 332 point the average yield to 
maturity because of rounding remained at 716 percent 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 788 percent as the 
discount fell 2 basis points to 763 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 782 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 
743 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 768 percent as the 
discount rose 1 basis point to 717 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 8 percent unchanged from late wednesday

home shopping network inc gambled and 
lost big in its lawsuit claiming gte corp supplied it with an 
inadequate phone system a setback that only adds to the video 
retailers problems industry analysts say 
a jury wednesday rejected hsns 15 billion suit instead 
awarding two gte subsidiaries 50 million each in a libel and 
slander countersuit 
this really puts home shopping network behind the 
eightball said william block an analyst at newhard cook amp co 
in new york at one time they were really soaring 
home shopping which replaced the gte phones with an mci system 
reported a profit of 7 million on sales of 5869 million for the 
ninemonth period ended may 31 hsns stock has plummetted from the 
mid40s in 1987 to less than 4 a share 
in its september 1987 suit hsn claimed it lost millions of 
calls from viewers of its cable tv show and 500 million in 
potential sales in 1986 and early 1987 because gte telephone 
equipment it contracted for could not handle the volume of calls 
during a sixweek trial in pinellas county the jury rejected 
charges of fraud negligent misrepresentation breach of trust and 
confidence and breach of fiduciary duty against gte 
the panel instead agreed with gtes countersuit maintaining 
that the electronic retailers financial problems were actually the 
result of bungled management gte argued that overexpansion 
competition and customer dissatisfaction rather than insufficient 
equipment caused hsns losses 
analysts said the victory mattered more to hsn than to the 
communications giant 
gte is such a huge company that this is seen as just a 
onetime gain with little longrange implications said james 
stork of duff amp phelps inc in chicago but most investors are 
just glad its over when something like this goes to a jury there 
is no telling what could happen 
theres definitely a sigh of relief said greg sigmund an 
analyst at ag edwards inc in st louis no one was really 
expecting an adverse decision for gte but it was on the back of 
the minds of a lot of people 
gte florida and gte communications received awards for damages 
to their reputations and credibility by home shopping network and 
its two top executives 
the jury heard a lengthy and complex presentation of technical 
issues and it understood that the gte companies had provided 
quality service and equipment to help a small company grow very 
quickly into a major business said james c carideo gte florida 
vice president and general counsel 
hsn was cited for 20 million of the total award with 40 
million each levied against hsn chairman roy speer and president 
lowell paxson 
hsn said it would appeal 
nando difilippo hsns executive vice president and general 
counsel said the company would claim the court should not have 
presented gtes libel and slander counterclaim to the jury 
under hsns format viewers can only buy hsn merchandise as long 
as the item is displayed on the screen the network said it lost 42 
million calls when up to half of its incoming calls never reached 
sales operators because of the allegedly faulty equipment

citibank president john reed said 
thursday that concessions made by creditor banks in a recent accord 
with mexico wont be repeated for other debtor countries 
speaking before the local chileanamerican chamber of commerce 
breakfast reed who runs the biggest us bank also said he 
strongly opposed the notion of government control of the foreign 
debt problem and observed that the world banking communitys 
attention has shifted away from the third world 
reed is on a tour of several latin american countries including 
venezuela which is seeking a refinancing of its debt 
he said he has been asked if other countries will get the same 
kind of relief that mexico received which included a 35 percent 
reduction in its obligations and 23 billion in fresh credit 
it was a plan especially for mexico he said personally 
i dont believe there will be another of this type really there 
wont be another 
there are certain things that were done in that case which i 
dont think the banks will do again we have learned that they are 
very difficult transactions reed said 
he said the accord required abandoning about 15 billion in 
claims by creditor banks and that comes directly from the banks 
shareholders about 30 percent of the loss in earnings was 
absorbed by us banks and the rest by european and japanese banks 
he said 
reed argued that the banking community was much better equipped 
than governments to deal with the third worlds foreign debt 
problems and said he strongly opposed a socalled political 
solution 
he said the leading industrialized democracies often have 
discussed the debt problem but they never come out and say 
okay were going to take our government resources and resolve the 
problem 
reed said us treasury secretary nicholas bradys plan for 
easing the debt problem relies on the banks and not on public 
coffers for fresh credit 
its better that we in the private sector try to resolve 
these problems exchanging debt for investment extending credits 
for the long term giving time

high interest rates have lured 23 
billion home from foreign banks boosting the nations foreign 
reserves to 6 billion the head of mexicos national bank said 
thursday 
the first half of 1989 saw an abundant repatriation lured by 
high interest rates banco de mexico general director miguel 
mancera said 
he spoke at the fifth national banking meeting the most 
important financial meeting of the year in mexico 
mexicans are estimated to have 28 billion stashed in foreign 
banks mostly in the united states much of the money fled because 
of the economic crisis that began in 1982 with the worldwide drop 
in oil prices 
mancera said mexicos balance of payments showed a 585 million 
deficit through july he called it relatively modest considering 
the circumstances 
mexico paid out 600 million to service its public debt and 700 
million on private debt service he said during the same period 
mancera said net foreign direct investment was about 900 million 
the banking meeting in this northern industrial capital of 3 
million came in the aftermath of a july 23 accord between mexico 
and private foreign creditors to restructure 54 billion of 
mexicos 107 billion foreign debt 
the agreement doesnt constitute a magic solution to our 
problems treasury secretary pedro aspe told the 
standingroomonly crowd of banking and government officials from 
mexico the united states and other countries 
about 1500 people are attending the twoday banking meeting at 
monterreys city theater 
the current agreement wont permit us to recover overnight 
what the crisis of overindebteness took from us over several

machinists union leader charles bryan marked the 
start of the fifth month of the eastern airlines strike thursday by 
pledging 100000 of his own money to a new effort to help the 
unionbacked buyout bid of chicago businessman joseph ritchie 
bryan said he was urging eastern employees who could afford it 
along with people across the country who support the strikers to 
contribute to an investment fund he hopes will add 50 million to 
the ritchie effort bryan who made the announcement at a news 
conference declined to identify the investment house that is 
establishing the fund and said legal details were still being 
worked out 
in a separate development thursday the master executive council 
of easterns pilots union unanimously passed a resolution asking 
pilots at carriers nationwide to initiate a suspension of air 
service the parking of planes on runways would be aimed at putting 
pressure on congress to investigate the fitness of eastern owner 
frank lorenzo to run eastern and its sister carrier continental 
airlines 
bryan said theres enough money already behind the ritchie bid 
which has been scoffed at by easterns parent texas air corp and 
received coolly by the us bankruptcy court in new york the court 
has been overseeing eastern since it filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization on march 9 five days after being hit by 
the crippling strike 
ritchie has offered 50 million and the unions have kicked in 
another 50 million as well as wage concessions totaling 210 
million in addition the unions have pledged up to 175 million 
from their wages if certain goals arent met during the first six 
months of operation under joint ownership 
bryan said the aflcio also is willing to offer a line of credit 
ranging from 65 million to 200 million for the bid 
texas air has indicated it wants 100 million to 200 million in 
cash up front from any buyer for eastern 
we are not doing this because we need the money bryan said 
referring to the new investment fund he said the effort was meant 
to counter eastern misinformation about its ability to rebuild 
without the unions and also to show the commitment of easterns 
employees to the airline 
im making it because i know it will work bryan said 
saying that in 33 years at eastern he has accumulated that money 
through an austere lifestyle but is willing to put it into buying 
the airline 
he said money for the fund would be returned if the buyout bid 
never comes to fruition most of easterns striking employees have 
no money left for such a fund bryan agreed but he said all 
employees would benefit because the investment funds would reduce 
the amount of wage concessions they would have to make in the 
purchase from texas air 
eastern pilots union spokesman ron cole said he thought the fund 
was a good chance for people to put their money where their mouth 
is and show their commitment to easterns employees 
eastern on aug 1 increased its schedule to 350 daily flights 
and says it will be back to 800 daily flights and out of bankruptcy 
by years end 
bryan said eastern is in desperate straits losing money on 
each flight because of sharply discounted fares and that it lacks 
pilots mechanics and spare parts for its planes 
eastern officials said bryans announcement wouldnt change 
anything 
our position has not changed the airline is not for sale 
said spokesman robin matell

a top american express co executive said 
thursday he plans to retire because of mistakes made on my 
watch that led the company to issue an unusual public apology to 
international banker edmund j safra 
the financial services giant said that harry l freeman 57 
advised chairman james d robinson iii that he planned to retire as 
executive vice president of corporate affairs and communications by 
years end 
freeman would be the first american express employee to leave 
his job as a result of the companys admission that people acting 
on its behalf had been involved in a campaign to discredit safra 
in a letter released by american express freeman told robinson 
he was convinced that the companys ongoing review of the matter 
will show he performed his duties faithfully and honestly 
however a wellintentioned effort for which i had executive 
responsibility went awry he wrote mistakes were made on my 
watch and accordingly i believe my decision to retire while 
painful is appropriate 
freeman a 14year veteran of american express was unavailable 
to comment on the letter and was said to be en route to joining his 
family for a longplanned vacation to africa he was expected back 
at work aug 21 
people familiar with the matter said freeman felt responsibility 
for allowing an operation designed to collect information about 
safra who at one time managed a bank for american express to get 
out of control 
after safra left the american express operation in 1984 he 
turned his attention to his other holding republic new york corp 
and its republic national bank 
but american express collected information on safra because 
republic had an agreement not to compete with the american express 
bank in the lucrative swiss banking market until 1988 and wanted 
the pact enforced 
last friday robinson apologized publicly to safra who lives in 
geneva for an unauthorized and shameful effort by people acting 
on american express behalf in fueling false media reports that 
linked safras banks to money laundering 
american express also agreed to pay 8 million to charities of 
safras choice to settle the dispute 
robinson told american express employees in a memo thursday of 
his deep regret that freeman intended to retire 
harry is much loved throughout our organization and like 
others i will miss his wisdom and his great sense of humor 
robinson wrote i wish him the best in future endeavors and look 
forward to his counsel as a loyal american express alumnus

citing the impacts of the continuing coal industry 
strike and the uncertain impact of new acid rain legislation 
newmont mining corp on thursday canceled plans for a 
recapitalization of peabody holding company inc in which it holds 
a stake 
the recapitalization plan did not have the flexibility to 
accommodate the possible negative implications of those two recent 
events said newmont chairman gordon r parker 
denverbased newmont had announced plans for a transaction that 
would have yielded a 425 million pretax dividend from peabody to 
newmont together with a 75 million payment to newmont from new 
peabody investors while allowing newmont to retain its current 
equity in peabody 
newmont said it planned to use the cash to cut its debt 
the other current shareholders of peabody were simultaneously to 
surrender their entire interest in a redemption by peabody salomon 
brothers inc and shearson lehman hutton inc would have become 
shareholders in their place under the plan 
the decision to halt the plan which called for a 1 million 
redemption option payment thursday to the current holders of 5003 
percent of peabodys shares was based on the strike and president 
bushs announcement of plans to cut acid rain emissions the 
company said 
as originally conceived the recapitalization including the 
redemption price and the dividend level were sound and salomon 
and shearson were prepared to give newmont the right in the 
mid1990s to become the sole owner of peabody if newmont so 
chose parker said 
the strike that began in june at pittston and spread to much 
of the rest of the coal industry and the potential impact on the 
entire coal industry of the administrations newly proposed acid 
rain legislation have made the redemption price under the option 
from our coshareholders in peabody potentially uneconomic to 
peabody he said 
we do not wish to compromise our ongoing 4997 percent 
investment in peabody he said

lincoln savings amp loan used accounting 
gimmickry to inflate its profits a private accounting firm 
said in a report released thursday as regulators put the insolvent 
thrift in receivership 
seldom in our experience as accountants have we encountered a 
more egregious example of the misapplication of generally accepted 
accounting principles kenneth leventhal amp co said in the report 
federal regulators who seized the irvinebased thrift in april 
placed lincoln in receivership thursday chartering a new federal 
mutual association to run it under the name lincoln savings amp loan 
association fa 
the action helps prevent its former parent phoenixbased 
american continental corp from making claims on lincolns 408 
billion in assets in april american continental filed for 
reorganzation under federal bankruptcy laws 
lincoln remained open throughout its ordeal and depositors will 
be able to continue their business with lincoln as usual federal 
home loan bank board chairman danny wall said thursday 
a federal audit found lincoln had a negative net worth of 631 
million as of june 30 and state officials said last week that 
lincoln was 906 million in the hole some analysts and regulators 
have estimated the total loss to the government may top 2 billion 
which would make lincoln the costliest thrift collapse ever 
american continental has been criticized for using lincolns 
federally insured deposits for junk bond and other nontraditional 
investments regulators are investigating whether lincoln and 
american continental used improper transfers of funds and 
accounting methods to make the unit look healthier than it was 
thursdays 10page report by leventhal amp co which examined 15 
real estate transactions at lincoln stemmed from a wider special 
examination ordered by the federal home loan bank board in 1988 
bank board spokesman bill fulwider said 
in order to boost earnings lincoln entered into noneconomic 
transactions and turned to accounting gimmickry the july 14 
report to the bank board said 
leventhal acknowledged that its report was based on limited 
information but said they believed it was adequate to support its 
findings 
lincoln was manufacturing profits the report concluded 
in phoenix american continental attorney marilyn fried said she 
had not seen the report and could not comment on its specifics but 
she denied that lincoln and american continental had used improper 
accounting techniques saying their books had been audited by major 
accounting firms 
she accused regulators of vastly overstating lincolns losses 
noting that officials had put the thrifts net worth at 112 
million as of dec 31 and a stillsolvent 20 million even when it 
was seized in april 
lincoln was placed in the joint conservatorship of the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp and federal deposit insurance 
corp on april 14 but until thursday it was still technically 
owned by american continental said fulwider 
fulwider described the receivership as a further step toward 
final resolution but said an immediate sale or liquidation of 
lincoln was not in sight
