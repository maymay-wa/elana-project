a statebystate poll of nearly 10000 likely 
voters wednesday rated george bush as solidly ahead in the race for 
the presidency saying he held a huge lead in the contest for 
electoral votes 
although polls of the nation as a whole indicate a close race 
between bush and michael dukakis the abc newswashington post 
survey of the standings in each state where the election actually 
is decided put bush firmly ahead 
abc reported that bush led solidly in 21 states with a total of 
220 electoral votes just 50 short of the total needed to win 
dukakis was firmly ahead in three states and washington dc for 
30 electoral votes 
with the election nearly a month off voter sentiments can 
change but the abcpost poll the only public survey of its size 
this year was the first recent poll to indicate a significant 
advantage for either candidate 
its interesting and encouraging bush told abc i dont 
know what the other fellow has but look weve just got a game 
plan stay with it and if polls are encouraging it makes me feel 
good but i also remember when they werent 
the poll was conducted from sept 21 through monday among 9778 
likely voters in the 50 states and the district of columbia its 
margins of error varied by state from five points to 10 points 
abc and the post also conducted a standard national survey that 
put the race at 51 percent for bush to 45 percent to dukakis a cbs 
newsnew york times poll wednesday had nearly the same result 
5045 
such national polls measure popular sentiment across the nation 
as a whole but in the election each state gives its electoral 
votes to the winner in that state so the statebystate standings 
are more relevant to the outcome such polls are rarely done 
because conducting polls in each state requires a far larger sample 
than surveying the nation as a whole 
according to the post from 100 to 500 voters were interviewed 
in each state the post noted that there are many potential sources 
of error in the poll including the length of time it took to 
conduct the survey 
the states that abc put firmly in bushs column included texas 
where recent state polls have given him a 10point lead new 
jersey where he led by eight points in a state poll last week and 
ohio where he led in a state poll a month ago by just four points 
also the states that it said leaned toward bush included new 
york where most other recent polls have shown a slight dukakis 
lead and california where most recent polls have found a tie 
these are the states that abc said firmly favored bush alaska 
arizona florida georgia idaho indiana kentucky maine 
michigan mississippi new hampshire new jersey new mexico north 
carolina north dakota ohio south carolina texas utah virginia 
and wyoming 
it said these were leaning for bush alabama california 
connecticut delaware iowa kansas louisiana maryland missouri 
nebraska nevada new york oklahoma south dakota and tennessee 
abc rated these states a tossup arkansas colorado montana 
rhode island washington west virginia wisconsin 
firmly favoring dukakis it said were hawaii massachusetts and 
minnesota and the district of columbia leaning for dukakis were 
illinois oregon pennsylvania and vermont 
the cbstimes poll meanwhile found increasing doubt about the 
qualifications of the republican vice presidential nominee sen 
dan quayle to serve as president and it indicated the concern was 
keeping the race a close one in terms of the popular contest 
nationally 
by a 21 margin probable voters in the cbstimes poll doubted 
quayles qualifications for the presidency his worst rating in 
that survey he was seen as qualified by only 30 percent while 
twice as many 63 percent said they would worry about him 
serving as president 
quayles presence appeared to help dukakis asked if they could 
vote only for president without considering the running mate 
support for dukakis dipped from 45 percent to 41 percent bushs 
support remained at 50 percent 
another poll wednesday by louis harris and associates put the 
popular contest at 5048 it also said dukakis may be helped a bit 
by concern over quayle asked to chose between bush and dukakis 
only without their running mates mentioned dukakis dipped from 48 
to 46 percent support bush remained at 50 percent 
harris polled 1355 likely voters oct 6 through monday its 
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points 
the smaller national abcpost poll was done oct 5 through 
tuesday among 1187 likely voters nationwide the cbstimes poll 
was done oct 8 through monday among 1009 probable voters both 
had fourpoint margins of error

a hotel owner criticized for throwing adolf 
hitler birthday parties for his employees said wednesday he plans 
to donate his collection of nazi material to a planned holocaust 
museum in washington 
ralph engelstad 58 who owns the imperial palace hotel and 
casino said he began discussions wednesday with officials of the 
us holocaust memorial council toward donating the nazi items 
we have offered it they have expressed interest in having 
it engelstad said 
engelstad who earlier painted over a nazi wall mural and 
scrapped plans to display the nazi items at his car museum said he 
hoped the planned donation to the holocaust museum would end the 
flap over his activities 
as i said earlier i now feel i have done what can be done 
engelstad said reading from a statement i have apologized for 
what cannot be undone 
engelstad said he hoped to donate the various nazi artifacts to 
a holocaust museum that is being planned by the council in 
washington but he said he would keep the various cars he has 
bought that are related to the nazi regime 
in a letter to the jewish federation of las vegas on tuesday 
engelstad said he would sell the collection of naziera cars 
motorcycles posters and other items and turn the room into a 
warehouse 
i have not been successful to date in convincing you that my 
apology for my insensitivity to jewish concerns was heartfelt and 
sincere engelstad wrote 
in retrospect i realize that what was missing in my apology 
was an acknowledgement of the specific hurt and pain felt by the 
jewish community over this issue he said 
engelstad a former goaltender on the university of north 
dakotas hockey team announced plans earlier this year to set up a 
5 million endowment to benefit the universitys hockey program 
the schools winter sports center was subsequently renamed ralph 
engelstad arena 
officials said the university doesnt plan to reject engelstads 
money and wont change the name of the hockey venue but school 
president thomas clifford said school officials would watch the 
controversy for any new developments and were keeping our 
options open 
engelstad a native of thief river falls minn has apologized 
for the two hitler parties which he held in 1986 and earlier this 
year 
in retrospect they were not only stupid but insensitive but 
at the time they were merely excuses for parties engelstad said 
adding that he threw parties often for his employees 
engelstads collection included a portrait of hitler signed 
to ralphie from adolf 1938 and a bumper sticker inscribed 
hitler was right 
engelstad has said the portrait was sent to him by a phoenix 
broker as a joke after he purchased a number of german vehicles 
engelstad did not authorize the bumper stickers and found them 
offensive he said

neither george bush nor michael dukakis came in contact with the 
voters on wednesday huddling instead with their handlers to go 
over lines for thursdays second and final presidential debate of 
the campaign 
bush buoyed by an abc newswashington post poll giving him a 
huge lead in electoral votes nationwide staged a brief 
madefortelevision event before disappearing into his debate 
preparation meetings he invited los angeles police chief daryl 
gates in for breakfast in a subtle continuation of his effort to 
make crime control a central theme of his candidacy 
the vice president told reporters he intended to show the 
country what my heartbeat is during his facetoface clash with 
dukakis and said he would continue depicting his rival as a 
liberal bush also attended the national league playoff game 
between the los angeles dodgers and new york mets after wrapping up 
his debate preparation for the day 
he shared a box with his wife barbara dodger owner peter 
omalley and campaign chairman james a baker iii 
democrat dukakis had baseball on his mind as well as he 
interrupted his debate homework to play catch with an aide while 
photographers recorded the scene referring to the first 
presidential debate and the one last week between running mates he 
said were ahead 20 were going to make it a clean sweep 
dukakis will need a clean sweep to overcome the kind of lead 
that bush has in the newest poll which surveyed 10000 likely 
voters from sept 21 through monday 
abc reported that bush led solidly in 21 states with a total of 
220 electoral votes just 50 short of the total needed to win 
dukakis was firmly ahead in only three states and the district of 
columbia with 30 electoral votes 
with the election nearly a month off voter sentiments can 
change but the abcpost poll the only public survey of its size 
this year was the first recent poll to indicate a significant 
advantage for either candidate 
the polls margins of error varied by state from five points to 
10 points the post said from 100 to 500 voters were interviewed in 
each state 
dukakis described his debate repertoire in baseball lingo as 
well saying he would use a fastball curve slider maybe a 
knuckler during his 90 minutes on stage 
workers in los angeles erected a debatenight set wooden 
lecterns red carpet and telegenic blue background that was 
trucked in from omaha where it was used in last weeks vice 
presidential debate the debate begins at 9 pm edt on the ucla 
campus in los angeles 
bush goes into the 90minute encounter with a modest lead in the 
public opinion polls although dukakis appears to have cut into the 
republican advantage since last weeks vice presidential debate 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle the subject 
of anonymous criticism from senior bush advisers since that debate 
said as he set out on his daily campaign rounds that if he finds 
out who was talking i think there will be staff changes 
quayle uttered a seeming declaration of independence after 
saying his campaign appearances had been so tightly scripted by 
bush advisers that he was told when he could wave as he got off his 
campaign plane 
thats all been thrown away he said i am my own handler 
and if you have any questions ask me he said he would take 
advice from bushs aides under consideration 
democrat lloyd bentsen had a ready retort for that idea that 
may be his pitch but ill bet its thrown george bush a real curve 
ball he said of his vice presidential rival the texas senator 
campaigned through missouri and arkansas where he said the 
republicans refuse to stand up for the american economy 
with election day still more than three weeks away there was 
fresh evidence that presidential politics is eternal 
one democratic official already was speculating that the iowa 
caucuses the leadoff contest in the last several campaigns might 
be moved back in the election calendar if the democrats lose the 
white house this year i think that the cry would be very loud 
for a different look at the nominating system said democratic 
vice chair lynn cutler a former iowan now living in washingon 
bushs breakfast with republican supporter gates came as the 
vice president worked hard to make crime a key issue in speeches 
throughout the country he has sharply criticized dukakis record 
on crime citing a massachusetts prison program under which a 
murderer escaped while on furlough and attacked a maryland couple 
some democratic strategists say the issue is particularly effective 
against dukakis in california the nations largest state 
bush said he believes he is in a stronger position politically 
than before the first residential debate on sept 25 and added that 
his goal for thursday night is to have the voters understand what 
my heartbeat is what i really care about 
as for dukakis walter f mondale the losing 1984 democratic 
presidential candidate said the 1988 nominee should loosen up in 
front of the television cameras mondale said in st paul minn 
that he knows dukakis as a very warm nice person but that that 
side of his personality hasnt come across on television 
bush had his no 1 surrogate campaigner at work with president 
reagan traveling in new jersey and pennsylvania 
in a speech to high school students in upper darby pa reagan 
touted the economic expansion since the recession early in his term 
of office and said in the last eight years weve worked to 
return americas values to all areas of american government

brown university and its food service 
plant operations and library workers reached a contract agreement 
on wednesday just hours before a midnight strike dedline 
after two days of negotiations the ivy league school agreed to 
pay full health insurance premiums for members of local 134 of the 
service employees international union 
we feel that we have a great victory here said karen 
mcaninch the unions business agentthe important thing is we 
got 100 percent blue cross coverage for the life of the agreement 
a threeyear contract for the 250 plant and food workers 
provided a 55 percent pay increase in the first year and a 5 
percent increase in the remaining two years the 90 library workers 
received a twoyear contract that gave them a 55 percent increase 
in the first year and a 5 percent raise in the second 
the contract was ratified by a show of hands by the plant and 
food workers and by a 5021 vote from the library workers mcaninch 
said 
the workers earlier this month authorized a strike for midnight 
wednesday when the contract covering plant and food workers 
expires the contract for the library workers expired on aug 19 
both sides gave substantially in the interest of harmony to 
get the matter resolved said robert reichley a university 
spokesman in the long run it may not be the best solution for 
both sides but at least it averted a strike 
on tuesday brown officials offered a higher wage increase but 
said they would pay only half the insurance premiums for the first 
year and 60 percent of following increases 
mcaninch said the principle of cost shifting was as important as 
the numbers 
they knew that we were serious about striking and that we felt 
very strongly about the issues she said we had a lot of 
support from brown university students

this central african nation kept a long 
official silence on aids but now is attacking the epidemic openly 
and plans to test 10000 people in its first survey of the deadly 
disease 
we know that it is a difficult problem but we are trying to 
do what we can do said dr ngaly bosenge leader of zaires 
national aids committee 
reporters visiting kinshasa in the past had to seek information 
from western health officials or private organizations involved in 
fighting aids 
ngaly whose business card shows a skull in the middle of a 
heart beneath the french abbreviation for aids now admits them to 
his office without demanding government authorization and even 
takes telephone queries from journalists in europe 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome for which no cure has been 
found is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
although homosexuals have been the main victims in developed 
countries the disease has spread among heterosexuals in africa 
this may be because of the unchecked spread of other sexually 
transmitted diseases which speed the transmission of aids because 
of contaminated syringes and blood supplies and because there are 
comparatively few homosexuals on the continent 
world health organization spokesman thomas netter said by 
telephone from the un agencys geneva headquarters that african 
countries have quickened their aids programs in the past 18 months 
its an acknowledgment that this is a problem and its no 
longer seen as some sort of a stigma he said i think people 
have gotten over that 
african nations were reporting five to 10 cases 18 months ago 
but now the total is about 19000 he said 
tanzania recently held an international aids conference and 
gabon did the same in june 
zaire and several other countries have begun aggressive 
education campaigns that use comic books popular music television 
and theater 
south africas daily newspaper for blacks the sowetan began a 
column on aids this week which warns that promiscuity facilitates 
transmission of the disease 
a who statement friday said reported aids cases worldwide rose 7 
percent to 119818 in september with updated figures from malawi 
tanzania and kenya accounting for most of the increase 
malawi listed 2586 cases more than four times the number in 
its last report oct 31 1987 tanzania reported 3055 cases 
nearly twice the total of oct 17 1988 and kenya reported 2732 
cases up onethird from a march 31 1988 report that also showed 
a big increase 
zaire has reported only 335 cases ngaly said his government 
knows the figure is many times that but we just didnt do a very 
good job we cant verify it yet 
ngaly said he was preparing a new total figure 
the government has been sensitive because of press reports 
describing zaire as the birthplace of aids and because of the 
reaction to reports of a survey that found 6 percent to 8 percent 
of the staff of a kinshasa hospital to be seropositive 
it was regarded as a national catastrophe ngaly said 
officials in uganda say their openess about aids has resulted 
wrongly in that east african country being labeled an aids 
epicenter dr sam okware head of ugandas aids control program 
said the number of cases doubles every six months 
ngaly said zaire is preparing its first general aids survey in 
cooperation with who and about 10000 people will be tested 
he said it probably will find a seropositive rate somewhere 
between the 6 percent to 8 percent at the hospital and the 3 
percent to 4 percent found in tests at a kinshasa factory 
the surveys purpose is to evaluate the success of our aids 
education program ngaly said the most important thing is to 
check the rate of aids infection we are confident that people 
understand the need for change but it is a longterm effort 
perhaps we will be able to save some lives 
netter said the survey probably will come up with a lot of 
cases but added the most significant thing is that there is a 
program in place to find out what the extent of the problem is and 
how to go about doing something about it 
dennis chandler director of the us agency for international 
development in zaire said condom sales have gone from virtually 
zero to 100000 monthly in kinshasa and surveys indicate most 
residents know as much about aids as people in the united states 
reports indicate the disease may not be spreading to rural 
areas and in many villages the seropositive rate remains 
zero according to ngaly 
tests in kinshasa of pregnant women and blood donors also 
suggest the general incidence of aids infection is not rising but 
the infection rate among prostitutes has grown from 27 percent to 
40 percent

the university of mississippi suspended the 
sigma alpha epsilon fraternity tuesday after an extended period 
of disruptive behavior that included a member being charged with 
raping a sorority pledge 
and in orono maine the university of maine withdrew 
recognition of a sorority after a hazing inciden in which pledges 
allegedly were branded with a heated metal stamp 
the earliest the mississippi fraternity will be eligible to 
return to campus is jan 1 said gordon beasley university vice 
chancellor for student affairs 
last month the university banned all oncampus 
fraternitysorority parties when a freshman chi omega sorority 
pledge said she was raped after attending a mixer held by the 
fraternity and the sorority 
that party was held offcampus because the fraternity was 
already on social probation because of a rush infraction and was 
prohibited from having oncampus parties 
stover smith 18 of metairie la was freed late last month on 
50000 bond after being arrested on rape charges said oxford 
police chief billy white the woman told officers that she left the 
party and was driven to a field then beaten and raped white said 
university officials said the rape charge was not the only 
reason for the suspension of the fraternity but it was a 
contributing factor the unversity began an investigation into the 
fraternitys activities after the incident 
the suspension means removal of all fraternity members from the 
campus chapter and the placing of the chapter in the hands of an 
alumni committee beasley said 
the identities of the victims in the sept 25 incident in maine 
said to have occurred in a bangor cemetery were not disclosed 
officials said a preliminary investigation found that two pledges 
had suffered burns 
an associate dean william lucy said the burns had been 
characterized as minor 
hazing is prohibited by both state law and school policy

president francois mitterrand has reaffirmed that 
france will remain its own master on defense issues saying 
frances mission was not to assure the protection of any other 
west european country 
that task he said tuesday belonged to the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
mitterrand said however that a french president could realize 
frances vital interests were affected by events beyond its borders 
and for example come to the aid of its neighbor west germany in 
an emergency 
other points mitterrand made in a major policy speech to the 
institute of higher defense studies 
frances new mobile shortrange hades nuclear missiles should 
not become theatre or battlefield weapons but serve as a final 
warning to an enemy that a nuclear confrontation was starting 
france would continue to modernize its mainly submarinebased 
nuclear deterrent but would also update a missile complex in 
southern france 
france retains the capability of building a neutron bomb at any 
moment 
france will not join any negotiations on reducing strategic 
nuclear weapons until deep cuts were made in the arsenals of both 
superpowers 
france opposes deployment of weapons in space as envisaged in 
the reagan administrations strategic defense initiative 
france will keep its chemical weapons capability until an 
international ban on their manufacture and use is negotiated 
mitterrand said the main objective of french defense policy was 
to maintain our identity our independence which is why we 
have our own strategy of nuclear deterrence 
he said france was committed to achieving nuclear disarmament 
and hailed the ussoviet accord to ban intermediaterange nuclear 
weapons as one of the major events since the end of world war ii 
he said france will remain a reliable member of the western 
alliance without abandoning its autonomy of decision with 
regard to natos integrated military command structure 
gen charles de gaullle took france out of this structure in 
1966 
mitterrand said in the event of war france will be present 
from the first minute with all its forces including nuclear ones 
provided that this was within the framework of the alliance 
he remarked that europes common defensive capabilities could be 
strengthened in 1993 after the european economic community 
established a single market 
mitterrand warned any attack against frances landbased 
missiles would mean we were at war and the unleashing of our 
strategic weapons would be instantaneous 
the president said with regard to frances shortrange nuclear 
weapons such as the pluton or hades missiles that these weapons 
would be used only against military targets 
the hades to be deployed in eastern france by 1992 has a range 
of about 280 miles barely enough to reach targets in east germany 
or other warsaw pact countries 
newspaper reports last month denied by mitterrand aides said 
france was considering delaying or canceling the hades program

cheering children greeted moroccanborn 
david levy the no 2 man in the rightwing likud bloc during a 
campaign stop in this town where twothirds of the residents are 
jews of north african origin 
when shimon peres head of the leftofcenter labor party 
campaigned in ramles openair market last week he was jostled and 
booed likud supporters shouted traitor and peres go home 
the contrasting receptions underscore labors continuing 
difficulties in winning the support of the sephardim jews of 
middle eastern and north african origin they make up 55 percent of 
the 21 million israeli voters and will be crucial in determining 
the outcome of the nov 1 elections 
in 1984 70 percent of the sephardim voted for the likud and 
this time there is still a strong element of identification with 
the likud said a pollster for the laboraffiliated decima 
polling company speaking on condition of anonymity 
however labor pollsters said they expected a dip of about 5 
percent in sephardic support for likud providing an opening for 
labor to campaign aggressively among sephardic voters 
a key target group are young financially successful sephardim 
born in israel who make up about half of the 5 percent of the 
voters wavering between labor and likud said the decima pollster 
they might determine the election because polls show labor and 
likud running necktoneck 
sephardic voting power first became evident in 1977 when labor 
was ousted from the government after 29 years because sephardim 
voted for the likud in massive numbers 
the sephardic identification with likud has its roots in the 
1950s and 1960s when labor at the time dominated by westernborn 
ashkenazim often was arrogant toward the north african newcomers 
today most sephardim still feel greater affinity toward likud 
than labor but after 11 years of the likud government some 
supporters are becoming more critical 
i will vote for the likud again but its not what it used to 
be in the times of former likud prime minister menahem begin 
said yehuda cohen 36 a taxi driver in ramle where 70 percent of 
the votes traditionally go to likud 
labor was in the government for 30 years and became corrupt 
now the same thing is happening to the likud he added 
likud can no longer say the sephardim belong to us said 
his colleague eli zarfati a former likud voter who is now leaning 
toward labor 
political analyst daniel elazar warned that the likud might be 
overestimating its hold on sephardic voters 
the likud is convinced they have the sephardim in their back 
pocket i dont think they do said elazar head of the jerusalem 
center for public policy a think tank 
if the likud had been better at governing and had not been 
associated with inflation and the war in lebanon their position 
with the sephardim would have been unassailable he added 
labor officials say they are making inroads mainly because 
labor candidates for the 120member parliament includes 16 
sephardim 
in addition peres currently the foreign minister is making 
many campaign appearances in predominantly sephardic areas 
but levy who as deputy prime minister is the highestranking 
sephardi in the cabinet played down the importance of the ethnic 
vote 
forty years have passed time has come to do away with the 
labels of sephardim and ashkenazim and to relate to people as 
israeli citizens levy told the associated press 
during a tour of ramle on tuesday levy was greeted by more than 
100 school children many of them chanting the partys slogan 
only likud can 
likud spokeswoman odelia karmon denied labor claims that 
sephardic support for the likud was weakening but said likud 
leaders are not targeting thos voters in particular labor has to 
do that because of the past but we have nothing to apologize 
for she said

a man who told police he had 85 kilograms 
of cocaine in his car when they stopped him for a traffic violation 
testified tuesday he made 139000 dealing drugs while posing as a 
us soldier in panama 
jackie lee bigelow dismissed from the army in 1986 said he 
made six trips to panama in his old uniform between april 1987 and 
last may he testified he was paid 25000 for each of five times 
he flew back with duffle bags containing cocaine which he then 
took to apartments in new york city 
he said he also was paid 13000 for a cardboard box of cocaine 
he mailed to a girlfriend and also got another 1000 from a 
contact in panama 
bigelows testimony came in the first day of the us district 
court trial of four people accused in a smuggling ring that 
included the alleged drug mailings 
bigelow of doerun also was charged in the case but has pleaded 
guilty 
the case broke when bigelow 27 was stopped by police on may 28 
for failing to have a drivers license he told police he had 85 
kilograms of cocaine in his car 
on trial are oscar smith regina smith and julia thom of new 
york and gary king of doerun they are accused of smuggling up to 
600 pounds of cocaine into the united states through various means 
defense lawyers have said that bigelow has concocted his story 
to win a lighter sentence for himself but bigelow testified that 
king made two of the panama trips with him and that smith was on 
the receiving end of most of his visits to new york

a prosecution witness at the divorcefixing 
trial of former miss america bess myerson conceded tuesday that 
both sides in her boyfriends divorce case did favors for the 
presiding judges daughter 
miss myerson 64 the former city cultural affairs commissioner 
is accused of giving a city job to the daughter of former state 
supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 in exchange for the 
judges favorable rulings in the divorce of miss myersons lover 
carl andy capasso 43 
the defense succeeded in getting mrs gabels former law clerk 
howard leventhal to admit during cross examination that a lawyer 
for capassos wife once helped secure an apartment for mrs gabels 
daughter although he did not remember exactly when 
in earlier testimony leventhal said that miss myerson made 
numerous phone calls to the judges chambers while mrs gabel was 
deciding whether to cut capassos alimony payments to his estranged 
wife 
according to leventhal mrs gabel apparently did not tell 
lawyers in the capasso divorce trial about the myerson phone calls 
when she offered to excuse herself from the case after a newspaper 
article revealed that miss myerson had hired the judges daughter 
sukhreet 
miss myerson is accused of giving a 19000ayear city job to 
sukhreet gabel who was then 34 shortly after miss myerson became 
cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 in order to get the judge to 
reduce capassos temporary support payments 
mrs gabel also did not tell the lawyers that mrs capassos 
lawyer raoul felder helped sukhreet gabel obtain an apartment 
leventhal testified under questioning by the judges defense 
attorney michael feldberg 
felder is not accused of any wrongdoing 
in cross examining leventhal the defense sought to explain or 
defuse his apparently damaging testimony that mrs gabel deviated 
from her usual routine in handling the capasso case 
on sept 14 1983 mrs gabel cut capassos weekly temporary 
alimony and child support payments from 1850 to 680 a week her 
ruling came just a few weeks after sukhreet gabel got a job as miss 
myersons assistant

in a gesture cheered by environmentalists the 
operator of a connecticut power plant has agreed to chip in on a 
treegrowing project it says will indirectly offset its boilers 
addition to the greenhouse warming of the earth 
the company applied energy services said tuesday it will give 
2 million to an international effort to plant 52 million trees on 
385 square miles in guatemala 
the trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide to offset the 14 
million tons that the companys 180megawatt coalfired plant in 
uncasville conn will generate each year during its 40year life 
according to the companys calculations 
the arlington vabased company said that as an environmental 
rule of thumb two square miles of forest are needed for every 
megawatt of coalfired plant capacity 
environmentalists hailed the companys move saying it helped 
illustrate the international nature of the greenhouse effect a 
warming of the earth that scientists say appears to have begun due 
to increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals released into the 
air carbon dioxide is formed by fossil fuel combust ion 
the warming could mean an average temperature increase of 3 to 8 
degrees fahrenheit by the middle of the next century an increase 
in sea levels of a foot or more and widespread weather changes that 
could mean more frequent droughts in the center of north america 
scientists say 
worldwide some 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year are 
released into the atmosphere 
gus speth president of the world resources institute that 
helped organize the guatemala project called the applied energy 
action one of the most farsighted and socially responsible 
decisions that any company has ever made 
requiring plant operators to offset their emissions in some 
similar manner might be proposed someday in legislation he 
said 
michael oppenheimer atmospheric physicist with the 
environmental defense fund in new york said a colleague dan 
dudek had recently proposed payments from utilities to plant trees 
on land taken out of agricultural production in the united states 
other environmentalists were quick to praise the applied energy 
decision 
i like it said neil simpson executive vice president of 
the american forestry association which is planning a 
treeplanting campaign of its own it recognizes were in one 
world when youve got a connecticut company going to guatemala to 
plant trees 
roger sant chief executive officer of applied energy said he 
hoped the project would prove a useful mitigation strategy for 
all new coalfired electric generation capacity 
we dont yet know that this is going to work perfectly but 
if it does were looking to follow the same strategy at our other 
plants sant said 
applied energy is one of the new independent producers selling 
power under contract to utilities escaping tight state regulation 
for generally looser federal supervision the company operates 
three plants totaling 360 megawatts and has contracts to build 
1600 megawatts of generating capacity 
when the uncasville plant is completed it will sell power to 
connecticut light amp power co 
applied energys cash for the guatemala project will be matched 
by cash or services totaling 2 million from care 12 million 
from the government of guatemala 36 million from the agency for 
international development and 75 million from the peace corps 
care an international development organization based in new york 
will handle the companys contribution

the reagan administration is expressing strong 
support for the efforts of former cambodian leader norodom sihanouk 
to achieve national reconciliation in his homeland and says 
effective safeguards must be imposed to prevent a return to 
power by the khmer rouge 
sihanouk who was meeting today with secretary of state george 
p shultz said tuesday after a visit with president reagan he 
agrees that leaders of the khmer rouge must go into exile if 
possible as part of a postsettlement coalition government 
the khmer rouge are believed to have killed between 1 million 
and 2 million cambodians during their 3 years in power during the 
late 1970s they are one of three rebel groups fighting the 
vietnamesebacked government now in power in phnom penh 
the reagan administration is providing 5 million in nonlethal 
assistance to the two anticommunist rebel groups and is consulting 
with members of congress about the possibility of an increase 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan told 
sihanouk that he supported sihanouks efforts to establish a 
reconciliation government in cambodia 
he said our policy rests on two elements a complete 
vietnamese withdrawal and no return to power of the khmer rouge 
fitzwater said 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said china 
which has been a major backer of the khmer rouge recognizes that 
discredited leaders of that group such as pol pot cannot be 
permitted to play a role in a future cambodian government 
but she said the administration could not confirm a new york 
times report that china has offered political asylum to individual 
khmer rouge leaders 
there have been intensified diplomatic efforts to shape events 
in cambodia as vietnam has begun a drawdown of its troops in that 
country setting a 1990 deadline for a complete withdrawal 
sihanouk who was ousted as head of state in 1970 and heads a 
rebel faction active in cambodia met with undersecretary of state 
michael armacost after his visit to the white house 
aligning himself with the reagan administration sihanouk told 
reporters it is necessary to give the world some guarantee about 
the khmer rouge in the future 
mrs oakley said the discussion with sihanouk focused on ways to 
achieve a negotiated settlement that includes the complete 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops and effective safeguards against a 
khmer rouge return to power 
the khmer rouge is said to be the strongest of the three 
factions and a major international effort is under way to ensure 
that group does not play a dominant role in cambodias future 
political evolution 
particularly active in this effort have been the six members of 
the association of southeast asian nations asean thailand 
indonesia malaysia singapore the philippines and brunei 
one of the measures being discussed to limit the khmer rouge 
role is the establishment of an international peacekeeping force 
other measures under discussion include the disarming of all 
cambodian factions and removing leading khmer rouge figures from 
cambodia 
mrs oakley gave a strong endorsement of sihanouk calling him a 
leading symbol of cambodian nationalism for the past 40 years 
we believe that his role is central to a satisfactory 
settlement in cambodia and we welcome the opportunity of his visit 
to express our strong support for him she said

ancient alchemists who strived to convert 
base metals into gold have been outdone a modernday chemist is 
changing sewer gas into diamonds 
dr james e butler and his colleagues at the naval research 
laboratory wont likely be going into the fancy jewelry business 
he admits 
but they have found a way to produce some tiny industrialtype 
diamond crystals using one of the most widely available raw 
materials the methane from sewer gas 
in this case gas from washingtons blue plains waste water 
treatment plant which is adjacent to the research laboratory 
in addition other chemists working at the naval research 
laboratory have grown diamond crystals using an oxygenacetylene 
torch butler said 
i dont think well be able to grow gemstone size and quality 
diamonds in the near future butler cautioned 
but the tiny diamonds made in his process using chemical 
vapors to deposit crystals on a surface could have a variety of 
industrial applications from abrasives to protective coatings 
computer insulators and a host of other uses he said 
what butler and the other navy scientists are doing is 
developing methods of getting carbon to form diamond crystals 
their process requires heating chemical vapors at normal air 
pressure or less and then getting carbon from the vapor to 
crystalize on a surface at temperatures of about 900 degrees 
celsius 1440 degrees fahrenheit current industrial processes 
for making diamonds require much higher heat and pressure 
graphite the soft black material used in pencil leads is the 
normally stable form of carbon at room temperature butler 
explained 
but by heating carboncontaining gases like sewer gas or 
acetylene the harder form of carbon can be made to grow on a 
surface and if enough crystals form they combine into a thin 
diamond film butler added 
why use sewer gas 
sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient inexpensive 
source of methane butler said methane a combination of carbon 
and hydrogen is a primary constituent of sewer gas it is 
generally burned as waste 
researchers in other countries have performed some similar 
experiments butler said adding that such sources of carbon as 
vodka also have been used 
it will be years before the diamondmaking system could be 
developed on an industrial scale he said but when that happens 
plenty of raw material will be available 
and if burning of the waste gas is halted that also would reduce 
pollution and release of carbon dioxide a product of the burning 
which scientsts fear will add to the socalled greenhouse warming 
of the earth

another meeting is scheduled for this week in 
london to see if a new longterm ussoviet grain agreement can be 
worked out 
the meeting was announced tuesday by the white house as 
tentatively scheduled for thursday and friday but no other 
details were provided in the brief statement by alan f holmer 
deputy trade representative who leads us negotiators 
the previous 5year agreement expired on sept 30 despite 
months of negotiations and informal talks by us and soviet 
officials one possibility has been a simple extension of the old 
pact for a year while negotiators work out details of a new 
arrangement 
negotiators have been pressured by some us farm interests to 
insist on larger minimum levels of annual grain purchases by the 
soviet union 
meanwhile the soviets have been buying us grain in large 
quantities without a new agreement including an additional 250000 
metric tons announced tuesday by the agriculture department 
the sale brought total corn sold to the soviets and delivered in 
the 198889 corn marketing year that began on sept 1 to more than 
43 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 250000 tons of 
corn would be about 985 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 273 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 27 million 
according to the old agreement the annual purchases were 
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
prior to the round of sales announced since sept 1 the soviet 
union had purchased 905 million tons of wheat and 517 million 
tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the 
agreement plus 830000 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of 
soybean meal

leftovers are prime candidates for offtastes meats cured with 
nitrite such as bacon ham and lunch meats dont have such 
problems he said 
the warmedover flavor also is described by the food industry as 
cardboardy or painty the offtaste is caused when fat in 
the uncured meat breaks down as it is reheated 
vercellotti and a fellow chemist allen j st angelo are 
seeking a patent on additives made from chitin which he described 
as a surplus material from the shellfish industry chitin is 
most commonly found in the shells of lobsters crabs and other 
shellfish 
the warmedover flavor occurs when oxygen in the atmosphere 
breaks down fats in the meat the report said large amounts of 
iron present in meat speed up the oxidation 
but the chitin additives bind the iron so it cannot speed up the 
oxidation thus slowing down the development of the warmedover 
flavor 
chitin additives would have to be approved by the food and drug 
administration before being available to consumers 
basically they are a type of soluble dietary fiber that we 
think will be safe to use in foods vercellotti said weve 
only tested chitin additives on beef but we think they will work 
on other meats poultry and fish as well 
the laboratory studies show that the additives have no other 
effect on meat flavor he said were only talking about adding 
a few parts per million to the meat 
vercellotti said the compounds can be mixed into the meat 
rolled on to the meat surface or sprayed on as a liquid

the laborcost advantage that west european 
factory owners held over their american counterparts as recently as 
two years ago is shrinking according to a government report 
a bureau of labor statistics report tuesday said labor costs 
measured in dollar terms were higher in eight west european 
countries in 1987 than in the united states 
the average hourly cost in this country was 1344 last year in 
norway it was 1739 in switzerland 1714 in west germany 
1687 in the netherlands 1546 in sweden 1512 in belgium 
1502 in denmark 1456 and in finland 1352 
for the first time since 1980 the west european average was 
higher than that of america 
in 1986 the only european countries that paid more for their 
labor than the united states were switzerland norway and west 
germany 
the lower cost of us labor was due in large part to the drop 
in the value of the dollar compared with most other currencies 
the labor costs as measured by the bureau included employerpaid 
taxes such as social security payments as well as spending on 
private benefit plans and the actual money that employees find in 
their pay envelopes 
since labor costs often determine where a manufacturer will 
produce goods and what the price will be lower us labor costs 
help make american goods cheaper and more attractive on world 
markets 
the bureau survey measured labor costs in 26 countries around 
the globe the average for those countries was 76 percent of the 
us pay rate that was 10 percentage points higher than in 1986 
and 6 points above the previous peak in 1980 when the dollar was at 
a low point 
japan accounted for a good deal of the overall rise in labor 
costs in 1975 its labor cost was 305 an hour less than half the 
us rate in 1986 it was 947 in 1987 it was 1114 well above 
britains 896 close to canadas 1197 and 83 percent of the 
cost in the united states 
japan has been losing some of its own manufacturing to the 
tigers the rapidly industrializing countries of east asia 
where costs are still low though they have been rising even faster 
than in japan south korean factories still had to spend only 179 
an hour last year but that was a big jump from 35 cents in 1975 
labor costs in latin america are lower in brazil they were only 
149 an hour a drop from the 160 of 1986 in mexico they were 
157 less than half the 371 rate of 1981 when the mexican peso 
was worth a lot more than it is today

defense lawyers say oliver l north cannot be 
prosecuted for lying to congress because the former presidential 
aide was never warned that making misleading statements about 
covert operations was a crime 
citing false statements by government officials about other 
covert operations norths defense lawyers contended tuesday that 
irancontra prosecutors were bringing novel charges against their 
client 
the defense said that until norths indictment march 16 with 
three other irancontra defendants no executive branch official 
had ever been prosecuted based on unsworn statements to congress 
north did not receive a fair warning that an executive branch 
official or a member of his staff would be guilty of a crime if the 
truth were misstated in an unsworn communication to congress the 
defense said 
the defense filed a series of motions to dismiss various charges 
that north a former national security council aide misled house 
committees in 1985 and 1986 by denying involvement in efforts to 
arm the contras or raise money for the rebels fighting nicaraguas 
sandinista government 
the defense noted that none of the statements made by north were 
under oath including remarks he made during an informal 
offtherecord discussion with members of the house permanent 
select committee on intelligence in 1986 in the white house 
situation room 
the other statements were written responses to queries made by 
various house committees about reports of covert assistance to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
an indictment returned last march charges north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and retired air force maj gen richard v secord with conspiring 
to defraud the government by diverting usiran arms sale profits 
to the contras 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has ordered separate 
trials for each defendant north is set to be tried first but no 
date has been set for the trial 
norths lawyers noted there was no prosecution of secretary of 
state john foster dulles for falsely assuring lawmakers in 1958 
that the government was not intervening in indonesia even though 
the cia was supporting rebels fighting president sukarno 
likewise the defense said there were no prosecutions arising 
from false statements by the state department after a u2 spy plane 
was shot down over the soviet union in 1960 the defense noted 
there may be disagreement as to whether or to what extent it 
is proper for government officials to misstate or conceal the truth 
where a truthful statement would jeopardize intelligence gathering 
or covert operations or otherwise compromise national security 
norths lawyers said 
until this case however there was no notion that such a 
false or misleading statement could be criminal simply because the 
statement was made directly or indirectly to a member of 
congress the defense said 
the executive branch communicates with congress on a continual 
basis about countless matters relating to the business of 
government the defense said 
norths lawyers said the provision under which he was charged 
only applied to statements made in connection with congress 
administrative functions and could not have been intended to 
reach such communications 
if it were applicable it would allow prosecution of executive 
branch officials for misrepresenting their intentions or concealing 
material facts defense lawyers said

a demonstration that temporarily closed food 
and drug administration headquarters underscores the desperation of 
aids sufferers hoping for a chemical cure that so far has escaped 
researchers around the world 
the action tuesday at fdas headquarters building in nearby 
rockville md also highlighted a fundamental problem facing the 
agency charged by law with overseeing the safety and effectiveness 
of its drugs 
in essence the hundreds of demonstrators including more than 
100 arrested for blocking entrances to the building are asking 
the agency to recommend experimental aids treatments as soon as it 
determines they are no more dangerous than aids itself 
the agency says that to do that would eliminate a major reason 
for its existence to apply a scientific sorting process that tries 
to cull quackery from treatments proven safe and effective 
the key word is proven aids patients feel they dont have time 
to wait for proof 
i would rather take my chances with the side effects of an 
experimental drug said vito russo a new york city writer who 
says he was diagnosed with aids in 1985 the side effect of aids 
is death 
at the same time russo complained that officials in the reagan 
administration are using the highly vocal call for easier approval 
of aids drugs to bolster its general theme of less government 
regulation in this case of pharmaceutical companies 
russo said he and his fellow demonstrators do not want the fda 
to stop testing drugs they want the agency to test them faster 
ironically that argument was heard loudest from pharmaceutical 
companies until the issue of aids drugs attained such a high 
profile 
but such an argument coming from an individual suffering from an 
incurable illness casts the issue onto a moral and ethical plane 
and on tuesday into the streets 
there is an inherent ethical judgment in almost all fda 
decisions on new drugs whether the beneficial effect warrants 
potentially harmful side effects but the issue is seldom drawn 
sharply enough to provoke protests by the people most directly 
affected the patients 
with no easy answers in sight the private american foundation 
for aids research foundation publishes an aids experimental 
treatment directory that is updated quarterly 
the latest edition issued just over three weeks ago lists 97 
drugs and agents being investigated as possible treatments for aids 
and aidsrelated illnesses with the names and addresses of the 
researchers conducting trials on each 
the 128page book free to aids patients starts with the 
strong recommendation that any person considering experimental 
treatment obtain the guidance of a personal physician in making 
any and all decisions in this area 
in a note to those infected with hiv the aidscausing virus 
the booklet recommends reading established medical journals that 
report on aids research 
but do not be fooled into thinking you can be your own doctor 
after reading a selection of articles it cautions 
the booklets last advice says that while there is no such 
thing as the official guide to coping with serious illness 
there is something very real that is known as the will to live 
it cannot be found in a testtube or under a microscope every 
person must discover it for himself if you have it or can find it 
it can make a difference 
vito russo has been living with aids for more than three years 
longer than most who contract the disease he is determined to 
live and when all else is said and done whether their position is 
right or wrong that is why russo and hundreds of fellow 
demonstrators shut the doors of the fda for a few hours on a chilly 
october day

negotiators are trying to reach a compromise 
on sharply differing tax bills passed by the house and senate one 
containing a taxpayers bill of rights and the other offering 
relief for 20 million owners of mutual funds 
the senate bill which was approved tuesday night on an 871 
vote would cut selected taxes by an estimated 3 billion over 
three years and to avoid worsening the deficit boost other taxes 
by the same amount the house bill passed 38025 on aug 4 has a 
75 billion price tag 
far more provisions are identical in both bills both would 
correct hundreds of technical errors in the 1986 tax overhaul 
extend several expiring tax benefits relieve farmers from paying 
the federal diesel tax on fuel for offroad use and raise some 
taxes to pay for the benefits 
the tax bill and a comprehensive plan for fighting drug abuse 
are the only major pieces of legislation standing in the way of 
adjournment of the 100th congress as early as this weekend 
all of us realize the more revenue we have in this bill the 
less likely the president is to sign it said sen max baucus 
dmont manager of the senate tax measure thus the senate will 
try to hold down the cost and house negotiators will be pushing for 
senators to accept some new provisions 
sen bill bradley dnj cast the only vote against the senate 
bill a principal architect of the 1986 tax changes bradley has 
argued against undue tampering with the new system saying it 
should not be riddled with specialinterest provisions 
not voting on the 871 senate vote that passed the tax bill 
were sens lloyd bentsen dtexas david boren dokla lawton 
chiles dfla thad cochran rmiss daniel evans rwash phil 
gramm rtexas david karnes rneb frank lautenberg dnj 
richard lugar rind dan quayle rind malcolm wallop rwyo 
and pete wilson rcalif 
both the house and senate bills would extend several expiring 
tax benefits with the senate opting for a shorter extension in 
order to reduce the cost these include a credit for business 
research an exclusion for workers employerfinanced educational 
assistance and a tax break for lowincome firsttime home buyers 
the senate bill but not the house would set up a bill of 
rights for taxpayers who are the subject of collection or other 
enforcement efforts by the irs 
the agency would have to inform taxpayers fully of their rights 
at the time an action is launched and would be barred from 
promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect the 
10day notice required before the irs could seize property for 
overdue taxes would be extended to 30 days 
the house bill includes a permanent change for owners of 
mutualfund shares allowing them to deduct as a miscellaneous 
expense certain costs of operating the funds these expenses could 
be written off fully despite a 1986 change that permits 
miscellaneous deductions only to the extent they exceed 2 percent 
of adjusted gross income 
other senate provisions would

japan is opting to ship deadly plutonium for 
its nuclear reactors by sea rather than by air prompting 
complaints from some members of congress that the united states 
should have been consulted 
us and japanese officials disclosed the shipping plans on 
tuesday touching off the dispute 
two democratic lawmakers said congress was tricked out of its 
right to a reasonable period to review changes in the new 30year 
usjapan nuclear cooperation agreement 
the state department denied the assertion saying the new pact 
which went into effect last july allowed certain changes with 15 
days notice to congress 
the change provides for a temporary alternative of sea shipment 
until crashproof air shipment casks are developed state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley told reporters that congress 
was notified formally on sept 20 
japan has been purchasing spent uranium atomic fuel from the 
united states and sending it to europe for refining into plutonium 
before it reaches japan the united states seeks to retain control 
over usage because plutonium is highly radioactive and usable not 
only for fueling power reactors but also for nuclear weapons 
in authorizing ocean shipments to japan the latest arrangement 
requires that armed escorts be provided against potential terrorist 
seizure 
it defines the escort as a coast guard or maritime safety 
vessel or any other ship on government service that is authorized 
and fully capable of protecting the transport ship and cargo and 
deterring acts of sabotage said richard j stratford deputy 
assistant secretary of state for nuclear energy and technology 
he said the japanese were told they could request us escorts 
but that they would be supplied only if consistent with overall 
us security priorities the japanese then indicated they were 
considering providing the escort themselves he said 
recalling testimony a year ago that air was preferable to sea 
shipment rep howard wolpe dmich said the reagan 
administration is trying to sneak by a hurried congress a very 
dangerous change in policy the administration is playing 
hideandseek with disaster by not guaranteeing the adequate safety 
of sea shipments to japan 
he said the administration has signed off on a 30year 
approval for shipment of the most dangerous substance known to man 
and left congress only 15 days to respond 
sen john glenn dohio also complained saying that in 
addition to opening a threat of nuclear blackmail by terrorists 
sea shipment increases chances of contaminating drinking water with 
radioactivity 
another state department spokeswoman nancy beck quoted the 
defense department as saying air shipment was preferable but that 
sea shipment was acceptable under proper safeguards that hijacking 
a plutoniumcarrying ship was a task for a major naval power 
and that the pentagon was satisfied with the safeguards provided in 
the latest arrangement with japan

george bush held a 4943 lead over michael 
dukakis in a national survey of registered voters conducted by the 
gallup organization which also found equal numbers of respondents 
calling themselves republicans and democrats 
the organization polled 1007 registered voters friday through 
sunday because of a fourpoint margin of error the two 
presidential candidates were statistically tied 
other national polls also have found bush retaining a small 
numerical lead indicating that he is slightly ahead 
most other recent polls have been conducted among registered 
voters who are judged as likely to turn out gallup applying a 
relatively loose gauge of likely voters found bush leading by 
5241 in that group of 748 
gallup stressed the closer result in its analysis of the survey 
released tuesday saying it believed it was too soon to gauge 
likelihood of voting 
that bigger bush lead could stem from his greater support among 
better educated voters who generally are more likely to vote he 
was backed by 58 percent of collegeeducated respondents compared 
with 37 percent of those who have not finished high school 
also the gallup poll found about as many respondents calling 
themselves republicans as democrats a result matched in some but 
not all other polls in past years the democrats have held a clear 
edge 
as in other polls the democratic vice presidential nominee 
sen lloyd bentsen was seen as having decisively beaten his 
republican counterpart sen dan quayle in their debate last week 
just less than half rated quayle as qualified to serve as 
president if necessary but that was up from about a third before 
the debate seventysix percent called bentsen qualified up from 
68 percent 
gallup sought to ascertain the effect of doubts about quayle by 
isolating the respondents who saw no difference between bush and 
dukakis but did see a difference between quayle and bentsen they 
made up 9 percent of the total were mostly democratic and went for 
dukakis by a 21 margin

when lloyd bentsen picked up an ar15 assault 
rifle at a police practice range in eastern pennsylvania and 
brought the weapon to his shoulder he was aiming all the same for 
texas votes 
the democratic vice presidential candidates three shots tuesday 
hit just below the silhouette targets heart democrats in texas 
are hoping that on nov 8 he can hit an electoral bulls eye 
after weeks of taking a drubbing bentsens strong showing 
against dan quayle in their debate has sparked new optimism and a 
new offensive by the texas democrats 
it was viewed as a slam dunk in texas and theres obviously a 
lot of regional pride said joe oneill bentsens chief of 
staff the mentality of the political guys down in the state has 
changed dramatically over the past week 
oneill bentsens top campaign aide seems to spend as much 
time in touch with the senators texas organization as he does with 
the democratic campaigns boston headquarters 
after all winning texas 29 electoral votes third largest 
prize in the nation was the main reason bentsen was picked for 
the ballot by michael dukakis and hes turned what was expected to 
be a gop blowout into a horserace 
but so far the polls show hes not winning it 
published surveys put the democrats behind by five to 12 points 
tom cosgrove director of the dukakisbentsen texas campaign says 
the democrats postdebate polling showed the gap near the small 
end of that range while republicans privately say their data still 
show a doubledigit lead for george bush and strong antidukakis 
sentiment 
we feel good says reggie basher spokesman for bushs texas 
campaign not only are the polls in bushs favor he says but the 
republicans have a strong organization in the state that bush also 
calls home 
the task for bentsen clearly is to convince texans that dukakis 
would be good for their economy and trustworthy on gut issues such 
as crime and gun control issues the bush campaign has used to 
clobber the democrats 
after he picked up that rifle at the police academy in 
allentown pa bentsen spoke on how the democrats were tough on 
crime despite republican claims to the contrary 
the image of the vice presidential candidate so armed delivered 
the other message if dukakis is some kind of antigun nut as the 
the republicans make him out to be would he have a man on the 
ticket like bentsen who owns many firearms and uses them with 
expert flair 
the campaign is complementing its symbolism with an aggressive 
new advertising campaign in the state 
weve just begun to launch our attack when texas voters are 
paying attention said cosgrove a nontexan who refuses to 
accept criticism from state democrats including bentsen that the 
campaign didnt respond quickly enough to the gop onslaught 
were a patient campaign cosgrove said this week this is 
monday oct 10 not monday nov 7 he said this week 
on the heels of bentsens debate democrats in the past week 
have launched a new television and radio blitz while bush has 
attacked dukakis for a prison furlough program and favoring gun 
control the ads say bush has supported the same things 
a direct mail campaign lampoons bushs visits to flag factories 
it features flags of other nations that are doing well under a 
republican administration such as drugexporting countries the 
iranians who traded hostages for arms and japan with its trade 
dominance of the us 
bentsen has maintained his home state popularity despite being 
tied to dukakis who is more liberal than most texas politicians 
trying to rub some of that approval off on dukakis bentsen flew to 
lone star texas the day after his omaha debate for a joint rally 
with dukakis and hell be there this week to watch on television 
as dukakis debates bush 
and hell be back

fleming said the idea for shoes came easily but that keeping 
the shoes on a goose was another matter 
he modified the shoes putting foam rubber in the end for 
comfort and to keep them from turning around he also had to glue 
the bows to the shoe because andy kept untying the laces small 
holes in the bottom of each shoe allows water to drain so the 
leather wont freeze in winter 
he just loves em fleming said he doesnt try to kick 
them off any more he used to think he had mud on his feet and kept

congress is seeking a lastminute compromise 
as it tries a final time to agree on a package of sanctions against 
iraq for its alleged use of poison gas against kurds 
house and senate negotiators are considering a senatepassed tax 
bill which includes the antiiraq provision the bill is one of the 
final items on the congressional agenda before the legislators 
adjourn for the year 
the sanctions package was approved by the senate 870 as an 
amendment tuesday evening shortly before the entire bill was 
passed 871 
it was third time in two months the senate has voted on the 
issue following reports that the iraqi army used chemical arms in 
late august to put down kurdish rebels 
the world cannot stand by in the face of repeated use of 
poison gas by iraq said sen albert gore dtenn 
the measure less sweeping than the sanctions package adopted by 
the senate a month ago is similar to a plan already approved by 
the house 
the bill would ban the export to iraq of us munitions and some 
high technology items and require america to oppose loans to iraq 
by international financial institutions such as the world bank 
in addition president reagan would have to levy more sanctions 
by dec 31 unless iraq provides verifiable assurances that it wont 
against use chemical weapons those potential sanctions include 
denial of exportimport credits and downgrading diplomatic 
relations 
but the bill wouldnt restrict grain exports or halt iraqi 
attempts to get monetary credits to buy us agricultural products 
sen david pryor dark reflecting the worries of farm state 
legislators said the concern is that this not lead to an 
embargo on agricultural exports to iraq 
but sen john heinz rpa complained that the measure unfairly 
penalized us manufacturers 
theyre probably laughing at us in iraq right now heinz 
said declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to iraq 
of the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemical 
weapons as mustard gas and nerve gas

a 12yearold boy is the 11th israeli to

spread of the disease

campaign after the polio virus was found in sewage in at least a 
dozen israeli cities 
on tuesday the third day of the campaign the government began 
vaccinating about 1 million school children against the paralyzing 
disease 
since september there have been 11 confirmed cases of the 
disease and six suspected cases but health ministry officials 
insisted the outbreak has not become an epidemic 
we wouldnt be vaccinating the whole population if we didnt 
think the whole population could be at risk but this absolutely is 
not an epidemic said paul slater chief epidemologist for the 
health ministry 
he said the latest case the first confirmed since sept 12 was 
reported in the town of hadera about 30 miles north of tel aviv 
the outbreak began in hadera and most of the cases have been 
reported there 
doctors believe the boy contracted the disease from an infected 
person not from contaminated sewage slater said 
but avraham morag chairman of the ministrys committee on 
infectious diseases said sewage has contributed to the spread of 
the virus in some parts of the country 
the former head of israels sewage system avraham meir told 
israeli radio that the nations sewer system must be improved as 
soon as possible 
we have to tell the truth purification centers are not 
creating sterile surroundings meir said on the radio but im 
against scaring the public and saying like i heard a child say 
when i drink water i drink polio 
in tel aviv authorities closed two beaches amid fears that 
overflowing sewage could contaminate the water with the virus 
a spokesman said no trace of the polio virus had been found in 
the water but city officials decided to close the beaches as a 
precaution 
at vaccination centers across the country school children 
received drops of the sabin vaccine on their tongue in some areas 
nurses went to schools and administered the vaccines in classrooms 
ministry officials expect to finish vaccinating school children 
today and are now preparing doses of the vaccine for adults 
more than 3 million people under the age of 40 will be 
vaccinated in the next three weeks at a cost of about 25 million

colombias ministry of justice has 
canceled plans to use chemical spraying against marijuana and coca 
plants because of a peasant protest justice minister guillermo 
plazas acid said 
colombias national dangerous drugs board had planned to spray 
1760 acres of marijuana and coca plants with the herbicide 
glyphosphate in southwest colombia 
about 2000 peasants marched on the town of corinto took over 
the town and kidnapped a newspaper reporter and two television 
reporters last saturday 
the reporters all colombians were released after a government 
commission arrived in corinto 190 miles southwest of the capital 
of bogota to talk with the peasants 
the plants will be destroyed by hand without using chemical 
products the justice minister said at a news conference tuesday 
the minister said in a response to a reporters question that 
colombian drug traffickers apparently had organized the peasant 
protest 
a spokesman for the peasants said that the peasants grow 
marijuana and coca because drug traffickers loan them money for 
planting and buy the crops for cash 
government agencies will not loan money to peasants the 
spokesman javier franklin said in an interview published tuesday 
by colombias leading newspaper el tiempo of bogota 
the us drug enforcement administration has used glyphosphate 
against marijuana plants in the united states 
earlier this month dea director john lawn said that marijuana 
had been sprayed by the herbicide from the air for the first time 
in the united states

pope john paul ii concluded his final foreign trip 
of the year with an appeal to europe to reject a secular future and 
look to its common religious heritage to guide it into the 21st 
century 
john paul who completes a decade as pope this week devoted the 
fourday trip in northeastern france to spreading his vision of a 
unified europe and shoring up the wilting roman catholic church on 
the continent where it first flowered 
the pope got a sharp reminder of the divisions still plaguing 
european countries as he gave a speech tuesday to the european 
parliament his main address of the trip 
shortly after he began speaking to the packed chamber a 
militant northern ireland protestant leader the rev ian paisley 
leapt to his feet and shouted i renounce you i renounce you as 
the antichrist 
the pope paused and paisley an elected parliamentarian was 
dragged from the hall paisley has led opposition to the 1985 
angloirish agreement which gave the government of 
catholicdominated ireland a say in the running of mostly 
protestant northern ireland 
in addition to addressing the european parliament which plays a 
consultative role to the european economic community john paul 
addressed the 21member council of europe and its commission and 
court on human rights all located in strasbourg near the west 
german border 
the pontiff focused on europes future at a time of heated 
debate on the subject the planned integration of the 12 common 
market countries economies in 1992 has given rise to discussion of 
a closer political union 
british prime minister margaret thatcher drew criticism last 
month when she declared that a usstyle european unit would 
weaken individual cultures 
the popes statements sharply contrasted with thatchers 
position 
a common political structure far from endangering the 
identity of the people of the community will be better suited to 
guarantee more fairly the rights of all regions he told the 
european parliament 
john paul built on a theme of a europe extending from the 
atlantic to the urals in which political institutions are 
subordinate to a common culture based on such christian values 
as freedom of speech and conscience 
he paid particular attention to what he viewed as a secular 
assault on the continents christian identity 
it is my duty to stress vigorously that if the religious and 
christian substratum of this continent should someday be 
marginalized in its role of inspiring ethics and in its social 
efficacy it is not only all of the heritage of the european past 
that would be denied but a future worthy of european man he told 
parliament 
in visits to the cities of metz nancy and mulhouse the pope 
urged special attention to unemployment the breakdown of the 
family and other problems that have followed europes development 
into a wealthy hightech region 
he expressed distress at the dwindling practice of catholicism 
in europe especially france where most people are roman catholics 
but less than 20 percent regularly attend mass 
the pope drew large crowds in services at stadiums and 
cathedrals but few people seemed to line his routes through 
strasbourg and the misty countryside nearby more than 10000 
police guarded the popes routes in strasbourg many wearing dapper 
gray pierre cardin suits 
with this trip his last of the year the 68yearold pontiff 
has logged 40000 miles this year and delivered 136 speeches in 
france austria africa and latin america

ladislav adamec czechoslovakias 
new premier is a moderate with a managerial background and is 
expected to stand for cautious economic reform 
adamec will succeed lubomir strougal who was widely regarded as 
czechoslovakias chief advocate of farreaching changes in the 
sluggish economy but whose plans were watered down by party 
conservatives 
at 62 adamec a graduate of the communist party college and of 
pragues university of economics is considered too old to honor 
recent official promises to rejuvenate the communist party and 
government hierarchy 
his main drawback is that for 18 years as deputy premier he 
worked in the political shadow of premier josef korcak and 
strougal who stepped down monday 
in his younger years adamec had no chance to develop charisma 
and establish himself as an obvious choice for more senior 
positions in the government he replaced korcak in a reshuffle in 
march 1987 when he was also promoted to the partys ruling 
politburo 
adamec has long been known as a good orator who would pinpoint 
shortcomings in public but some critics say that he has lost some 
of the impetus as a reform advocate 
his main advantage appears to be that in the eyes of many czechs 
he is not associated with the oppression that occurred during the 
socalled crisis years of 196869 when thenparty chief 
alexander dubcek and his associates were purged in the wake of the 
sovietled invasion 
at that time he was still at the university of economics in 
prague while heading the industrial department of the communist 
partys central committee 
according to western analysts adamec who earlier had a 
reputation of a reformer appears to have adopted a more cautious 
line but continues to criticize poor economic performance 
adamec wants modernization of industry by raising the technical 
standard of plants and equipment 
in a speech to a central committee session last december adamec 
said if we do not modernize the traditional engineering and 
nonengineering industries the inherited technical creativity will 
gradually evaporate and that would cost us very dearly 
he also complained about requesting from the czech industry 
higher export performance without providing adequate funding for 
technical innovation and higher qualification of personnel 
adamec was born sept 10 1926 to a miners family in frenstat 
pod radhostem in north moravia 
in the 194555 period he worked in a rubber processing company 
ending as a deputy director he subsequently was employed by his 
hometowns electric company where he became director in 1960 
in 196062 he held local government jobs and in the 196369 
period he headed central committee departments in prague he became 
a member of the central committee in june 1966

japans finance minister was among leading 
political figures who bought unlisted stocks in a series of 
questionable equitities purchases the japan communist party has 
alleged 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa was among those who purchased 
shares of a real estate firm before they were offered publicly and 
later sold them for a huge profit communist party vice chariman 
koichi ueda said at a news conference tuesday 
the communist party said it obtained documents allegedly showing 
the purchases by miyazawa and senior private secretaries of other 
leading politicians including prime minister noboru takeshita and 
former premier yasuhiro nakasone 
political secretaries in japan are similar to western 
politicians chiefs of staff and are politicians closest aides 
takeshita nakasone and other political leaders have 
acknowledged their aides were involved in the purchases but have 
said they did not know about them at the time the communist 
partys allegations were the first against miyazawa 
miyazawa bought 10000 shares of the real estate firm 
recruitcosmos co for the equivalent of 195000 in september 
1986 a month before the shares were listed publicly 
ueda said miyazawa made a profit of at least 130000 since he 
bought the shares at 1950 each and they rose to more than 3250 
each when listed 
in western equities markets such transactions constitute insider 
trading or trading on privileged information and are illegal 
japan only has vague regulations concerning use of confidential 
information in transactions and companies are free to offer shares 
to whomever they wish at any price 
the government has moved to tighten japanese laws against 
insider trading but the action is not retroactive 
miyazawas secretary nobuyoshi nakatsu said by telephone that 
no comment from miyazawa would be available 
but kyodo news service said miyazawa told japanese reporters at 
a hastily called news conference that he allowed former secretary 
tsuneo hattori to use his name but as i repeated again and 
again i myself am not involved in any dealings i am rather a 
victim 
asked if the shares were bought under his or hattoris name 
miyazawa said he did not know hattori resigned last week saying 
he wanted to make way for younger people 
one of the documents obtained by the communist party widely 
reproduced in newspapers and on television shows the names of nine 
reputed share purchasers including miyazawa and the aides to 
takeshita and nakasone 
do best inc a stock trading firm acquired 80000 shares of 
recruitcosmos and turned them over to the nine for 1950 a share 
a month before the shares went on sale according to the document 
another communist party official who would not be identified 
said the party received the documents anonymously but determined 
they were genuine 
the charges against miyazawa apparently had little effect on the 
tokyo stock market which a dealer said was slowed more by the 
sharp fall of the dollar against the yen 
the socalled recruit scandal unfolded in july as a bribery case 
in kawasaki a city south of tokyo but spread to encompass some of 
the countrys most powerful politicians or their aides as well as 
senior journalists and at least one professor 
experts say the practice of selling stocks at low prices to 
politicians has been common with companies making political 
contributions in this way

brazil has rejected a possible january 
visit by cubas president fidel castro to inaugurate a latin 
american cultural center 
it would have been the first since the two countries 
reestablished diplomatic relations in 1986 after a 22 year break 
according to rio de janeiros respected daily jornal do brasil 
newspaper sao paulo governor orestes quercia invited castro to 
attend the inauguration of the new latin american center being 
built in south americas largest city when he visited cuba in 
december 
the newspaper said the foreign ministry told quercia a visit 
from castro would not be appropriate 
no official invitation was issued to castro by the brazilian 
government the invitation was a personal one foreign ministry 
spokesman ruy nogueira told journalists at a late news conference 
and it is improbable implausable and unrealistic that the head 
of a foreign country would visit another without an official 
inviation from that country 
jornal do brasil quoted highlevel government sources as saying 
that despite brazils now solid diplomatic relations with cuba 
sectors of the military might interpret an excess of hommage paid 
to castro as a provocation 
brazil severed diplomatic relations with cuba in 1964 shortly 
after a rightwing military coup toppled former president joao 
goulart president jose sarney who led brazil back to civilian 
rule in 1985 after being chosen in a militarycontrolled electoral 
college vote reestablished relations with cuba one year later 
the military still wields substantial behindthescenes power in 
brazil

once again theres talk of high stakes as 
michael dukakis and george bush get ready for their second and last 
debate of the 1988 presidential campaign 
maybe this will be the breakthrough debate the occasion when 
one or the other will so impress voters with his eloquence or 
ineptitude that the election will be decided then and there 
more likely it will be an october rerun of their september 
debate 
a few new lines have appeared in the campaign weeks following 
that debate 
look for dukakis to hold up a 20 bill and deride bushs 
proposal for a 1000ayear tax deferred savings account thursday 
night 
twenty bucks he tells roaring partisan audiences twenty 
bucks that he says is the annual tax savings americans would 
realize from the bush plan 
crime has been a major stump theme for bush in recent days with 
renewed attacks on the massachusetts prison furlough program 
what might voters remember of their first confrontation the 
debate that dukakis likes to refer to as some of the best 90 
minutes of this whole campaign 
they might recall bushs stirring defense of his running mate 
indiana sen dan quayle 
he took a tremendous pounding said the vice president and 
everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding 
bush said quayle would do very very well and he has my full 
confidence and hell have the confidence of people in their 30s and 
40s 
the republican nominee predicted his running mate would do 
very well when we get into the debates 
quayle has since had his debate with democratic vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen the indiana senator came across 
as overly programmed and the polls showed that he fell short of 
bushs expectations 
will bush rise to the defense of quayle again that should be 
one moment to watch for on thursday night 
that first presidential debate also was the night that dukakis 
gave a passionless response to a question about his lack of 
passion about the characterization that he is the smartest clerk 
in the world 
i care deeply about people said dukakis he said it again 
and again 
i am somebody who believes deeply i care very deeply 
these are things i believe in very very deeply 
he conceded that i may be a little calmer than some about it 
dukakis did show a passion for certain words he used lead 
leader and leadership 18 times during the debate he also 
was partial toward values and strength 
when the massachusetts governor was asked about his lack of 
foreign policy experience he gave this reply 
the question is values the question is strength the question 
is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be 
provided im ready to provide that leadership i want to be the 
commanderinchief of this country i think it takes fresh 
leadership now and an understanding of those forces of change to 
provide the kind of strength that we need i dont think its 
just experience that makes a difference its strength its 
values 
twelve times dukakis referred to values bush wasnt far 
behind using the word 11 times six times in his first response 
liberal and liberals were bush favorites he used one or 
the other eight times 
he also used several other terms which mean the same thing like 
aclu freeze people a reference to supporters of a nuclear 
freeze and such geographic symbols of liberalism as 
massachusetts and with something of a sneer boston and 
bostonians

the shooting death of an australian 
yachtsman by indonesian police has caused a major diplomatic row 
between the two countries with prime minister bob hawke rejecting 
indonesian explanations 
the indonesian government called the aug 14 killing of david 
blenkinsop an accident but hawke on tuesday demanded a full 
inquiry into the dastardly event 
we are not going to have a situation where australian 
nationals can be pushed around in this case killed and just sit 
quietly back hawke said we will pursue this matter to see 
that it is properly investigated 
the indonesian embassy in canberra said police boarded the 
couples yacht and blenkinsop and his pregnant britishborn 
fiancee joanne mist were shot accidentally during a struggle the 
embassy said the yachtsman drowned after falling overboard 
ms mist says blenkinsop was shot twice and thrown overboard 
her baby was not injured 
certainly the late mr blenkinsops fiancee has a quite 
different story and i must say that im not prepared to accept at 
face value some story on the part of indonesian authorities about 
an accident hawke said 
blenkinsops parents said they spent 6400 to search for their 
sons body frustrated at the lack of information they finally 
wrote to hawke 
thaufick salim spokesman for the indonesian embassy said 
blenkinsop and his fiancee entered indonesian waters during a 
voyage from thailand to australia two months ago to seek shelter

mathematicians working with hundreds of 
computers on three continents have successfully split a recordlong 
100digit number into two prime factors according to a report 
published today 
the final numerical sequence required for the solution flashed 
into a laboratory in palo alto calif at 203 am pdt tuesday 
marking a development that will probably force cryptographers to 
rethink how some codes used by governments and banks are applied in 
the future said the new york times 
the 100digit number was chosen by an elaborate mathematical 
screening process to afford the maximum possible difficulty the 
times said the two factors found are 41 digits and 60 digits 
respectively 
a numbers factors are smaller numbers that when multiplied by 
each other produce the larger number a prime number is one that is 
evenly divisible only by one or by itself 
the project was organized by mark s manasse of the digital 
equipment corps systems research center in palo alto and arjen 
k lenstra of the university of chicago they were helped by 12 
users of about 400 computers in the united states the netherlands 
and australia who donated computer time when not needed for their 
regular work 
factoring the 100digit number took less than a month in 
theory one expert said a supercomputer like the cray operating 
continuously could have solved the problem in about a week but 
supercomputers cost thousands of dollars an hour to run and 
operating the range of simpler computers for short periods when 
they were idle kept the cost down to virtually nothing the times 
said 
there has been rapid progress in the factoring field this year 
with the same group establishing a record with a 96digit number 
just three weeks ago according to lenstra the record has been 
broken about once a year this decade manasse predicted a 106digit 
number will have been factored by the end of the winter 
here is the problem they solved

the chairman of a house panel that oversees 
the equal employment opportunity commission says a new report shows 
the agency was more concerned with reducing paperwork than with 
protecting claimants civil rights 
the general accounting office released a report tuesday that 
said the eeoc did not fully investigate up to 82 percent of job 
discrimination claims over a threemonth period last year 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif who ordered the study as

further evidence of the agencys attack on civil rights 
protections

of the charges closed by six eeoc district offices during the 
period and 40 to 87 percent of charges closed by five state

after enduring weeks of attack on hotbutton 
issues such as crime and the flag the slowtoanger democratic 
presidential nominee responded with the emotion his backers longed 
for this campaign but not before michael dukakis own mother did 
first 
can anyone get as low as this 85yearold euterpe dukakis 
asked after recounting what she regarded as personal attacks by 
george bush and the republicans 
i am telling these truths because my son refuses to she 
said 
appearing together in maine last weekend both dukakises 
demonstrated dismay at a republican campaign focusing on a handful 
of issues 
bush has been blamed for trivializing the 1988 presidential 
campaign he has devoted weeks to attacking the governor of 
massachusetts over his veto of a bill requiring the pledge of 
allegiance in schools over a program allowing weekend furloughs 
for inmates including convicted murders for membership in the 
american civil liberties union and for moving slowly on pollution 
in his own back yard 
and he has had help too 
president reagans reference to dukakis as an invalid was 
quickly retracted but the fact that he uttered it thrust onto 
front pages the washington rumors that dukakis had hidden past 
mental trouble the rumors were false by all evidence but the 
episode coincided with the beginning of dukakiss slide in the 
polls 
republican sen steve symms of idaho asserted that an old photo 
existed of dukakiss wife burning an american flag in protest over 
the vietnam war kitty dukakis denies it no photo ever emerged 
but subtle damage may have been done 
dukakis has begun responding with his own negative assaults on 
television commercials and in speeches he belittles bushs running 
mate dan quayle he accuses bush of plotting a raid on social 
security and he depicts bush as lacking judgment 
all of this is part of what frequently is lamented as the 
negative nature of the 1988 presidential race 
minor issues or outright distortions are screamed while hardly 
a whisper is heard about the national debt piling up by the 
billions relations with the soviets the aids plague or the 
hostages still in lebanon 
it is true its a very negative campaign and i say most of 
the blame lies with bush said william schneider political 
observer at the american enterprise institute a conservative think 
tank 
i say his campaign is probably the most disgraceful in modern 
american history schneider adds it is also working it is 
both disgraceful and effective 
the only real surprise though is that this type of campaign 
comes as much of a surprise to anyone 
for one thing look what happened to the two candidates who did 
talk about the deficit democrat bruce babbitt and republican bob 
dole like walter mondale four years earlier found voters didnt 
want to hear it 
and the negative campaign is hardly a 1988 phenomenon 
it is more negative at an earlier stage than any presidential 
campaign ive seen said frank greer a democratic consultant who 
has been advising dukakis on his debates but it follows the 
pattern of senate and gubernatorial races the 1980s have seen a 
real escalation in the use of negative advertising 
in fact democrats have become accustomed over the past eight 
years to facing intensely negative campaigns centered on one or two 
or three emotional issues in statewide races 
ncpac the national conservative political action committee ran 
a series of campaigns in which they targeted democratic incumbents 
with intensive negative television commercials on a few emotional 
issues in 1984 sen jesse helms of north carolina ran negative tv 
ads about his opponent for more than a year 
democrats have learned to deal with such campaigns by responding 
forcefully 
dukakiss running mate vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
faced a ncpac campaign in texas in 1982 when he was seeking 
reelection he fired back and won easily 
on his campaign plane last weekend bentsen expressed relief 
that dukakis at last had begun to respond with their own tough ads 
where have they been he said holding out his arms in an 
expression of frustration at the delay 
bentsen said the dukakis campaign should have responded 
immediately when after the democratic convention in july the 
republicans began attacks on dukakiss record and even his 
patriotism 
some say dukakis and his advisers are to blame for failing to 
forsee the attacks failing to recognize the visceral impact some 
were having and failing to respond before the damage was done 
dukakis after all has never before run against a serious 
conservative republican campaign 
one reason why he frittered away 17 points was because he 
didnt respond and didnt go hard negative himself said larry 
sabato political scientist at the university of virginia 
you have to fight fire with fire you cant sit there and take 
it and you cant just occasionally respond and be defensive you 
have to give your response immediately in tough terms and then go 
on the attack yourself thats modern politics in a nutshell 
sabato says the negative campaign shouldnt be a surprise when 
viewed in a historical context too in 1964 for instance barry 
goldwater was depicted as representing the threat of nuclear war 
a pretty negative notion 
the reason campaigns have grown increasingly negative is that 
such attacks work 
the issues the bush campaign selected seemed to resonate with 
voters as symbols of something larger and unsettling 
bushs aim was to raise doubts about dukakis and depict him as a 
massachusetts liberal he apparently has succeeded 
in early august dukakis said bush has some of the highest 
negatives ever recorded in the history of american politics he 
was referring to unfavorable ratings in polls 
two months later it is dukakis who has the high negatives 
polls show his unfavorable rating now tops 40 percent exceeding 
that of both bush and quayle

he sang happy birthday doffed his 
suitcoat in favor of a football jacket and to the astonishment of 
aides kissed the two cheerleaders who presented the gift 
michael dukakis was delivering what advisers hope he can deliver 
again thursday night in his final debate with george bush a 
genuine show of emotion something dukakis rarely allows himself on 
the campaign trail 
the democratic presidential nominee arrived here late tuesday 
night and was staying in the los angeles area until the showdown 
with bush 
one of the nice things about debates is that they get people 
out from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and it 
gets them to address the issues dukakis told a crowd of about 
350 people at the airport here 
the massachusetts governor had no public events scheduled today 
but was holding meetings with about 20 aides and advisers on the 
debate the confrontation could prove crucial to dukakis attempts 
to overcome bush who holds a slight lead in most polls but is 
believed to have a larger edge in electoral college votes 
dukakis aides speaking to reporters on the flight from boston 
said they believed voters were still not familiar with dukakis and 
that one of his major debate challenges would be to convince voters 
he cares more about their concerns than bush 
those aides were thrilled by what they saw in fargo nd where 
dukakis held an airport rally while his plane was refueled tuesday 
night 
about 800 people who braved 45degree temperatures to attend the 
latenight rally appeared happy with dukakis performance as well 
he had just finished greeting the state and local officials on 
hand when he introduced ted mondale a midwest coordinator for 
dukakis and the son of the 1984 democratic nominee walter mondale 
dukakis told the crowd ted mondale celebrates his 31st birthday 
today 
then came the unexpected dukakis led the crowd in singing 
happy birthday with even mondale looking on in apparent 
surprise 
an upbeat dukakis delivered his standard stump speech to the 
crowd and told them victory is out there if they work hard for 
a democratic victory 
he also took his staple swipe at republican vice presidential 
nominee dan quayle 
dukakis mentioned his choice texas sen lloyd bentsen and 
referred to him as the best qualified person for the job 
i wonder if the republicans can say the same dukakis 
sporting a broad grin asked rhetorically 
at the end of the rally two cheerleaders from north dakota 
state university the no 1 ranked team in ncaa division ii 
football presented dukakis with a bright yellow bisons jacket 
which he quickly donned before thanking the cheerleaders with a 
kiss on the cheek he sported the jacket on the flight from fargo 
to los angeles as well 
dukakis predebate coaching has been rich with suggestions that 
dukakis make an emotional connection with voters 
i think its very important that the american people know his 
values know what he cares about john sasso the campaigns vice 
chairman said during the flight west the question is where are 
you going to lead us 
california rep tony coehlo who traveled with the dukakis 
entourage said many voters would consider dukakis a blind date 
because they do not know enough about him 
the american people dont want to elect george bush coehlo 
said they think hes ok but they dont want to elect him they 
want another option and just need to get to know mike dukakis to 
have it 
dukakis aides also make no secret of the fact that quayle will 
be a dukakis debate target 
its obvious that a lot of people are frightened sasso 
said this is a guy who is a heartbeat away from the presidency 
it scares people 
at the same time though dukakis will try to frame the quayle 
selection in the larger context of bushs judgment and also try to 
contrast the proposals on health care college opportunity 
housing trade and education in recent weeks with what the dukakis 
camp terms as a bush campaign of symbols and slogans that lacks 
substance 
they dont like where the dialogue is going and they want to 
get it back on who knows what the pledge of allegiance sasso 
said this is not a ping pong match of one liners

iraq and iran exchanged soldiers remains 
for the first time since their ceasefire took effect seven weeks 
ago a senior un official said 
but an iraqi governmentrun newspaper said there was no progress 
in unmediated talks toward a permanent peace settlement 
un assistant secretarygeneral marrack goulding told a news 
conference in the iraqi capital that each side on tuesday handed 
over the bodies of eight soldiers killed during the eightyear war 
he said the exchange took place in the war fronts southern 
sector but gave no further details 
goulding visiting iraq and iran for talks on consolidating the 
ceasefire said the exchange was a sad and moving event but it 
showed that through the united nations there can be cooperation 
between the two sides 
goulding was scheduled to leave today for tehran for talks with 
iranian officials and a visit to the iranian side of the front 
un peacekeeping troops are posted along the iraqiran border 
to monitor the ceasefire that went into effect aug 20 peace 
talks started aug 25 but are bogged down over iraqs demand for 
free navigation in the persian gulf and clearing the shaat alarab 
waterway 
goulding said the ceasefire was holding although both sides 
reported minor violations and two or three soldiers were 
killed he gave no details of how the deaths occurred 
the un official also said some soldiers had been taken 
prisoner since the ceasefire but he did not say whether they were 
iranian or iraqi and noted a number of them had been freed 
iran last month released 72 disabled iraqis but iraq has not 
yet freed any prisoners of war and is known to have taken more than 
700 iranians pows in september in what tehran called a major 
ceasefire violation 
according to the red cross a total of 50182 prisoners of war 
are held by iran and 19284 by iraq but un officials and 
diplomats in baghdad and tehran believe iran holds 6000070000 
prisoners and iraq 3000050000 
an iraqi governmentrun newspaper said tuesday there has been no 
progress in the iraniraq peace talks since they started over six 
weeks ago 
the front page editorial in aljoumhouriya was the first comment 
by iraqs official media on the statement saturday by iranian 
foreign minister ali akhbar velayati who said the two sides agreed 
in principle to un proposals to end the war 
the daily said iran has not committed itself to respecting free 
navigation in the persian gulf and clearing the shaat alarab 
waterway the estuary of the tigris and euphrates rivers and iraqs 
main outlet to the sea it said there was no breakthrough in 
negotiations and accused iran of continuing delaying tactics and 
procrastination 
velayati said iran agreed to a un proposal that it give up its 
right to search ships in the strait of hormuz the strategic mouth 
of the gulf 
he did not mention iraqs demand to clear the shatt alarab 
before letting the talks progress 
the talks have moved from geneva to new york and are expected to 
return to geneva at the end of the month

china may be willing to grant sanctuary to 
pol pot leader of the feared khmer rouge guerrilla group to clear 
the way for a settlement of the war in cambodia diplomats say 
the communist khmer rouge blamed for mass executions and forced 
relocations during nearly four years of brutal rule in cambodia 
were overthrown by the vietnamese in 1978 
but the khmer rouges continued presence as a potent guerrilla 
force has been viewed as an obstacle to negotiating the withdrawal 
of vietnamese troops 
china supported the khmer rouge when it ruled cambodia but has 
been distancing itself from the group diplomats have said that pol 
pots exile to china may accelerate a settlement in the conflict 
china has not ruled out such a development 
the chinese government would take any alien as a refugee to 
china if the whole affair conforms with chinese law chinas un 
mission spokesman yuan shibing said tuesday 
vietnam has said it would withdraw its troops from cambodia by 
1990 and has been negotiating with the threemember cambodian 
resistance which includes the khmer rouge 
diplomats say chinas acceptance of pol pot could help pave the 
way for a settlement 
this offer is what china intends to do if it is necessary that 
pol pot and his close collegues should be given exile somehwere 
outside of kampuchea cambodia said one asian diplomat familiar 
with negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity 
china he said still insists that vietnam withdraw its troops 
as a first step in any settlement the diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity described a possible offer of exile as 
the bottom line but not something that china immediately would 
offer 
in washington meanwhile cambodian prince norodom sihanouk 
leader of one of the factions fighting the vietnamese occupation 
said tuesday i think it is necessary to give the world some 
guarantee about the khmer rouge in the future 
i think the ones who are responsible for the genocide of the 
cambodian people in the 1970s must not continue to lead the 
khmer rouge movement and they must go into exile if possible he 
said after a meeting with president reagan 
reagan spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president reiterated 
us policy favoring a complete withdrawal of vietnamese troops and 
opposing a return to power of the khmer rouge 
in a sign of beijings distancing itself from pol pot chinese 
foreign minister qian qichen recently told the general assembly 
that the armies of the cambodian factions should be dissolved and 
replaced with a new national army equally representing all 
factions 
pol pots regime has been blamed for killing an estimated 1 
million people 
chinese officials were expected to meet this week with 
ambassadors of the association of southeast asian nations to 
discuss the cambodian problem 
the khmer rouge is the strongest of three factions fighting 
vietnams occupying forces in cambodia besides the noncommunist 
forces of sihanouk the resistance includes the forces of son sann 
a westernleaning politician

the nations defense minister says 
latin americas foreign debt is a bigger security risk than its 
drug trade insurgencies or border conflicts 
behind the drug trafficking and behind the subversion is the 
incommensurable weight of the foreign debt which erodes and 
asphyxiates our economies said gen italo del valle alliegro 
it is not just an economic problem but a political and social 
problem that can create strong centers of disturbance for our 
systems del valle alliegro said in an interview with the 
associated press this week 
latin american countries are struggling to pay foreign debts 
totaling over 400 billion venezuela which owes at least 34 
billion is the regions fourthlargest debtor 
del valle named defense minister in july said venezuelas 
armed forces are committed to defending a 30yearold democratic 
system 
we have a solid and mature democracy and our armed forces are 
convinced of their role of supporting the nations civil 
institutions he said 
he said venezuela never adopted the doctrine of national 
security which led to military takeovers throughout latin america 
because it felt the theory was authoritarian and 
antidemocratic 
the theory which broadened the scope of national defense to 
allow the military a legitimate political role in keeping out 
communism originated in the us war college and was further 
expanded by the brazilian armed forces 
it is credited with having opened the way for military ousters 
of civilian rulers in argentina bolivia brazil uruguay chile 
and other countries in the 1960s and early 1970s 
he said a document backed last year by military leaders 
throughout latin america including venezuela did not constitute a 
joint defense pact 
the document identified the international communist movement as 
the common and principal threat to the americas it was issued 
by 14 latin american nations and the us during the 17th 
conference of american armed forces which took place at mar del 
plata argentina in november 1987 
it was one working paper among many others there is no 
anticommunist pact he said

president mikhail s gorbachev reiterated his 
concern over western european plans for economic integration 
saying they could work against cooperation with the east tass 
reported 
in a kremlin meeting with austrian chancellor franz vranitzky 
the 57yearold soviet leader said tuesday that europeans have been 
striving for economic internationalization and political 
independence 
but on the other hand what awaits the alleuropean process if 
the western part of europe cruelly closes itself off in a new 
formation gorbachev asked in excerpts reported by tass the 
official news agency 
how then would a european home be built he said 
referring to a concept that calls on east and west europeans to 
cooperate politically and economically 
it was the second time gorbachev has expressed concern to a high 
western european official over plans by the 12member european 
economic community to create a single market in 1992 by 
eliminating borders and unifying customs regulations austria is 
not an eec member 
in a july 30 kremlin meeting with west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher gorbachev said european politicians would 
have to bear responsibility for any damage the proposal would have 
on positive beginnings toward disarmament and strengthening 
security 
gorbachev apparently shares the same fears expressed by other 
world leaders that the 1992 economic unification of europe will 
shut out trade with nations that are not members of the eec 
he also may fear that the eec will pose a more formidable 
competitor to moscow in selling its goods on the world market 
vranitzky arrived in moscow on monday and is scheduled to leave 
thursday

president pw botha of south africa 
says an agreement in principle has been reached on the withdrawal 
of 50000 cuban troops from angola but that the timetable still 
needs to be worked out 
botha speaking at a press conference tuesday dismissed press 
reports that south africa cuba and angola had agreed during 
weekend a meeting in new york on a timetable for a troop withdrawal 
the principle has been accepted but the timetable needs to be 
worked out he said 
south africa has scheduled for nov 1 the start of an 
independence plan for neighboring southwest africa known as 
namibia but it has linked namibian independence to a cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola 
botha warned that the nov 1 deadline for beginning the un 
independence plan for namibia may not be met 
south africa wants to see southwest africa to be 
independent he said but he said if other forces who are 
taking part are not prepared to start with the necessary 
machinery on the first of november that is not south africas 
fault he did not elaborate 
the parties involved in the talks are to meet later this month 
in brazzaville congo 
in new york cubas deputy foreign minister ricardo alarcon de 
quesada and angolas ambassador to the un manuel pedro 
pacavira also said tuesday that negotiators reached no agreement 
in talks held friday through sunday 
they spoke at a news conference in response to published reports 
saying the talks reached agreement on a 24 to 30month pullout by 
the cubans 
we are at an impasse which is not precisely synonymous with 
agreement said alarcon 
as you can see in the newspapers reports almost daily we 
havent yet achieved an agreement or understanding on the calendar 
for the withdrawal of the cuban forces in angola he said 
alarcon said cuba and angola need 30 months to train and equip 
angolan forces to deal with any future raids by south africa or by 
the angolan rebels that are backed by the united states and south 
africa 
the united states serving as mediator in the talks has 
suggested a 24month withdrawal and south africa agrees said 
alarcon and pacavira 
pacavira said the conflicting proposals were advanced a month 
ago in a meeting in brazzaville 
south africa in the past has launched periodic raids from 
namibia into southern angola to back up rebel forces when they 
encountered heavy resistance from cuban forces 
under a preliminary agreement in the peace talks all south 
african forces left southern angola by sept 1

violations of law that allegedly have been committed but was 
confident the outcome will be satisfactory 
us district judge george c carr on tuesday lifted a federal

mora controlled a laundering network in medellin colombia home of 
the medellin cartel to service traffickers john doe also known as 
don chepe in that city and roberto baezalcaino in los 
angeles the indictment said 
undercover agents received the money from various defendants and 
laundered it for a commission officials said in most instances 
it was deposited in bank accounts here then transmitted to mora in 
colombia via blank checks drawn on the tampa account prosecutors 
said 
agents first contacted bcci representatives in february 1987 and 
began opening accounts at various branches in july the indictment 
said 
the indictments alleged possession and smuggling conspiracies 
as well as conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue service 
launder proceeds of domestic cocaine sales and engage in a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
the major defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison 
and fines of more than 5 million if convicted on all counts the 
bank faces maximum fines of more than 45 million 
the us government is seeking forfeiture of property funds in 
about 40 bank accounts and bcci assets

male strippers cavorted too close to 
female patrons at a fire department fundraiser upsetting some 
husbands and violating a state law requiring performers to remain 
at least 6 feet away a prosecutor said 
during the male dance revue last month strippers came close 
enough for members of the taneytown volunteer fire departments 
womens auxiliary to tuck dollar bills in the dancers gstrings 
assistant states attorney jill trivas said 
state liquor laws require gstring clad strippers in eight 
counties to keep 6 feet between them and patrons the law also 
forbids the touching of buttocks 
had i been aware of these things i might have been able to 
talk with these gentlemen and explain what they could do said 
diane perry secretary of the womens auxiliary whose members paid 
10 each to see the sept 23 show 
the carroll county liquor board which took the matter under 
consideration after a few husbands lodged complaints expects to 
render a decision in 30 days on whether the fire department was 
responsible for allowing the violation to occur possible penalties 
include a 2000 fine 
ms perry asked the liquor board tuesday for leniency saying 
she did not learn about the 6foot rule until moments before the 
event started 
ms perry said the show which raised 2000 could not have 
been canceled that night without a demonstration 
mustang rebel jaguar and flash were among members of the 
fox a traveling troupe from lansdale pa who have performed 
for more than 400 fire department womens auxilaries in seven 
states ms perry said 
fire department president james h parker who obtained the 
liquor license for the event told the liquor board he agreed with 
the prosecutors interpretation of the law 
parker admitted he was warned about the law when the board 
granted a oneday liquor license for the revue he contended the 
women failed to heed his warning issued less than two hours before 
the show began

a former civilian weapons analyst pleaded 
guilty to passing military secrets to south africa an act his 
attorney said was motivated by a misguided sense of patriotism 
thomas joseph dolce 49 pleaded guilty tuesday in us district 
court to one count of espionage the first such case involving 
south africa prosecutors said dolce faces up to 10 years in 
prison and a 10000 fine 
his attorney harold i glaser said the father of three 
believed the united states should be doing more to help what dolce 
considers to be an important us ally fighting communism 
he did it out of what he considered to be loyalty but it was 
of course a gigantic gigantic mistake said glaser 
dolce a former employee at the aberdeen proving ground north of 
baltimore admitted mailing a classified document in 1979 to col 
bernardus redelinghuys a defense and armed forces attache at the 
south african embassy in washington 
assistant us attorney gary p jordan reading from a statement 
of facts at a hearing said dolce furnished the south africans 
with anything he came across pertaining to russian equipment he 
reasoned that the south africans were confronted with soviet 
equipment in angola and that the united states should be providing 
this information to them 
jordan said dolce delivered the document to redelinghuys because 
of its potential use for sabotage by south africa a staunchly 
anticommunist country that is ruled by its white minority under a 
system of racial segregation called apartheid 
dolce also acknowledged delivering batches of classified 
documents on 40 or more occasions by mail and in person to three 
military attaches at the embassy and to south african missions in 
london and los angeles between the fall of 1979 and the summer of 
1983 
for agreeing to plead guilty to the single count and to 
cooperate with prosecutors he was not prosecuted under a more 
severe statute carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison 
dolce had security clearance through his work for the army 
material systems analysis activity a department of the army agency 
charged with evaluating weapons systems 
glaser said dolce was the only us citizen involved adding the 
government learned of his clients activities inadvertantly 
the lawyer declined to elaborate 
authorities said dolce had insisted his activities were 
motivated by ideological rather than financial concerns jordan 
said there is no evidence that dolce accepted money 
us authorities would not discuss the extent of the damage 
dolces activities caused to national security 
alayne resberg press secretary for the south african embassy 
said her country considered the matter history 
two of the officers allegedly involved have already retired 
from active service and the third officer is no longer in the 
united states of america she said 
we would just like to point out that south africa doesnt 
consider itself an unfriendly nation toward the usa she said 
adding that neither the fbi nor the justice department has talked 
to anyone in the embassy about the case 
dolce ended his relationship with the south africans in 1983 
apparently because of a personality clash with the embassys new 
defense attache authorities said 
us district judge herbert f murray ordered dolce held in jail 
without bail pending a sentencing date which has yet to be set 
prosecutors said they would recommend dolce be given the maximum 
sentence

radical sinhalese group which has opposed the july 1987 peace 
accord aimed at ending the 5yearold war by tamil militants 
the separatist war has claimed at least 8500 lives 
the accord was sponsored by india which got involved in the 
ethnic problems of its southern neighbor because of the sympathies 
of its own 60 million tamils to the rebel cause 
india sent in at least 47000 soldiers to sri lanka when the 
tamils reneged on the peace plan 
tamils who are mostly hindus form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people they claim they are discriminated against by the 
mostly buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population 
and control the government and military

the alamo may have been at peace since 1836 
but descendants of those who fought there have a new battle brewing 
over control of 17 million banked from souvenir sales at the 
shrine 
the daughters of the republic of texas have always had charge of 
the alamo and its bank account but the league of united latin 
american citizens angered over what it calls a misrepresentation 
of history by the daughters says they should turn any surplus over 
to the state 
in my opinion all they want to do is get their hands on the 
money ella stumpf 84 one of the daughters said this week 
the alamo is a selffinancing facility no state tax money is 
invested and the daughters must generate funds from the souvenir 
shop to pay for a staff of 65 and an annual budget in excess of 1 
million 
the mission visited by 3 million people a year occupies four 
acres of state land in downtown san antonio the daughters serve at 
the pleasure of the legislature which alone has authority to end 
their custodial role 
i dont think too many people knew they had 17 million in 
the bank off sales from their souvenir shop i dont think anyone 
had ever asked said state rep orlando garcia whose inquiry 
into the alamo ledgers started the current flap 
garcia said unless the daughters have a great purpose for 
these funds the money could become available to the state 
when the attorney general ruled that the alamo finances fell 
under the texas open records act the daughters sent a copy of 
their latest audited budget to garcia 
wed never had to face this before were happy to do 
whatever the proper authorities want us to do we dont have 
anything to hide said peggy dibrell a member of the daughters 
alamo committee 
attached to the audit was a note explaining the intended plans 
for the surplus funds a new film and activity center two new 
educational films and a permanent operating hedge against a 
sudden dropoff in tourism 
jose garcia de lara president of the latin american citizens 
league was quick to call for a full accounting of the finances 
with any surplus funds be considered for other state programs 
quite frankly we arent very adamant about taking over the 
alamo our main issue is we want accountability by whomever is 
running it to the peoples of the state and to the history of our 
citizenry he said 
the daughters have created their history by perpetuating myth 
and by omission these thousands of bad mexicans killed our few 
good anglos and this has made the chapel a symbol of oppression 
about 180 texans including davy crockett and jim bowie died at 
the alamo fortchapel when it was attacked by an army of thousands 
of mexicans during the texas revolution in 1836 
but garcia the legislator said there is no historical or 
cultural component to his inquiry 
i dont have time to get annoyed by what did or didnt happen 
in 1836 he said what is at issue is access to records about 
finances that should be public my name could be davy crockett the 
fifth and id be asking the same questions

highly radioactive waste from the savannah 
river plant will be shipped to new mexico under a project being 
reviewed by the us energy department the agency says 
a proposed facility at the nuclear weapons plant would prepare 
the waste for shipment starting next year to the departments waste 
isolation pilot plant near carlsbad nm according to an 
environmental assessment by the agency issued monday 
the new mexico plant would eventually remove a potential source 
of groundwater contamination from savannah river thousands of 
cubic feet of stored waste containing elements heavier than 
uranium which are called transuranic 
plutonium manufactured at savannah river for use in nuclear 
weapons is a transuranic element 
the three nuclear weapons reactors at the plant near aiken have 
been closed for maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of 
publicity about lax safety precautions 
savannah river is one of 14 sites that generate or store 
transuranic wastes in nuclear weapons work and that will ship them 
to new mexico 
the new mexico plant is a research facility designed to 
demonstrate the safe and environmentally acceptable disposal of 
radioactive defense waste the report said 
the savannah river facility would analyze compact and solidify 
newly generated waste 
by 1995 when savannah river is to start retrieving previously 
stored waste for shipment a projected 370000 cubic feet of stored 
transuranic waste will have accumulated there the energy 
department report says waste is stored in containers and trenches 
at the plant 
starting in 1995 the report said savannah rivers facility 
would ship away 15000 cubic feet of retrieved waste per year and 
export new waste as fast as it accumulates at a projected rate of 
6200 cubic feet per year 
the new mexico project which has itself drawn criticism from 
environmentalists will not end the south carolina plants 
environmental woes 
a report issued this week by congress general accounting office 
notes that hazardous but nonradioactive wastes also have 
accumulated at numerous sites around the plant some reports 
estimate the total cost of cleaning up the plant at 65 billion 
in addition the transuranic project does not include waste 
buried before 1970 the energy department decided the environmental 
benefits were not worth the risks of unearthing the waste the 
report suggested

the headquarters of south africas roman catholic church in 
pretoria today authorities said it was arson 
there were no injuries but a nun and three other people staying 
in the building were rescued by firemen after they were trapped on 
a balcony by the flames 
if it hadnt been for the fast action of the fire department 
we would have all been killed said one of the four rob lambert 
it was the second major attack in six weeks on the headquarters 
of an antiapartheid church organization the main office of the 
south african council of churches was devastated by a bomb aug 31 
police said four nearly empty containers of gasoline and 
paraffin were found on the ground floor of khanya house in 
pretoria the headquarters of the southern african catholic bishops 
conference 
the fire seriously damaged the organizations archives and print 
shop on the ground floor and also caused damage on two upper floors 
police said a minibus with 11 people inside including blacks 
and whites was seen by a policeman at the building shortly before 
the fire broke out about 2 am the vehicle had a false license 
plate police said 
no arrests have been made in connection with the bombing of 
khotso house in johannesburg which housed the offices of the 
council of churches and other organizations seeking an end to 
apartheid or the whiteminority goverments policy of racial 
segregation 
leading activists have suggested the bombing was carried out 
either by rightwing vigilantes or by a covert security force unit 
the catholic church in south africa is predominantly black two 
weeks ago the catholic bishops distributed a pastoral letter 
suggesting catholics consider not voting in this months nationwide 
municipal elections 
activists say the elections for segregated local councils serve 
only to entrench apartheid and will bring blacks no closer to 
obtaining voting rights on the national level

cbs television has deleted references to 
american indians as savages from a thanksgivingrelated 
peanuts cartoon because an indian parents group here 
complained a network official said 
carol altieri vice president of program practices for the cbs 
broadcast group in hollywood said the producers notes on the 
script to the mayflower voyagers indicate that the word 
savages has been dropped throughout 
the peanuts special is scheduled to air oct 21 as part of 
an animated historical miniseries called this is america charlie 
brown 
ms altieri said the change was made because of concerns raised 
by the concerned american indian parents group of minneapolis and 
the cbs affiliate in minneapolis wccotv she said no other 
affiliates had complained 
the network distributed scripts of the cartoon and teaching 
instructions to affiliate stations which distributed them to 
participating schools said joanne brokawlivesey director of 
educational and community services for cbs in new york 
because the script referred to indians as savages in at 
least two places and included historical inaccuracies that gave 
negative portrayals of indians wccotv shortened the script and 
revised the teaching instructions said tom cousins a consultant 
for the station 
he said the material being given to 52000 students at about 150 
schools in minnesota was changed to foster cultural sensitivity 
were going to go with the revised one to remove anything that 
would be insensitive to the native americans cousins said it 
was corresponding with myths rather than actuality 
he said the cartoon wrongly portrays indians as giving war 
whoops and unfairly portrays the indian squanto who befriended 
the pilgrims as a grateful slave who learned english after 
being kidnapped by an englishman who took him away to europe 
the war whoops are a myth of the oldtime cowboy movies 
cousins said 
in the finished program squanto says i served a wonderful 
man who also had me learn english and that man finally gave me my 
freedom to sail back here to my land 
the networkdistributed script was shortened by cousins so that 
it ends with the mayflowers arrival in north america and the 
teaching instructions were revised to suggest ways for teachers to 
discuss myths surrounding thanksgiving cousins said a committee 
that included an american indian and a human relations professor at 
st cloud state university agreed on the changes he said 
ms altieri said cbs will air the program despite objections 
from concerned american indian parents 
were not stereotyping indians or native americans here as 
much as we are telling the story of a man squanto who through 
extreme adverse experiences in his life brought those experiences 
to bear in becoming the salvation of people who landed in this 
strange land ms altieri said 
she said the actual program may not come off as harsh as the 
advance script in the eyes of those who have complained 
i think it might be a mistake to make the judgement prior to 
seeing the program she said 
but phil st john a member of the parents group in minneapolis 
said he still objects to airing of the program

south korean delegates elated by 
their countrys success as olympic host will be more flexible when 
they resume talks with north korea thursday on reunification 
officials said today 
the talks at the border truce site of panmunjom will be the 
first meeting between parliamentary officials of the two koreas 
since the 1988 summer olympics ended in seoul on oct 2 
the olympics have given us new impetus we will be more 
flexible a senior government party official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the two sides began discussions aug 21 on possible formal talks 
between the two koreas parliaments but made no major progress in 
four meetings in the fourth session aug 26 each accused the 
other of blocking agreement but they agreed to resume discussions 
after the olympics 
the two sides differed widely over both the agenda and format of 
the proposed formal talks north korea demanded a joint meeting of 
the nearly 1000 members of the two koreas parliaments but south 
korea sought a smaller meeting 
we will be flexible about the two pending issues and make new 
proposals the south korean official said 
at thursdays meeting he said south korea would suggest that 
each side send up to 100 delegates to the main talks previously 
south korea had sought to limit the number to 25 
in its flexible stand on the agenda the official said south 
korea may agree to discuss a north korean proposal that the 
parliaments of the two sides issue a joint nonaggression 
statement 
north korea said any such statement should call among other 
things for the withdrawal of the 42000 us troops stationed in 
south korea and drastic arms reductions by the two koreas 
south korea had sought to sign a nonaggression treaty rather 
than a nonaggression statement which has no binding force but 
pyongyang officials maintained that the two koreas are not separate 
states and thus cannot conclude a treaty 
south korean officials said they would take a soft stand and 
try to accommodate north korean proposals as much as possible but 
they did not say whether they would consider the north korean 
proposal for a pullout of the american troops and arms reductions 
other topics expected to arise at the meeting include a recent 
call by south korean president roh taewoo for summit talks with 
north korean ruler kim il sung the official said 
in a major policy speech on oct 4 roh renewed a call for 
summit talks with kim and said he was ready to end rivalry and 
confrontation on the korean peninsula the summit if held would 
be the first since the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 into 
the communist north and capitalist south 
in response to rohs proposal north koreas official radio said 
on sunday the proposed summit would not be possible unless south 
korea accepted pyongyangs preconditions the south korean news 
agency naewoe reported

seven current and former boston police detectives 
have been sentenced to two to five years in prison for shaking down 
bars and restaurants but say theyll appeal their convictions 
the four former and three current detectives were sentenced 
tuesday after having been found guilty last month of conspiring to 
extort more than 18000 in bribes in return for protecting bars 
and restaurants from inspections overlooking violations or seeking 
to influence liquor regulations cases 
prosecutors diane kottmyer and james farmer charged the 
detectives with selling their badges for influence while defense 
attorneys maintained that the detectives were only accepting gifts 
from people they worked with closely over several years 
the sentences handed down by us district judge a david 
mazzone were lower than those sought by the prosecutors but 
kottmyer and farmer said they were satisfied 
the message is that police officers just like all other 
citizens are bound by the constraints of the law kottmyer said 
explaining the sentences mazzone said its difficult not to 
be impressed by their records 
former detective francis x sheehan got the stiffest sentence 
five years the others received sentences of two years or three 
years 
they sold the public trust in return for personal gain 
kottmyer said in arguing for penalties of up to 10 years 
a defense attorney anthony cardinale said an appeal was 
planned challenging rulings by mazzone that prevented the defense 
from attacking the credibility of prosecution witnesses some of 
whom the detectives claim were bar owners of dubious repute 
addressing the court before he was sentences defendant thomas 
j connolly drew applause from some 30 detectives when he told 
mazzone i dont think in my heart i ever sold my badge i am 
not a racketeer i never have been a racketeer

tanks and troops disappeared from the 
streets of algiers at dawn today when the government abruptly 
lifted a state of emergency imposed during violent nationwide 
protests last week 
armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled away from public 
buildings and main intersections at 5 am in this mediterranean 
port city only the defense ministry and other military 
installations were manned by soldiers 
but more than 3000 looters and agitators arrested in the last 
hours of the state of emergency still were being held in the police 
school at el biar and elsewhere 
the government acknowledged that at least 180 people were killed 
nationwide in the past week but unofficial counts placed the death 
toll at more than 500 
more than 1000 people were said to have been injured mostly by 
machinegun fire directed at crowds of demonstrators 
shops were open today and government offices public services 
and algiers vital harbor were functioning normally 
a 10 pm to 6 am curfew was also lifted effective this 
morning 
islamic fundamentalists recognizable among the generally 
europeanclad population of algiers by their flowing white robes 
could not be found this morning 
they had sought to take over the spontaneous protests against 
high prices and a government austerity program and their calls for 
demonstrations were widely followed 
president chadli bendjedid promised in a nationwide television 
address monday to meet demands for economic and political reform 
he said there would be a purge of those responsible for the crisis 
but he gave no specifics 
there was speculation mohamed cherif messaadia 
secretarygeneral of the national liberation front the sole legal 
political party would be among those purged 
the party and its boss have not spoken publicly since the crisis 
began oct 4 political analysts said the partys authority has 
been seriously reduced by the riots 
in his speech bendjedid made no mention of the party saying 
political reforms would be publicly debated and perhaps submitted 
to a referendum 
bendjedids speech was widely seen as weak but the government 
organized spontaneous demonstrations of support for it 
throughout the country 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity say 
the official death toll of about 180 was low but they also 
contended that reports of up to 500 dead were exaggerated 
reliable accounts from hospital medical and police sources 
indicated at least 400 people died and more than 1000 were injured 
in the biggest crisis faced by the government since its 
independence from france in 1962 
among those killed in violence monday was sid ali benmechiche a 
senior editor at the official algerie presse service said 
diplomatic and family sources 
the government announced friday that 900 people were arrested 
but sources following judicial proceedings said more than 3000 
people were in custody 
in the eastern city of annaba trials began tuesday for people 
arrested during the riots and six demonstrators were sentenced to 
prison terms ranging from four to eight years the algerian league 
of human rights said in algiers 
according to lawyers present in the courtroom the charges were 
vandalism sabotage and attacks on government and private property 
food shortages soaring prices and low wages were among the 
complaints when the protests began in algiers and more than a dozen 
provincial cities 
demonstrators targeted an austerity program introduced by 
bendjedid in january measures include cutting food subsidies 
reducing the workforce at some nationalized industries and giving 
those industries more autonomy 
algeria which has a sovietstyle centrally directed economy 
has been hurt by the crash of oil prices more than 95 percent of 
the north african countrys exports come from oil and natural gas

a soviet economist says boosting food subsidies 
will only fuel inflation but that modernizing agriculture will help 
reduce waste that costs 96 billion annually 
kim n khmelkov an economist and director of a moscowarea 
farming enterprise said that to finance more subsidies the 
government probably will have to take the money from staterun 
enterprises the communist party daily pravda reported tuesday 
those enterprises in turn would be forced to raise prices to 
make up for the loss he said 
in a word its a race in a circle price increases would 
not strengthen the economy but destabilize it and the 
destabilization would start with those with the lowest incomes 
pravda quoted him as saying 
many soviet economists have said the prices of basic commodities 
must be increased in the next few years to make the economy more 
efficient president mikhail s gorbachev has promised consumers 
will be compensated for any price increases 
khmelkov said that officials must instead keep strict control 
over prices and end vast inefficiencies in agriculture 
as an example he said a new kind of milking machine that could 
easily be produced in the soviet union would increase milk 
production by 10 percent to 15 percent while saving 4 billion 
across the country 
in west germany financial sources said a consortium of banks 
plans to sign a 16 billion credit agreement for the soviet union 
the new york times said soviet officials hope to use the money to 
improve the nations food processing and consumer goods industries 
deutsche bank west germanys largest commercial bank is 
heading the consortium involved in the agreement which would be 
the biggest western credit line ever to the soviet union 
scientists have calculated that inefficiency and waste in soviet 
agriculture account for 96 billion a year khmelkov said 
thats half the cost of what is grown in the fields and 
farms he said 
the government spends 105 billion a year to keep the prices of 
milk meat bread and other food products low in keeping with 
longterm policies officials have espoused as proof of the 
superiority of their economic system 
khmelkov said his enterprise produces beef costing 250 a pound 
but it is sold in stores at government prices 80 cents lower 
the economist said it costs other farms twice as much to produce 
the same amount of meat and the state picks up the difference 
between the cost of production and the retail price 
nevertheless some moscow consumers cannot afford to buy meat 
which is not always available he said 
in addition to considering retail price increases gorbachev has 
been trying to trim the topheavy management of the staterun 
agricultural system the soviet president also is trying to 
encourage state farms to give more responsibility to families and 
small groups of workers allowing them to earn more money for 
better work

television when a local newscast flashed her photograph on the 
screen and reported that she had been murdered 
a paula ann moore had indeed been killed the previous day she 
was from rockford 18 years old and black two local television 
stations illustrated the story by using the ninthgrade school 
photograph of the paula ann moore who was alive from rockford 18 
and white 
i knew that a paula ann moore had been killed ms moore 
said tuesday but then the news showed my picture i didnt know 
what to do all i could think was that everybody my friends and 
relatives would think i was dead 
i called my mom right away i guess i kind of freaked out 
paula was not the only one upset friends and relatives began 
calling her mother rebecca friday after reading newspaper 
accounts minus the photograph of the slaying 
the phone started ringing at 7 am rebecca moore said i 
spent the whole morning explaining to people that our paula was 
fine 
mrs moore was so busy making calls that she missed the 5 pm 
newscasts she sat down to watch the 10 pm news 
i knew it wasnt my daughter who was dead but seeing her 
picture like that and hearing the story i was shaking all over 
said mrs moore 
she said her daughters photo accompanied the murder story on 
two local stations wifr and wrex spokesmen for both channels 
confirmed that they had used the wrong photograph the two stations 
apologized for the error during tuesday newscasts mrs moore said 
mrs moore said officials from jefferson high school where her 
daughter attended classes told her they did not release the 
picture 
linda dawson spokeswoman for the rockford school district said 
no one from administrative headquarters released the photo either 
she speculated that the television stations obtained a school 
yearbook independently 
the real victim was found dead thursday in a small storage shed 
behind a rockford home police said the woman who had been a 
livein baby sitter at the home for the last month was reported 
missing by her family several weeks ago

an organizer of a marijuanasmuggling 
ring ordered by a judge to open an aids hospice rather than serve 
years in prison says hes pleased with the sentence but may have 
had an easier time behind bars 
the sentence issued tuesday by us district judge gene carter 
believed to be the first of its kind in the country calls for 
harvey m prager to operate a hospice in maine that will house at 
least three aids victims 
the 41yearold prager who helped open the first aids hospice 
in south america and his frenchborn wife sandrine will act as 
nonpaid resident managers for five years 
im sure two or three weeks down the road when were in 
the grip of the struggle well think it may have been easier to 
have gone to jail said prager who had requested the sentence 
prager pleaded guilty in january to conspiracy possession and 
importation of marijuana he could have received up to 15 years in 
prison and a 125000 fine 
the sentence proposal drew criticism from the public and some 
people have written letters to newspapers calling it outrageous 
and an insult to all lawabiding citizens of maine 
however it was applauded by advocates of alternative prison 
sentences among them a private nonprofit group called sentencing 
options which helped devise the plan 
theres not much point in his going to prison director joan 
gauche said he has a lot to offer and society is going to 
benefit 
carter who is known for handing down maximum penalities in 
drugrelated cases said he will impose a jail term if the hospice 
fails to materialize 
i am concerned that you do what you say youll do because 
if you do not do this i will not hesitate to reconsider this 
matter carter told prager a yarmouth resident 
more than 20 others connected with the smuggling operation 
which imported more than 20 tons of marijuana worth 83 million 
through deer isle between 1979 and 1981 each have been sentenced 
to up to 10 years in prison 
prager an art broker described by family and friends as a 
welleducated intelligent man who had a few bad years said he 
will have the hospice open by the oct 1 1989 deadline imposed by 
the judge 
i think we have taken the harder road and im hoping that 
people do realize that were about to do a lot of very very hard 
work he said were pleased to be able to do this work but i 
dont believe itll be easy 
as part of a plea agreement prager will forfeit proceeds from 
the smuggling operation and liquidate his assets which include a 
500000 townhouse in london a paris apartment worth about 
200000 property in the caribbean and at least one swiss bank 
account said assistant us attorney joseph h groff iii 
the assets are estimated to be well in excess of 1 million 
groff said and the government will receive twothirds and leave 
onethird for prager 
jerry miller president of the national centers for institutions 
and alternatives said he believes this is the first time a judge 
has approved opening an aids hospice as an alternative to prison 
its a lot more productive than all the jailing were into 
miller said in a telephone interview from his alexandria va 
office i wish we could be as creative as that for the average 
offender

prime minister mohammad hasan sharq 
said today his government is committed to seeking a negotiated 
settlement to end the war with moslem guerrillas 
sharq also said he hoped the us presidential election next 
month will lead to a change in washingtons policy toward the 
ussupported guerrillas 
we hope that the smell of blood of innocent people will no 
longer be to the liking of the leaders of the united states of 
america sharq said during a 90minute meeting with western 
reporters 
he made no new offers that might persuade the guerrillas to stop 
fighting the sovietbacked afghan government but he indicated a 
preference for making deals with local guerrilla commanders inside 
the country rather than trying to persuade their pakistanibased 
leaders to give up the fight 
if we are not able to have ways of negotiating with all of 
them we will have negotiations with some of themthe 63yearold 
prime minister said those who are sharing the miseries of the 
people of afghanistan will come first 
the afghan government has been pursuing a policy of trying to 
establish what it calls coalition governments at the provincial 
level if successful this strategy could neutralize on a 
piecemeal basis the guerrillas by persuading them to lay down 
their arms in exchange for local power 
the prime minister whose remarks in dari were translated into 
english by government officials urged the united states and 
pakistan to stop arming the guerrillas 
he dismissed any similarity between the united states arming of 
the guerrrillas and the soviet unions resupplying of the afghan 
army he said the kremlin has been arming the afghan government for 
35 years 
american aid to the guerrillas began in earnest when soviet 
troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to support the 
communist government after a coup 
soviet troops started withdrawing from afghanistan on may 15 
under terms of an agreement reached in geneva the withdrawal is 
now half completed and the remaining soviet soldiers estimated 
at 50000 to 60000 are to be gone by feb 15 1989

safety problems that halted production of us 
nuclear weapons materials expose a bad trend and a sense of 
complacency in the operations of nuclear plants top energy 
department officials said today 
the risks we are facing are serious said richard 
starostecki deputy assistant energy secretary for safety health 
and quality assurance 
energy secretary john s herrington said tuesday that the 
government will not be able to manufacture nuclear weapons 
materials for 2 months because of safety problems but he said 
that raises no threat to national security 
the department had planned to restart one of its three nuclear 
weapons reactors at its savannah river plant in south carolina as 
early as next month but now does not expect the first of them to 
reach full operation until january herrington said 
starostecki interviewed on cbs this morning said the 
nations aging nuclear weapons manufacturing plants must remain in 
operation for another 10 to 15 years while they are being replaced 
the savannah river reactors began operations in 1954 
these are the only supplies we have for our national 
security said starostecki were trying to take measures now 
before the situation does degrade and we have a serious accident 
referring to the shutdown last weekend of the main plutonium 
processing plant at rocky flats in golden colo because of a 
radioactive contamination incident he said the incident of the 
workers is indicative of a bad trend and we want to stop it before 
it does result in any offsite release of radioactive material 
starostecki said the rocky flats facility should be able to 
restart in about two months 
the top energy department spokesman c anson franklin said on 
nbctvs today that some contractors and department managers 
have become so accustomed to the old equipment that they dont 
stop long enough to see what was the cause of minor problems 
we think there is a sense of complacency in the department 
franklin said 
all three of the savannah reactors have been closed down for 
maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of publicity about lax 
safety precautions 
the department said herrington will not operate unsafe 
reactors we will meet the defense needs of this country in a safe 
manner and an environmentally sensitive manner 
herringtons deputy joseph f salgado outlined what he called 
a phased restart it will include supervision by a senior 
manager at savannah river and a review of safety at various 
milestones during the four weeks officials say will be needed to 
take the first reactor to full power 
salgado said he foresaw no shortage of tritium one of two 
nuclear weapons materials produced at savannah river the facility 
the only nuclear weapons plant on active status also produces 
plutonium which does not decay as quickly as tritium and is said 
to be in abundant supply 
we are comfortable that savannah river will operate at a 
sufficient level to meet the tritium needs of the future salgado 
said 
the news conference was called to defuse criticism of the energy 
department not only over the savannah river plant in aiken sc 
but also over radioactive contamination at the rocky flats plant 
northwest of denver colo and over allegedly lax security at 
weapons laboratories in new mexico and california 
in related developments tuesday 
president reagan voiced concern about the nuclear plant safety 
problem during a meeting with top defense and energy department 
officials chief of staff kenneth duberstein said 
duberstein quoted reagan as saying the administration is 
committed to making sure that all safety precautions are taken 
and that all rules and regulations be followed 
the chairman of ei du pont nemours and co which operates 
savannah river under contract for the energy department reacted 
angrily to claims that company employees had a lax attitude toward 
safety re heckert said du pont was caught in a political 
crossfire between the energy department and capitol hill 
officials said the shutdown of the rocky flats main plutonium 
processing plant on saturday virtually halted production at the 
nuclear weapons plant 
congressional researchers said the energy department has 
admitted hundreds of visitors from communist and nuclearsensitive 
nations into its nuclear weapons labs at sandia los alamos and 
livermore without required security checks 
sen john glenn dohio said the cost of cleaning up 
radioactive and hazardous waste at energy department nuclear 
facilities is estimated at 150 billion to 175 billion he cited 
estimates by energy department officials and the general accounting 
office 
it will take 20 years even if we know how to do the 
cleanup glenn said adding that safety and health matters too 
often took a back seat to production goals at the departments 
nuclear facilities it was not clear how glenn the chairman of the 
senate governmental affairs committee made the estimate 
a report issued at the savannah river plant estimated that 
cleaning up the facility could cost as much as 65 billion the 
estimate by the gao was markedly higher than an earlier energy 
department forecast of 285 million for cleanup of 69 waste sites 
at the plant 
herrington and salgado said most recent criticism of the 
department had originated within the department itself during a 
safety and environmental campaign started in early 1985 
our facilities are safer today than they were four years 
ago said herrington but much more needs to be done 
salgado told congress on sept 30 that he hoped to restart one 
of the savannah river facilities the preactor within 30 to 45 
days

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze invited 
unesco today to create an international scientific group to begin 
space research at a controversial radar station in the soviet union 
he said soviet scientists were ready to establish contacts with 
the united nations educational scientific and cultural 
organization to carry out peaceful research at an absolutely 
peaceful radar installation at krasnoyarsk 2000 miles east of 
moscow 
in a speech sept 16 soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
proposed that a center for international cooperation in the 
exploration of space be set up at the radar station 
the united states has said the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty it signed with the soviet union would permit the krasnoyarsk 
station to be used for space tracking but contends that evidence 
suggests it actually is being used for missile detection and 
warning a violation of the abm treaty 
shevardnadze on the last day of a threeday official visit to 
france spoke to a special session of unescos governing executive 
board 
he said the most important problem facing the 158nation 
parisbased organization is to prevent the scientific and 
technological revolution from alienating people who depend on it to 
improve their lives 
he said it was immoral and dangerous particularly for 
industrialized nations to keep developing nations which constitute 
a majority in un organizations at the periphery of scientic 
development 
the united states and britain left the organization respectively 
at the end of 1984 and 1985 after charging that unesco was overly 
political freespending and poorly managed at the time the 
united states called the organization a champion of extreme 
statist philosophies 
shevardnadze said the soviet union bore a share of the 
responsibility for the departure of the two western nations 
sometimes we were also acting on the principle of a tooth for 
a tooth under the pressure of confrontation he said 
he said excessive introduction of ideological dimensions in 
unesco debates undermined the principle of tolerance that is 
fundamental to international cooperation 
shevardnadze was welcomed to unesco by director general federico 
mayor who said he was sure the united states britain and 
singapore which also left unesco would heed an appeal 
shevardnadze made at the un general assemly last month to 
reconsider

a handful of students who occupied an 
administration building at goddard college for nearly two days have 
ended their vigil after narrowing a 26item list of wideranging 
demands to one 
the three remaining students ended their blockade on the second 
floor of the community center on tuesday seven others had left the 
building monday night 
the final demand agreed to before the protesters ended their 
occupation was that the college fully disclose its financial 
records something goddard president jack lindquist said was 
already in effect 
its a funny issue to have as an issue he said everybody 
knows they can come to me for that information im glad it wasnt 
ending homelessness in america that would have been harder to do 
after the barricades were removed tuesday about 100 students 
and faculty met to discuss the issues that had been raised by the 
protesters which ranged from school issues such as increasing 
student participation in the colleges administration to more 
global concerns such as freeing south african activist nelson 
mandela and ending homelessness in america 
before the barricades were removed zenzile madikinea a south 
african and former goddard student who organized the protest with 
student dan abrams cried softly 
because we are nonviolent and dont want anybody to get hurt 
we are coming down to press all our demands we care about the 
students and respect the process he said 
lindquist said the community life committee composed of 
students and faculty would decide whether any punitive action 
would be taken against the students

call it rapprochement call it detente call 
it peace however fleeting after weeks in the national spotlight 
dan quayle now admits he actually finds the press likable 
quayles new posture with the media assumes that reporters are 
merely a bit misguided not necessarily evil a notion he expanded 
on tuesday as he posed for a photo opportunity at an ohio pumpkin 
stand 
the republican vice presidential nominee bought his press 
entourage a bushel of apples bit into one and admonished go eat 
them enjoy it change your attitude 
the stand was owned by one jack r custer not to let an 
opportunity slip one reporter noted to quayle that it appeared he 
was at custers last stand the senator laughed 
why not we were at waterloo earlier said another a 
reference to quayles remark to a napoleon ohio rally that 
michael dukakis wouldnt come there because he doesnt want to 
meet his waterloo 
such repartee with the indiana senator was missing from early 
weeks of his campaign when the candidate was constantly peppered 
with questions about his military service academic record and 
personal life those questions do pop up from time to time as do 
questions about polls indicating that quayle is a drag on the 
ticket 
and indeed when quayle ventured into the back of his plane to 
see reporters recently he met some of his toughest questions to 
date about his parents support in the past of the john birch 
society 
quayle testily denounced the question as irrelevant when 
the reporter persisted quayle finally told him youre 
irrelevant 
but more often than not quayle has been casual and relaxed 
around the press since his debate with lloyd bentsen his 
democratic counterpart 
there have been frequent impromptu visits to the back of the 
plane for ontherecord chats and goodnatured banter with the 
regulars who travel with him 
there havent been any formal news conferences since sept 15 
they are not quayles best format he often makes gaffes and 
they clearly dont fit in with the campaign strategy 
weve had news conferences not as much as the press would 
like concedes david prosperi quayles press secretary but 
our strategy is not to satisfy the press as much as it is to get 
our message out 
quayle likes to tell crowds he is a former newspaperman he once 
held a management position at his fathers huntington ind 
newspaper but he has made no secret of the fact that he feels he 
has been treated unfairly by the press since he became the nominee 
one reporter who rode on quayles campaign plane for the first 
time tuesday seemed stunned that the senator and his press corps 
were not at war with each other in the air 
you didnt realize what good friends i had until you got on 
did you quayle said gesturing round the plane and smiling 
broadly 
wonderful people here glowing reports they write about me all 
the time its the other people that arent here theyre the ones 
that write all those bad things 
with perhaps a bit more of his tongue in his cheek quayle 
explained his seemingly new attitude to the press by saying i 
figured out you werent all that bad 
i just didnt realize what a friendly bunch of people you are 
the more i get to know you the more i really like you he told a 
group of reporters at a van wert ohio stop 
since the debate moreover quayle has displayed a fascination 
with spin the timehonored practice of political aides 
selling reporters their favorable interpretation of a particular 
development 
i am dr spin and i want you all to report that quayle told 
the traveling press i dont want anybody to say well heres 
what some campaign aide said about it you ask me and ill give you 
the answer 
during the weekend quayle complained to bush campaign chairman 
james a baker iii about anonymous bush staffers quoted in news 
reports as saying the gop vice presidential nominee was a liability 
and he did not perform well in the debate according to campaign 
sources who requested anonymity 
quayle says his new lightheartedness with reporters comes 
because he has simply decided to enjoy his last few weeks on the 
campaign trail 
we are going to have a great deal of fun these last few 
weeks he said and i am just sort of sitting back and as they 
say let her rip

the communist party chief today said 
ethnic rallies that ignited nationwide unrest are an example of 
couterrevolutionary tendencies running rampant in yugoslavia 
staterun media reported 
what the counterrevolution in kosovo has been trying to do 
constitutes the most brutal threat to socialism in 
yugoslavia stipe suvar told the ruling politburos of yugoslavia 
and kosovo an autonomous province in the republic of serbia 
but he added antisocialist and if you want 
counterrevolutionary tendencies have grown in all of yugoslavia so 
that the kosovo reality in comparison is not a particularly 
isolated phenomenon 
suvar an ethnic croat spoke in pristina the capital of 
kosovo his comments were reported by the staterun tanjug news 
agency 
at a meeting tuesday serbias communist party chief slobodan 
milosevic defended the kosovo rallies and vowed he would assign 
blame for the national crisis during a meeting of national leaders 
next week 
but milosevic was criticized for failing to condemn calls for 
violent solutions to tensions in kosovo where serbs claim 
discrimination by the albanian majority 
during the belgrade meeting of the central committee of the 
serbian communist party members demanded three kosovo communists 
be ousted from the national central committee for failing to 
resolve tensions 
the belgrade and the pristina gatherings were key preludes to 
the crucial national central committee gathering monday 
the growing friction between ethnic groups and general 
dissatisfaction with the nations economy has led to widespread 
public protests strikes and political manuevering that add up to 
yugoslavias most serious social unrest since world war ii 
milosevic hailed by serbs as the heir apparent to the late 
president josip broz tito is expected to have a major showdown 
with national party leaders over the kosovo dispute and the broader 
protests over yugoslavias economy 
milosevic on tuesday defended the nationalist rallies but said 
they should not become a regular practice the meeting was 
broadcast on state radio and television in a break with usual 
practice 
he said mondays meeting should be a confrontation with the 
responsibility for the crisis 
the serbian central committee which has more than 100 members 
decided with only six negative votes to demand dismissals of two 
ethnic albanians and one slav from their kosovo party posts and 
their expulsion from the national central committee 
one of the three is azem vlasi an ethnic albanian and former 
party chief in kosovo where predominantly moslem albanians make up 
90 percent of the population most slavs who live in the province 
serbs and montenegrins are christian 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure the 
autonomous provinces kosovo and vojvodina are part of serbia but 
not fully subject to its control 
the decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in titos 1974 constitution to prevent one 
republic from gaining sway over the others but has resulted in an 
ineffective government 
suvar has said broad personnel changes would be made during 
mondays national party meeting 
ethnic tension in kosovo has increased sharply in recent weeks 
because of rallies by hundreds of thousands of serbian 
nationalists albanians deny discrimination against slavs and say 
the problems are economic 
mustafa sefcet an ethnic albanian member of the serbian central 
committee on tuesday sharply criticized such rally chants as we 
want arms and the calls for vlasis death 
these are antisocialist slogans which do not meet with sharp 
condemnation except for sharp condemnation by all nations and 
nationalities in regions outside serbia he said 
one should on the spot unmask all forces standing behind 
the slogans he said in apparent criticism of milosevic 
belgrade radio reported three more rallies tuesday it said 
50000 people demonstrated at leskovac 90 miles south of belgrade 
20000 massed at nearby cuprija and another large rally was 
reported at valjevo 50 miles south of belgrade

some 200000 commuters were derailed this 
morning when a broken water main flooded subway tunnels and closed 
some streets around a key midtown manhattan subway hub officials 
said 
some sections of the subway system were under eight feet of 
water and the water was lapping over some platforms said transit 
authority spokesman bob slovak 
the break in the 36inch main was reported at 2 am said 
martha holstein a spokeswoman for the city department of 
environmental protection it took about five hours for city crews 
to close three water mains to isolate the break 
its no longer gushing in the area holstein said its 
still very wet 
the broken main carries water into smaller distribution mains 
which connect to buildings 
transit authority spokesman bob previdi said some 200000 
commuters were affected as train service on some lines was halted 
for up to four hours before the trains could be rerouted 
holstein said water service was expected to be restored to the 
affected areas between broadway and eighth avenue and 56th and 
60th streets near the southwest corner of central park within 
a matter of hours 
the size of the actual break and its cause had not yet been 
determined she said 
subway vibrations heavy traffic a number of factors can 
affect water mains in addition to age or freezing weather so its 
very unclear what would have caused this she said 
motorists were advised to avoid the area said a police 
spokesman sgt edward burns

saving historic church buildings is less 
important than keeping the parish life within them strong cardinal 
edmund c szoka said in defense of a plan to close 43 catholic 
churches in the city 
szoka predicted tuesday that parishioners unhappiness with the 
planned closings would decrease 
as people have time to think about this and to consider it 
theyll understand that what were trying to do is to strengthen 
the life of the parishes strengthen the presence of the church in 
the city he said 
thats always been our objective we cant confuse that with 
simply maintaining a lot of great big buildings that once served a 
purpose but today are not needed 
a preservationist said many of the structures deserved to be 
saved as landmarks even if not as houses of worship 
i would say throughout the northeast and the midwest there is 
a widespread recognition that the roman catholic church especially 
cannot afford to keep that number of buildings said holly fiala 
fiala midwest director of the chicagobased national trust for 
historic preservation and other representatives of local state 
and federal preservation agencies met in detroit on monday to 
discuss the historic significance of churches the archdiocese of 
detroit plans to close 
some of these are very great energyusing buildings and the 
population that supports them has been reduced fiala said for 
the large barns of buildings meant to house 4000 parishioners and 
that now have 400 its a real problem 
as many as half of the 43 threatened churches may be eligible 
for designation as landmarks under detroits historic landmark 
ordinance said william m worden staff director of detroits 
historic designation advisory board 
the historic designation would restrict interior and exterior 
renovations he said state and national historic designations are 
also possible a status already attained by 10 of the affected 
buildings 
it may delay the demolition of the building or its conversion 
to an alternate use but it will not keep their parish alive 
fiala said that is something separate and apart from what the 
designation can achieve it basically protects the building itself 
but it doesnt protect what happens inside that is a local issue

the united states has provided 142 aircraft to 
other countries over the last decade for the interception and 
eradication of illegal drugs the state department said today 
more than half went to mexico facing growing violence from 
cocaine traffickers in their own countries the governments of 
latin america are fighting back the department said in a 
statement 
these countries are building rural mobile police units 
eradicating coca plantations and looking for new crops for peasant 
growers it said 
the us government is working with a number of latin american 
governments to build up their own capabilities for eradication and 
interdiction the statement issued by the press office said we 
are committed to helping these governments and will continue to 
provide training and equipment 
two years ago congress required that us airplanes and 
helicopters used on antidrug missions remain udner us ownership 
the statement issued today was in response to inquires prompted by 
an account by the knightridder news service 
state department officials said on tuesday that bolivia had 
mounted machine guns on six us helicopters under a drugfighting 
contract with the pentagon while peru and guatemala have hired 
american civilian pilots 
americans are flying five helicopters in peru and two aircraft 
to spray fields in guatemala the officials said 
the disclosure followed the knightridder story that said the 
state department had amassed a force of 150 aircraft and planned to 
use us civilian pilots to fly armed missions against drug traders 
in latin america the caribbean and asia 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley called the story an 
exaggeration she and catherine shaw of the departments 
international narcotics office then disclosed the pentagon contract 
with bolivia and the hiring of civilian pilots in peru and 
guatemala 
but mrs oakley said the 29 helicopters and planes acquired on 
order to combat drugs are not for combat they are not used for 
aggressive actions like bombing airstrips or cocaine laboratories 
i am not aware of plans for their future use in that regard 
in all 16 us helicopters and planes are in south american 
countries to combat drugs the officials said but except for the 
six helicopters in bolivia none has weapons mounted aboard mrs 
oakley said 
she said however that local law enforcement agents may be 
carrying weapons aboard those aircraft 
the knightridder story identified ann b wrobleski the 
assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters 
as commander in chief of the air wing 
aides to mrs wrobleski said she was attending an international 
drug conference in the hague that was not open to the press and 
could not be reached for comment 
mrs oakley called the story an exaggeration and an 
overdramatization of the congressional mandated role of the 
department in combating drugs 
the six helicopters in bolivia are huey models each one able to 
carry a crew of three and eight passengers the m60 machine guns 
are mounted in doorways on swivels 
ms shaw of the international narcotics office said bolivia 
armed the helicopters under a contract with the defense department 
in all she said the united states has title to 29 helicopters 
and planes in the antidrug wing not the 150 reported by 
knightridder 
of these ms shaw said five bell helicopters have been 
delivered to peru six hughes helicopters to bolivia a c123 cargo 
plane to peru two agricultural spray planes to guatemala and two 
to colombia 
she said the two in colombia may be flown by american civilians 
as well but she was not certain 
two other planes are used for training while the others in the 
wing of 29 will be delivered later the state department official 
said 
congress authorized 55 million for the operation under a 1986 
law the united states must maintain title to the planes 
previously american planes would be turned over to other countries 
to use in their campaigns against narcotics

the military says it got just one false positive 
result in testing more than 135000 recruits for the aids virus 
lending support to those who favor widespread screening for the 
disease 
the armed forces which routinely screen all recruits for 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome had only one false positive in 
checking young men and women from areas where the aids virus is 
rare 
the results of the military testing program are to be published 
thursday in the new england journal of medicine 
the risk of false positive results is often cited as an argument 
against routinely screening people at low risk of aids infection 
such as marriage license applicants some have suggested that the 
false positives might actually outnumber those who are truly 
infected with hiv the aids virus 
dr robert r redfield of the walter reed army institute of 
research said the military program dispels that myth by showing 
that aids testing can be performed quickly cheaply and accurately 
the test costs the government 3 per person and the results are 
available within three days 
military researchers said not all aids testing may be as 
accurate and efficient as theirs 
clearly people who perform the test poorly will have bad 
results redfield said i would like americans to ask why the 
young men and women in the department of defense get an early 
diagnosis for a treatable preventable disease when they cant 
the answer is there has been no leadership in the medical community 
to provide that right to the american people 
one critic of widespread testing dr lawrence miike of the 
congressional office of technology assessment said the report 
shows that you can get this phenomenally high accuracy rate 
which probably surpasses every other test there is 
but im not worried about them he said im worried about 
labs that advertise come get your hiv test i get calls from 
people who say they are the victims of false positives 
the question is not how well the best laboratories can do 
added dr klemens b meyer of new england medical center in boston 
the issue is how well most laboratories are performing whether 
they will maintain this performance and whether it is good enough 
many experts agree that aids testing is sufficiently accurate 
when used among people who are at increased risk of the disease 
such as homosexual men or drug addicts 
to learn how well it works among people at low risk military 
researchers reviewed 20 months of testing of recruits from rural 
parts of 36 states with low aids rates 
their initial check of the blood of 135187 recruits showed that 
15 were infected when they reexamined the blood of these 15 with 
four different tests they found that one of them was actually free 
of the aids virus the 14 others were in fact infected 
during the study the hiv infection rate among the total 12 
million recruits was 148 per 1000 people the military doctors 
said their latest work suggests that among these people there was 
one false positive result for every 200 truly positive ones 
redfield said the military testing has improved and false 
positives are now probably about one in 1 million 
in the military program blood is initially screened with a 
quick easy test called an elisa if its found to be positive for 
the virus its checked again with the same test 
all blood that turns up positive in both tests is reexamined 
with a more timeconsuming test called a western blot if that 
shows the blood to be infected a new sample is drawn from the 
recruit if this also turns out to be positive on a western blot 
the recruit is considered to be infected with the aids virus 
redfield said he believes that aids testing should be routinely 
performed in venereal disease clinics in drug addiction programs 
during pregnancy exams and when people are admitted to hospitals

the five veteran astronauts who 
flew discovery into space say the most anxious moments of their 
nearly flawless flight came during liftoff a very long 8 
minutes as they remembered the fate of the challenger 
pilot richard covey said tuesday that although he had flown 
before he still was a bit taken aback by the power of the 
rockets that thrust the shuttle into orbit sept 29 
it was a very very long 8 minutes until the main engine 
cut off covey said during the crews first postflight news 
conference at the johnson space center i think we all felt that 
way 
im sure we were all thinking to some degree about the fact 
that the last time this had been attempted it wasnt successful 
you never forget that he said 
the challenger explosion which occurred 73 seconds after 
liftoff on jan 28 1986 and killed all seven astronauts aboard 
was blamed on a faulty booster rocket the rockets were redesigned 
and nasa officials have found no damage in the new boosters 
despite the anxious moments discoverys astronauts praised the 
shuttles performance and its success in putting americans back 
into space 
we can look back on a flight that as far as im concerned was 
picture perfect said discovery commander frederick hauck who 
announced the mission would be his last hauck a navy captain 
said he is considering what he will do next but said he has not 
resigned from the national aeronautics and space administration 
i dont think we have any ghosts hovering above us anymore 
hauck said referring to doubts cast on the space agency because of 
the challenger explosion 
during an appearance today on cbs this morning covey was 
asked how nasa was changed by the discovery mission 
i think the main changes weve seen within nasa are a 
commitment to quality a commitment to safety that we didnt have 
quite as much emphasis on prior to the challenger accident and an 
increase in communications between all the elements of nasa 
covey said 
during the fourday mission hauck covey john m lounge david 
c hilmers and george d pinky nelson deployed a 100 million 
communications satellite tested shuttle systems and conducted 11 
experiments before landing at edwards air force base calif on 
oct 3 
although a detailed account of the mission showed a few minor 
problems including trouble with a cooling system the only 
complaint the astronauts had tuesday concerned the bulky pressure 
suits worn during launch and landing 
while watching a 20minute film about the flight that included 
shots of the astronauts getting into the 75pound suits before 
landing nelson said it hurts just to watch it 
nelson said that although the suits which are part of a new 
escape system are pretty uncomfortable a few modifications 
such as a better fan and a less bulky harness could improve them 
during the mission discoverys crew members broadcast an 
emotional message in memory of the seven challenger astronauts 
while a camera on the shuttle showed a view of the earth 
hilmers who came up with the memorial said he wanted those on 
the ground to see the pictures of earth to help understand why 
others want to travel in space 
i thought at that time we were really linked closely 
together he said i felt a lot closer to the challenger 
victims then than maybe ever before we really wanted to show the 
world that we were standing up there for them and their sacrifice 
wasnt in vain

norways defense chief and one of its 
top computer engineers testified that the sale of norwegian 
technology to the soviet union undermined nato security 
gen vigleik eide said tuesday that the kongsberg vaapenfabrikk 
in a joint venture with toshiba machines co of japan exported 
computerized control systems for milling machinery that allowed the 
soviets to speed up their production of silent submarine 
propellers the general said the stateofthe art technology would 
make it more difficult to detect the vessels 
he made the statements at the trial of bernard john green a 
briton who was the sales manager at kongsberg and who signed the 
contracts that violated western export regulations to east bloc 
countries 
green who has lived in norway since 1975 pleaded innocent to 
charges of lying on the export licence application for the sale he 
argued that the sale completed between 1983 and 1985 was a 
collective decision by the company green 50 faces a maximum 
2year prison term if convicted 
eide said the technology enabled the soviets to more quickly 
equip old and new submariness with such propellers from 1984 to 
1987 the soviets produced 50 propellers with low noise level 
this weakened our possibilities of detecting subs and reduced 
our capability of drawing the right military conclusions in times 
of crisis norways security was damaged eide said 
norway is a member of the north atlantic treaty organization and 
of the parisbased coordination committee for multinational export 
control cocom which regulates trade with the soviet bloc 
the norwegianjapanese joint venture involved the export of 
milling machinery with nine axes which violated cocom regulations 
that only allowed export of twoaxes machine tools 
oeyvind bjoerke who developed hightech data systems for the 
norwegian company told the court he knew the sale violated cocom 
rules and that he discussed it with the company employees 
but bjoerke said the soviets could have acquired similar 
technology from other sources 
they would not have gotten the very best equipment but other 
equipment would not have prevented them from producing the silent 
propellers they needed they may just have needed a little more 
time he said 
when the toshibakongsberg deal was disclosed last year it put a 
strain on usnorwegian relations and prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland apologized to president reagan 
at the time of the sale norway had no law to punish those who 
violated cocom rules but parliament imposed stricter controls last 
year

the us attorneys office today sued state and 
local water resources agencies seeking to force them to end 
pollution of the everglades and lake okeechobee 
the fivecount federal complaint says the agencies have failed 
to protect water quality and prevent water pollution as required by 
state and federal law 
lake okeechobee and the everglades are unique environmental 
treasures said us attorney dexter lehtinen the continued 
degradation of the everglades is a national tragedy 
the suit was filed against the south florida water management 
district the florida department of environmental regulation and 
the heads of those agencies 
lehtinen said the lawsuit seeks to stop water pollution 
throughout the kissimmeeokeechobeeeverglades water system since 
pollution gathered by the system ends up in a national park and a 
national wildlife refuge 
okeechobee the nations largest freshwater lake outside of the 
great lakes has for years been receiving pollution much of it in 
the form of nutrientladen runoffs from dairy farms along the 
kissimmee river valley the river flowing from south of the 
orlando area is a primary source of water for the lake 
in turn water from the lake flows into the loxahatchee national 
wildlife refuge into everglades national park and to the 
waterconservation areas that recharge the biscayne aquifer 
southeastern floridas primary water supply 
both state and federal laws are violated by allowing large 
quantities of polluted water to enter the protected areas lehtinen 
said 
the state and the selfgoverning water district failed to 
maintain legal water quality standards operated pumps without a 
permit and violated their contracts to supply clean water to the 
national parks the suit claims 
lehtinen stressed that the everglades park provides sanctuary to 
rare and endangered species of wildlife including the florida 
panther southern bald eagle woodstork american crocodile and 
cape sable sparrow 
the park requires lownutrient nonpolluted water for the 
survival of the species he said adding that without immediate 
action more and more wetlands will be lost

the fbi has ended its monthlong investigation 
into allegations of a 1978 baby swap at a rural florida hospital 
saying there was no evidence any federal laws were violated an 
agency spokesman said 
we closed our case fbi spokesman russ wood said tuesday 
preliminary investigation failed to establish that there was a 
violation of federal criminal statutes 
wood declined to give details of the inquiry 
the pennsylvania couple who sought the probe ernest and regina 
twigg can ask state law enforcement officers to investigate the 
federal spokesman said adding that option is always available 
the twiggs claim their newborn was stolen at hardee memorial 
hospital in wauchula nearly 10 years ago mrs twigg maintains that 
she gave birth to a healthy girl but hospital workers sent her 
home with a sickly child then altered records to hide the swap 
the couple say genetic blood tests this summer revealed that 
arlena the child they raised was not their real daughter arlena 
suffered from a heart defect and died following surgery aug 23 
never knowing that doubts had been raised about her parentage 
last month the twiggs filed a 100 million suit against the 
hospital and some of its employees and persuaded the fbi to 
investigate to see if federal kidnapping laws had been violated 
records show that during its probe the fbi subpoenaed documents 
from the hospital and interviewed the twiggs they also talked 
with the father of a sarasota girl who the twiggs claim was the 
only other white girl born at hardee memorial during the time mrs 
twigg gave birth 
the girl has not been identified to protect her from publicity 
lavonna vice one of the lawyers representing the twiggs said 
she doesnt know why the federal investigation ended but 
speculated that it might show the child the twiggs claim was stolen 
was not taken out of florida 
federal kidnapping law generally applies to victims taken across 
state line however the law also states that keeping a victim more 
than a day creates a rebuttal presumption that the victim was 
transferred over state lines 
the father of the 9yearold sarasota girl said he doesnt know 
what to think about the fbi departure from the case he said he 
cooperated with the agency and provided them with polygraph tests 
results showing he knew nothing about an alleged swap he claims 
the twiggs of langhorne pa are wrong about his daughters 
identity

senate majority leader robert byrd pleaded 
with his colleagues today to complete work quickly on the 26 
billion drug bill and restrain themselves from trying to be the 
john wayne in the drug war 
byrd dwva indicated that democratic and republican 
lawmakers have so far been unable to try to pare down the more than 
100 amendments that may be introduced meetings were continuing 
but it was uncertain whether the senate would begin debate on the 
electionyear bill today 
speaking on the senate floor byrd cautioned senators against 
introducing amendments aimed at trying to indicate who can be the 
toughest who can be the john wayne in the drug war 
we can all be tough but weve got a good tough bill he 
said 
the legislation would provide additional federal money for 
treatment programs new law enforcement officers and prisons it 
also would allow capital punishment for certain drug offenders who 
commit murder and toughen penalties for drug dealers who sell 
their wares to children 
the wideranging measure would distribute 60 percent of its 
money to prevention and treatment programs and 40 percent to law 
enforcement 
even though the legislation is the joint product of democrats 
and republicans there are some lawmakers who want to strengthen 
it others who want to water it down and still others who wish to 
attach unrelated language to it because it could be the last bill 
congress passes this year 
senators are ready to introduce amendments that would strip the 
death penalty provision from the measure limit the ability of 
prisoners to appeal their sentences on technical grounds permit 
courts to accept some illegally seized evidence and force states to 
conduct drug tests on drivers license applicants 
other amendments would apply sanctions against south africa and 
require containers of alcohol to carry warning labels by some 
counts there are more than 100 amendments waiting in the wings 
the clock is a factor because congress is hoping to adjourn for 
the year at weeks end for the last several days some senators 
and their aides have been trying to see if there is any way to 
limit the number of amendments that would be offered 
the house passed a strong version of the bill sept 22 
containing the death penalty but bearing many other tough 
proposals the senate bill lacks 
one important provision that is absent from both is a mechanism 
for paying for the programs created in the bill even though 14 
billion is supposed to be spent in fiscal year 1989 which began 
oct 1 legislators say the government only has 450 million left 
in its coffers the senate has so far voted down efforts to raise 
taxes or cut other spending programs to provide the missing 950 
million 
even if the senate passes a bill housesenate negotiators will 
have to agree to a compromise version before it can be sent to 
president reagan for his signature

president gustav husak today 
appointed a new government after the premier and his cabinet 
resigned in a shakeup expected to slow the pace of reform 
husak appointed a new 20member government including ladislav 
adamec to replace lubomir strougal as the federal premier the 
staterun ctk news agency said the appointments amounted to a 
rubber stamp of selections made tuesday by the communist partys 
central committee 
strougal a key advocate of speedy economic and social reform 
was premier for 18 years he resigned monday during a meeting of 
the central committee and also gave up his seat on the partys 
ruling politburo 
adamec 62 was premier of the czech republic one of the 
nations two republics he is expected to be less insistent on 
speedy reform than strougal the czech republics parliament today 
chose frantisek pitra to replace adamec as the republics premier 
ctk said 
the new government requires approval by the federal assembly or 
parliament scheduled to meet in november it was not immediately 
clear what became of a caretaker government that was appointed 
tuesday 
speeches published after the central committee meeting made 
clear that party leaders favor reforms but resist radical changes 
in the economy such as tampering with the socialist linchpin 
central planning 
warning of the potential for high inflation and unemployment 
under rapid reform the leadership backed personnel changes aimed 
at pursuing a slower road to restructuring than that of the soviets 
strougal 63 was known to have championed thorough economic 
reform similar to those being carried out in the soviet union under 
president mikhail s gorbachev but strougals plans for innovative 
changes were watered down by party conservatives 
adamecs main advantage appears to be that in the eyes of many 
he is not associated with the brutal suppression that occurred 
during the socalled crisis years of 196869 when thenparty 
chief alexander dubcek was purged in the wake of a sovietled 
invasion 
party chief milos jakes chief ideologist jan fojtik and a 
resolution published tuesday made it clear that political change 
like that in the soviet union has been ruled out for some time to 
come 
fojtik denounced the radicalism of unidentified people in 
czechoslovakia who are calling for a drastic reform with 
bankruptcies and unemployment rapid growth of prices of 
foodstuffs rents and of inflation 
fojtik told reporters we put emphasis on the leading role of 
the communist party of czechoslovakia in carrying out the 
restructuring process 
the economic reform is aimed at strengthening socialist 
ownership relations said fojtik 
as he met reporters fojtik claimed strougal does not feel 
healthy is tired and is not really able to master the many 
difficult task of premiership 
fojtik indicated that strougal left the political scene in 
anger saying he will not even head the caretaker government 
fojtik and jakes also stressed that despite some cautious 
opening up in the arts the party remains firmly opposed to 
political liberalization let alone the recognition of dissident 
and nonconformist political and ecological groups 
without naming countries the ideologist who took over the 
party portfolio from hardline politburo member vasil bilak now in 
charge of foreign policy said prague leaders are discouraged and 
in fact appalled by reform setbacks in hungary and poland 
fojtik outlined some government changes tuesday 
he said jaromir johanes first deputy foreign minister and a 
former ambasssador to canada and the united states was nominated 
to be the new foreign minister replacing bohuslav chnoupek 
five new members ages 43 to 56 were added to the central 
committee politburo and strougal and peter colotka stepped down 
colotka also resigned as premier of the slovakia republic 
ctk said he was replaced by ivan knotek 52 a newcomer to the 
politburo

hundreds of thousands of books were destroyed in two 1986 arson 
blazes 
because the building is undergoing extensive renovation no 
books were in the library when the fire broke out tuesday however 
authorities feared that smoke from the basement blaze may have 
again damaged the structures huge murals 
as firefighters wearing air tanks vented smoke from the 
62yearold library an arson investigator would say only that the 
blaze was under investigation

donald manning 
a passerby reported the fire at 517 pm and it was declared 
extinguished a halfhour later said assistant fire chief gerald 
johnson the blaze was confined to paper and wood construction 
material in an 8by25foot basement room 
the work being done in that room involved removal of ceiling 
tiles containing asbestos the presence of the hazardous material 
worried firefighters and prevented library officials from 
immediately entering afterward to assess the damage

democrat michael dukakis pitched economic nationalism while 
republican george bush accused his rival of adopting a 
protectionist stance strictly for political gain as the two 
presidential candidates finetuned their strategy for their second 
and final debate 
the vice president embarking on a weeklong west coast swing 
highlighted by thursdays debate in los angeles told business 
students at seattle university on tuesday that dukakis opposed 
protectionist demagoguery during the democratic primaries 
but now for political reasons he sees advantage in stoking 
fears about foreign influence bush said 
dukakis vowed that the democratic ticket would be aggressive 
advocates for us companies and workers 
together we can build a future where the best products in the 
world are designed by american minds built by american hands and 
produce good profits and good paychecks here on american soil 
the massachusetts governor told a partisan crowd at tufts 
university in medford mass 
later tuesday dukakis responded to bushs charges im for 
more trade not less trade i want to export american products not 
american jobs 
like bush dukakis was in california today conferring with 
advisers and doing some lastminute studying of briefing papers for 
the nationally broadcast 90minute debate set to begin at 9 pm 
edt at pauley pavilion on the ucla campus 
neither candidate planned any campaign appearances today to 
devote their time to debate preparation 
bush was working with former deputy treasury secretary richard 
g darman who was dukakis standin for a mock debate the vice 
president had saturday said press secretary sheila tate 
bush was taking a short break this morning to meet with los 
angeles police chief daryl gates 
one final detail for the candidates facetoface confrontation 
was decided tuesday when the bipartisan commission on presidential 
debates selected the moderator and three questioners 
ann compton of abc andrea mitchell of nbc and margaret warner 
of newsweek will quiz the candidates and bernard shaw of cable 
news network will serve as moderator 
cbs anchorman dan rather declined an invitation to be a panelist 
the first question will go to dukakis and bush will deliver the 
final closing statement a reversal of the first debate said bob 
neuman a spokesman for the commission 
the latest polls indicated that the race remains close raising 
the political stakes for the primetime debate 
a gallup organization survey showed bush leading dukakis 49 
percent to 43 percent among 1007 registered voters questioned 
friday through sunday while a harris poll of 1355 likely voters 
thursday through monday had the lead at only 50 percent to 48 
percent given the polls margins of sampling error four points 
for gallup and three for harris the race appeared virtually even 
among 748 likely voters gallup found bush ahead 5241 percent 
but the organization stressed the closer result saying it was too 
soon to gauge likelihood of voting 
as in other polls democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen was seen as having decisively beaten republican dan quayle 
in their debate last week 
quayle returned to indiana on tuesday to a rousing hometown 
reception where he delivered some fighting words for his candidacy 
borrowed from the late president harry s truman and revolutionary 
war hero john paul jones 
we plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen in the 
end well get the job done we have just begun to fight the 
indiana senator told cheering supporters 
the crowd erupted when quayle proclaimed youre looking at 
the next vice president of the united states 
quayle was traveling to rapid city sd and great falls 
mont later today where he was expected to talk about his role in 
coauthoring the 1982 job training partnership act 
bentsen was campaigning this afternoon in columbia mo and 
fayetteville ark 
the democratic vice presidential candidate again ridiculed 
bushs selection of quayle noting that the gop nominee has 
suggested that in his administration the indiana senator would head 
the drug interdiction effort 
george bush wants us to follow dan quayle into battle 
bentsen told a rally at a philadelphia union hall on tuesday 
ill tell you ive been in combat and ill pass on that one 
if george bush is serious about being president why would he 
choose dan quayle for being vice president 
while in seattle bush vowed to crack down on whitecollar crime 
as he told the universitys business students he would throw the 
book at insider traders and other whitecollar criminals 
they may not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits but 
they are a real danger to society and they should be hit with the 
maximum penalties of the law he said 
bushs most pointed attack however was on his rivals 
protectionist stand 
my opponent needs an issue and hes willing to scare people 
to find it the vice president said 
bushs speech at the roman catholic college was interrupted by a 
jesuit priest who was forcibly removed after he shouted his 
objections to reagan administration policies the priest said he 
was given a citation for criminal trespassing 
dukakis in his appearance on a college campus pledged to 
restore american leadership in space and technology and as a result 
see the nation take the lead in global markets 
the democratic nominee said the gop ticket was satisfied with 
today and complacent about tomorrow symbolized by its new theme 
song dont worry be happy

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
oct 10 
kennebec journal augusta maine on the gasguzzler boom 
last week secretary of transportation james h burnley 
announced that his department had again caved in to the demands of 
the countrys top two automakers and waived fuel economy 
requirements for 1989 automobiles 
meanwhile a new poll suggests that 90 percent of the public 
believes government should require automakers to build more 
fuelefficient cars 
the survey respondents know something the department of 
transportation apparently doesnt 
oil may be cheap and plentiful at the moment but the situation 
cant last so it makes sense to keep producing more fuelefficient 
cars and cutting hazardous air pollution in the bargain 
gm and ford arent doing that since the reagan administration 
signaled its willingness to agree to any figure the big automakers 
came up with theyve put efficiency on the back burner 
strenuously pushing a new generation of muscle cars for which 
they have little foreign competition 
that may boost profits in the short term but makes little sense 
in the long run precisely the condition the government fuel 
standards were supposed to address

the seattle times on sheltering the homeless 
the federal governments benign neglect in evaluating surplus 
government property that could be suitable for sheltering the 
homeless has been given a needed jolt by a united states district 
court judge in washington dc 
it has been 15 months since congress passed and president reagan 
signed the mckinney homeless assistance act a piece of legislation 
that has been strangled in part by bureaucratic inaction 
among other things the act requires federal agencies to turn 
over buildings and land suitable for sorely needed shelters to 
local governments and nonprofit agencies implementation of the 
act has lagged ludicrously 
the judge lamented 
pitifully few of the numerous unused federal properties are 
being evaluated for their suitability to assist the homeless and 
those that are found to be suitable are not being made available 
it defies logic that only a dozen surplus federal properties 
exist across the country as possible shelters for an estimated 3 
million homeless americans

los angeles daily news on george bush michael dukakis and the 
aclu 
george bush may turn out to be the best friend the american 
civil liberties union has had since the redbaiting sen joe 
mccarthy bush has made the aclu into a cause celebre 
the day after the first presidential debate at which bush 
quoted an earlier remark by michael dukakis that the democratic 
presidential nominee is a cardcarrying member of the aclu 
the organizations president told the new york times that the group 
had gotten hundreds of phone calls from people interested in 
joining 
dan quayle may call the aclu the criminal defendants best 
friend but since people in this country are innocent until 
proven guilty they are allowed a few friends 
there is no better safeguard in this country against abusive 
prosecution than a pack of experienced aclu lawyers 
that said we feel free to censure the other side of the aclu 
that side is highly political seemingly paranoid about the 
supposed danger of religion in public life and overzealous in 
looking for infringements on socalled free speech 
of course if anyone is to blame for the superficiality of the 
aclu debate it is bush for ignoring the groups beneficial side 
and dukakis for defending the organization as if its politics were 
irrelevant

owatonna minn peoples press on the league of women voters 
withdrawal from presidential debate sponsorship 
hurrah for the league of women voters 
rather than putting up with another staged event the league 
withdrew its sponsorship of the second presidential debate of this 
campaign 
the leagues decision is the first honest call of this campaign 
anyone who witnessed the first presidential debate knows the 
candidates were more interested in their appearance than the 
substance of their answers 
the league likened the debates to the ever growing list of 
campaign charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest 
answers to tough questions we wholeheartedly agree 
this campaign has been one staged event after another enough is 
enough its time for the candidates to put the issues before their 
wardrobes 
maybe the leagues decision will bring these candidates back 
into the real world not the one their campaign advisers have 
carefully staged these past few months 
certainly the voters deserve as much

waco texas tribuneherald on the vice presidential debate 
by all criteria style or substance lloyd bentsen was a 
lopsided winner in the vice presidential debate dan quayles 
only claim was that he was still standing call it a technical 
knockout 
sure bentsen overplayed the need for a tough trade policy 
a trade war perhaps as a miracle cure for the american economy 
but in other policy matters like welfare reform the environment 
and defense burdensharing by american allies he was resonant 
bentsen was perhaps most convincing in explaining that he can 
differ in degree with michael dukakis on contra aid which he 
favors and dukakis opposes bentsen criticized the reagan 
administration for banking so heavily on military force that 
regional diplomacy is disregarded outright 
bentsen was also right on the shaky foundations of reaganomics 
an economy propped up by foreign debt and deficit spending 200 
billion in hot checks quayle was left to give a testimonial to 
foreign entrepreneurs 
dukakis still has a lot of convincing to do to show his mettle 
as a leader but bentsens performance helps him a lot 
the senator from texas came off as a real dukakis asset a man 
of competence and moderation

charleston wva daily mail on prison furloughs 
some good is coming out of the presidential race michael 
dukakis defense of a furlough program for felons is causing such 
programs to undergo closer examination by the general public 
it is insane to allow violent criminals to roam free before they 
complete their prison sentences such releases needlessly place the 
lawabiding public in jeopardy 
the willie horton case in massachusetts is a good example of 
this not only was horton bad news before he was convicted he 
violated prison rules while inside the administration that allowed 
this man to be freed is outandout incompetent 
it was also wrong of circuit judge larry starcher to end due 
process and capriciously free 56 inmates from the huttonsville 
wva prison in 1986 already seven of those men have returned 
to prison for crimes that wouldnt have been committed had they 
been behind bars where judges and juries sent them 
efforts to alleviate prison crowding need to be a little more 
careful than this these experiments have endangered the civil 
rights of innocent citizens both in west virginia and 
massachusetts

effect the head of the us environmental protection agency is 
saying that isnt enough epa administrator lee thomas wants 
complete elimination 
hes right if the danger is as dire as thomas says and there 
seems little reason to doubt him the treaty should be amended 
the united states should lead the way with legislation 
establishing a timetable for a complete ban in this country on the 
manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that are 
believed to be breaking down the ozone layer high above the earth 
the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons and the development of 
acceptable substitutes should proceed apace destruction of the 
ozone layer which screens out ultraviolet rays that are harmful to

by solidifying his grasp on the kremlin apparatus and conferring 
on himself the trappings as well as substance of power mikhail s 
gorbachev comes to resemble more closely the soviet dictators whose 
mistakes he vows to undo 
to combat the terrifying legacy of josef stalin become the next 
stalin to stamp out the stultifying cult of leonid brezhnevs 
personality raise mikhail s gorabachev onto the pedestal 
it is not really so surprising gorbachev is a russian and a 
communist if he sends journalistic lances to prick the balloons of 
stalins reputation there is no debunking vladimir i lenin the 
sources and legitimacy of power as gorabachev exercises them are 
those that lenin erected 
there is no doubting gorbachevs desire to liberate the 
creativity of the soviet peoples by freeing them from red tape and 
shackles of inherited practice 
in the interest of economic productivity at the base of state 
and political power he clearly intends reforms and liberations 
that have a greaterthaneconomic dimension extending into the 
intellectual and even spiritual spheres however distasteful some 
of that may be to gorbachev himself 
but to impose this on fourth generaton bureaucrats the party 
functionaries raised by brezhnev for their limited vision and 
unlimited loyalty gorbachev requires unhindered cooperation at the 
top unbrooked by opposition 
diversity pluralism separation and balance of powers whatever 
their virtue lower in the hierarchies still have no place in the 
summit of soviet power the general secretary proceeds as his 
predecessors have he knows no other way

in lebanon 
the release of one hostage in lebanon has made inevitable a 
spate of more or less informed surmise about when others may be

inevitable too has been speculation as to a whether the 
action resulted from a secret administration deal with iran to let 
a hostage go before the election and b whether we can expect an 
october surprise meant to influence the elections outcome 
as to when other hostages may be released the short answer is 
that no one can confidently say 
the iranians may be trying to sway american voters but this is 
not certain 
overt activity by the administration that might be interpreted 
as dealing with terrorists can probably be ruled out

the chattanooga tenn times on withdrawal of the minimum wage 
bill 
a republicanled filibuster against legislation to raise the 
minimum wage recently forced withdrawal of the bill from 
consideration 
the same day the republican filibuster prevailed the senate 
budget committees democratic staff released a damning report on 
jobs and wages the report showed that half of the new jobs created 
over the past nine years dont pay enough to keep a family of four 
above the poverty level 
republicans did introduce a cynical substitute to the 
democratic bill creation of a subminimum wage to be paid certain 
workers mostly teenagers during their first three months on the 
job 
its purpose was not clear unless it was to suggest that 
teenagers dont need or dont deserve the minimum wage it 
that sounds reasonable look around at various fast food outlets 
that employ mostly teenagers they are having to pay more than 
minimum wage just to attract and retain those employees 
through their filibuster the republicans reiterated support for 
their familiar trickle down theory in this case the only 
thing trickling down was contempt for the least fortunate in 
americas work force

the honolulu advertiser on the chile plebiscite 
chile has rejected its strongarm dictator of 15 years through a 
plebiscite that was noteworthy for its high voter turnout and 
neartotal absence of complaints of fraud or trouble at the polls 
credit goes to chiles people who seemed determined not to let 
anything get in the way of their first vote on the presidency in 18 
years 
but some credit is also due general augusto pinochet who so far 
has stood by his pledge to honor the election outcome

the milwaukee journal on traffic problems at chicago airports 
reacting to a growing number of mistakes by air traffic 
controllers the federal aviation administration last week cut 
peakhour landings at chicagos two major airports ohare and 
midway 
ohare has a dismal record of controller efficiency the airport 
has been the subject of three investigations by the national 
transportation safety board in the last two years 
the boards most recent report two months ago said among other 
things that controllers at ohare are undertrained and overworked 
that suggests part of the remedy hiring and training more 
controllers 
but that will take time and money fortunately there is a 
quicker cheaper remedy to chicagos airline congestion greater 
use of milwaukees mitchell airport 
this uptodate airport can be reached almost as quickly from 
some of chicagos northern suburbs as midway or even ohare and 
passengers are less apt to be stuck in a holding pattern at or over 
mitchell because it is underused

the cabinet minister in charge of law 
and order today suggested crime could be reduced by putting 
electronic tags on people freed on bail and by widening a ban on 
drinking outdoors 
britains crime rate dominated debate on the second day of the 
conservative partys annual convention in the southern coastal 
resort of brighton 
the convention has been marked by massive security when the 
governing party last met in brighton in 1984 a bomb planted by the 
irish republic army killed five people and narrowly missed the 
prime minister 
government statistics in march indicated a 12 percent increase 
in muggings and other violent crime in england and wales last year 
and an 11 percent increase in sexual offenses 
about 39 million crimes were reported to police in england and 
wales in 1987 up 45000 from 1986 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member in charge of law 
and order said the government would attack crime with more police 
officers a possible widening of the public drinking ban and the 
electronic tagging system 
but hurd once again rejected capital punishment saying dont 
lets get stuck just in this groove 
capital punishment cant be the answer to all crime or even 
to violent crime in general he said 
capital punishment was abolished in britain in 1969 but an 
overwhelming majority of conservative delegates raised their hands 
in favor of its reinstatement in an unofficial convention poll 
hurd said that if the experiment with electronic tagging works 
it could be expanded to monitor the movements of convicted 
offenders 
the apparatus is relatively simple hurd explained it 
looks like an electronic bicycle clip and it works if this 
project proves successful then we shall take the idea further 
roy hattersley deputy leader of the socialist opposition labor 
party on tuesday condemned prime minister margaret thatchers 
philosophy of individual selfreliance and her determination to 
reduce what she calls the dependency culture based on state aid 
the idea that the tories are the party of law and order is 
clearly nonsense hattersley said 
the new tory philosophy openly undermines the rule of law it 
is openly the party of callous individualism mrs thatchers 
values and mrs thatchers example lie at the heart of our 
increasingly violent society it is mrs thatcher who has 
encouraged the cult of selfishness he charged 
legislator teddy taylor a leading law and order activist on the 
right wing of the conservative party called at a fringe meeting in 
brighton on tuesday for a crusade on crime backed by stiffer 
penalties and deterrents 
after nine years of conservative government people are 
entitled to say the time has come for decisive action he said

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle said today he was not mad at anybody in the bush 
campaign but would take a greater role in running his own 
campaign from now on 
i am my own handler quayle told reporters as he left 
indianapolis if you have any questions ask me 
quayle had previously expressed irritation at unidentified bush 
aides who have been quoted anonymously as saying he was a liability 
to the gop ticket 
the indiana senator complained about the sniping over the 
weekend to bush campaign chairman james baker iii but quayle said 
there was no animosity between him and top campaign officials 
im not mad at anybody in the bush campaign he said im 
going to coordinate with them theyre going to suggest things that 
i say suggesting that i do and im going to take that under 
consideration 
quayle said he did not anticipate any campaign staff changes 
but if i can find any of those leakers i think there will be 
staff changes 
he described his conversation with baker as cordial and said 
reporters would hear him say whats on my mind in the future 
quayle ended a successful midwestern campaign swing tuesday with 
a promise in his home state to keep on fighting 
we plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen in the 
end well get the job done we have just begun to fight quayle 
shouted as supporters cheered 
to the partisan crowd the indiana senator could do no wrong 
although dukakis supporters mounted a small protest outside the 
rally site quayle has said he expects to be a prime target of the 
democrats and that he is happy to be the lightning rod for the 
campaign 
quayle travels to south dakota and montana today as he makes his 
way west 
but his reception probably wont top the one he received here 
where supporters cheered wildly as he stood before them and said 
youre looking at the next vice president of the united states 
welcome home dan they shouted as he worked the crowd 
shaking hands while a band played back home in indiana 
the welcome did not extend to reporters traveling with quayle 
the crowd chanted just say no as the press entourage arrived 
indiana was the scene of one of the more notorious news 
conferences of the quayle campaign as he and george bush held a 
rally in quayles hometown of huntington the day after the 
republican convention 
reporters were booed and denounced with shouts of boring as 
they tried to question quayle about his national guard service 
tuesdays campaign events had a vastly more calming tone than 
that day in august quayle rode through ohio on a winding bus tour 
through pastoral farm land attacking democrat michael dukakis as 
soft on crime one of the republicans favorite themes 
quayle was portrayed by speaker after speaker as a son of the 
heartland and he told flagwaving crowds that their staunch 
midwestern values would be preserved under a george bush presidency 
right and wrong is at the very core of life in this beloved 
midwest region that i grew up in and where you live he said 
the values of this region have not left me 
he spoke of the importance of ohio which has 23 electoral votes 
and is viewed as a swing state in november 
and in napoleon ohio quayle delivered the campaigns response 
to the democratic presidential candidates outrage at the way the 
bushquayle ticket was portraying the massachusetts furlough 
program and the escape of convicted murderer willie horton jr who 
attacked a maryland couple while on the lam 
dukakis had said during the weekend that he resented being 
portrayed as insensitive to the plight of crime victims and noted 
that members of his own family had been victimized in the past 
dukakis also noted that people such as horton who had been 
sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole could 
not be furloughed under current state law 
but quayle took issue with dukakis defense of what quayle said 
was his sorry record of dealing with violent crime 
he has not truly and sincerely owned up to his irresponsible 
conduct quayle said

american fbi agents seized 6 million 
worth of paintings during a reent search of the estate of ferdinand 
marcos soninlaw in california a senior philippine official said 
today 
mateo caparas chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government told reporters he expects us authorities to turn over 
the paintings to the philippine government because they know the 
works of art were bought with the filipino peoples money 
in a related development caparas said marcos ousted president 
of the philippines could still face criminal charges in the 
philippines even if he enters a plea bargain with us authorities 
and surrenders some of his fortune 
but caparas indicated the goverment of president corazon aquino 
may delay filing criminal charges against marcos so that us 
authorities can procede with their own prosecution of the ousted 
president 
our national interest requires that we do not permit our 
filing of criminal charges here to be used as an excuse by mr 
marcos to escape his indictment abroad said caparas speaking on 
authority of mrs aquino 
the move followed reports that state department legal officer 
abraham sofaer recommended marcos be offered a deal under which he 
would avoid prison by surrendering millions of dollars he allegedly 
embezzled during his 20year rule marcos has not been indicted 
the possible charges concern allegations of the fraudulent 
purchase of real estate and art objects 
caparas told reporters the paintings recovered in california 
were part of the samuels collection which disappeared from the new 
york apartment of marcos wife imelda 
other paintings were recovered in paris after they were 
allegedly smuggled out of the united states by saudi arabian 
businessman adnan khashoggi a close friend of the marcoses 
marcos and his wife have lived in hawaii since he was ousted 
from power in a civilianmilitary uprising in february 1986 
i just talked with our lawyer in the united states and he said 
that when about 50 agents searched the home of greggy araneta they 
found paintings belonging to the samuels collection caparas told 
reporters araneta and his wife irene who is marcos daughter 
live in woodside a small community south of san francisco 
in san francisco us attorney joseph russoniello said a van 
was used to haul away the paintings sculptures ming dynasty vases 
and antique furniture the raid was carried out by the fbi and 
customs and irs agents under a search warrant 
the fbi confirmed last week that agents searched the home and 
other buildings on aranetas estate on thursday 
we expect that paintings would be turned over to us like the 
paintings that were recovered in france caparas said we have 
long been saying that those paintings were purchased with the 
filipino peoples money 
caparas said he was leaving for new york today to look into the 
status of four manhattan buildings allegedly owned by the marcoses 
and which the commission is trying to recover 
the couple has not admitted ownership of the buildings which 
are now subject to litigation 
caparas said he expects to be in new york for three or four 
weeks and then will go to switzerland where his commission is 
trying to recover billions of dollars in secret bank accounts 
allegedly belonging to the marcoses 
president corazon aquino created the commission shortly after 
she assumed power in february 1986 to recover billions of dollars 
the deposed president and his family and friends allegedly 
plundered 
filipino officials have filed 39 civil suits against marcos to 
recover 967 billion but no criminal charges have been lodged 
against him in the philippines for fear he might demand his 
constitutional right to return home to face his accusers in court 
philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia but officials fear 
his return may spark violence

a referendum on marylands pioneering handgun 
law has provoked a bitter fight between progun forces and the 
states political establishment that could turn the tide on the 
issue nationwide 
voters will decide nov 8 whether to keep the tough law passed 
this spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as saturday night 
specials 
still smarting from congressional rejection last month of a bill 
requiring a sevenday waiting period before anyone can obtain a 
handgun gun control advocates hope a yes vote in maryland will 
rally their movement and provide encouragement for gun control 
battles in the new jersey and florida legislatures 
the campaign has embroiled the national rifle association state 
gun clubs the roman catholic church the black community most 
major law enforcement officials and gov william donald schaefer in 
a struggle characterized by charges of racism and misrepresentation 
there is a sort of tidal effect that comes and goes on issues 
like this said michael beard director of the national coalition 
to ban handguns if they the nra lose a couple of battles then 
they lose a lot of their power 
the nra has devoted 3 million to the repeal effort outspending 
the laws supporters by 101 
either way it goes its going to have some impacts in other 
states if its lost it doesnt mean other states are automatically 
going to follow suit weve been successful in blocking other 
attempts but it would be an impetus said richard gardiner the 
nras assistant general counsel 
barbara lautman spokeswoman for handgun control inc charged 
the referendum has become a test of how much money it will take 
the nra to distort the truth if we lose in maryland it will mean 
that once again the nras millions won out over common sense 
the laws supporters are counting on the vigorous support of 
schaefer and other wellknown marylanders schaefer has taped 
television spots that denounce the nra for interference 
four other states have laws banning cheap handguns illinois 
minnesota south carolina and hawaii but marylands is unique 
because it doesnt define what constitutes a saturday night 
special leaving that task to a ninemember board appointed by the 
governor 
the handgun roster board is required to compile a list of 
handguns with legitimate recreation and personal security uses that 
may be sold in the state after jan 1 1990 the law also bans the 
new breed of mostly plastic guns that cant be detected by security 
devices in airports and courthouses 
the board has become the major substantive issue in the debate 
with opponents contending it would have authority to outlaw all 
handguns a charge supporters say is false 
charges of racism have been leveled against the progun forces 
who are appealing to black voters with the argument that banning 
cheap handguns would deprive the poor of their right to protect 
themselves against crime 
the most rev john h ricard a leading black roman catholic 
clergyman in baltimore described the tactic as a poorly veiled 
attempt to pit blacks against the majority thats offensive to all 
citizens this ugly racist campaign thrust should be ended at 
once 
the catholic church has been criticized for its highprofile 
support for the law one progun leader urged parishioners to drop 
spent bullet cartridges in collection baskets to protest the 
churchs stance there were no reports of anyone doing so 
among the lawenforcement leaders endorsing the gun ban are 
attorney general j joseph curran secretary of public safety 
bishop l robinson the state branch of the fraternal order of 
police and associations of state troopers sheriffs and chiefs of 
police 
george young the california political consultant directing the 
repeal campaign summed up the opposition argument americans 
have an inalienable right to self defense the right of people 
to purchase the handgun of their choice history tells us you lose 
your rights in increments this is an increment we intend to 
oppose

university of north dakota officials say 
theyll accept a 5 million endowment from a las vegas hotel owner 
who threw adolf hitler birthday parties for his employees 
concluding he meant them only as a joke 
a delegation from the school flew to nevada on sunday and met 
with ralph engelstad 58 a onetime university of north dakota 
hockey player who owns the imperial palace hotel and casino the 
trip was prompted by disclosures about engelstads private 
collection of nazi memorabilia housed at the hotel and the hitler 
parties 
i dont think the world war ii collection that we saw is a 
problem in itself said barry vickrey associate dean of the 
university law school the bigger problem is some of ralph 
engelstads actions most notably the hitler parties which have 
given the whole collection a sinister context 
our delegation seemed to conclude that his motives were 
unthinking and thats not good vickrey said but we werent 
able to conclude that he was antisemitic or prohitler 
the collection includes a portrait of hitler which has that 
unfortunate to ralphie from adolf on there said dave 
vorland executive assistant to the universitys president 
engelstad explained the fake inscription as a joke according to 
the star tribune of minneapolis 
engelstad also admits hanging an artists portrait of himself as 
a nazi at a hitler party again as a joke 
officials said the university in grand forks nd doesnt plan 
to turn down engelstads money and wont change the name of the 
ralph engelstad arena formerly the winter sports center but the 
universitys president thomas clifford added that the university 
is watching the controversy for any new developments and were 
keeping our options open 
engelstad pledged the 5 million endowment to benefit the 
schools hockey program and has already given 500000 
details about the hitler parties and other elements surfaced 
during an investigation by the nevada gaming control commission 
in a statement delivered at a news conference last week the 
hotel owner said he threw hitler birthday parties this year and in 
1986 to boost employee morale at the casino 
looking for an excuse i suggested one with adolfs birthday 
as a theme he said it wasnt meant to honor hitler 
i cant tell you how much i regret my insensitivity on this 
point it was innocent but it was very very bad judgment i 
deeply regret it and apologize for it i despise hitler and 
everything he stood for 
at one of the hitler parties engelstad handed out tshirts 
depicting nazi battle scenes as favors said clifford 
he said it wasnt the brightest idea he ever had clifford 
said but i dont think it had anything to do with neonazism it 
was just a bad joke bad taste 
in a letter to the jewish federation of las vegas engelstad 
said he now plans to sell his collection of cars and other world 
war ii axis memorabilia

king fahd of saudi arabia says he 
wishes iran had sent a delegation to a meeting of islamic 
information ministers the latest saudi overture aimed at easing 
bitter differences among moslem nations 
fahds signal to iran came at the opening of the conference 
attended by information ministers from about 45 islamic nations 
i would have wished the iranian delegation to be with us 
fahd said in a speech tuesday iran is an islamic country and 
deep in my heart i would have loved to see my iranian brothers here 
today 
irans culture is persian and most of its people belong to the 
minority shiite branch of islam most arabs belong to the sunni 
branch 
a leading islamic spokesman meanwhile assailed western news 
media for their reporting on islamic matters 
the image of the muslim people in the world has been 
stereotyped as backward ignorant fundamentalist and lacking 
culture and civilization said sharifuddin pirzada of pakistan 
secretarygeneral of the islamic conference organization 
saudi arabia is hosting the information ministers conference in 
this port city on the red sea officials said the gathering was 
aimed at improving the flow of information among islamic countries 
and enhancing the image of islam in the nonmuslim world 
fahd told delegates islamic countries had to show the world 
their faith was based on peace and stability 
his gesture to iran was the clearest in a series of recent saudi 
overtures it comes as tehran seeks to improve relations with both 
arab and western nations after the aug 20 ceasefire in the 
8yearold war with iraq 
the saudis broke off diplomatic relations with tehran april 26 
after accusing the tehran regime of carrying out sabotage 
subversion and terrorism against saudi arabia kuwait and other 
arab states 
the kings remarks came a week after the saudi government 
executed four saboteurs it said were working on irans behalf 
iran condemned the executions and accused saudi arabia and other 
gulf arab states of producing more oil than the quotas set by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to drive down oil 
prices to weaken tehran 
pirzadas attack on western news media delivered in a closed 
session was not reported in detail by the official saudi press 
agency but a partial transcript was obtained by the associated 
press 
he said the international media are mostly unaware of and 
indifferent to the realities of the islamic world 
at times they are actively hostile and indifferent toward our 
faith our cultural heritage our objectives of socioeconomic 
development and our efforts to safeguard our independence he 
said 
pirzada said news reports from western agencies none of which 
he named either ignore or deliberately distort and undermine the 
just causes of the muslims 
our faith is villified our culture sneered at our 
difficulties magnified and our peoples governments and 
institutions subjected to misrepresentation ridicule and 
censure he said

a prosecution witness in the divorcefixing 
trial of bess myerson admitted under crossexamination that a 
lawyer for the other side in the divorce case also did a favor for 
the judges daughter 
miss myerson a former miss america and city cultural affairs 
commissioner is accused of giving a city job to the daughter of 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel in exchange for 
favorable rulings in the divorce of miss myersons lover carl 
andy capasso 
testimony by mrs gabels law secretary resumed today at federal 
court in manhattan with the judges daughter expected to take the 
stand later in the day 
under questioning today by assistant us attorney stuart 
abrams the law secretary howard leventhal amended his previous 
testimony about when mrs capassos lawyer got an apartment for the 
judges daughter 
on tuesday leventhal said he didnt remember exactly when the 
apartment had been obtained but questioning by defense lawyers 
left the impression that mrs capassos lawyer had done an innocent 
favor for mrs gabels daughter while the judge was considering 
issues in the divorce case 
to the best of my knowledge leventhal said today the 
lawyers help came after justice gabels completing her rulings 
in the capassos case 
the lawyer raoul felder said tuesday that he helped miss gabel 
find an apartment in 1986 by which time the capasso case was 
ancient history felder is not accused of any wrongdoing 
on tuesday leventhal also testified that miss myerson called 
the judges private line several times while mrs gabel was 
deciding whether to cut capassos weekly support payments to his 
estranged wife 
according to the prosecution witness mrs gabel apparently did 
not tell lawyers in the divorce trial about the myerson phone calls 
when the judge offered to excuse herself from the case after a 
newspaper article revealed that miss myerson had hired the judges 
daughter 
but under crossexamination by mrs gabels lawyer leventhal 
said that mrs gabel readily told him miss myerson was the 
mysterious person calling and identifying herself as barbara 
robinson or barbara goodman 
did she the judge react in panic when you asked that 
question asked feldberg 
no not at all said leventhal she reacted in a jocular 
manner 
miss myerson is accused of giving a 19000ayear city job to 
sukhreet gabel who was then 34 shortly after miss myerson became 
cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 the prosecution alleges the 
former beauty queen wanted to get the judge to reduce capassos 
temporary support payments 
mrs gabel also did not tell the divorce lawyers that felder 
helped sukhreet gabel obtain an apartment leventhal testified 
under questioning by the judges defense attorney michael feldberg 
on sept 14 1983 mrs gabel cut capassos weekly temporary 
alimony and child support payments from 1850 to 680 a week

republican george bush claiming he was 
politically stronger than during his first debate with democratic 
rival michael dukakis said today he would show americans what my 
heartbeat is when he tangles with dukakis again thursday night 
the vice president said he was ready for the final nationally 
broadcast campaign debate which starts at 9 pm edt thursday on 
the ucla campus 
we do tend to be a little stronger politically these days but 
what i want to do is have them viewers understand what my 
heartbeat is what i really care about he told reporters at a 
breakfast meeting with los angeles police chief daryl gates a 
republican supporter 
asked about his goals for the next debate bush replied its 
less statistics than it is how i would like to lead this 
country where id like to see us by the 90s so i want to spell it 
out in a broader sense this time let the others nitpick on all 
these little numbers 
he said he would keep portraying dukakis as a liberal he 
cannot run away from his past the vice president said 
bush spent most of the day working with debate coach richard g 
darman the former deputy treasury secretary who played the role of 
dukakis for the first presidential debate sept 25 and studying 
briefing papers alone 
other debate coaches including media adviser roger ailes were 
arriving later today 
the relatively quiet day in los angeles comes on the heels of a 
seattle appearance tuesday that was disrupted by a shouting jesuit 
priest 
the rev bill bichsel who works with the homeless in tacoma 
wash was forcibly removed from the hall by police after he stood 
up in the audience and yelled out his objections to reagan 
administration policies 
his words could not be heard clearly over the loud public 
address system bush was using and the vice president continued 
speaking at one point bush stopped and took note of the protester 
isnt this a great country you can run into all kinds of 
characters in my line of work this ones amazing he said 
bichsel said he was given a citation for criminal trespassing 
and was released a police spokesman in seattle was unavailable for 
comment 
bush continued to pound out the anticrime theme that his 
advisers have targeted as a votegetter in the waning weeks of the 
campaign but the focus tuesday was on whitecollar crime 
bush told the audience of seattle university business students 
he would throw the book at whitecollar criminals as hard as we 
throw it at other criminals 
the fact is that most of the people on wall street are honest 
hard working people and beyond that much of the money made tere 
is recycled to foundations to help the poor universities and other 
worthy causes he said 
but abuse will rear its ugly head without vigorous law 
enforcement he said 
bush also accused dukakis of protectionist demagoguery 
because of dukakis recent statements against foreign ownership of 
us industry 
for political reasons he sees advantage in stoking fears 
about foreign influence bush charged 
my opponent needs an issue and hes willing to scare people 
to find it he said accusing his opponent of flipflopping on 
the protection issues and being a believenothing candidate

another western influence may soon follow rock 
music and fast food into soviet society the ritual of filing 
annual financial returns and paying a progressive income tax 
a pair of economists said in articles published wednesday that a 
complete reform of the soviet tax system is necessary to expose 
those who have made fortunes in the multibillion dollar black 
market and spread income more equitably 
to search for some kind of scientific approach in our system 
of taxation is useless deputy finance minister viktor semenov 
told the weekly moscow news 
semenov and economist v yaroshenko writing in the communist 
party daily newspaper pravda both said a yearly statement of 
income and expenditures was essential 
yaroshenko added that the income tax should be made more 
progressive as it is in many other countries to be fairer to poor 
people 
currently soviets pay a flat 10 percent of their income in tax 
if they make less than 320 a month the average industrial wage 
the rate increases a few percentage points for higher incomes most 
taxes are deducted at the work place and workers dont need to file 
annual tax returns 
declarations of income and expenditures would serve as a means 
of strong economic and psychological action most of all against the 
system of organized crime said yaroshenko 
by filling out such forms illegal millionaires would be making 
a preliminary accusation of themselves he said 
black marketeering and other organized crime saps the economy of 
more money every year than is paid out in benefits to pensioners 
invalids students families with many children and orphans he 
said 
it is so wellorganized that it constitutes a government 
within the government he said 
the current economic and tax structure hurts the poor 
yaroshenko said he suggested the government impose more 
progressive income taxes and that illegal millionaires be allowed 
to give their illgotten wealth to staterun charities anonymously 
before filing their financial statements 
yaroshenkos article was the second published in pravda in two 
days to address the effects of economic reforms on the soviet poor 
in an article published tuesday a farm economist said increasing 
food prices would be an unacceptable way to eliminate the 105 
billion the government pays every year in subsidies instead kim 
n khmelkov said the soviet union must make farming much more 
efficient 
in yet another article printed wednesday moscow news said that 
in the first half of the year 130000 was confiscated in the 
soviet capital from people illegally trading rubles for hard 
currencies but it said police are nowhere near able to control the 
problem 
western tourists are approached near hotels and tourist sites in 
large cities by hordes of people offering to exchange money such 
exchanges are illegal and give the soviets access to goods they 
cannot buy in the official economy 
yaroshenko blamed the pervasiveness of organized crime on the 
centralized soviet economys inability to produce large quantities 
of highquality consumer goods 
instead of the usual sold and bought we started to say 
threw out and managed to get yaroshenko said that money 
is hard to earn has always been normal and natural but that it is 
hard to spend this is an alarming symptom 
semenov said the tax system will be reformed in the early 1990s 
when economists also are aiming to implement a comprehensive system 
of price reform 
the government must reduce indirect taxes that are worked into 
the retail prices of many goods and turn to direct taxes that now 
make up only 75 percent of the national budget he said 
semenov said some of the heaviest indirect taxes historically 
have been imposed on light industry and food processing two areas 
of the economy soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is urgently 
trying to reform to provide a better life for soviet citizens 
taxes significantly raise the retail price of refrigerators 
vacuum cleaners tv sets and tape recorders he said 
the wholesale price of a volga the largest standard passenger 
car produced in the country is 5460 after indirect taxes are 
added however the final retail price is more than 25600

president reagan borrowed a phrase from 
dan quayle to hustle votes for the republican ticket urging high 
school students to participate in the november election to help 
keep america the envy of the world 
reagan was campaigning today in pennsylvania and new jersey as 
chief surrogate for gop nominee george bush while the vice 
president prepares for his second and final debate thursday night 
with democratic rival michael dukakis in los angeles 
in a speech before students at upper darby high school in 
suburban philadelphia a republican stronghold he last visited late 
in his 1980 campaign the president made repeated references to 
quayle bushs running mate and echoed the indiana senators 
assertion that america is the wonder of the world 
but reagan said that unless the nations youngsters take part in 
the election all that he has fought for in the past eight years 
might be lost 
i am dedicating myself this year to making sure that this 
future of hope built on opportunity and traditional values remains 
open to each of you he said citing the strong economegrees although 
romanians 
and foreign visitors say many houses actually are colder than that 
the energy decree did not mention any change in the quotas for 
natural gas indicating strict limits set last year remained in 
force 
the higher quotas for electricty while not considerably 
improving romanians living standards generally viewed as among 
the lowest in europe were perceived as a sign that the regime of 
president and communist party leader nicolae ceausescu may fear new 
public protests at the outset of winter 
about 10000 people marched through the streets of brasov 
romanias secondlargest city in november shouting slogans against 
the regime and clamoring for more food and more heating 
the protest in brasov a leading industrial center was believed 
to be the largest against the government since the communist 
takeover in 1947 
the comparatively higher power quotas this year might have also 
been intended to shield romania from the wave of unrest in 
neighboring yugoslavia triggered by worsening living conditions and 
ethnic problems in the balkan nation 
romanians also have suffered from widespread food shortages and 
despite official calls for better supplies of meat cheese and 
other staples shortages have worsened romanians and western 
diplomats in bucharest said 
in july even bread was hard to find in the capital for a week 
white flour cooking oil sugar butter and eggs have been 
rationed since the early 1980s but in august and september no 
sugar rations were distributed 
romanias centralized economy has been grappling with perennial 
failures in the past decade to meet plan targets in coalmining and 
shortcomings in the operation of coalfired stations scinteia 
recently has again carried articles complaining about repair delays 
and poor supply of coal at the stations 
under the measures published wednesday electricity consumption 
beyond assigned quotas will be penalized with up to four times the 
normal charge 
according to the measures a family of three to four people 
living in a threeroom apartment will be alloted a quota of 47 
kilowatt hours in january for lighting and other household needs 
which equaled the quota for that month two years ago 
an energysaving decree issued in november regarded by 
romanians as beyond the absolute minium they could be expected to 
endure had alloted a family just 35 kilowatt hours for that month 
last year a family of three was allotted 236 cubic meters of 
natural gas for heating and cooking in january the coldest month 
of the winter 
in most homes cooking is done by natural gas heating systems 
in the apartment blocks where most urban romanians live are 
heated by centrally controlled thermal systems that authorities can 
turn down to decreed limits

associated press correspondent peter eng 
accompanied the latest joint team searching crash sites for 
evidence of americans still missing in action from the vietnam war 
this is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at low tide the beach seems to extend 
all the way to the submerged wreckage of an american bomber shot 
down 20 years ago near the lighthouse that unwittingly guided its 
raid on this industrial port 
residents of nearby villages recall little about the crash and 
the fate of the crew remains a mystery to them the local 
administrator said he wrote a brief report for his superiors but 
does not know what happened to it 
the united states still seeks to account for 2393 americans 
listed as missing in action in the southeast asia war more than 13 
years after it ended defense department sources in washington say 
about 400 were airmen lost in crashes in water whose remains 
probably never will be recovered 
difficulties even with cases considered most easily resolvable 
show a hard road lies ahead despite last weeks unprecedented joint 
investigations in vietnam where 1757 americans are missing 
us and vietnamese specialists searched in five provinces 
visiting crash sites and interviewing villagers about six lost 
airmen the six are among 70 discrepancy cases washington says 
vietnam should have information on including cases of men captured 
but never returned 
they retrieved two sets of unidentified remains and some 
wreckage but it was an arduous task just reaching the sites which 
were chosen in part becasue of their nearness to hanoi the 
capital the team trekked across mountainous leechinfested areas 
through monsoon rains and along roads enveloped in blinding dust 
wreckage from a 1968 crash is said to be submerged in a 
waterfilled crater in a rice field at die hop village near 
haiphong 
tran van loi 50 then the local communist party chief said the 
villagers put the airmans body in a nylon bag and buried it near 
the wreckage but he could not find it now because the land has 
been planted so often 
wreckage litters rice fields from haiphong to hanoi but only 
the cores of jet engines remained at two sites visited last week 
nguyen hop 60 said residents stripped all the metal for 
souvenirs and to make household items after a crash near his 
village in 1967 he smiled and held up a large rice pot made from 
the wreckage 
at another crash site nearby young men still were stripping a 
muddied jet turbine 20 years after the crash selling the metal for 
the equivalent of half a cent a pound 
us experts also surveyed crash sites in laos recently for a 
planned fourth joint excavation but reported no progress in 
obtaining numerous remains the authorities in wartorn cambodia 
claim to have 
the project in vietnam was a major breakthrough because many 
us officials believe vietnam is withholding information a 
suspicion fed by previous refusals of permission for us experts 
to search the countryside 
washington demands the fullest possible accounting of the 
missing which requires trust built on progress with the 
discrepancy cases said a western official interviewed in bangkok 
thailand who has an important role in the matter 
what i want most is to get some kind of confidence that we are 
getting something approaching full disclosure on the discrepancy 
cases he said on condition of anonymity 
diplomats in hanoi see the cooperation as a a step toward 
diplomatic relations now blocked by us opposition to vietnams 
military occupation of cambodia they say foreign minister nguyen 
co thach convinced communist party colleagues to allow the 
investigations putting aside preoccupations with sovereignty and 
security to do what is needed to improve ties with washington 
everyone agrees its extremely unlikely they will account for 
all the mias one western ambassador said the joint 
investigation is an exercise in trying to find ways and means of 
normalizing relations its symbolism 
us bombers raided north vietnam from 1965 to 1968 then again 
in 1972 pilots followed the glow of the lighthouse to strike 
haiphong the countrys biggest port vietnamese officials said 
the us defense department says the official press published 
information on us aircraft losses in north vietnam throughout the 
war and hanoi kept records on deaths and burials of prisoners 
of the 2393 mia cases 1128 were classified from the beginning 
as killed in actionbody not recovered and defense department 
sources say few of the remains will be found 
the other 1265 originally were labeled prisoner of 
warmissing in action but a few years ago all but one symbolic 
case were changed to the status of presumed dead 
in the villages what evidence remains is fading with the 
memories of older residents and the destruction wrought by man and 
nature 
investigators said it was difficult to find people still living 
in crash areas because they fled during the bombing reports on 
crashes written by local officials often were inaccurate because of 
the chaos said nguyen can head of vietnams mia office 
he said vietnam has resolved 22 of the 70 discrepany cases 11 
by returning remains and the others by concluding after 
interviewing villagers that nothing could be recovered in some 
cases aircraft exploded in the air he said 
a us investigator said you go to a town in the us and you 
ask what happened 2025 years ago after offices have been moved 
records have been moved its hard the vietnamese have no 
equipment no personnel no money and they have great economic 
problems of their own

a commission of journalists and academics the 
third panel in 14 years to tackle the topic called wednesday for 
reviving the presidential press conference and making it a 
frequent routine and undramatic institution 
the longer presidents go without a press conference the 
greater the suspicion that there is something to hide and the 
greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences the 
panel said 
when ultimately the president holds a conference it is 
liable to be a hostile affair in which both the president and the 
press look bad it would seem better on balance for the president 
to take his lumps on a more frequent basis 
at the same time the harvard commission on the presidential 
news conference said the media must mend their ways if the press 
conference is to revive the public wont lend its attention to the 
sessions if it believes reporters questions are unfair irrelevant 
or overly aggressive it concluded 
the 16member commission studied the issue for a year it was 
appointed by the joan shorenstein barone center on the press 
politics and public policy of harvard universitys john f kennedy 
school of government it was cochaired by former newscaster marvin 
kalb director of the center and frederick w mayer assistant 
professor of public policy at duke university 
the commission said the presidential press conference a 
75yearold institution is not aging well and that under 
ronald reagan it has fallen into a serious state of disrepair 
reagan has held only 45 formal news conferences in his nearly 
eight years in office and once let 5 months pass during the 
irancontra affair without a formal meeting with reporters 
president franklin d roosevelt met with reporters nearly 1000 
times in 13 years in office 
we believe that all parties would benefit from restoring the 
habit of frequent routine and undramatic news conferences the 
panels report said 
properly conducted news conferences can serve presidents press 
and public alike the commission said and all suffer when the 
institution deteriorates 
the press can often be irritating to presidents appearing to 
assume an adversarial posture question tactics and motives 
distort the presidents message or divulge uncomfortable 
information the report added 
when presidents get bad press and all do at one point or 
another during their presidency they are tempted to limit contact 
with reporters or to limit contact to situations more controllable 
than a press conference 
the panel recommended that presidents meet with the media twice 
a month during daytime hours once with reporters who cover the 
white house routinely and once with smaller groups of journalists 
and hold six televised evening news conferences a year 
daytime news conferences should be held to reduce the 
temperature and encourage more substantive and useful exchanges 
the panel suggested it said this would give morning newspapers 
more time to prepare their stories and allow television evening 
news programs to show highlights of the session 
the commission noted that it was the third to address the issue 
in 1974 in the wake of watergate a group of scholars met at the 
boston university school of communication and concluded the press 
conference was in a sad state 
six years later after president carter had avoided the press 
during the iran hostage crisis a panel at the university of 
virginia decried the distressing disrepair of the institution 
last month presidential candidates george bush and michael 
dukakis answering questions raised by the freedom of information 
committee of the associated press managing editors association 
promised to be accessible to the white house press if elected 
neither would say how often he would hold formal news sessions 
however

deputy secretary of state john c whitehead on 
wednesday called on communist authorities to tear down the berlin 
wall and praised east germans who have risked their lives to escape 
to the west 
the state departments no 2 official who spoke to reporters at 
the wall in west berlin recalled president reagans june 1987 
speech at the gray barrier east germany built in 1961 to stop the 
westward flow of refugees 
reagan called on those who put it up to tear it down and 
so they should the sooner the better said whitehead who is in 
europe on an official visit to east and west germany romania 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia 
the berlin wall is a gray monstrous snake he said as he 
stood on a podium in front of what he called an anachronism a 
barrier inconsistent with our contemporary world 
he recalled recent escapes and escape attempts into west berlin 
from the eastern sector 
when i hear of young men shot at as they run for freedom 
or of a pregnant woman chased by a patrol boat as she swims 
across the spree the river that divides east from west i feel 
deep admiration for the courage of those berliners whitehead 
said 
whitehead said that he had discussed with east german officials 
their countrys practice of shooting at people trying to escape 
i do believe that the shootings are less frequent than when i 
started to raise the issue whitehead told reporters 
whitehead said the allies governing west berlin the united 
states britain and france would continue to support reagans 
1987 berlin initiative aimed at easing regulations and 
improving international air access to the divided city 
the allied powers in december issued a memorandum to soviet 
officials proposing improvements to the berlin initiative 
allied officials have refused to disclose the soviet response 
but the west german newspaper bild am sonntag said last month that 
the soviets accused the allies of ignoring the territorial and 
political realities of central europe 
whiteheads tour of warsaw pact countries included talks in east 
berlin on tuesday with east german leader erich honecker 
whitehead also said a time of change was coming to eastern 
europe because of peoples dissatisfaction with economic and social 
conditions

a strong earthquake off the northern coast 
of taiwan shook houses in taipei on wednesday although there were 
no reports of casualties or damage the central weather bureau said 
the temblor recorded at 645 pm with its epicenter at sea 
about 60 miles northeast of taipei registered 57 on the richter 
scale of ground motion the bureau said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

although subsequent presidents have been tempted to put the press 
back out on the street none has been willing to pay the price to 
do it the harvard commission on the presidential news conference 
said wednesday in a report urging more frequent meetings with the 
media 
the commission gave this history of the presidential news 
conference 
theodore roosevelt although he took reporters in out of the 
rain his sessions were not really news conferences the 
reporters simply stood and listened while the president talked to 
them often while being shaved by the white house barber 
woodrow wilson really the father of the news conference he 
believed presidents should be obliged to answer reporters 
questions just as british prime ministers field questions from the 
opposition in the house of commons wilson met with the press once 
or twice a week in the first 2 years of his term then went a year 
without a session and held irregular meetings thereafer 
warren harding wilsons successor met with the press twice a 
week for most of his presidency but required that the questions be 
written and submitted in advance 
calvin coolidge his sessions were cooler if he didnt like a 
written question hed crumple it up and throw it away 
herbert hoover he met with reporters more than twice a week in 
his first few months in office but after the 1929 stock market 
crash he cut the frequency to once a week these sessions were 
short and uninformative 
franklin d roosevelt he met with reporters almost twice a week 
for 13 years his press conferences were intimate affairs around 
his desk or at warm springs ga around his car he often 
flattered reporters impressed them with the depth of his 
knowledge sometimes bullied them once sent a reporter to sit in 
the corner wearing a dunce cap he didnt insist on written 
questions but sometimes put answers off the record and usually 
could only be paraphrased by reporters not quoted directly 
harry s truman he moved the press conference from the oval 
office to the indian treaty room in the executive office building 
creating a more formal atmosphere most of what he said was on the 
record and sometimes his spunky spontaneous answers got him in 
trouble he averaged fewer than one a week 
dwight d eisenhower he allowed television cameras in changing 
forever the nature of news conferences although live telecasts 
were not permitted for the first time the american people could 
see their president as he interacted with the press the report 
noted and for the first time reporters themselves became 
visible to the public as actors in the process eisenhower cut 
the frequency to once every two weeks 
john f kennedy his press conferences marked by wit became 
the standard against which subsequent presidents would be judged 
or judge themselves he had a briefing book prepared and 
practiced answers 
lyndon johnson kennedy was a tough act to follow and johnson 
to avoid questions when his vietnam policy came under challenge 
took to making long opening statements one study found his opening 
statements consumed more than onethird of the time he averaged 
more than two press conferences a month 
richard nixon he averaged only six a year during the watergate 
crisis when he went for five months without a news conference the 
press became so hostile that he once stalked off without awaiting 
the usual closing thank you mr president 
gerald ford he averaged one every three week but still had 
difficulty dampening the press cynicism that had developed during 
the johnson and nixon administrations the report said 
jimmy carter he kept to a twoamonth pledge for a year and a 
half but ended up averaging half that many holding fewer during 
the iran hostage crisis he moved them to the evening out of 
frustration with the way the television news shows edited his 
remarks at daytime news conferences 
ronald reagan he pledged to hold news conferences once a month 
but has held only 45 in more than 7 years in office reporters 
have become so frustrated with limited access and their feeling 
of being manipulated that on occasion they have resorted to 
shouting questions at the president whenever they are allowed 
within earshot the report said the president although 
successful in the short run in dodging difficult questions suffers 
from the perception that he is not really in charge of his own 
white house

leading islamic spokesman urged 
action wednesday to counter what they said was widespread prejudice 
against moslems as backward ignorant fanatics 
the concern over antimoslem sentiment became a principal theme 
as information ministers from more than 40 islamic countries worked 
on a plan to improve the exchange of news among themselves and 
breaking down barriers to the nonislamic world 
professor abdelhadi boutaleb directorgeneral of the islamic 
educational scientific and cultural organization said the worlds 
estimated 800 million moslems must be educated against outside 
influences including foreign media characterizations of 
backwardness ignorance and fanaticism as the main features of 
our peoples 
on tuesday sharifuddin pir zadeh the pakistani 
secretarygeneral of the organization of islamic conference told a 
closed session that reports from western news agencies ignore or 
deliberately distort islamic issues 
some saudi newspapers echoed the theme 
the jiddahbased englishlanguage arab news urged the 
information ministers to act against an ugly phenomenon that it 
said was particularly virulent in western europe but also apparent 
in nationalist movements within the communist bloc and increasing 
even in the third world 
outside the islamic world antiislamic prejudice is most 
definitely on the increase much of it is pure religious bigotry 
but there is a marked streak of racism involved in it as well 
the newspaper said 
it said any effort to correct this would be wasted if it is 
nothing more than a machine pushing islamic information back into 
the islamic world 
we cannot allow ourselves to rely on the insensitive and 
uncomprehending international news agencies when islam is 
involved it said 
except for a us television crew from cairo western news 
agencies appeared to be the only outside media permitted to cover 
the conference saudi arabia rarely grants entry to foreign 
reporters 
the twoday meeting in this red sea port city drew ministers or 
their representatives from all but a few of the 46 members of the 
conference 
the absentees included afghanistan whose marxist government was 
expelled from the conference several years ago and iran with 
which host saudi arabia broke diplomatic relations in april

million to the united nations campaign for the reconstruction of 
afghanistan and repatriation of millions of afghan refugees the

soviet pledge was the largest to date since an appeal for donations 
went out in june his genevabased office the un humanitarian

the 10th us circuit court of appeals today 
overturned a decision that had threatened to throw the states 
official english initiative off the nov 8 ballot on the 
grounds that the petitions for the proposal should have been 
available in spanish 
the appellate court panel issued the decision at the end of a 
90minute hearing this morning on colorado secretary of state 
natalie meyers appeal of us district judge jim carrigans 
decision of sept 16 
carrigan had said petitions circulated in 12 colorado counties 
should have been printed in spanish and english the petitions were 
printed in english only he said failure to circulate bilingual 
petitions in those counties violated the federal voting rights act 
of 1965 
the decision had thrown the status of the official english 
ballot initiative into doubt because his rejection of petitions 
from the 12 counties dropped the number of valid signatures on the 
petitions to just 36874 a total of 50686 signatures were needed 
to get the measure on the ballot 
but meyer had placed the proposed amendment on the general 
election ballot despite carrigans ruling hoping that her appeal 
would be accepted by the 10th circuit court 
after the court ruled today meyer said this one will be 
voted on were through as of today 
carrigan had based his ruling on a portion of the us voting 
rights act that requires election literature to be distributed in a 
second language in areas where more than 5 percent of the 
population has a limited knowledge of english 
his ruling had been watched closely in other states besides 
colorado because of concern that it could affect not only other 
initiatives on this years ballot but laws passed by previous 
initiatives 
in florida opponents of an official english amendment in that 
state went to federal court to get the measure removed from the 
november ballot citing carrigans ruling on bilingual petitions 
proposed amendment 1 says simply an amendment to the colorado 
constitution to declare that the english language is the official 
language of the state of colorado 
critics have called the proposal racist while proponents say 
that english is a bond that helps hold americas melting pot 
together 
in announcing its decision today the appeals court said a 
written ruling giving details on the reasons for overturning 
carrigans decision would be issued later

the government wednesday promised a 
crackdown on rising crimes of violence but refused to restore the 
death penalty 
home secretary douglas hurd told his ruling conservative partys 
annual convention he would recruit more police build more prison 
space impose further curbs on drunkenness and introduce electronic 
tags to keep track of alleged offenders 
but his rejection of the death penalty clearly bucked sentiment 
at the convention 
with hurd and prime minister margaret thatcher looking on 
delegate lionel stanbrook ended his prodeath penalty speech by 
unexpectedly asking prohanging delegates to raise their hands a 
majority did 
hanging was abolished in 1969 and attempts to restore it have 
been repeatedly defeated ever since 
dont lets get stuck just in this groove hurd urged the 
delegates capital punishment cant be the answer to all crime 
or even to violent crime in general 
the second day of the convention also dealt with the environment 
and energy and included a pledge by energy minister cecil 
parkinson to sell the stateowned coal industry to private 
ownership after the next election which must be held by 1992 
but the days dominant issue was law and order which is 
increasingly preoccupying tories as police reported a 12 percent 
increase in violent crime in england and wales last year and an 11 
percent increase in sexual offenses 
electronic tagging would enable authorities to free suspects 
instead of locking them in prisons which already are rated the 
most overcrowded in western europe 
the home office said the tagging trials would take place in 
england and wales only and the specific test areas had not been 
selected 
the apparatus is relatively simple hurd explained it 
looks ike an electronic bicycle clip and it works if this 
project proves successful then we shall take the idea further 
he said it could be used for offenders who would otherwise be 
remanded in custody and to enable judges to hand down more 
community service sentences 
there should be restrictions on the young thiefs leisure 
time hurd said it would do him good to be made to stay at 
home during pub opening hours or on saturday afternoon while the 
football is going on electronic monitoring fits in here 
the tag attached to the ankle transmits a signal to a police 
receiver if the suspect violates his curfew hours the signal is 
broken and he can be rearrested 
the howard league for penal reform attacked the scheme as 
unnecessary expensive ineffective and uncivilized while the 
national association of probation officers said us tagging 
programs had not reduced the prison population 
the tories insist crime is up because school and parental 
discipline has declined while the opposition labor party blames it 
on mrs thatchers freemarket doctrines which it says foster 
greedy individualism

a training exercise for a fire crew at an 
air force base turned into a lifeanddeath struggle when a tanker 
plane crashed killing all six crew members and injuring 10 
passengers 
the air force said today it hadnt determined the cause of the 
crash tuesday afternoon at wurtsmith air force base a board of 
officers will be appointed to investigate the crash 
wurtsmith located near lake huron is one of two michigan bases 
in the strategic air command nineteen b52 bombers aryek with 
nucleartipped cruise missiles and nuclear bombs are based at 
wurtsmith 
the kc135 stratotanker a fourengine plane used to refuel 
other planes was returning to the base from a mission to ki 
sawyer air force base in michigans upper peninsula when it crashed 
and burned said staff sgt donald lawber a spokesman at wurtsmith 
in the northeastern lower peninsula 
the six crew members died at the scene authorities said eight 
of the 10 injured were treated and released from the 379th 
strategic hospital at the base staff sgt albert fleming said two 
people admitted to the base hospital were in good condition today 
the bases firefighters had just completed a training exercise 
when the accident occurred and they quickly doused the flames 
said air force sgt gene babble 
the aircraft was making its landing approach when it crashed 
into the tarmac said airman kim dvorak another base spokesman 
the planes pilot had not radioed a distress call before the crash 
she said 
a witness who was not identified told the detroit news one of 
the planes wings touched the ground as it was landing before it 
veered out of control the plane slammed into the ground skidded 
more than a quarter mile and came to rest in a grassy area about 
150 yards off the runway 
dvorak said investigators have ruled out wind shear as the cause 
of the crash which occurred in sunny weather with light winds 
pinpointing the cause will be difficult she said because the 
plane was not equipped with a flight recorder like the black 
box carried by commercial airliners 
not much of an airplane was left said state police sgt 
john pegg at the east tawas post basically all that was left 
was a tail section 
the 10 passengers all military personnel were being brought to 
wurtsmith from ki sawyer to participate in a base inspection 
part of preparation for an inspection by officials from strategic 
air command headquarters in omaha neb said anita bailey 
spokeswoman for ki sawyer

the 18 members of the swedish academy 
made their final deliberations for thursdays 1988 nobel literature 
prize announcement under pressure to fill some gaps in the awards 
87year history 
no writer from china has ever won the prestigous prize despite 
that countrys 3000year literary tradition the laureate list 
which dates back to 1901 contains just two asians only six women 
have ever been honored 
in keeping with tradition the academys secretary sture allen 
announces the winner when a gold clock in the academys 18th 
century office strikes 1 pm 8 am edt 
the other nobel prizes are to be announced next week by the 
royal swedish academy of sciences and the karolinska institute 
they include the awards for chemistry physics economics and 
medicine 
the peace prize announced in oslo norway on sept 29 went to 
the un peacekeeping forces around the world this years prizes 
are worth 390000 each 
the last woman to win the literature prize was swedens nelly 
sachs who shared it with a man sj agnon of israel in 1966 
despite swedens ingrained system of sexual equality men outnumber 
women on the academy by 162 all members serve for life 
the last asian winner was yasunari kawabata of japan in 1968 
from there the gap stretches back to 1913 and indian laureate 
rabindranath tagore 
i would say it is time for a chinese author said asa 
beckman an editor at blm one of swedens leading literary 
magazines she suggested bad jin or female novelist shen rong 
academy members keep a strict code of secrecy they never 
discuss candidates by name however member goran malmqvist of 
stockholm university hinted in an interview that this years choice 
should satisfy most people 
i find it hard to imagine any nasty comments he said 
this year we have a short list with extraordinarily worthy 
candidates said malmqvist they all have contributed to world 
literature 
the academy has been studying the list of less than 10 
candidates since before the summer he said 
culture page editors of swedens biggest newspapers and 
publishing houses admitted they were at loss for a good guess this 
year 
but speculation centered on a handful of favorites including 
nadine gordimer of south africa and mexican writers octavio paz or 
carlos fuentes 
others mentioned by perennial nobel watchers included us 
author joyce carol oates trinidadborn indian writer vs naipaul 
japanese authors yasushi inove and kobo abe italys alberto 
moravia and jaan kross an estonian who spent eight years in a 
soviet labor camp in siberia 
then there is graham greene the british writer has been 
discussed since the 1960s and has become known as the man who did 
not get the nobel prize 
according to many accounts greene has been blocked by academy 
member artur lundqvist who objects that his novels do not raise 
literary standards however lundqvists influence in the academy 
is said to have declined since he suffered a serious illness in 
1981 
the swedish national news agency tt suggested east german author 
christa wolff frances marguerite duras britains doris lessing 
and ana matute of spain among the possible female winners 
will allen once again have to hear the eternal question why 
dont you ever choose a woman tt said 
the election of malmqvist a chinese specialist to the academy 
in 1985 reflected an awareness of criticism for having a decidedly 
proeuropean or western slant 
the following year the prize went for the first time to an 
african nigerias wole soyinka 
alfred nobel who made his fortune from inventing dynamite and 
other explosives stipulated in his will that the prize be awarded 
to the author who produced the most outstanding work of an ideal 
tendency nobel died in 1896 
his words have been interpreted differently by the generations 
of academies in the first decades after world war ii the prize was 
awarded to modernists such as the poet ts eliot and to 
established writers such as bertrand russel 
in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s the prize was used 
to draw attention to masters who wrote for a limited audience and 
were unknown worldwide such as czech poet jaroslav seifert in 1984 
and greek writer odysseus elytis the 1981 laureate 
the laureates will be given their awards in stockholm dec 10 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is to accept the 
peace prize in oslo on the same day the anniversary of nobels 
death

two men charged with the 1983 murder of a new 
york producer who was trying to finance the cotton club movie 
have pleaded innocent denying allegations that could bring the 
death penalty 
william molony mentzer and alex lamota marti are accused of 
gunning down producer roy radin who authorities say was targeted 
for death in connection with his unsuccessful attempt to finance 
the film 
mentzer and marti pleaded innocent tuesday to murder and special 
circumstance allegations of committing murder for financial gain 
and lying in wait for the victim they could face the death penalty 
if convicted 
municipal court judge david s milton set a nov 7 hearing for 
motions preceding a preliminary hearing 
five defendants including mentzer and marti are named in a 
complaint dealing with the murders of radin and of a prostitute 
june mincher marti and karen delayne greenberger are not charged 
in the mincher killing which was unrelated to radins death 
mrs greenberger a key figure in the radin allegations is 
fighting extradition from florida another defendant robert ulmer 
lowe is awaiting extradition proceedings in maryland 
robert leroy deremer charged only in the mincher killing was 
returned here from indiana on tuesday after waiving extradition 
prosecutors allege that mrs greenberger formerly known as 
elaine jacobs ordered radins execution after a dispute over her 
financial cut of the movie the cotton club 
mrs greenberger who authorities said was involved in cocaine 
dealing allegedly introduced radin to movie producer robert evans 
who was then seeking financing for the film about the legendary 
harlem night spot 
radin 33 who had produced vaudeville shows in new york saw 
the cotton club as his chance to enter the hollywood big time 
prosecutors said he was embroiled in a deal to raise 35 million 
for the film from puerto rican investors when he disappeared may 
13 1983 
radin failed to show up that night for a dinner at a swank 
beverly hills restaurant a month later his bulletriddled body 
was found dumped in a rural area 60 miles from los angeles

closer but still trailing after the campaigns 
first two debates michael dukakis faces george bush in los angeles 
thursday in what may be the democrats last chance to move the 
presidential race onto their issues 
and importantly to do it with a smile 
in the final debate before the election each candidate would 
love to land a knockout blow to be so eloquent and impressive or 
to so damage his rival that the race for the presidency would be 
greatly altered 
thats not likely however 
bush with an apparent lead in the electoral college that 
exceeds his narrowing margin in national polls needs this debate 
less than the democratic nominee and massachusetts governor 
the vice president has no doubt been spending some time 
preparing a retort for any jibes dukakis might make about his 
selection of dan quayle as running mate 
quayle bush said in the first presidential debate will do 
very well when we get into the debates something polls agree 
quayle did not do in the vicepresidential faceoff last week 
for dukakis as the underdog and as the challenger who 
represents change 90 minutes on a stage with bush before a 
national television audience poses a last opportunity 
dukakis forces see the debate as his chance to confront bush on 
the negative charges the republican campaign has been heaping on 
him dukakis tried that in the first debate when he accused bush of 
questioning his patriotism and declared i resent it 
bush since has moved on pummeling dukakis anew over the 
massachusetts prison furlough program 
dukakis showed anger last weekend at the suggestion he was 
insensitive to victims of crime and his aides said they hope to 
keep the nominee angry 
stop this shameless playing of politics with the tragedy of 
crime dukakis said in a line hes likely to replay to bush 
answering the other guys charges isnt usually enough though 
many democrats say dukakis still needs to make the case for 
himself on the issues of his choosing principally the economy 
and he needs to show some warmth passion and even humor in the 
process 
polls after their first debate indicated many people credited 
dukakis with his grasp of the issues but they also suggested many 
didnt find much they liked in the oftendour dukakis 
in his first debate dukakiss main fault may have been his 
passionless answer to the question about his lack of passion 
i care deeply about people he said in a phrase he 
repeated i may be a little calmer than some about it 
dukakis has been frustrated so far in making his economic themes 
connect with voters he is trying to make a point that prosperity 
isnt reaching many americans and that the economic future is 
clouded 
his thematic phrase has been changing almost weekly in an effort 
to find one that resonates bringing prosperity home middle 
class squeeze and now make america no 1 
advisers want dukakis to paint bush as the candidate of the 
wealthy and privileged of wall street and big business some of 
dukakis best moments on the stump have come when he tried that 
george bush plays santa claus to the wealthy and ebenezer 
scrooge to the rest of us dukakis said recently holding a 20 
bill aloft in ridicule of the savings provided to middleclass 
americans by bushs taxdeferred savings account plan 
look for dukakis to repeat that one too 
theyve got to draw a clear line of which candidate is on your 
side said frank greer a democratic consultant who has advised 
dukakis on the debates theyve failed in doing that so far 
mainly because theyve been on the defensive

the house refused wednesday to abolish the 
muchcriticized federal agency created to manage and sell off the 
worst assets of insolvent savings institutions 
the house voted 247130 to approve the measure under the 
procedure used however twothirds of those voting had to be in 
favor of the legislation for passage and the house failed to reach 
that margin by five votes 
even if the house had approved the bill there was little chance 
for passage by the senate which hasnt considered such legislation 
the federal assets disposition administration a quasipublic 
organization was formed by the federal home loan bank in 1985 to 
assist the federal savings and loan insurance corp in the 
management and disposition of acquired assets 
lawmakers have accused it of favoritism conflicts of interest 
and mismanagement of the 39 billion in loans and real estate in 
its care 
fada was criticized bitterly for paying salaries as high as 
250000 annually cloaking its activities in secret and failing to 
dispose of many of the assets placed in its custody 
the house banking committee approved the bill on oct 4 by a 
vote of 428 with all the negative votes coming from republicans 
who see the legislation as a political measure rather than 
substantive action 
the legislation would have given the bank board 60 days to close 
fada and limit severence pay for employees to about 4700 or 
three weeks salary rather than the four months pay pledged by 
the agency early this year 
the bill similar to a section of the omnibus banking 
legislation approved by the house in august would have assigned 
fadas activities to fslic the government insurance fund that 
backs sampl deposits up to 100000 
reps paul kanjorski dpa and tom mcmillen dmd introduced 
the legislation 
rep fernand j st germain dri banking committee chairman 
and floor manager for the bill said in debate that his panel had 
been investigating fada for the past 15 months 
our findings clearly establish that this agency has become a 
wasteful bureaucracy lacing in accountability and providing an 
inefficient means of disposing of property acquired from failed 
savings and loan associations he said 
high salaries big expense accounts and cialike secrecy have 
become the agencys claims to fame during its threeyear 
existence

gov sir david wilson on wednesday delivered an 
optimistic review on conditions in hong kong but said problems 
exist and they must be solved to retain the prosperity and dynamism 
of this british colony 
in an annual address opening a new session of the legislative 
council hong kongs chief lawmaking body wilson said he was 
confident about the colonys economic growth despite public concern 
over its return to china in 1997 when a territorial lease expires 
he said hong kongs gross domestic product was expected to grow 
by 6 percent this year or half the 1987 figure but explained this 
was the result of economic consolidation following earlier years of 
double digit growth 
hong kong has prospered over the past decades by maintaining 
an open economy he said nevertheless we have to recognize 
that we are dependent not just on ourselves but on the economic 
performance of our major overseas markets and on our continued 
access to them 
as an example of concern wilson singled out an unsuccessful 
attempt by the us house of representatives earlier this month to 
override president reagans veto on legislation to tighten curbs on 
textile imports to the united states 
we must continue to be aware of and guard against 
protectionist sentiment in the us congress he said 
hong kong exported roughly 43 billion worth of apparel and 
textile goods to the united states last year it was the single 
largest category in exports that totaled 92 billion 
wilson said sinohong kong relations are developing well 
wilson said hong kong still faces a problem over the 
resettlement of vietnamese boat people who continue to arrive 
despite a government policy to repatriate to vietnam those regarded 
as economic migrants and not genuine refugees 
he said 13300 boat people have arrived in hong kong since the 
fall of vietnam to the communists in 1975 there are roughly 25000 
still in hong kong but wilson said their rate of resettlement to 
other countries has dropped sharply in recent years 
the tragedy is that doors are no longer open for them he 
said they are people on a journey to nowhere

the supreme court was urged wednesday to 
uphold a key 1976 civil rights decision and not retreat in the 
fight to eliminate the badges of slavery in american society 
julius levonne chambers of the naacp legal defense and education 
fund said the courts 12yearold ruling conforms with a law 
congress passed in 1866 to eradicate racial discrimination in the 
wake of emancipation 
congress had egregious conduct to correct after the civil 
war chambers said and he continued congress meant to reach 
the type of conduct at issue in wednesdays case 
chambers who is black said were not working on the farms 
now were working in credit unions but the badges of slavery were 
what congress was trying to reach 
the civil rights act of 1866 was intended to ensure recently 
freed slaves all the rights of citizenship 
chambers is representing a north carolina woman who accused her 
former employer mclean credit union of racial harassment the 
case has attracted as much attention as any in the courts new term 
begun last week 
civil rights advocates say they are concerned it might signal a 
willingness by a newly solidified conservative court majority to 
wipe out gains made by minorities over the last 30 years 
the justices are deciding whether they mistakenly ruled in 1976 
that the 1866 law authorizes suits against private citizens accused 
of discrimination 
the court is expected to announce its decision next year 
roger s kaplan a new york lawyer representing mclean credit 
union said the 1866 law would not reach private acts of 
discrimination and the court in 1976 interfered with the will of 
congress in extending the reach of the old statute 
kaplan received sharp questioning from the justices when he said 
the proper course now for the court was to abandon precedent and 
reverse its 12yearold ruling 
justice antonin scalia said kaplan must come up with something 
more than the argument that the 1976 ruling interfered with 
congressional prerogatives 
if thats all you have im afraid its nothing scalia said 
justice anthony m kennedy the courts newest member and 
potentially a decisive swing vote in the case asked chambers where 
the court should draw the line in applying the 1866 law 
could it be invoked he asked to sue an employer for using a 
racial epithet wheres the controlling principle kennedy 
asked 
chambers said the law would apply if the use of the epithet 
demonstrated an intent to discriminate and was not an isolated 
occurence 
the court sent shock waves through the civil rights community 
last april when it announced it would use the credit union case to 
consider reversing the 1976 decision called runyon vs mccrary 
while no party to the north carolina case urged the court to 
reconsider the 1976 precedent the justices by a 54 vote took the 
extraordinary step of acting on their own initiative to call for a 
reexamination 
kennedy and scalia were in the majority along with chief 
justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day oconnor and 
byron r white 
the dissenters said the move threatened to undermine the faith 
minorities have placed in the high court 
in runyon vs mccrary the court held that racially segregated 
private schools which refuse to admit blacks violate the 1866 law 
the ruling allows civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as a 
weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms 
for example no other federal law bars racially segregated 
private schools also the law provides for heavy punitive damages 
against those found to have practiced discrimination 
that is of particular importance in job bias cases which account 
for some threefourths of the suits filed under the 1866 law 
congress in 1964 outlawed onthejob discrimination but did not 
provide for such heavy penalties 
the 1866 law also is a key recourse for those challenging bias 
in the sale of private homes 
the attorneys general of nearly every state a majority of us 
senators more than 100 house members and more than 100 civil 
rights and public interest groups are urging the court not to 
tamper with the 1976 ruling 
the reagan administration has not taken an official position in 
the dispute 
the case stems from an appeal by brenda patterson a black woman 
who was a teller at mclean credit union she sued under the 1866 
law seeking actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling by 
a federal judge in winstonsalem nc throwing out her suit

an international conference concluded 
wednesday that the warming of the earth from the greenhouse 
effect is a crisis requiring massive scientific and political 
coordination to stem the burning of fossil fuels and halve the 
emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2030 
the effort must entail fundamental changes in lifestyle 
including a rapid switch to solar wind and other environmentally 
sound energy sources new farming techniques and the abandonment 
of some chemical products the conference said 
it also recommended that the industrial nations forgive certain 
debts of the third world as an incentive for poorer nations to 
conserve and replenish their tropical forests 
representatives from 35 nations attended the threeday global 
greenhouse network first international conference to formulate 
recommendations for heading off what many scientists have warned 
could be a disastrous overheating of the earth 
this crisis is of such overwhelming magnitude that it will 
require a truly global response said jeremy rifkin president of 
the foundation on economic trends which sponsored the meeting 
the greenhouse effect is a warming of the earth caused by the 
increasing concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases in the 
atmosphere 
the gases largely a result of burning fossil fuels like coal 
and oil allow radiation from the sun to warm the planet but block 
excess heat from radiating back into space the effect is similar 
to that of a greenhouse for growing plants 
global warming is already occurring and the planet faces 
the possibility of profound disruption in the coming decades 
said philip michael kelly a climatologist from the university of 
east anglia in norwich england 
scientists have warned that the consequences of even a slight 
global warming could include increased droughts and other severe 
effects upon crop production moreover they say it could melt the 
ice caps threatening coastal areas with higher seas and even 
produce stronger hurricanes in future years 
among the other recommendations of the conference 
taxes on use of carbonbased fuels and other penalties for 
damaging the environment targeted at industrialized nations the 
money raised from these penalties would go to an international fund 
to assist nations seeking ways to cope with climate change 
rejection of nuclear geneticengineering and other 
hightechnology responses to the climate problem 
tax incentives and legislation to discourage use of 
chlorofluorocarbons a type of chemical used in refrigerators and 
other industrial processes which can damage the environment 
reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide by onefifth by the 
year 2000 and by half by 2030 
tax incentives and legislation to encourage energy efficiency 
and conservation in industrial residential and commercial uses 
a switch by agriculture away from petrochemical fertilizers to 
organic products 
it is recognized that these goals cannot be achieved without 
fundamental changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns in the 
industrialized world and structural changes in socioeconomic 
relationships worldwide the conference concluded 
the group also announced plans for a celebration of global earth 
day in 1990 and designation of the 1990s as the environmental 
decade

said corrupt officials would be punished and that the ministry of 
justice was working on new decrees and regulations for the campaign 
the president said he particularly was concerned about personal 
enrichment by government officials and bankers he said if it was

nasa officials hope that a 
disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar wednesday 
will be en route to venus by april as americas first 
interplanetary explorer in 11 years 
the national aeronautics and space administration showed off the 
scattered pieces of the magellan spacecraft to reporters and 
photographers four days after the spacecrafts arrival by truck 
from the martin marietta plant in denver 
if all goes well the parts will be assembled and checked out 
over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in 
march to be loaded aboard the space shuttle atlantis said jo ann 
morgan the kennedy space centers director of payloads projects 
management 
the scheduled launch date is april 28 
nasa will have only 25 days until may 23 to get atlantis off 
the pad before venus moves out of its favorable alignment with 
earth otherwise the magellan voyage will have to be delayed about 
two years said charles brown magellan program manager for martin 
marietta which built the probe for nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
once the shuttle is in orbit the crew will release magellan 
from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466day trip 
to venus 
it will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as 
well as the first us planetary mission since two pioneer 
spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study venus atmosphere 
magellan is to settle into an elliptical orbit around venus 
ranging from 155 miles to 1180 miles above the surface each 
circuit of the planet will take 31 days and during the 40 minutes 
the craft is nearest the surface an advanced radar will peer 
through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface 
which will be relayed to an earth station 
during each orbit the radar supplied by hughes aircraft co 
will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10000 miles long 
brown said it would take 1853 such swaths recorded over 243 days 
to chart the entire planet 
the spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how 
venus was formed brown told a news conference to find out we 
need to know the topography of the planet 
we now have the topography of earth the moon mars and 
mercury but we dont have the topography of venus because of the 
cloud cover he said the imaging radar will give us that 
topography 
brown said magellan will enable scientists for the first time to 
study detailed images of venus like those formed by wind or flowing 
liquid craters and large landslides 
while venus is earths closest neighbor in the solar system the 
two planets are vastly different venus has a surface temperature 
of about 900 degrees fahrenheit its atmopshere is almost entirely 
carbon dioxide and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of 
earth 
brown said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the 
two planets evolved so differently

chad and sudan are joining forces against 
bandit gangs from both countries whose looting and robbing rampages 
in recent months have resulted in hundreds of deaths in western 
sudan 
among targeted warlords is acheikh ibn omar once designated by 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi as chads president whose army 
of 2000 renegades is said to be hiding out in sudan 
a chadiansudanese committee went this week to fasher capital 
of the wests main region darfur to meet with ibn omar and leaders 
of other armed chadian factions the chadian delegation has been in 
sudan since saturday discussing ways to improve security near the 
frontier to stop infiltration of armed bands 
border insecurity has bedeviled prime minister sadek mahdis 
civilian government almost ever since it took power in sudan in 
1986 from a junta that had ruled for a year after a coup 
brigadier mahmoud haren hamad darfurs chief of police said 
more than 3000 civilians and at least 100 policemen have been 
killed by armed robbers in the region since 1984 early this year 
he said six or seven armed robberies were occurring every day 
mahdi and others have complained bitterly of the spillover of 
the war between libya and chad they have charged that soldiers 
from both countries have sought in sudan a haven from the fighting 
with easy pickings for robbery or have used sudanese territory as 
a short cut between libya and the battle fronts in chad 
despite his outwardly friendly relations with gadhafi the prime 
minister ordered libyan troops out of sudan in 1985 and again the 
next year some of the 2000 originally in sudan are thought still 
to remain 
gadhafi declared the prolonged war ended in may and resumed 
diplomatic relations this month with the government of hissene 
habre formerly his bitter enemy 
sudanese officials have announced several times that the members 
of ibn omars troops had surrendered their weapons to the army 
last week however cabinet affairs minister salah abdulsalam 
admitted that only 955 men had turned in their weapons and said the 
government doesnt know the whereabouts of the rest of the 2000 
men 
but tigani sysi darfurs governor told the associated press 
they have entered the jabal mara mountains near fasher where they 
are looting and robbing sudanese villages and travelers 
he said there are 32 different bandit gangs in western sudan 
the cooperative sudanesechadian effort follows a series of 
fruitless tries by the sudanese alone 
last month the cabinet committee decided to close sudans 
frontiers with both libya and chad but such a task is almost 
impossible considering that the 1000mile border is almost all 
desert

the next president could very well be forced 
to preside over a sharp decline in us living standards unless he 
acts quickly to deal with pressing international economic problems 
two staff members of the private council on foreign relations said 
wednesday 
the presidents ability to deal with economic problems has been 
fundamentally altered by the fact that financial markets have 
coalesced into a single worldwide market the specialists wrote in 
a new book after reagan confronting the changed world economy 
the next president will face more difficult constraints and 
more difficult choices than any of his predecessors over the last 
40 years c michael aho one of the authors told reporters at a 
briefing 
a president must face the voters only once every four years 
but he must face the judgment of the markets every business day 
said aho who is director of economic studies for the council if 
he doesnt have a credible economic policy markets could react 
sending the dollar plunging and interest rates soaring 
aho and his coauthor marc levinson pointed to the worldwide 
collapse of stock markets last oct 19 as a warning of what can 
happen if investors lose confidence in the ability of governments 
to manage their international affairs 
because of the huge trade deficits of the 1980s the united 
states has transferred billions of dollars into the hands of 
foreigners to pay for imported televisions and cars 
that situation has transformed the united states from the 
worlds largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country 
meaning that foreigners now own more in us assets than americans 
own in foreign assets 
aho and levinson predicted that this imbalance between us and 
foreign ownership of assets will hit 1 trillion in the early 
1990s the countrys net foreign obligations stood at 3682 
billion at the end of 1987 
a net debt poses the risk of lowering the us standard of 
living because americans will have to transfer between 40 billion 
and 50 billion annually overseas in debt service to foreigners 
money that will not be available in this country the authors said 
oho said the flow of foreign capital into the united states has 
helped to finance a consumption binge as americans and the 
government spent more than they were earning 
we are going to have to slow down our excess consumption and 
start servicing our debt he said 
the authors made the following policy recommendations for the 
next president 
the federal budget deficit which totaled an estimated 150 
billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 should be cut over 
the next four years through a combination of tax increases and cuts 
in defense spending and benefit programs such as social security 
and medicare 
growing pressures to erect protectionist trade barriers should 
be resisted but they said american trade negotiators need to be 
tougher in getting other nations to open their markets to us 
goods so that this country will be able to run a surplus in 
merchandise trade to help service the deficit it will have in 
investment earnings 
the policies of the world bank and the international monetary 
fund need a major overhaul in the area of third world debt the two 
organizations should be focusing their efforts on ways to reduce 
the 12 trillion debt of developing nations rather than pursuing 
endless strategies of rescheduling the debt payments 
the united states should abandon its effort with other major 
countries to prop up the value of the dollar and instead allow 
market forces to drive it lower the authors said without a further 
dollar devaluation americas trade deficit will not be eliminated 
aho said foreign capital markets will force the next president 
to deal with these problems very early in his term or risk a 
precipitous drop in the dollar caused by foreign investors losing 
confidence in the united states 
you get a sense that foreign investors are waiting for jan 21 
to see whether the next president will make the hard policy choices 
that will be needed he said 
the council on foreign affairs is a research organization that 
conducts studies on international issues

oliver l norths lawyers accused irancontra 
prosecutors wednesday of spinning novel theories of criminality 
to improperly charge the former presidential aide with illegal 
conduct 
in a virtual blizzard of motions to dismiss the 16 counts 
against north defense lawyers argued that independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh formulated new legal doctrines criminalizing 
conduct in the sensitive areas of foreign affairs and interbranch 
relations 
the defense also argued that the former national security 
council aide did not receive fair warning he could be 
prosecuted for making misleading statements in unsworn replies to 
congressional queries about covert aid to the contras 
such charges are unprecedented and were not made after false 
statements by government officials about such covert operations as 
the u2 spy plane shot down by the russians in 1960 and the cias 
support of indonesian rebels in 1958 the defense contended 
allegations that north and three codefendants illegally 
diverted proceeds of usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
rest on the faulty premise that the conspiracy violated the 
congressional ban on aid to the contras known as the boland 
amendment the defense said 
walsh could not more blatantly or improperly formulate 
policies for the government than to charge north after president 
reagan had determined that the boland amendment did not apply to 
the national security council staff the defense said 
nor was the conspiracy to defraud the government of proceeds 
from the arms sales a valid charge because there is no proof that 
the government was deprived of its property right to the 
proceeds of those transactions the defense said 
the major charges rest on entirely novel theories of 
criminality and wholly unprecedented applications of substantive 
statutes the defense said in filing 28 motions late tuesday the 
motions were note made public until wednesday nine other motions 
were filed under seal 
defense lawyers noted that norths allegedly false statements 
denying his role in helping the contras were made at an 
offtherecord session with members of the house select permanent 
committee on intelligence or were incorporated in written responses 
to house committees sent by the national security council in 1985 
and 1986 
congress never intended that an official could be charged for 
making unsworn statements and walshs decision to prosecute such 
informal exchanges promises to transform interbranch relations 
by criminalizing the winks and nods that characterize interbranch 
communications the defense said 
such charges impose on the executive branch the duty to be 
forthcoming to congress on pain of criminal prosecution not just 
political embarrassment defense lawyers brendan v sullivan jr 
and barry simon said in the pleadings 
the defense motions also attacked the validity of charges that 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter and two 
arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard 
v secord defrauded the government by diverting armssale profits 
to the contras 
secord acted as an agent of the us government and ensured that 
the cia was paid the prices it charged for the weapons sold to 
iran the defense said the defendants therefore cannot be charged 
with defrauding the government by diverting profits made during the 
arms sales to iran the defense charged 
separate trials have been ordered for each of the defendants and 
north is set to be tried first us district judge gerhard a 
gesell has not set a trial date 
a charge that north defrauded the government by using a 
taxexempt foundation to help raise 32 million for the contras 
rests on a controversial assumption that donations to the rebels 
couldnt be deducted as charitable contributions from donors 
income taxes the defense said 
walsh ignored repeated admonitions from the courts that 
pioneering interpretations of tax liability should be pursued 
civilly rather than criminally the defense said 
the independent counsel stretched the limits of the 
conspiracytodefraud statute to charge lt col north on the basis 
of a legal theory that no court has ever endorsed 
the retired marine officer never received fair notice that 
his fundraising would result in criminal prosecution the defense 
contended

americans were held for 17 days during the ordeal 
i was afraid that my wife and children thought i was dead 
said brown choking back tears 
brown 45 said he and other hostages were allowed to read 
magazines after they had been removed from the plane in beirut 
where us navy diver robert stethem was shot by the hijackers and 
tossed out on the runway to die the hijackers screamed marine 
at stethem while he was beaten and before he was shot witnesses

at this time i realized that my wife had been told i was 
killed because i had been a marine and it was published that a 
marine had been killed said brown 
hamadi is being tried for murder and air piracy in a heavily 
guarded courtroom in a frankfurts preungesheim prison which is 
surrounded by police with submachine guns 
brown described the first minutes after the jetliner was seized 
one man had a pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other 
brown said referring to alleged kidnapper hassan ezzeddine who is 
still at large 
the other man hamadi had a hand grenade in his hand i saw a 
grenade pin on the floor of the plane which to be honest with 
you frightened the hell out of me brown said 
he said he saw the hijackers running through the plane striking 
passengers 
i was able to see numerous times the brutality that both of 
the hijackers inflicted on the passengers they were hitting them 
right and left 
he said they sometimes leaned on the backs of seats and kicked 
passengers 
brown said he was later taken off the plane in beirut along with 
other passengers and taken to a slum house where other captors 
interrogated them 
we were taken later to an underground prison for the first 
seven days we did not brush our teeth or wash or change our 
clothes there were no newspapers and no news brown said 
the hostages were moved again to a third location where they 
were finally allowed to wash and read magazines he said 
he said the hijackers appeared welltrained for their mission 
the initial movements to take over the plane were done with 
such professionalism that without a doubt they controlled that 
plane brown said 
hamadi sat quietly throughout the testimony listening to his 
courtappointed interpreer 
brown who said he worked for a medical equipment company was 
not asked by the court to reveal his residence under court 
guidelines for the protection of witnesses 
on tuesday american leo byron tearfully recounted how hijackers 
hit and kicked crouching passengers including himself and his 
teenage daughter 
he also provided more description of how stethem was severely 
beaten before he was fatally shot 
his face was puffy he was very raw or bloody in the neck 
area he appeared to be dazed said byron 52 
byron said he did not see who fired the shot that killed 
stethem hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies 
killing stethem 
stethems parents richard and patricia stethem have attended 
each session of the trial which began july 5 
hamadi was arrested jan 13 1987 at frankfurt airport after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
west germany last year rejected a us extradition request for 
hamadi saying he would be tried in this country instead

michael dukakis has made a promise of 
universal health insurance a centerpiece of his presidential 
campaign and george bush wants to expand medicaid coverage for the 
poor 
but both candidates have shied away from detailed prescriptions 
for a host of other intractable medical problems that will confront 
the next president from the aids crisis to longterm care to the 
soaring costs of medicare 
health care is an issue that most americans are very concerned 
about and the candidates have not spent a lot of time on it 
said john rother legislative director for the american association 
of retired persons 
although neither bush nor dukakis has owned up to it the 87 
billion medicare program which provides health insurance for 28 
million elderly and 3 million disabled workers is almost certain 
to be a prime target for deficitreduction in the next congress 
physicians fees under medicare have risen at a 15 percent 
annual clip and congress is already studying ways to move away 
from the traditional method of reimbursing doctors for whatever 
their customary charges are 
theyve been rather quiet about what they would do with 
medicare our concern on medicare is that you cant keep ratcheting 
that program down and expect access for the elderly to continue 
said jack owen executive vice president of the american hospital 
association 
but health analyst jack meyer said the next administration 
if theyre serious about budget control has to put health care on 
the table 
americans spent 497 billion on health care in 1987 or 112 
percent of the gross national product a far larger share of gnp 
than any other industrialized country 
still 37 million americans have no health insurance most of 
them in families with someone in the workforce they are not old 
enough for medicare nor in most cases poor enough for medicaid 
the ranks of the uninsured have grown rapidly over the past 
decade as insurance premiums surged in step with medical charges 
and as jobs with extensive fringe benefits disappeared in 
industries such as manufacturing 
hospitals and physicians once shifted the cost of caring for the 
uninsured onto those who could pay but in recent years both the 
government and thirdparty insurers such as blue cross have balked 
at shouldering that burden 
the paying patients are driving much harder bargains said 
meyer president of a research firm called new directions for 
policy its much harder to bury these costs in somebody elses 
bill 
here is a look at the candidates positions on uninsured people 
longterm care and aids 
</TEXT>

dukakis calling it a disgrace that the united states is the 
only industrialized country other than south africa without 
universal health insurance proposes to help 22 million of the 
uninsured by backing legislation to order all but the smallest 
employers to arrange health insurance 
dukakis has also called for a 100 million program to provide 
medical and nutritional care to 200000 pregnant women who lack 
insurance or medicaid coverage 
i want to make sure that quality affordable health care is 
the birthright of every family and citizen in this land says the 
massachusetts governor whose state last april began requiring 
health insurance with most jobs 
while dukakis has said this requirement would not cost the 
federal treasury anything bush has labeled it a 35 billion tax on 
business that could force thousands out of work 
the vice president says he wants to allow poor people to buy 
into the 32 billion medicaid program which now covers 24 million 
of the needy 
he has not offered all the specifics but bush promises to press 
for mandatory medicaid coverage for all children living in poverty 
starting with infants 
the republican would phase in affordable coverage for pregnant 
women and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty line and 
eventually cover older children as well according to a position 
paper 
medicaid now covers less than half of all poor children leaving 
11 million unprotected 
but expanding medicaid will not be cheap 
meyer estimated it would cost 8 billion to 9 billion to cover 
all uninsured poor people

with 15 million people in nursing homes typically paying more 
than 20000 a year longterm care is one of the biggest worries 
for older americans and their families 
bush has proposed tax incentives to encourage people to buy 
their own longtermcare group insurance and allowing people to 
convert their iras savings accounts and life insurance to pay 
nursing home bills 
for those who cannot afford insurance bush favors easing 
medicaid requirements so they dont have to spend their life 
savings before becoming eligible 
dukakis has endorsed rep claude peppers 7 billionayear plan 
to provide firstdollar coverage of longterm care at home 
pepper the florida democrat would pay for this coverage by 
levying the 145 percent payroll tax for medicare on all wages 
instead of ending it at 45000 effectively raising the payroll 
tax for 8 million workers 
dukakis has suggested guaranteeing medicaid coverage for those 
who first exhaust private longterm insurance benefits

bush says we may have to spend even more than the current 1 
billion budget for the fight against the deadly virus but money 
alone wont stop aids he says education is crucial including 
giving students the facts in a thoughtful sensitive manner 
bush supports legislation that would make it a crime to 
discriminate against aids patients and those infected with the 
virus he said aids test results must be kept appropriately 
confidential 
dukakis also supports a 1 billionplus aids research and 
education budget 
as president i will educate the public about both the facts 
and the myths of this terrible disease he said children should 
be taught about the disease as part of a comprehensive health 
education program beginnning in the early grades

it was just two months ago that michael 
dukakis stood in the massachusetts statehouse and scorned 
republican george bush for having some of the highest negatives 
ever recorded in american politics 
he was referring to the percentage of people who rated the 
candidate unfavorably in public opinion polls 
two months later it is dukakis who has the high negatives 
polls released this week show the democratic nominees unfavorable 
rating now tops 40 percent exceeding that of bush 
republicans say that means americans dont like what they see as 
they learn about dukakis in no small way though theyve learned 
about dukakis through strongly negative television ads and other 
attacks by republicans 
dukakis has begun responding with his own negative assaults on 
television commercials and in speeches he belittles bushs running 
mate dan quayle accuses bush of plotting a raid on social 
security and says the vice president is a failed leader who lacks 
good judgment 
all this is part of what frequently is lamented as the negative 
nature of the 1988 presidential race 
minor issues or outright distortions are given highdecibel 
treatment while hardly a whisper is heard about the national debt 
relations with the soviets the aids epidemic or the hostages still 
held captive in lebanon 
some blame bush for trivializing the presidential campaign he 
has devoted weeks to attacking dukakis over the pledge of 
allegiance weekend furloughs for prison inmates membership in the 
american civil liberties union and the governors slowness in 
moving to clean up polluted boston harbor 
it is true its a very negative campaign and i say most of 
the blame lies with bush said william schneider poliical 
observer at the american enterprise institute a conservative think 
tank 
i say his campaign is probably the most disgraceful in modern 
american history schneider says it is also working it is 
both disgraceful and effective 
the negative campaign shouldnt come as much of a surprise 
though 
look what happened to two badluck candidates who talked about 
the deficit democrat bruce babbitt and republican robert dole 
like walter mondale four years earlier discovered to their chagrin 
that voters didnt want to hear about unpleasant realities 
the negative campaign is hardly a 1988 phenomenon 
it is more negative at an earlier stage than any presidential 
campaign ive seen said democratic consultant frank greer who 
has been advising dukakis on the debates the 1980s have seen a 
real escalation in the use of negative advertising 
greer says it follows the pattern in senate and gubernatorial 
races democrats have become accustomed over the past eight years 
to facing intensely negative campaigns centered on a few emotional 
issues in state races 
ncpac the national conservative political action committee ran 
a series of campaigns in which democratic incumbents were targeted 
with intensive negative television commercials on a few emotional 
issues in 1984 sen jesse helms of north carolina ran negative tv 
ads about his opponent for more than a year 
the democrats have learned to deal with such campaigns by 
responding forcefully 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen faced a ncpac 
campaign in texas in 1982 when he was seeking reelection he 
fired back and won easily 
on his campaign plane last weekend bentsen expressed relief 
that dukakis had finally begun responding with his own hardhitting 
ads 
where have they been he asked holding out his arms in an 
expression of frustration at the delay 
bentsen said the dukakis campaign should have responded 
immediately when after the democratic convention in july the 
republicans began attacks on dukakiss record and even his 
patriotism 
bush had some help too 
president reagans reference to dukakis as an invalid was 
quickly retracted but he succeeded in thrusting onto newspaper 
front pages the rumors that dukakis had hidden mental problems in 
the past the rumors were false by all evidence but the episode 
coincided with the beginning of dukakis summer slide in the polls 
some say dukakis and his advisers are to blame for failing to 
anticipate many of the attacks to recognize the visceral impact 
some were having and to respond before lasting damage was done 
dukakis after all has never run against a serious 
conservative republican campaign 
one reason why he frittered away 17 points was because he 
didnt respond and didnt go hard negative himself said larry 
sabato political scientist at the university of virginia 
you have to fight fire with fire you cant sit there and take 
it and you cant just occasionally respond and be defensive you 
have to give your response immediately in tough terms and then go 
on the attack yourself thats modern politics in a nutshell 
the reason campaigns have grown increasingly negative is that 
such attacks work the issues the bush campaign selected seemed to 
resonate with voters as symbols of something larger and unsettling 
bush attacked dukakis values schneider said 
he said dukakis hopes to score similarly with his attacks on 
quayle hoping it will register as a symbol of bushs judgment

brother jude pieterse generalsecretary of the bishops 
conference said a parcel containing two unexploded limpet mines 
was found in the archives room when employees were allowed to 
reenter the building at midday

that the house was occupied and yet they went ahead regardless of 
the consequences 
we earnestly pray that the perpetrators of this foul act will 
be persued and brought to justice it said 
the bishops said the attack should be viewed in the context of a 
tragic mess in which our country and its people find themselves 
because of apartheid and racial discrimination

people attending a church meeting in pretoria and sister brigid 
flanagan about 70 the associate generalsecretary of the bishops

said the arson attack was the work of ruthless rightwing urban 
guerrillas who seem to act with impunity

city council postponed its monthly 
meeting after a third councilman reported that vehicles were 
torched at his home and a bomb threat was called in to city hall 
officials said 
the burnings began in may when mayor truman scarboroughs 1985 
dodge aries station wagon was set on fire and destroyed on oct 2 
fire destroyed a 1986 cutlass supreme and a 1983 pontiac 6000 owned 
by vice mayor jim brown 
councilman tom mariani was the latest victim with fire 
destroying his daughters 1987 dodge shadow and damaging his 1980 
datsun and a small truck he had borrowed to haul campaign signs 
a bomb threat was reported at city hall later in the day 
the two other council members in this city near cape canaveral 
worry theyre next 
im not nearly as frightened for myself as i am for my 
family said nathan brown who is moving an antique ford to 
another location as a precaution if someone should come to my 
residence i am prepared to do what i have to do i am not a sheep 
ill leave it at that 
police patrols will be increased around the homes of all five 
council members said city manager randall reid tuesdays council 
meeting was rescheduled for next week 
police and fire investigators say they have no suspects and no 
motive which could be something as simple as anger over a zoning 
decision 
to me its really hard to grasp what the motive is fire 
chief richard cherry said is it because its an incumbent 
council or because theyre candidates or what 
mariani was awakened to the blaze in his driveway shortly after 
3 am tuesday by a neighbors barking dog on his way outside 
mariani said he heard a door slam and a car speed away with help 
from neighbors and passersby mariani kept the flames from 
reaching his house until firefighters arrived 
this is crazy you just dont do things like this said 
mariani who has been on the city council off and on for 11 years 
and is running for mayor this year im just numb i just cant 
believe there are people in our titusville community who would do 
this

a former volunteer firefighter was 
arrested and charged in connection with one of the arson fires that 
have brought months of fear and sleepless nights to this town 
police said today 
plainclothes police officers hustled lance lalumiere 23 into 
the police station in neighboring lancaster this afternoon and he 
was arraigned in district court there later on a single felony 
arson charge 
since may 21 fires have been set in the white mountains town of 
850 people months marked by anger sadness worry and suspicion 
no one has been injured but there have been some close calls 
the fire for which lalumiere was charged occurred aug 23 at his 
brothers home it was the 19th in the series of fires 
officials declined to comment on whether lalumiere was a suspect 
in any other of the fires state police scheduled a news conference 
for later in the day 
the charge filed today was based on a state police complaint at 
arraignment in lancaster district court judge paul donovan set 
bail at 50000 cash 
state police have released few details of their investigation 
which includes members of the state fire marshals office the 
federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and help from the 
fbi 
on tuesday lalumiere was taken to a nearby state police 
barracks his brother michael told the weekly coos county democrat 
after the fire broke out at michaels home in august lance 
lalumiere reported it and was trying to put it out when others 
arrived he was questioned for eight hours and police searched his 
home and car but he was not arrested at the time in interviews 
with the democrat he denied involvement in the fires 
lance lalumiere was asked to quit jeffersons volunteer fire 
deparment when he moved to nearby groveton he has since moved back 
to jefferson where he works nights as a dishwasher at a restaurant 
the blazes changed the rhythm of life in jefferson many 
families began sleeping in shifts and abandoned vacation and social 
plans some residents began nighttime patrols to try to catch the 
arsonist guns were left by the door in many homes 
as the months passed the initial shock became tempered by anger 
and for some resignation the vigils persist but have in recent 
weeks been tinged with the knowledge that this exhausting nocturnal 
life cannot continue forever 
i have a feeling were developing the same callus you develop 
in belfast or beirut said charles bond a state senator and 
jefferson resident before todays arrest was announced if a car 
bomb is going to blow up in front of your house its going to 
happen youre scared but you have to live with it 
the volunteer fire departments 32 current members and 12 other 
people have taken polygraph tests jefferson has no police force 
in all of the villages 52 square miles of scenic meadows woods 
and hills there are only 363 residences and three blocks now the 
vistas are pockmarked by burnedout shells some on back roads and 
many on main thoroughfares 
most of the fires were set late at night many at the back of 
the buildings they began with brush and fields then escalated to 
barns empty homes and occupied homes no one has been killed or 
seriously hurt though some barely escaped with their lives and 
some have lost their homes 
a mother of two normally softspoken now bites off her words 
with anger i want this person to suffer i want him caught so he 
can hurt a little like we have said the woman who like many 
residents spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal 
jeffersons families have prepared for each restless night by 
activating lights around their homes that come on automatically 
when they sense motion and letting porch lights burn through the 
darkness some settle in for nightlong vigils of coffee nerves and 
sleeplessness 
unmarked patrol cars cruise the village on their way to back 
roads police routinely stop cars traveling through town at night 
and ask for license and registration 
tourists flocking to see new hampshires famous fall foliage are 
surprised to learn this is the town theyve seen on national 
television and have read about in newspapers 
despite the natural beauty many residents are hoping autumn 
will pass quickly and winter snowfall will either make it easier to 
track down the arsonist or deter him but john harrigan publisher 
of the democrat disagrees 
i dont want it to snow and i dont want the fires to stop 
said harrigan whose home was damaged by a fire set in early 
august one more fire could mean one more mistake by the 
arsonist leading to an arrest

a study of aids virus screening among military 
recruits found that only one was wrongly identified as infected 
discounting fears that too many people will be mislabeled if there 
is widespread testing a researcher said 
the public should know that if they choose to they can do 
early diagnosis of hiv infection cheaply they can do it in a 
logistically feasible way and they can do it with a great deal of 
accuracy said dr robert r redfield of the walter reed army 
institute of research in washington 
the latest findings published in thursdays new england journal 
of medicine were based on the first 20 months of military 
screening of all recruits just one of the 135187 people tested 
from rural areas was misclassified as infected 
the test which reveals the presence of antibodies formed when a 
person is exposed to the aids virus is used to screen donated 
blood and also offered by public health agencies to check those at 
high risk of the disease such as homosexual men and drug addicts 
many of those testing positive for the virus will go on to 
develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome a crippling of the 
bodys immune system that leaves a person prey to lifethreatening 
cancers and infections there is no cure 
experts disagree over whether hiv screening should remain 
largely voluntary or whether it should be expanded to include 
mandatory testing in some situations of people at low risk of 
aids such as hospital patients 
opponents argue that among other things such broad testing 
could falsely label many healthy people as infected for instance 
dr klemens b meyer of new england medical center has suggested 
that of every 10 lowrisk people with positive aids tests nine of 
them might actually be free of the virus 
redfield who is one of the nations most persistent advocates 
of widespread testing said the latest findings show this is 
untrue he believes doctors should routinely check for aids just as 
they do for cancer heart disease and other illnesses 
he suggests that aids screening be part of routine testing of 
hospital patients pregnant women marriage license applicants and 
clients of venereal disease and drug abuse programs the aim is to 
spot the hiv infection early when its symptoms can often be 
controlled and when carriers can be persuaded not to spread the 
disease to others 
dr harvey fineberg dean of the harvard school of public 
health said that while the latest data help build the case for 
widespread screening they are not sufficient to shift the 
balance altogether 
issues of confidentiality of test results and possible 
discrimination against infected people still must be settled he 
said promoting condom and spermicide use fighting drug abuse and 
providing clean needles are more economical ways to stop the spread 
of aids 
dr robin weiss of the institute of medicine agreed that despite 
the tests accuracy it should remain voluntary at least for now 
there is no overwhelmingly compelling reason at this moment to 
endorse mandatory widespread population screening she said 
because the answer to the question what is the purpose of the 
test and what would you do with the results is unclear there is 
no treatment there is no way to ensure that people will change 
their behavior and not spread the disease 
others question whether commercial labs will perform the aids 
test as accurately as the military 
dr lawrence miike of the congressional office of technology 
assessment acknowledged the militarys phenomenally high accuracy 
rate but added im not worried about them im worried about 
labs that advertise come get your hiv test i get calls from 
people who say they are the victims of false positives 
klemens agreed the question is not how well the best 
laboratories can do he said the issue is how well most 
laboratories are performing whether they will maintain this 
performance and whether it is good enough 
to this redfield responded i think its an unusual time when 
the department of defense can do things cheaper quicker and more 
accurate than the private sector 
redfield said the military testing has actually improved since 
the first 20 months of the program and mistakenly false results 
are now probably only one in 1 million he said the test costs 3 
per person and the results are ready within three days 
there have been 74809 cases of aids reported in the united 
states since june 1981 according to the centers for disease 
controls oct 6 statistics with 42142 deaths or 56 percent of 
all cases

sobs rose to the choir loft of a smalltown 
church as caskets were closed at a funeral service wednesday for 
three of the five seventhgrade girls killed when a speeding car 
jumped a curb and struck them 
about 1000 people many of them young filled the assumption of 
blessed virgin mary roman catholic church for the joint funeral for 
laura karcz and brenda hylok both 13 and nicole watia one month 
shy of her 13th birthday 
services were scheduled later wednesday for the other two 
victims jodi prokop and jessica mckeefry both 13 
the rev jordan kuczwara told mourners they could cry and then 
go back to their lives or thank god for the gift of the girls 
short lives and learn something from them 
thirteen years young but old enough to achieve something 
he said adding that the girls needed no drugs or alcohol but found 
happiness in their friends family and faith 
remember students dont cry for them cry for those who 
are looking for other ways to find happiness kuczwara said 
many sobbed as the three caskets were closed 
the girls were killed friday night when a cadillac traveling at 
an estimated 70 mph jumped a curb sheared a utility police and 
struck them on a sidewalk along a residential street about two 
blocks from the police station 
investigators planned to check the car for possible mechanical 
problems and to investigate whether the 17yearold driver a 
diabetic may have suffered a seizure said police chief reed

under legislation approved wednesday by 
congress a commission will recommend by dec 31 which of the 
nations military installations should be closed 
the commission will examine all 3800 military facilities in the 
united states although it will concentrate on the 550 largest 
installations those which each employ more than 300 civilians 
no list either official or unofficial has been released by the 
commission legislators noted wednesay thus there is no way to yet 
know which bases might be closed 
but critics have long pointed to a trio of bases which they say 
represent facilities that could be closed with little harm to the 
nations defense 
the three are fort douglas utah built more than a century ago 
to protect stagecoach routes fort monroe va built inside a moat 
to defend against the british invasion in the war of 1812 and fort 
sheridan ill where the major features are a golf course and two 
beaches on lake michigan 
another potential facility to be closed may be loring air force 
base in northern maine a strategic air command base which the air 
force proposed closing in 1975 it was that proposal which prompted 
congress to erect stiff hurdles against base closings 
in 1985 the pentagon prepared a list of bases which it said 
could be closed that list will likely be reviewed by the 
commission 
the 1985 list included fort devens mass cameron station va 
fort wingate depot nm blytheville air force base ark the 
refueling wing at mcconnell air force base kan the philadelphia 
naval shipyard naval regional medical center oakland calif new 
cumberland army depot pa and letterkenny army depot pa

a yearold program to promote the safety of 
socalled latchkey children who are home alone while their parents 
work is being expanded to include a tollfree hotline to a national 
resource center organizers said wednesday 
parents and other adults seeking information about the care of 
schoolage children can call a hotline for project home safe a 
national program developed by the american home economics 
association and financed by the whirlpool foundation 
the threeyear project began a year ago and provides research 
training materials and standards on how to improve the care of 
schoolage youth the term latchkey children dates back to the 
19th century when workingclass children who were on their own wore 
their house keys on neck chains 
gladys gary vaughn the associations research unit 
administrator said at a news conference that todays latchkey 
children number an estimated 65 million and cross racial ethnic 
economic and geographic lines 
she was joined by rep pat schroeder dcolo who said few 
families can attain the american dream of children college 
home ownership cars and health insurance on just one income 
anymore

the four panamanian members of the commission 
that operates the panama canal boycotted the quarterly meeting 
wednesday in protest of us policies toward the military leader 
manuel noriegas rule 
it was the second time since january the four have refused to 
attend but the five us members were able to conduct business 
it does deprive the commission of the input of the panamanian 
members with regard to panamanian interests commission chairman 
william gianelli said 
at wednesdays daylong closed session he said members 
discussed the commissions 500 million budget and details of 
moving dependents of some 1100 canal commission employees back 
home to the united states should they decide to voluntarily leave 
during the current tensions between the us and panama 
the commission was formed as a result of the 1977 treaty in 
which the united states agreed to turn over ownership of the canal 
to panama by the year 2000 
the panamanians boycott followed the indictment of noriega on 
us drug charges pressure from the reagan administration for 
noriega to step down imposition of economic sanctions against 
panama refusal by the united states to recognize noriegas chosen 
president and this countrys continued recognition of ousted

slovenia the nations most liberal 
republic accused serbia again wednesday of fanning ethnic turmoil 
that has combined with economic chaos to create a political crisis 
the attack by slovenias communist party leader milan kucan on 
nationalist rallies by serbs came the day after serbian party 
leader slobodan milosevic made a strong defense of the mass 
demonstrators at which supporters often shout his name 
kucan told the slovene partys central committee 
it is not hard to kindle fires of political nationalist 
social and other passions but one should also think about what 
remains after the fire burnedout structures take time to be 
covered with oblivion 
it is the final hour for sobering up for halting insanity 
which is driving us to destruction and the last moment to stop 
those who are using and manipulating peoples misfortunes 
weeks of strikes public protest and ethnic unrest have plagued 
yugoslavia which has not had strong leadership since president 
tito died in 1980 
inflation running at an annual rate of 217 percent the foreign 
debt is 21 billion and 15 percent of yugoslav workers are 
unemployed austerity measures imposed in may have cut real wages 
while prices continue to rise 
the split in the slavic camp between serbs and slovenes is part 
of political maneuvering before a meeting of the national partys 
central committee oct 17 which is expected to produce a showdown 
and leadership changes 
stipe suvar chief of the national party promised a major 
shakeup after protesting throngs demanded the resignation of 
leaders blamed by workers and farmers for the worst economic crisis 
since world war ii 
there is broad consensus that radical economic reform is needed 
but the ethnic unrest which developed into antigovernment 
demonstrations last weekend has split the leaderships of the 
national and regional parties 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure serbia 
is the largest republic and both provinces kosovo and vojvodina 
are part of its territory 
tito specified the decentralized system of government and 
collective federal presidency in his 1974 constitution to prevent 
one republic from gaining sway over the others but the result has 
been ineffective government by compromise 
kucan urged national party members wednesday to avoid a 
wholesale purge which he said would not solve the nations 
problems 
he said mass protests oct 67 brought yugoslavia to the 
threshhold of an extraordinary situation in which some 
elements in yugoslavia left unidentified would have welcomed 
military intervention 
do the proponents of these demands indeed fail to see that 
they only support the suspesion of the legal legitimate system 
he asked 
in a direct attack on the serbian leadership which on monday 
attacked the slovenian partys weekend statement criticizing 
serbia kucan denounced the vehemence aggression and the 
unsubstantiated nature of the reaction of the comrades from 
serbia 
a meeting between members of the national partys ruling 
politburo and the communist leadership of ethnically troubled 
kosovo province ended early wednesday with no resolution of serbian 
demands for the dismissal of three senior kosovo party figures 
serbias central committee made the demand tuesday in the 
meeting in which milosevic defended mass rallies of serbs 
slavic residents of kosovo a southern province adjacent to 
albania claim they are victimized by ethnic albanians who make up 
90 percent of kosovos population

emperor hirohito who has been bedridden with 
intestinal hemorrhaging for three weeks has grown weaker as his 
anemia and jaundice worsen imperial palace officials and news 
reports said wednesday 
doctors gave the 87yearold emperor more blood in an attempt to 
reduce the anemia said kenji maeda a spokesman for the imperial 
household agency 
officials said hirohitos strength was declining because doctors 
were unable to supply enough nutrients through intravenous feeding 
the emperor the worlds longestreigning monarch has not been 
able to eat anything except for two ice cubes and a few spoonfuls 
of porridge since his condition worsened sept 19 
although the emperor did not discharge any blood wednesday a 
palace official said wednesday he could not rule out the 
possibility of internal bleeding from his intestine 
palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports 
that hirohito has cancer in his upper digestive system and they 
have urged the media to refrain from such speculation 
china announced that foreign minister qian qichen has postponed 
a planned trip to japan because of the emperors illness qian was 
to visit oct 2025 to mark the 10th anniversary of a peace and 
friendship treaty between the two countries 
hirohito has no political power but serves as a symbol of the 
unity of japan until hirohito renounced his divinity after world 
war ii emperors were considered living gods 
since hirohitos condition worsened about 4 million japanese 
have signed registers around the country to express their hopes for 
his recovery 
however the emperors status has remained controversial since 
the war when his name was used to rally support for japan

the hunt crossed three continents and required 
hundreds of computers but a team of researchers captured a prize 
few thought possible the prime factors of the 100digit number on 
mathematicians most wanted list 
the breakthrough could have important implications for 
governments and banks which use largedigit numbers in security 
systems on the assumption they provide a code too difficult to 
break 
but the pleasure of the hunt concerned researchers more 
why did we go after it university of chicago computer 
scientist arjen lenstra said wednesday because people compile 
lists 
the number which begins 9412343607 and stretches on for 
90 more digits defied all previous efforts to find its prime 
factors 
the factors of a number are two numbers that when multiplied 
together yield the larger number a prime number is one that is 
evenly divisible only by 1 or itself 
the prime factors of 21 for example are 3 and 7 by 
comparison the prime numbers that solved the 100digit number are 
respectively 41 digits and 60 digits long 
finding the prime factors of such large numbers was thought to 
be so difficult in fact that many security systems assume such 
computations to be beyond the range of even the most powerful 
computers being applied for long periods of time 
governments transfer secret messages and banks transfer funds 
electronically by encoding the information in largedigit numbers 
that require the receiver to know its prime factors in order to 
decipher the information 
ten years ago everybody suggested 80 digits were safe 
nowadays thats trivial said lenstra codirector of the project 
with dr mark manasse of the digital equipment corps systems 
research center in palo alto calif 
i think 150 is reasonable he continued but personally 
id go a little beyond 200 now 
computer scientists had theorized that a single computer doing a 
million calculations per second would have needed 25 years to solve 
the problem even a stateoftheart supercomputer such as the cray 
would need about 10 months of constant computing that at a cost 
of thousands of dollars per hour 
lenstra and manasse however factored the number in just 26 
days 
they began their attack on the 100digit number by breaking the 
problem into smaller tasks then farmed them out to about 400 
computers in the united states europe and australia through an 
exisiting electronic mail network 
all the computers used in the project worked on the factoring 
problem only when they were not being used for anything else each 
time a problem was solved it was relayed by electronic mail to 
digitals palo alto lab 
the last sequence of numbers required to solve the entire 
problem flashed across a computer screen at 203 am pdt tuesday 
one of the really nice things about this effort is that it 
cost us virtually nothing lenstra said we contacted friends 
other computer scientists anybody that thought factoring was fun 
and got them to participate 
lenstra 32 a visiting professor in chicagos computer science 
department is unsure where the next horizon lies he said every 
time the length of the number goes up by three digits the time 
needed to compute the prime factors doubles 
but we dont know what our problemsolving limit is until we 
find out how much interest is out there and how big an electronic 
mail network we can assemble 
weve already started on a 102digit number he concluded 
just to keep us busy

the future of the biennial race against time 
which raised millions of dollars for the worlds poor hung in the 
balance wednesday when its sponsor went into voluntary liquidation 
sport for sport aid ltd which organized the series of sixmile 
road runs in 128 countries relied on sales of tshirts entry fees 
and television videos to pay for administrative costs 
sport aid blamed its collapse on an august mail strike in 
britain that hampered the distribution of sponsorship forms only 
215000 britons onethird the expected turnout took part in the 
sept 11 event 
the charity backed by the company sport aid foundation is 
unaffected and is still receiving money said company spokesman 
nick cater 
the company owes creditors 39 million cater said 
the accounting firm deloitte haskins and sells has been 
appointed to clear the companys debts money raised by people who 
took part in the race against time wont be used to pay off 
creditors said a spokeswoman who requested anonymity 
the question of whether we will be back and do it all again 
depends on the people on the ground and those who took part he 
said they put heart and soul into the event they will decide 
what is to happen 
the first sport aid race on may 25 1986 attracted nearly 20 
million runners in 89 countries and raised more than 35 million 
for african famine victims 
the amount raised by sport aid 88 will not be known until the 
end of the year cater said a third race had been planned for 1990

the environmental protection agency said 
wednesday it will permit the use of cancercausing pesticides whose 
residues on foods are increased during processing if the risk of 
cancer is negligible 
the agency so far has interpreted the socalled delaney 
clause barring cancercausing food additives as requiring it to 
refuse new pesticide licenses for such chemicals 
the reversal of policy is in line with one of the 
recommendations of a national academy of sciences panel last year 
jack moore epas deputy administrator said the change clears 
the way for decisions on 73 old pesticides licensed when standards 
were looser for which there is some evidence of cancercausing 
power it also may permit the licensing of weakly carcinogenic new 
chemicals which might be safer than current compounds 
at least a dozen chemicals are known to be in the second group 
but not all have current license applications pending 
if you dont let the new chemical on the market therell 
never be an opportunity to retire the old one either through 
regulations or competitive pressure moore said 
asked if he was arguing that the new policy would mean safer 
food he replied yes thats not a conclusion the agency came to 
by itself its also the conclusion of the academy report 
epas new policy defines as negligible risk a maximum 
oneinamillion chance of getting cancer from the residue in 
question over a lifetime 
environmentalists denounced the action we are horrified 
said janet hathaway of the natural resources defense council it 
amounts to rewriting the delaney clause and completely gutting the 
delaney clause 
jay feldman coordinator of the national campaign against the 
misuse of pesticides said a oneinamillion standard might be 
acceptable in principle but not for a single pesticide considered 
apart from all the others 
the agency has no proposal to curtail additive risk were 
talking about significant exposure when all chemicals are 
considered he said 
the delaney clause named for its 1958 sponsor thenrep 
james j delaney dny is in the federal food drug and cosmetic 
act it bars the use of any food additive shown to cause cancer in 
man or animal the act classifies as additives those pesticides 
whose residue is concentrated during processing 
the same act requires epa to set maximum permissible 
concentrations for pesticide residues on both raw and processed 
food and no pesticide leaving a residue may be used if such a 
tolerance has not been established 
the delaney clause does not apply to raw foods and under the 
separate pesticide law epa can permit the use of pesticides that 
cause cancer if the benefits outweigh the risk 
the food and drug administration was rebuffed in court in trying 
to use a similar oneinamillion negligible risk standard for 
food coloring under the delaney clause but moore said the court 
went out of its way to point out that the language of the 
cosmetic act may not apply directly to food additives 
associated with pesticide use 
the old chemicals of which moore spoke about 50 of which are 
known to concentrate during processing have been in a regulatory 
limbo for several years 
these and many other chemicals were licensed when standards were 
much looser epa since the late 1970s has been gathering data from 
laboratory animal and other tests to relicense all 656 chemicals 
used as active ingredients in pesticides about 300 are used on 
foods 
new data for the 73 chemicals showed if we were to apply a 
rigid delaney approach those old pesticides would have to come off 
the market moore said 
a zero risk policy is totally infeasible as we sit here 
today there would be so many pesticide uses being curtailed wed 
cause dramatic and deep disruption in the food supply moore said 
both ms hathaway and feldman said epa has been obliged all 
along to use the delaney clause against old pesticides when new 
data become available regardless of whether the clause bars 
licensing of certain new chemicals

consumer environmental and farm groups 
launched wednesday a drive for further tightening of curbs on the 
use of chemical pesticides on the nations crops 
we are drenching our food and drowning the nation in an 
everincreasing amount of agricultural chemicals declared john 
oconnor director of the newly launched national toxics campaign 
the coalition was billed at a news conference as a switch from 
past campaigns to curb pesticides in which environmentalists and 
farmers have found themselves at odds 
american agriculture movement and the national farmers union 
officials on hand praised the coalitions stress on restricting the 
supply of farm crops and thus raising farm prices as a prelude 
to scaling back pesticide use 
absent were the national farm bureau and other groups that 
traditionally represent a broad sweep of agribusiness as well as 
politically influential producer groups such as the corn wheat 
and soybean growers associations many farmers remain opposed to 
additional pesticide curbs and chilly toward environmentalists 
environmentalists have been campaigning for 26 years for 
tightened controls over pesticides citing evidence that more than 
50 basic ingredients in chemicals sprayed on us crops cause 
cancer in laboratory animals as well as an array of other health 
problems 
congress last month approved legislation that would set a 
nineyear deadline for completion of safety testing by the 
environmental protection agency of more than 600 active ingredients 
in pesticides at the current pace the job would take until the 
year 2024 congressional investigators estimate 
even sponsors of the legislation however have been painting it 
as a barebones measure that represented merely the best compromise 
that could be reached for the time being they have been urging 
action next year to combat increasing pesticide contamination of 
groundwater the basic drinking supply for an estimated 113 
million americans 
at its news conference the national toxics campaign issued a 
35page report detailing the pesticide problem it mainly 
represented a recycling of data that have appeared in previous 
documents examining the issue 
it called for both control of the supply of agricultural 
commodities and a program of integrated pest management as 
well as new pesticide curbs 
supply management opposed by many farm groups would go into 
effect under legislation sponsored by sen tom harkin diowa and 
rep richard gephardt dmo its aim is to prevent enormous 
surpluses that drive down farm prices 
a few groups such as the national save the family farm 
coalition have long been campaigning for such a measure which was 
nevertheless shelved early in the current session of congress they 
say better farm prices would offset production losses as a result 
of reduced reliance on pesticides 
family farmers are ready to reduce their use of expensive and 
dangerous chemicals but federal policies stand in our way 
susan denser of the family farm coalition told the news conference 
consumer advocate ralph nader also on hand for the news 
conference said keeping families on the farm was an important goal 
to avoid oligarchy domination of agribusiness plantations 
integrated pest managment another goal of the coalition stands 
for a variety of techniques such as reduced pesticide use tilling 
in a manner that protects crops from pests and scouting farm fields 
to avoid needless spraying 
federal monitoring of pesticides in groundwater and an array of 
other measures left out of this years pesticide bill also are 
being advocated by the coalition as part of a farm bill that may be 
written next year 
meanwhile the us public interest research group said 
congressional candidates received more than 4 million in campaign 
contributions from pesticide manufacturers over the last five years 
the contributions were made by political action committees 
operated by 21 member companies of the national agricultural 
chemicals association which represents pesticide manufacturers 
the capitol hillbased group said it noted the chemical companies 
opposition to groundwater provisions supported by most 
environmentalists 
there is a strong correlation between chemical company 
contributions to a politician and that politicians vote on 
regulatiion of the chemical industry said rick hind of the 
research group 
he said the chemical companies were applying agricultural 
techniques to capitol hill they sow campaign contributions and 
reap legislation that allows them to operate with minimal 
government oversight

soldiers blew up four palestinian homes and 
sealed five others wednesday in reprisal for the murder of arabs 
who collaborated with israel palestinians hurled a grenade at a 
troop bus but missed 
noting an increased use of guns and grenades by palestinian 
activists defense minister yitzhak rabin suggested there had been 
a shift in palestinian tactics from stones to more sophisticated 
weapons 
once they shift from civilian violence to terror for me it is 
proof that they failed to achieve their goals by what they call the 
intefadeh rabin said using the arabic word for uprising 
but clashes continued in the occupied territories israel radio 
reported seven palestinians wounded four in the west bank and 
three in the gaza strip 
in the gaza strip sources said a grenade was thrown between a 
bus carrying soldiers and a civilian car the army said no injuries 
resulted and soldiers sealed the area and detained a number of 
palestinians 
a day earlier a grenade was thrown at an army jeep wounding 
two soldiers in the legs 
rabin speaking to a foreign press association luncheon noted 
wednesdays incident was the third time grenades had been hurled in 
the recent days and that a village leader had been shot to death 
with an assault rifle by plo enforcers 
he said terror attacks had declined in the occupied lands in the 
past 10 months as palestinian activists focused on largescale 
demonstrations and stonethrowing confrontations 
but the defense minister said the army had succeeded in stopping 
big protests and in recent days there had been a upsurge in the use 
of bullets bombs and grenades 
it represents a failure by them to create a number of violent 
incidents by simple means and therefore a beginning by this small 
group to return to terror as it was used in the past rabin said 
the army did not identify the group behind the latest grenade 
attacks but arab journalists in the gaza strip said rumors 
circulated that the attacks were the work of islamic militants 
palestinian sources said yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization was not involved and prominent palestinians said they 
were not aware of any change in plo policy 
plo leaders have said palestinian protesters had access to 
weapons but had been instructed not to use them in confrontations 
with israelis 
the restraint has won palestinians international sympathy and 
the embargo on terror is an essential ingredient for any 
palestinianisraeli dialogue after israels nov 1 general election 
rabin said he believed the use of bullets by palestinians may be 
an effort to prod plo leaders into taking a stand politically on 
negotiations with israel 
but many of the recent casualties have coincided with steppedup 
arrest raids and the introduction of plastic bullets 
since the beginning of the month 15 palesitinans have been 
killed and scores wounded raising the overall death toll to 295 
since the uprising began dec 8 
ten suspected arab collabators with israeli authorities have 
been killed since last december including three who were stabbed 
to death in recent weeks in nablus about 30 miles north of 
jerusalem 
soldiers blew up four houses in nablus and sealed five others 
maj gen amram mitzna military commander of the west bank 
said the houses belonged to palestinian members of a group 
responsible for killing the arabs who cooperated with israel 
the united states has asked israel to stop the policy of blowing 
up houses because it is done without court hearings 
a pool of israeli reporters witnessed the houseblowing 
operation wednesday but foreign reporters and photographers were 
banned 
roni shaked a reporter for the daily yediot ahronot saw the 
explosions and said the early morning reaction prompted immediate 
protests 
immediately after the blast before the column of smoke rose 
up to the sky terrible shouts came from all the windows and 
doorways of the neighborhood he said 
the reporter said there were calls of allahu akbar arabic 
for god is great 
it was a call for battle for revenge for many long 
minutes this call hung in the air along with many whistles he 
said 
the city of 120000 has been under curfew since violent riots 
erupted friday after rumors circulated that israeli troops had 
opened fire on a mosque killing four palestinians and killed 
another palestinian who had his arms bound behind his back 
the army denied soldiers shot into a mosque and the jerusalem 
post quoted the army as saying soldiers had handcuffed a prisoner 
not realizing in the dark that he had been wounded he later died

vice president george bush engaged in some 
light preparation on wednesday for a second nationally televised 
presidential debate he said would show americans what my 
heartbeat is what i really care about 
bush sandwiched several hours of debate preparation in between a 
morning jog and a baseball playoff game at night 
the republican presidential nomineee expressed confidence about 
thursdays second nationally televised debate with rival michael 
dukakis and told reporters we do seem to be looking a little 
stronger politically these days 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate said the vice president planned 
only several hours of debate preparation with aides wednesday and 
would not have any further mock debates the last such sessions 
occurred tuesday morning and last saturday in washington with 
sparring partner richard darman a former deputy treasury secretary 
bush planned to take off the rest of the day to attend the 
seventh and deciding game at dodger stadium in the national league 
championship series between los angeles and the new york mets 
asked by reporters what he hoped to accomplish in the second 
debate bush said what i want to is have them americans 
understand what my heartbeat is what i really care about 
he said those areas included foreign affairs the defense of 
this country world peace how i as president would build on that 
bush added that he planned to cite fewer statistics in the 
debate and talk more on how i would like to lead this country 
where id like to see us be in the nineties if im elected 
president 
so i want to spell it out on that broader sense this time and 
let the others nitpick on all these other little numbers and 
statistics he said 
he denied anew that he had been engaging in negative campaigning 
against dukakis saying what i have to do is make him be what he 
is and that he seems reluctant to do and then ive got to be what 
i am and that second part is what i really want to concentrate on 
at this debate 
he cant run away from his past he cant say today that hes 
mainstream when hes been on the lefthand spectrum of the american 
political process 
the vice president also jogged for about 20 minutes in a 
municipal park with about a dozen students from the university of 
california los angeles who all wore bushquayle tshirts 
in a briefing for reporters ms tate said that bush wasnt 
worried about the possibility of a surprise blow from dukakis 
hes pretty good at dodging and weaving she said i dont 
think well worry too much about unexpected blows 
she also said she doubted bush would rely heavily on oneliners 
in this debate it ought not to be reduced to some kind of 
showbusiness sting of oneliners she said and if it is the 
voters wont get as much out of it 
weeks of stories about handlers and crafting oneliners and 
strategic responses takes a toll i think they lose some 
credibility 
comparing this debate with the last one she said we rate 
them pretty much the same 
and she warned dont expect to see a different bush this time 
around 
what you see pretty much is what you get she said youre 
not going to see an entirely different type of debate from his 
standpoint

former cambodian head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk said wednesday after meeting with secretary of state 
george p shultz that moderate elements of the khmer rouge should 
be included in a new coalition government in cambodia once 
vietnamese troops withdraw 
while restating his view that khmer rouge leaders who were 
responsible for genocide against the cambodian people a decade 
ago must be excluded sihanouk said moderate elements could be 
included in a new collegial system 
then we could control them sihanouk told reporters at the 
state department adding that to exclude all elements of the khmer 
rouge would make them bandits 
the khmer rouge which is believed to have killed between 1 
million and 2 million cambodians during their 197578 rule is one 
of three factions fighting the vietnamesebacked government in 
phnom penh 
based on his talks here which included a meeting tuesday with 
president reagan sihanouk said his view of the situation in 
cambodia and that of the united states are practically the same 
shultz reaffirmed the longstanding us position that elements 
of an acceptable settlement include a complete withdrawal of 
vietnamese forces and the emergence of a coalition government not 
dominated by any faction 
we simply cannot see a return to power of the khmer rouge 
shultz said 
sihanouk who was deposed in a 1970 military coup reaffirmed 
his view that leaders of the khmer rouge should be exiled perhaps 
in china 
but they must not participate in the new government only the 
ones who are the moderates who are not responsible for the genocide 
should be accepted he said 
the reagan administration is providing 5 million in nonlethal 
assistance to the two anticommunist rebel groups and is consulting 
with members of congress about the possibility of an increase 
vietnam has set a 1990 deadline for completing a withdrawal of its 
troops 
the khmer rouge is said to be the strongest of the three 
factions fighting the provietnamese government and a major 
international effort is under way to ensure that that group does 
not play a dominant role in cambodias future political evolution 
particularly active in this effort have been the six members of 
the association of southeast asian nations thailand indonesia 
malaysia singapore the philippines and brunei 
one of the measures being discussed to limit the khmer rouge 
role is the establishment of an international peacekeeping force 
other measures under discussion include the disarming of all 
cambodian factions and removing leading khmer rouge figures from 
cambodia

house dispute over nontax amendments delayed negotiations 
wednesday on a compromise package of tax cuts and increases 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said he doubts the bill can become law this year 
unless negotiators complete their work on friday 
but squabbling over some senate amendments delayed even the 
appointment of the house negotiators who would be led by 
rostenkowski the delay forced cancellation of a scheduled 
negotiating session wednesday 
at issue are amendments protecting the manassas battlefield in 
virginia against some commercial development and proposed 
sanctions against iraq for using poison gas against some minority 
citizens 
the manassas amendment is under jurisdiction of the house 
interior committee the iraq amendment falls under the house 
foreign affairs committee those committees could be expected to 
demand representation among the house negotiators which 
rostenkowski opposes 
wilson morris a spokesman for house speaker jim wright said he 
expected the problem to be worked out possibly in time for 
negotiators to begin work thursday 
the house and senate bills are designed primarily to correct 
errors in the 1986 tax overhaul they also include dozens of other 
amendments that cut some taxes and raise others the senate bill 
would raise about 3 billion over three years the house version 
between 71 billion and 75 billion

hospital after finding no evidence that federal laws were broken 
an agency spokesman said 
ernest and regina twigg a langhorne pa couple who sought the 
inquiry can ask state officials to investigate whether violations 
of law occurred fbi spokesman russ wood said tuesday 
the twiggs claim their newborn was stolen at hardee memorial 
hospital in wauchula nearly 10 years ago mrs twigg maintains her 
healthy baby girl was switched for a sickly child and that records 
were altered to hide the swap 
genetic blood tests this summer showed that the child they 
raised for nearly 10 years arlena was not their real daughter 
the twiggs said arlena suffered from a heart defect and died 
following surgery aug 23 
the twiggs filed a 100 million suit against the hospital and 
some employees two weeks later 
wood declined to give details of the fbi investigation 
but records show that during its probe the fbi interviewed the 
twiggs subpoenaed documents from the hospital and talked with the 
father of a sarasota girl who the twiggs think may be their 
daughter the couple claim she was the only other white girl born 
at hardee memorial at the same time 
the sarasota girl has not been identified to protect her from

michael dukakis on wednesday declared 
democrats the winners in the two debates thus far in the 
presidential campaign and promised to make it a clean sweep 
with a win in his final showdown with republican george bush 
dukakis interrupted his preparations for the debate to toss a 
baseball around with an aide and sticking to sports metaphors 
described the pitches he planned throw at bush during their 
nationally televised debate starting at 9 pm edt thursday at the 
pauley pavilion on the ucla campus 
a fastball curve slider maybe a knuckler was the 
democratic nominees description of his planned debate repertoire 
were ahead 20 were going to make it a clean sweep 
dukakis sporting a ucla sweatshirt reacted firmly to a 
question as to whether he thought it possible he would win the 
popular vote but lose to bush in the electoral college count which 
decides the election 
were going to win period dukakis said 
various polls have suggested that dukakis is close to bush in 
the overall race but that bush is further ahead in potential 
electoral votes 
asked how bush should handle any debate questions about running 
mate dan quayle dukakis who has been highly critical of the 
indiana senator answered in a single word gingerly 
dukakis shook hands with several people eating their lunch on 
the pool deck of his los angeles hotel before returning to daylong 
meetings with aides and advisers who traveled to the debate city 
with him tuesday night 
quayle is likely to be a prime debate target for dukakis who 
aides say also will try to portray bush as an insensitive and 
failed leader who has offered no realistic solutions to the major 
problems facing average americans 
earlier in the day dukakis strategists from the california and 
national campaigns assessed the campaign so far and what dukakis 
still must do 
i hope we dont look at presidential elections as personality 
contests said ron brown a former jesse jackson aide who now 
advises dukakis 
we hope the american public will judge michael dukakis on what 
he says and not on how he looks brown said we think that the 
american people the more they see of michael dukakis the more 
thay are going to be persuaded by his view of the future 
as for california dukakis state campaign manager tony 
podesta said the democratic ticket held a small lead in this 
crucial state and hoped to expand on it through televisions ads 
that counter what podesta called some of the slime and lies the 
bush camp has been putting forth about the dukakis record on 
crime and the environment 
brown disputed republican assertions that bush has wrapped up 
most of the south west and rocky mountain states but he added 
that while dukakis publicly speaks of a 50state campaign 
targeting decisions will be made in the next few days 
obviously we are focusing on the areas where we think weve 
got to win brown said i think you see a scenario a very 
reasonable scenario that indicates this thing is nowhere near 
over 
added podesta 
the electoral college lock theory has about as much truth as 
george bushs television spots 
the massachusetts governor at airport rallies tuesday in north 
dakota and los angeles said he was looking forward to the 
confrontation 
one of the nice things about debates is they get people out 
from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and it gets 
them to address the issues the democratic nominee said 
on the flight here his aides promised that dukakis would be 
ready to exchange oneliners with the vice president more 
importantly they said dukakis hopes to convince voters that he 
cares more about them and their children than bush does 
to underscore that point dukakis will discuss his recent 
proposals on health care housing and helping pay college expenses 
this is not a pingpong match of oneliners said john sasso 
vice chairman of the dukakis campaign and the candidates closest 
adviser i think people are fed up with the meaningless labels 
whos offering the leadership 
sasso said dukakis must convince the public that under a 
democratic administration they will get the benefit of the doubt 
when the door of the oval office closes 
i think its very important that the american people know his 
values know what he cares about sasso said

california grape growers sued oregon over a 
state rule that requires restaurants to post warnings when they 
serve fresh foods treated with sulfite preservatives 
the california table grape commission which represents 1000 
growers fear restaurants will stop serving grapes rather than post 
the warnings said bruce obbink commission president 
that could cost growers and food distributors several hundred 
thousand dollars obbink said by telephone from fresno calif 
kristine gebbie director of the oregon health divison said she 
could not comment on the lawsuit filed the lawsuit tuesday in 
marion county circuit court until the state attorney generals 
office reviewed the case 
she said however that health officials made the right decision 
when they ordered restaurants to warn customers when foods have 
been treated with sulfites 
weve got allergic people who can react to any level of 
sulfites and the only way to protect them is to either ban all 
products with sulfites or warn them that it is present gebbie 
said as i understand it for a very sensitive person any level 
of sulfite is a problem 
the emergency rule which expires in february was approved aug 
26 by health division officials after they learned that restaurants 
were serving california table grapes and other items that treated 
with sulfites 
the rule accompanies a 1985 regulation that prohibits 
restaurants from treating fruits vegetables and other salad items 
with sulfitebased preservatives 
the restriction was pushed by the legislature after the death of 
a 10yearold girl who died after eating sulfitetreated guacamole 
at a restaurant 
the girls family sued the maker and distributor of the sulfite 
product used at the restaurant the oregon court of appeals ruled 
last week that the maker and distributor were not liable for 
damages

summers production and still represented a fiveyear low

gain of 2 percent from septembers estimate but still 22 percent 
below 1987

put the corn harvest at 446 billion bushels and the soybean crop 
at 147 billion bushels 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american

production at 148 billion bushels and forecast a corn harvest of 
455 billion bushels 
his forecasts which came out monday were higher than usdas 
september estimates but analysts said leslies soybean production

futures 
they said his corn production forecast was higher than expected 
and sparked some selling of corn futures 
despite lowered production as a result of the drought usda

shortages they have been estimating that the drought would add one 
percent to the consumer price index for food this year and two 
percent next year

averaged 89 percent of the base year of 1977 up 1 percent from 
september

the philippine government might delay 
filing charges against ferdinand e marcos until us authorities 
decide whether to prosecute the exiled former president an 
official said wednesday 
mateo caparas chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government said president corazon aquinos administration would 
not seek to obstruct justice in other lands or permit filing of 
charges here to be used as an excuse by mr marcos to escape his 
indictment abroad 
he spoke after reports that the us state departments legal 
officer recommended marcos be offered a deal to avoid prison by 
surrendering millions of dollars allegedly embezzled during 20 
years in power 
marcos and his family live in exile in hawaii the philippine 
government alleges marcos ad his associates stole up to 10 billion 
before his administration was toppled in the 1986 uprising that 
swept mrs aquino to power 
on tuesday the los angeles times reported that state department 
adviser abraham sofaer recommended the plea bargain to avoid 
indicting and prosecuting a former head of state 
the newspaper said us officials feared marcos would seek to 
embarrass american and filipino authorities by disclosing improper 
or illegal conduct if he were indicted 
the plea bargain proposal reportedly involves an investigation 
of marcos by us attorney rudolph giuliani in new york into 
alleged illegal money transfers and other activities 
caparas told reporters that even if marcos accepted a plea 
bargain he would still face prosecution in the philippines 
filipino officials have filed no criminal charges against marcos 
for fear he would demand his right to return to the philippines for 
trial philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia 
caparas commission is in charge of recovering money allegedly 
taken by marcos he told reporters that mrs aquino had asked him 
to issue the statement 
mrs aquino has repeatedly refused to allow marcos to return to 
the philippines citing national security 
caparas said efforts by marcos to return were either an excuse 
to get out of america or a part of his campaign to destabilize the 
present government 
caparas also said american fbi agents seized 6 million worth of 
paintings and other art objects during a raid last week on the 
woodside california estate of marcos soninlaw gregorio araneta 
he said he expected the objects to be turned over to the 
philippine government because those paintings were purchased with 
the filipino peoples money araneta is married to marcos 
daughter irene 
in san francisco us attorney joseph russoniello confirmed the 
raid and said agents hauled away paintings sculptures ming 
dynasty vases and antique furniture

the maronite christian spiritual leader 
is making a list of up to seven candidates in hopes of getting us 
and syrian support for a presidential election several beirut 
newspapers reported wednesday 
he hopes the united states will use its good offices to 
persuade syria to approve two or three of them so the election can 
be held the independent daily annahar said 
michel abu jawdeh its leading columnist urged patriarch 
nasrallah sfeir the 65yearold maronite leader to run for the 
presidency himself 
the qualifications of the president needed to save lebanon 
from its crisis fit only you and your friend raymond edde he 
wrote its a fateful responsibility which you will have to 
shoulder otherwise there will be no lebanon 
edde 75 is a veteran politician who moved to paris in 1976 
after surviving three assassination attempts 
he has announced his candidacy for president and said he would 
seek a commitment from the five permanent members of the un 
security council the united states the soviet union china 
britain and france to make israel leave its selfproclaimed 
security zone in south lebanon 
edde says that would prompt the withdrawal of syrian and other 
foreign forces from lebanon syria has 40000 soldiers stationed in 
eastern and northern lebanon and in moslem west beirut 
twentynine christian members of parliament have authorized 
sfeir to consult with moslem factions the united states and syria 
about presidential elections 
by unwritten agreement among lebanese religious groups the 
president is a christian the prime minister sunni moslem and the 
parliament speaker a shiite moslem christians also have controlled 
the army and judiciary since independence from france in 1943 
christians were the majority in 1943 but moslems now make up an 
estimated 55 percent of the 4 million people and want an equal 
share of power 
the christian bloc supporting sfeirs effort and 16 moslem and 
leftist deputies issued separate identical statements this week 
rejecting partition of lebanon on sectarian lines and calling for a 
speedy election both groups said it should occur before parliament 
speaker hussein husseinis term ends oct 18 
moslems have rejected the interim government headed by the 
christian army commander gen michel aoun that was appointed by 
president amin gemayel as his 6year term ended sept 23 they back 
the incumbent cabinet headed by salim hoss a sunni who is acting 
prime minister 
syria the main power broker in lebanon after 13 years of civil 
war here has pressed for election of either former president 
suleiman franjieh 78 or parliament member mikhail daher 58 
daher was a compromise candidate who emerged from syrian and us 
talks after a christian boycott of parliament blocked franjiehs 
candidacy 
christians who oppose syrias military presence in lebanon claim 
both are too close to the syrians

premier mohammad hasan sharq said 
wednesday the government prefers a settlement with guerrilla field 
commanders to a deal with leaders who direct the moslem insurgency 
from neighboring pakistan 
in a 90minute meeting with five western reporters he made no 
new offers that might persuadethe ussupported guerrillas to stop 
fighting 
president najib the communist party chief appointed sharq on 
may 26 the 63yearold premier who has close ties to moscow but 
is not a party member has become increasingly visible as the 
government spokesman 
najib has said he would broaden the base of his sovietbacked 
government by including nonparty members 
speaking to the reporters wednesday about negotiations with the 
insurgents sharq said if we are not able to have ways of 
negotiating with all of them we will have negotiations with some 
of them those who are sharing the miseries of the people of 
afghanistan will come first 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and the soviet union sent military forces to afghanistan in 
december 1979 under a unmediated agreement signed last april 
the soviets are withdrawing their estimated 115000 soldiers 
the guerrillas were not a party to the agreement between 
pakistan and afghanistan which the soviet union and united states 
signed as guarantors and conmtinued fighting 
najibs regime is trying to establish provincial coalition 
governments including representatives of the insurgents if 
successful the strategy could neutralize the guerrillas on a 
piecemeal basis by persuading them to stop fighting in exchange for 
local power 
that would return afghanistan to its presoviet situation a 
weak central government that survives largely through coexistence 
with powerful local leaders who fight to the death for their 
villages valleys or hilltops but do not threaten the capital 
sharq expressed willingness to talk with afghan leaders inside 
and outside the country including deposed king zahir shah to 
establish a new government and end the war 
zahir shah lives in italy and his return as a constitutional 
monarch is proposed periodically proposed as means of ending the 
current impasse 
the premier would not say whether asadabad capital of eastern 
kunar province fell to the insurgents monday night as their 
leaders in pakistan claimed 
referring to government forces in the town 12 miles from the 
frontier he said maybe they are now under control of the 
coalition government 
he said he spoke by telephone wednesday morning to the kunar 
governor in asadabad who was trying to establish a coalition 
provincial government and he assured me of progress that he will 
be able to establish it 
sharq said asadabads defenders were local militiamen paid by 
the government not army troopers he spoke in dari the afghan 
language and government officials translated his comments into 
english 
urging the united states and pakistan to stop aiding the 
guerrillas he expressed the hope that elections in both countries 
next month would bring policy changes and the smell of blood of 
innocent people will no longer be to the liking of the leaders of 
the united states of america 
soviet resupply of the afghan army is not the same according to 
sharq he said the soviets had been providing arms to afghanistan 
for 35 years since the time of zahir shah who was overthrown in 
1973 by his cousin and former prime minister mohammad daoud 
daoud was killed in the coup five years later 
us aid to the guerrillas began in earnest when soviet troops 
entered afghanistan 
more than 5 million afghans have fled the country during the 
civil war and 3 million are in pakistan living in border towns and 
refugee camps that serve as guerrilla bases and supply points 
kabul radio said the army had killed two foreigners and 319 
criminal extremists guerrillas in an attack on insurgents 
in zabul a southeastern province 
it did not identify the foreigners but much of the broadcast 
was devoted to charges of pakistani involvement with the insurgency 
and the radio claimed pakistani army officers were fighting 
alongside guerrillas inside afghanistan 
since his apointment sharq has visited moscow and meets 
regularly with foreign reporters allowed to visit kabul 
najibs photograph appears less frequently in kabul newspapers 
and nightly television newscasts no longer are dominated by lengthy 
videotapes of the presidents activities 
sharq served as chief of staff daouds government during the 
monarchy 
in spite of the fact that i was the second person who waged 
the coup against king zahir i have never been opposed to zahir 
shah personally but only to the kingdom to the monarchy he 
said wednesday

tobacco exports wrongly certified as 100 
percent us grown and shipped under government credit guarantees 
should come in for a fullscale fbi investigation a tobaccostate 
congressman said wednesday 
the harm that this corrupt blending practice has caused the 
american tobacco farmer is inestimable rep robin tallon 
dsc said in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
the credit guarantees are supposed to be reserved for 
americangrown crops only although the agriculture department says 
it will provide them for the americangrown portion of a blended 
shipment if the foreignproduced portion does not exceed 25 percent 
of the entire package 
fourteen of 19 exporters monitored by federal investigators 
received government credit guarantees for entire shipments that 
were certified as 100 percent american tobacco but which actually 
blended us and imported leaves investigators told a house 
agriculture subcommittee last week 
the findings have agitated tobaccostate congressmen who say 
they are not only concerned about potential fraud but believe the 
credit guarantee program should be reserved for crops produced 
exclusively by american farmers 
the case already is under investigation by the us attorneys 
office in raleigh nc said lawmakers and officials of the 
general accounting office and department of agriculture inspector 
generals office 
tallon said in his letter he was shocked and angered to 
learn of the wrong certification by any definition this 
constitutes fraud 
he said any exporters who deliberately misrepresented a shipment 
as being completely american not only stole from the taxpayers of 
this country but they also stole sales opportunities from our 
tobacco farmers 
he asked thornburgh to make sure that any such exporter be 
brought to justice 
tallon in an interview acknowledged that the us attorney in 
raleigh would most likely be free to call on the fbi for 
assistance but he said it was important to contact the attorney 
general to urge such action 
i dont know what kind of staff they have at the us 
attorneys office he said this thing is far more involved 
complex and complicated he expressed hope that the fbi would 
examine all pertinent records of exporters and banks that provided 
advance payments to the exporters under the guarantee program 
and the end users the people who supposedly purchased the 
tobacco he said 
tallon also renewed his criticism of the way the matter has been 
handled by usdas foreign agricultural service the agency scoffed 
at initial reports from iraq that not all of the tobacco being 
shipped was american 
fas administrator thomas o kay told the house agriculture 
committees tobacco and peanuts subcommittee last week that he had 
no reason to doubt the word of the exporters he said the complaint 
from iraq was explained to him as an illfounded rumor started by a 
disappointed zimbabwean exporter 
tallon said however that testimony at the hearing left him 
unsatisfied 
the question begs to be answered whos trying to cover up 
what he said im saying bring in the fbi and see if anyone 
else gets caught in the loop

dutch a pit bull terrier who 
narrowly escaped being put to death for killing another dog was 
sprung from jail by someone with a love for animals and a pair of 
sharp wire cutters 
the case involving dutch has pitted a district court judge 
against a homemaker who claims dutch should not be punished for 
killing a small terrier in june 
judge cornelia terwee ruled tuesday that dutch should be taken 
from his owner 28yearold saskie van poeteren and placed in a 
new home but hours later dutch was spirited away from an 
amsterdam kennel 
ms van poeteren said she wasnt involved in the breakout but 
that an anonymous caller telephoned her late tuesday assuring her 
dutch was safe 
the gentleman just said dont worry itll be all right 
ms van poeteren told the associated press on wednesday 
dutchs reprieve from death made him famous 
police ordered dutch destroyed after he bit another dog to 
death but a local magistrate ruled that biting another dog did not 
make dutch a threat to the general public and ordered him returned 
to ms van poeteren 
the prosecutors office appealed 
judge terwee ruled the fault was with ms van poeteren not 
dutch because the pit bull was not on a leash at the time of the 
attack 
she ordered dutch placed with a new owner and fined ms van 
poeteren 36 for violating leash laws 
dutch television interviewed ms van poeteren tuesday as she 
wept outside the courthouse over the confiscation order 
he was just the cutest little thing she said i was sure 
id get him back 
the broadcast showed a family snapshot of dutch wearing his 
owners sunglasses and a closeup of ms van poeterens goldfish 
apparently to illustrate her fondness for pets 
even the authoritative nrc handelsblad newspaper published an 
article on dutchs trial under the headline judges chewing over 
pit bull case

a judge dismissed nearly a third of the 
charges in the mcmartin preschool molestation trial wednesday and 
prosecutors moved to drop other counts apparently because of 
insufficient evidence 
the 17month prosecution case against raymond buckey and his 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey ended last week with three children 
failing to testify 
superior court judge william pounders immediately granted a 
prosecution motion to dismiss 27 counts based on their unheard 
allegations prosecutors said the youngsters had refused to appear 
because they were too traumatized 
deputy district attorneys lael rubin and roger gunson who 
sought to drop a total of 35 counts said the judge should resolve 
other matters before dismissing the eight counts based on testimony 
of children who did appear at the trial 
but defense attorney danny davis accused prosecutors of 
attempting to cut their losses by eliminating from the case 
children who told incredibly bizarre stories of alleged 
molestations 
the truth of the matter is the evidence these childen 
presented at the preliminary hearing was unbelievable davis said 
outside court 
ms rubin and gunson filed a new complaint listing 52 
accusations against the 30yearold buckey and 12 charges against 
his 61yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey as well as one joint 
conspiracy count 
they cut the number of children allegedly molested from 14 to 
11 nine of whom testified at the trial 
ms rubin told reporters the remaining evidence was sufficient 
to convict the defendants 
weve had testimony from nine children in this case and 
medical evidence which strongly supports our position that children 
were molested at the mcmartin school she said 
mrs buckeys attorney dean gits said the prosecutions action 
was highly unusual and said hed never seen a similar 
situation before 
davis called the development heartening saying thirty 
five counts are out without a breath wasted by the defense 
he added its a facesaving device but it looks like major 
plastic surgery is going on there is a major surgical slashing 
of the prosecution case and its by their own knife 
he equated it to the making of a 35 million settlement to a 
100 million lawsuit before the opposition has put on a case ive 
never seen that before 
davis said he would move to excise even more charges in 
arguments thursday he contends that at least four children who 
testified spoke of acts that allegedly occurred beyond the sixyear 
statute of limitations for prosecution 
if his argument succeeds he said 60 to 70 percent of the 
charges would be gone pounders said he would study the law on 
statute of limitations overnight 
the mcmartin case has been troubled from its inception and has 
gone through repeated upheavals that diminished its scope 
it began in 1984 with seven defendants and originally involved 
claims that 41 children had been molested at the now defunct 
mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach 
after a twoyear preliminary hearing district attorney ira 
reiner dismissed charges against five former teachers saying the 
evidence against them was incredibly weak 
the trial began in april 1987 prosecutors called their final 
witnesses last week and the defense is scheduled to begin next 
week 
on wednesday afternoon pounders went to the the site of the 
closed preschool to see whether jurors should be taken to view the 
scene

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen said wednesday the republicans refuse to stand up 
for the american economy and are avoiding issues important to 
keeping the nation competitive 
bentsen stalking votes in missouri and arkansas on the eve of 
the second debate between george bush and michael dukakis also 
aimed new barbs at dan quayle and accused bush of trying 
character assassination against dukakis 
the texas senator said the democrats had no argument with 
quayles assertion that other nations envy the united states 
america is still the envy of the world bentsen told a crowd 
of more than 2500 outside the columbia courthouse many waving 
tiny flags but not because of people like dan quayle and george 
bush who refuse to stand up for the american economy 
you dont stay number one by coasting he said responding 
to bushs assertion that the democrats were trying to scare people 
about foreign ownership of us industries bentsen chairman of 
the senate finance committee pushed through the trade bill earlier 
this year 
america needs leaders who will stand up for the working people 
of america he said later at a rally at the university of 
arkansas at fayetteville 
he told the student audience that the republicans consider 
higher education a privilege of wealth while dukakis has proposed 
a program so all qualified students could attend college 
a strong contingent of probush students in the crowd of about 
3000 heckled as he spoke they shouted bush in 88and when 
bentsen attacked the republicans tell the truth lloyd 
bentsen told the crowd it was a sign of how united the democrats 
are that he was saying nice things about razorbacks just before 
the texasarkansas football game the university of texas alumnus 
received an arkansas football jersey that had his name over the 
number 88 
at rallies and in interviews wednesday bentsen worked to make 
sure quayle remained a live issue for for thursday nights debate 
today i read in the newspaper that dan quayle says hes going 
to be his own campaign manager his own dr spin control he 
said at the columbia podium that may be his pitch but ill bet 
its thrown george bush a real curve ball 
extending the baseball metaphor bentsen said bushs choice of 
quayle was another example of how the vice president swings and 
misses in the war against drugs no runs no hits no 
progress 
the crowd held up wanted posters with unflattering photos of 
george bush he was missing in the war on drugs the posters 
said 
and now dan quayle hes no jfk and hes no candidate for 
rookie of the year bentsen said at some point george bush 
has to take some responsibility for the quality of his decisions 
in interviews with local reporters bentsen rebelled at the 
notion that quayle might be getting sympathy because of the debate 
outcome 
mike dukakis is a man whos been subjected to a virtual 
character assassination by a republican campaign afraid to face 
the issues he said there ought to be some sympathy for mike 
dukakis 
as for backlash from his attack on quayle during the debate 
bentsen said it was minimal if people felt sympathy for 
quayle he said that would be misplaced 
bentsen said dukakis would do an excellent job in his debate 
thursday night after the first two debates he and dukakis were 
20 he said 
i think well go 3zip he predicted

the senate gave voicevote approval wednesday 
night to a bill authorizing a monument to american women who served 
in the vietnam war 
the bill approved earlier by the house does not specify the 
location of the memorial to the 10000 american women who were in 
the nations longest war other than to say it must be placed 
somewhere in the washington metropolitan area 
the measure is a substitute for earlier legislation which had 
proposed the addition of a nurses statue to the vietnam veterans 
memorial on the grassy mall that stretches from the capitol to the 
lincoln memorial 
that bill had been endorsed by the senate in june on a 961 
vote but was opposed by two of the three federal agencies whose 
approval would have been required critics said the addition of 
another statue to the vietnam memorial would have violated the 
artistic integrity of one of the citys most popular national 
monuments

workers trapped in a 22story 
building hung out of windows and shouted to be rescued from flames 
and thick smoke wednesday in a fire that officials said killed one 
person and injured 124 others 
it took two hours to put out the blaze at the governmentrun 
banco do brasil building located in the busiest intersection of 
downtown rio 
firefighters broke through walls of adjacent buildings to pull 
people to safety hundreds of office workers fled in panic 
the fire was confined to the bottom three floors of the bank 
building but enormous amounts of heavy smoke billowed from every 
floor casting a haze for blocks over the congested business 
district 
the fire started at the worst time 4 pm near the end of 
the workday and just at the start of the rush hour fire 
department col fernando vieira in charge of the rescue operation 
said at the scene 
the traffic was terrible and because it was raining that 
intensified the smoke and we couldnt see people in the windows 
crying for help 
smoke was so thick that at times it hid from view workers who 
hung out of windows and screamed for help 
fernando pinto who was pulled from a smokefilled room said 
it was terrifying i thought the ladder would never reach me i 
saw the smoke getting thicker and prayed i would get out in time 
col flavio fagundes of the rio de janeiro fire department said 
about 400 people were in the 1940sera building when fire broke 
out 
construction workers had been renovating the bottom three floors 
of the building at the intersection of rio branco and presidente 
vargas avenues said public security director helio saboya 
he said the blaze began on the first floor but the cause was 
still undetermined 
many workers escaped by crossing over to an adjoining building 
others climbed stairs to the roof to await rescue by police 
helicopters 
about 50 of us were working on the 10th floor when all of a 
sudden smoke started coming through the ventilating system bank 
employee antonio soares told the associated press the building 
safety rules tell you that in case of a fire to go down but when 
we got to the fourth floor everything was blocked because of 
construction work 
we went back to the eighth floor somebody found a big hammer 
and we smashed a hole in the wall and got through to the building 
next door 
people at the scene said it took 30 minutes for the fire 
department to arrive 
according to fire department col maurice ortiz 70 people were 
treated for smoke inhalation at local emergency centers and 55 
others were sent to a hospital nine of the 55 were in critical 
condition and one died said dr fatima bressan of the souza aguiar 
hospital

the first baseball team from the soviet union 
to visit the united states may not have defensive whizzes or 
offensive sluggers but theres no question about its eagerness 
the team interrupted its first sightseeing tour of the nations 
capital to watch the majorleague playoffs 
they didnt want to be rude but the older players wanted to 
watch the game game 4 between the oakland athletics and the boston 
red sox said rick spooner an american who serves as the coach 
of the soviet team 
the opportunities this week to watch the playoffs has been a big 
part of the trip for a team playing a game that is only 1 years 
old in the soviet union 
constantly were trying to watch said andrei borodin the 
teams coach and first baseman if theres any possibility we 
stay in front of the game all the time 
the soviet team which hails from the mendeleyev institute of 
chemical technology played the first ussoviet baseball game in 
the united states on wednesday against a johns hopkins university 
squad 
the soviets lost 160 
they committed 11 errors 
they had no hits 
they did have six baserunners one on an error five on walks 
but the game was never close the johns hopkins team scored eight 
unearned runs in the first inning on only four hits 
the results werent much different when a team from johns 
hopkins visited the soviet union recently the us team soundly 
beat mendeleyev considered the strongest soviet team in all three 
games the americans also gave clinics and other instruction to 
their russian counterparts 
the mendeleyevs went on to win four baseball tournaments this 
year playing throughout the soviet union 
when i was there i said they were comparable to a junior 
varsity high school team said johns hopkins coach bob babb 
now id say theyre equivalent to a high school team and a 
pretty good high school team when they put all their best people on 
the field 
the defensive skills of the game have come slowest to the 
soviets 
their fielding hitting cutoffs fly balls still give them 
trouble babb said but their hitting has improved 
tremendously 
the soviet union would like to field a baseball team in the 1992 
summer olympics 
if we follow the course of our basketball players it will 
take 57 years and we will be playing with the best teams in 
europe bogatiryov said i cant talk about the americans 
still the game against americans was important 
i think theyre feeling the pressure of this game babb 
said theyre here trying to represent the soviet union in our 
sport they believe they must make a good showing to get the 
support they need back home 
there are no baseball fields in the soviet union when johns 
hopkins played the soviets on russian soil the two teams played on 
a soccer field with a chalkdrawn circle for a pitchers mound 
so the johns hopkins facility a diamond with dugouts and a 
batting cage is one not to be wasted an extra daily practice has 
already been squeezed into the soviets schedule 
theyd like to stay out on the field all day spooner said 
what do they think of the playoffs 
theyre awed babb said they ask a lot of questions why 
do things happen in a game having studied the game game for 
only a year and a half to see the strength of these players 
boggles their minds

the fire for which lalumiere was charged occurred aug 23 at his 
brother michaels cabin it was the 19th suspicious blaze to break 
out lance lalumiere reported the fire and was trying to extinguish 
it when firefighters arrived he was questioned for eight hours 
afterward and police searched his home and car

peace negotiations the israeli foreign ministry said wednesday 
israel television said officials of the two governments signed a 
trade agreement wednesday in beijing state radio said each side 
established governmentrun corporations to promote trade 
avraham tamir directorgeneral of the foreign ministry said on 
israel television that diplomatic ties with china hinged on how the 
middle east peace process advances he added that efforts to 
achieve peace in the region would continue and ties with china 
would be a reality in the very near future

workers scrambled wednesday to transform 
uclas basketball arena into a television studio where the debate 
between george bush and michael dukakis could help decide the 
election day choices of millions of voters 
debate organizers trucked in sets lecterns and equipment 
straight from the oct 5 vice presidential debate in omaha neb 
they said things were going smoothly despite the time crunch 
as the republican and democratic nominees spent a quiet day 
preparing for their second and final debate ed fouhy executive 
producer for the bipartisan commission on presidential debates 
said the frenzy was intense inside the pauley pavilion on the 
ucla campus 
fouhy said his job was made easier because this university of 
34000 students is accustomed to handling big events 
they have a whole special events staff thats used to doing 
these things he said we plugged into that 
ucla served as the athletes housing center and site of the 
gymnastics competition for the 1984 olympic games and last year 
entertained britains visiting prince andrew and the duchess of 
york 
vice chancellor alan charles said the debate was a pretty big 
deal but nothing the university cant handle 
the university of california campus in los angeles was selected 
last friday after the league of women voters withdrew as debate 
sponsor in a dispute with the bush and dukakis campaigns 
the debates commission established by both campaigns to handle 
the first presidential debate in winstonsalem nc on sept 25 
quickly succeeded the league as sponsor of the los angeles event 
commission director janet brown said the leagues original 
debate site the old shrine auditorium near downtown los angeles 
was vetoed when the league demanded reimbursement of 90000 she 
said ucla offered free use of its 13000seat basketball arena 
and on wednesday the los angeles city council voted 112 to 
give 25000 to help fund the presidential debate 
i would have supported it if it was open to the public said 
councilman ernani bernardi who dissented because only 1500 people 
will be allowed in the 12500seat arena and the audience of chosen 
republicans and democrats would be waiting to cheer their 
candidates hot shot statements 
at the sprawling west los angeles campus the floor of the arena 
was being covered and carpeted wednesday and partitioned off from 
the rows of bleachers that will go unused during the debate 
organizers said 2000 tickets will be distributed for the debate 
audience in keeping with the intimate tv studio atmosphere that 
characterized the winstonsalem debate and the oct 5 vice 
presidential matchup in omaha neb 
the redcarpeted stage the deep blue backdrop and oak lecterns 
that were used in the previous debates were installed in the arena 
a press center was set up in the nearby student union building for 
an estimated 3000 journalists and crews covering the event 
the debate format also will be the same each candidate will 
have two minutes to answer a question and one minute for rebuttal 
with brief closing statements the panelists will be moderator 
bernard shaw of cable news network andrea mitchell of nbc ann 
compton of abc and margaret warner of newsweek magazine 
janet brown asked the los angeles city council on wednesday to 
contribute funds to defray debate costs which she said probably 
would be substantially more than the 500000 required for the last 
debate 
raising private money for the debate has been a hustle she 
said

the house is expected to take up compromise 
legislation thursday to require banks retail stores and other 
issuers of credit cards to provide more information to consumers 
about interest rates and other charges 
the measure which still falls short of the disclosure 
requirements sought by some members of congress and consumer 
groups likely will be sent to the white house by the end of the 
week the senate passed it late tuesday 
senatehouse negotiators met last week to iron out the 
differences between separate bills passed earlier by their 
respective chambers 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
consumer affairs subcommittee walked out of that session because 
he said rep fernand st germain dri chairman of the full 
banking committee would not permit him to air complaints about the 
measure before the conferees 
this bill does not help the consumer said annunzio 
leslie gainer an official of the ralph naderorganized us 
public interest research group agreed somewhat with annunzio 
saying the legislation fails to go far enough with the new 
disclosure rules and preempts states from passing stronger laws 
said ms gainer unfortunately congressional banking 
conferees crafted a bill which will wipe out existing state law 
prohibit states from acting in the future and allow the creditcard 
industry to operate under a single new federal law 
the bill requires disclosure of annual fees the interest rate 
charged for unpaid balances the method for calculating that 
balance and the length of grace periods during which no interest is 
charged similarly late fees overthelimit fees and fees for 
cash advances must be disclosed 
it requires that information to be provided in all directmail 
solicitations for applicants in other cases however some of the 
information need not be provided until the consumer already has 
been provided a card ms gainer and others argue the disclosures 
should be upfront in all cases 
sen christopher j dodd dconn noted during the final senate 
debate tuesday night that the initial motivation for this 
legislation came from the high costs consumers are paying to use 
their credit cards while most interest rates were declining by 
about 50 percent during the early 1980s credit card interest rates 
not only didnt fall they rose 
with nearly 106 million americans holding 800 million credit 
cards dodd said the impact of even small changes in rates and 
fees can be vast even a 1 percent decline in interest rates 
would save consumers about 700 million he said 
the consumer bankers association which represents approximately 
800 federally insured banks savings and loans and credit unions 
endorsed the legislation 
joe belew cba president said the measure provides for 
simple meaningful disclosures which ensure that consumers can 
compare terms on credit cards its enactment will show that 
consumer and industry representatives can work together to produce 
legislation which benefits the public 
ms gainer acknowledged that the bill does provide significant 
assistance to consumers in states that have not yet passed 
disclosure laws in fact now most state laws are not as 
comprehensive in certain areas as the federal bill is 
but she noted that the states would be precluded from enacting 
tougher disclosure requirements including the length that rate and 
fee terms remain available to prospective applicants whether the 
issuer reserves the right to change the terms after the contract 
has been signed and whether an outofstate issuer is complying 
with the states interest rate ceiling

republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle saying he had reached a snapping point over control 
of his campaign by bush aides declared wednesday that from now on 
i am my own handler 
im going to have fun and im going to say whats on my 
mind quayle told reporters as he left indianapolis en route to 
south dakota for a fundraiser and speech 
the indiana senator said he was not mad at anybody in the bush 
campaign however he had previously expressed irritation at 
published reports quoting unidentified aides to gop presidential 
nominee george bush as calling him a liability for the ticket over 
the weekend he complained to bush campaign chairman james a baker 
iii 
quayle also has chafed at the rigid format dictated by the 
handlers from the bush campaign limiting his access to the 
press scripting prepared texts for him to read and even 
determining when he would wave as he got off his campaign plane 
he told reporters thats all been thrown away 
aides said the decision to publicly assert control of more 
aspects of his campaign was quayles alone and was not yet another 
new script handed down from bush officials but quayles aides 
many of them baker intimates were openly delighted that the story 
was dominating quayles campaign day 
beyond his speaking out it was unclear what changes might be 
seen in quayles campaign his schedule is still determined by bush 
strategists and even quayle said he would continue to deliver the 
speeches prepared for him those are cleared at least in early 
draft form by the bush campaign 
therell be some offthecuff remarks but therell be some 
scripted ive learned that there is a certain value in having a 
script quayle said 
he said he will still coordinate with bush officials and stay 
in close communication with them 
theyre going to suggest things that i say suggest things 
that i do and im going to take that under consideration he 
said 
quayle said that as one who has successfully run for elective 
office in the past i know how to get votes and i know whats 
best for george bush 
ive done it their way this far and now its my turn he 
added 
he said he has cordial relations with baker the campaign 
chairman the two men spoke at length on tuesday night 
baker said wednesday in los angeles these things are really 
very regrettable and i certainly understand why he would be steamed 
up about them if i could find out who was putting them out wed 
have fewer people working in the campaign 
he said were going to make a little effort to find out who 
on the staff was talking to the media 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate said baker had told a senior staff 
meeting last friday at the vice presidents recommendation that 
any member of bushs campaign staff who criticized quayle faced 
possible dismissal 
the matter had come to a head last friday two days after the 
vice presidential debate when anonymous bush aides were quoted as 
saying quayle had not done well in the debate and was a liability 
to the ticket 
i think there is a snapping point that everyone goes through 
and it snapped about friday sometime last friday quayle said 
this week quayle started telling reporters i dont anybody to 
say well heres what some campaign aide said about it you ask me 
and ill give you the answer 
although quayle has been more accessible to reporters since the 
debate he has still not held a formal news conference since sept 
15 he said he will try to have one soon

president jose sarney on wednesday 
unveiled a plan aimed mainly at stopping massive uncontrolled 
burning in the amazon jungle by farmers and ranchers which has 
aggravated the worldwide greenhouse effect 
the program called our nature calls for a temporary end to 
government tax and financing benefits for largescale cattle 
ranching in the northern amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed 
tropical timber 
environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast amazon 
tracts by the primitive slashandburn method has released hundreds 
of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere 
they say this causes the greenhouse effect the gradual warming 
of the earths atmosphere by a concentration of pollutants that act 
like a blanket trapping the suns warmth 
brazils governmentrun space research institute said about 
77000 square miles of land were cleared by the slashandburn 
method in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year 
we must create nationwide consciousness that we are all 
passengers in the adventure of man on earth sarney said in a 
ceremony announcing the program the era of unlimited natural 
resources is over 
the our nature program also contains a recommendation to 
brazils congress to cut mercury imports freelance gold 
prospectors throughout the amazon use the highly toxic element to 
separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the 
water 
this program is going to shake up powerful economic 
interests said antonio jose guimaraes president of brazils 
federal forest service but the government is resolved to carry 
it out 
earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor amazon 
basin which covers an area equal to roughly twothirds of the 48 
continental united states permitted land developers to burn off 50 
percent of their properties the fastest and cheapest way to open 
up clear areas and then gave them tax deductions for doing so 
the world bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of 
landclearing in the brazilan amazon has destroyed 240000 square 
miles of natural tropical rainforest cover an area larger than 
california 
interior minister joao alves said the tax break suspensions were 
temporary because the government is working out a plan to 
determine which parts of the amazon can be used for farming and 
ranching and which must be left alone 
even before our nature was announced private amazon 
developers complained about the plan 
orlando mariutti who has three projects on a total of 136000 
acres in the western state of mato grosso told the newspaper folha 
de s paulo that cutting tax incentives will hold back 
development of the amazon 
large developers in the region he said generally preserve 
more than the 50 percent of the land required by law

former vice president walter f mondale said 
wednesday he declined an invitation to be interviewed for president 
of the university of minnesota a decision that disappointed his 
top backer for the post gov rudy perpich 
ive told the selection committee that i will not be a 
candidate mondale said you know i love our university what 
its meant to me and to so many of us but i just could not 
persuade myself that this was the best role i could play its a 
different world you know administering an academic community and 
it just didnt seem the right thing for me to do 
mondale a lawyer had not expressed interest in the job 
publicly but perpich had promoted him as the successor to kenneth 
keller who resigned as the universitys president last march 
perpich said by telephone from his home in gilbert that he was 
disappointed by mondales decision but added life goes on 
perpich said he didnt try to persuade mondale to reconsider 
after mondale told him of his decision tuesday 
you have to really want that its a difficult job perpich 
said 
the governor said persuading lawmakers to approve his budget 
requests for the university would have been much easier with 
mondale at the helm 
i was a little bit selfish perpich said i wanted someone 
to help carry that burden and he would have done it and i think 
very successfully 
the universitys credibility has been damaged by turmoil over 
spending on the university presidents residence and office which 
led to kellers resignation and other problems during the year 
mondale a former us senator from minnesota who returned to 
the state to practice law following his unsuccessful 1984 
democratic presidential bid said he has no current plans to run 
for political office in the future

a dispute between scientists has left 200 rare 
and pampered rats without a hole to call their own 
carefully bred for up to 125 generations by gordon harrington of 
the university of northern iowa the rats represent rare genetic 
strains some are masters at racing through rat mazes while others 
were bred with various personalities or are drunks or drug addicts 
the rats have bounced between iowa and michigan since they were 
evicted last month from lafayette clinic a state mental health 
facility the detroit news reported wednesday 
im not sure what is going on said harrington a psychiatry 
professor i have devoted my career to the rats they are the 
product of from 75 to 125 generations of precise breeding and 
considerable study but i suppose if we dont resolve it this will 
bring it to an end 
for years the rats were bred in harringtons lab in cedar 
falls iowa but in march 1986 a lab fire wiped out half his 1800 
rats the lab was closed 
harrington took some of the luckless rodents home with him and 
sent others to laboratories around the world 
in january 1987 the lafayette clinic hired harrington on 
condition that he bring along at least 100 of his special rats he 
brought 200 and the rats enjoyed a warm welcome 
but they fell out of favor when harrington was dismissed after 
spending a month at overseas medical conventions clinic officials 
contend harrington had no research plans for the rats 
he was parading around australia completing ignoring these 
rats said dr norman rosenzweig acting chairman of wayne state 
universitys psychiatry department the lafayette clinic is run by 
the state but staffed by psychiatry professors from wayne state 
harrington denies neglecting his rats he maintains that his 
troubles stem from rejecting a lafayette colleagues request to 
receive credit on any research material published by harrington 
after dismissing harrington the clinic tried to send his rats 
packing as well but when the rodents arrived in cedar falls 
harrington refused to accept them 
the rodents spent part of last week in a shipping office until 
the humane society in nearby waterloo iowa offered the rats 
temporary shelter 
wayne state officials said they felt sorry for the rats and 
sent a truck on saturday to pick them up the rats are now in an 
animal research facility while school officials ponder their fate

president reagan said the republican 
party has become the party of working people as he carried his 
campaign for george bush into the battleground states of the 
industrial northeast wednesday 
the party that so many of us grew up with still exists except 
today its called the republican party and im asking all of you 
to come home and join me reagan said at a columbus day dinner 
here 
earlier the president told students and teachers at upper darby 
high school in the suburbs of philadelphia that he is concerned 
about young peoples future and the decisions we americans make 
at the polls this year will determine whether or not that future 
will be bright 
the president mingled public speeches with private republican 
fundraising sessions meeting with 70 people who paid 5000 
apiece for a reception at a philadelphia restaurant and attending a 
similar function at an airport hotel after arriving in newark on 
his way to west orange 
in philadelphia he also met with archbishop anthony j 
bevilacqua head of the citys 13 million roman catholics and 
with the family of a policeman gunned down in the line of duty 
in his west orange speech he reminded the audience that in his 
earlier years he was a democrat and it is often said that the 
onceproud democratic party of fdr and harry truman is dead and 
gone that the democratic party has been taken over by the left 
that the departure from the mainstream that we began to see at 
their 1968 convention now defines the party at the national level 
especially the liberal leadership in congress 
but there is something you should know he added the 
party of fdr and harry truman couldnt be killed 
you see the secret is that when the left took over the 
democratic party we took over the republican party we made the 
republican party into the party of working people the family the 
neighborhood the defense of freedom and yes the american flag 
and the pledge of allegiance to one nation under god 
the menu for the 20aplate columbus day dinner was salad 
ziti meatballs sausage dessert and coffee the affair was 
cosponsored by italian americans of essex county and the italian 
tribune a newarkbased weekly newspaper 
when he left the archbishops home in philadelphia reagan met 
with the family of edward m setzer a policeman who was killed 
sept 30 in bryn mawr while investigating a burglary 
his trip wednesday took him to two hotly contested northeastern 
states where bush and democrat michael dukakis are slugging it out 
for a combined total of 41 electoral votes 
federal aviation administration officials said that as reagan 
was en route to new jersey air force one and a commuter plane may 
have flown too close to one another but the president was in no 
danger 
the presidents plane and a bar harbour airlines plane came no 
closer than two miles horizontally and 500 feet vertically but 
should have been three miles apart said faa spokesman bob 
buckhorn the faa is investigating the incident he said 
telling the upper darby students that americas prosperity is 
both an opportunity and a challenge reagan said 
i am dedicating myself this year to making sure that this 
future of hope built on opportunity and traditional values remains 
open to each of you i believe that the decisions we americans make 
at the polls this year will determine whether or not that future 
will be bright 
besides praising bush reagan recognized the vice presidents 
controversial running mate dan quayle by quoting his comment in 
last weeks vice presidential debate that america is the envy of 
the world 
the president also reminded the students that when you vote 
for a candidate for the senate or the house youre voting for the 
direction of the country and the world as much as when you vote for 
president 
in the last eight years we have set our sights once again on 
the enduring values of family faith neighborhood opportunity 
and freedom the president said 
i believe prosperity and economic growth are the products of 
strong values he said

troops and rebels are fighting 
housetohouse in the besieged southern sudan town of torit and a 
roman catholic bishop there sent a plea we implore you to pray 
for peace a newspaper reported wednesday 
the englishlanguage newspaper sudan times did not say how it 
received the written plea from archbishop paride taban it 
published the appeal wednesday 
the army meanwhile confirmed reports by the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army that the rebels had captured ikotos a town near 
torit it said soldiers made a tactical withdrawal from the 
town 45 miles north of uganda 
the army claimed its 108man garrison inflicted many casualties 
among more than 3000 rebels attacking from east west and north 
but gave no figures for either side the rebels said friday that 62 
soldiers died in the threeday battle and that 300 fled into uganda 
the fall of ikotos gives the rebels control over three towns 
that form a triangle around torit capital of east equatoria 
province 85 miles east of juba the largest city in the south 
liberation army fighters captured kialla and katire weeks ago 
the sudan times said street fighting was reported this week in 
torit and that the archbishop has been sending appeals for food and 
other relief supplies for the besieged populace 
this is my last message to you tabans message read 
according to the newspaper we implore you to pray for peace 
he said catholic agencies in his diocese have nothing else to 
offer torits thousands of hungry people but the town has given up 
on expecting help from the outside the newspaper reported 
it quoted the archbishop as saying he told his parishioners 
everybody should decide for himself what he should do and we 
cannot do more than pray for the will of god for you 
the liberation army began its rebellion in 1983 in an effort to 
win autonomy for the south and now controls 90 percent of the 
southern countryside and an increasing number of villages and towns 
despite heavy rains in southern sudan this year many areas 
remain plagued by famine because fighting has forced farmers from 
their land 
relief operations are hampered because rebels control 
checkpoints on many roads railways and the nile river and 
threatened to shoot at planes flying in the area without rebel 
permission 
two civilian planes were shot down in 198687 with a loss of 
more than 70 lives a relief plane carrying about 100 people was 
hit last month as it landed at juba

american and soviet officials have agreed to 
set up a disinformation hotline to prevent accusations against 
each others countries from escalating into worldwide propaganda 
campaigns charles z wick head of the us information agency 
said wednesday 
agreement to work toward the establishment of an early 
warning system to challenge disinformation was among the results 
of ussoviet information talks in moscow sept 2628 said wick 
wick gave few details of the proposed system in a national press 
club speech but later used the term hotline suggesting it 
would be a telecommunications link patterned after the 25yearold 
moscowwashington hotline intended to prevent accidental 
triggering of a superpower nuclear war 
the early warning system would be designed to give the 
united states a mechanism to challenge disinformation efforts 
before they become part of a worldwide campaign wick said 
the russians have curtailed dramatically circulation of 
disinformation and extreme false or unsubstantiated charges 
against the united states since last decembers summit between 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said wick 
but exceptions continue he added recalling an official moscow 
radio broadcast he heard a few days ago about western countries 
buying children from impoverished south american countries and 
treating them as slaves 
i couldnt believe my ears we are going to try the hotline 
on that one he said 
wick said gorbachev and his supporters recognize this kind of 
disinformation which was part of the war of ideas a very short time 
ago is counterproductive 
soviet agreement for the voice of america to open a moscow 
bureau was announced after the september talks 
wick said other agreements concluded in moscow included 
commercial distribution of soviet and american films within the two 
countries sale of us newsmagazines for soviet currency provided 
expanded circulation is achieved cooperation in publishing and 
printing and an annual exchange of 1000 high school students from 
each country 
the two countries also agreed to start talks in january on 
setting up cultural centers in each others territory wick said 
terming the agreements important first steps in establishing a 
freer flow of information and a more constructive relationship

levine said he decided to develop his own system of rating 
cities after a study by a geographer in 1984 found levines 
hometown of fresno the worst city in america this time fresno 
ranked 232 out of 286 
the weakness of previous studies was that they assume that 
people who live under better environmental economic and cultural 
conditions are more satisfied with their lives 
psychologists he added though have long recognized that 
favorable living conditions dont always produce subjective 
wellbeing 
levine and fellow researchers kuni miyake and marta lee settled 
on rates of alcoholism suicide divorce and crime as the 
yardsticks to measure by because they are both causes and effects 
of social stress clearly an important element in psychological 
wellbeing he said 
a comparison of the new study with past rankings of the best 
places to live found virtually no correlation levine said 
the sharp differences between our rankings and the others 
indicate that the objective environmental economic and cultural 
conditions they use as guidelines dont relate very well on 
pathology he said when we compared their rankings with the 
alcoholism suicide divorce and crime rates in each city the 
correlations were very weak 
he said the researchers were surprised to learn that higher 
suicide and crime rates were associated with milder climates and 
healthier economic conditions 
we know that moving to a new area often appeals to people who 
are having trouble in their lives and think that a fresh start 
somewhere may help them so they move to a place where conditions 
are most attractive bringing their pathology with them and driving 
up the rates of divorce suicide alcoholism and crime in these 
areas he said 
also sociologists have found that areas where there are many 
migrants suffer from social disorganization as the new arrivals 
struggle to cope with new situations new stresses and new social 
norms he said 
we found that the higher migration rates of the sun belt areas 
of the south and west went with correspondingly higher rates of 
alcoholism suicide divorce and crime whether we compared cities 
or regions levine said

britain and vietnam agreed wednesday to repatriate 
vietnamese refugees who want to return home from hong kong with 
financial assistance from the british government if needed 
britain said about 350 vietnamese boat people who expressed a 
desire to return home will be sent back in a phased program that 
will start immediately 
the agreement was announced at the end of a second round of 
talks between a joint britishhong kong delegation and a vietnamese 
delegation led by the assistant foreign minister vu khoan 
the accord says both sides accept the need for comprehensive 
arrangements for vietnamese boat people who arrived in hong kong 
after june 16 when the british colony moved to curb a steep rise 
in refugees by ending its open door policy 
a foreign office spokesman who by custom was not identified 
said the 9500 vietnamese refugees in question are classified as 
illegal immigrants and will remain in detention centers pending 
outcome of further talks with vietnam 
forcible repatriation of refugees who do not want to return home 
has not been discussed with the vietnamese he said adding 
we will concentrate on the first 350 we hope others will come 
forward and realize that their future is in vietnam 
vu said the returning refugees would be received in a 
humanitarian way 
under hong kong policy now in effect vietnamese who cannot 
prove they are fleeing political persecution are labeled illegal 
immigrants subject to repatriation hong kong holds that most are 
actually economic migrants 
the total number of vietnamese boat people now in camps there is 
25000 
two weeks ago hong kong began broadcasts aiming at vietnam 
explaining the new tough policy in a move to discourage vietnamese 
from heading there 
the delegations also called on other countries to increase their 
efforts to accept vietnamese eligible for resettlement from hong 
kong 
they invited the un high commission for refugees to take part 
in putting into effect the accord to repatriate those vietnamese 
who want to return home

a bipartisan group of senators working on the 
26 billion electionyear drug bill agreed late wednesday on a 
formula for paring down the more than 100 amendments to the 
catchall measure 
under the procedure about 56 of the amendments would either be 
folded into the bill offered as amendments or killed by the 
chambers leaders the remaining amendments would not be offered at 
all 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said the senate 
would vote thursday on whether to follow the proposed formula and 
begin debating the bill 
byrd said that if lawmakers agreed to follow the procedure the 
senate could complete work on the bill by friday congressional 
leaders have been hoping that the house and senate could adjourn 
for the year by friday 
byrd said that if the procedure for considering the amendments 
was not adopted it may mean well have no drug bill 
the majority leader said the drug bill would be amended to 
include provisions giving prosecutors tougher powers to crack down 
on child pornography creating a new position of federal drug 
czar and stiffening sentences for some drug offenses 
the agreement would allow votes on about eight other amendments 
including language stripping a provision establishing the death 
penalty for certain drug offenders who commit murder requiring 
states to randomly test new drivers license applicants and 
allowing some drug offenders to lose federal benefits they might 
receive 
byrd took to the senate floor wednesday morning to urge his 
colleagues to refrain from offering amendments trying to indicate 
who can be the toughest who can be the john wayne in the drug war 
we can all be tough but weve got a good tough bill he 
said 
but some lawmakers were holding out for guarantees that votes 
would be allowed on their own amendments included among them were 
sen phil gramm rtexas who was insisting on votes on proposals 
to toughen sentences for drug offenders convicted of dealing with 
children and to deny many federal benefits to some people found 
guilty of drug sales 
im going to offer those two amendments if im here and 
alive gramm said before entering one of the days negotiating 
sessions 
the focus of much of wednesdays discussion was an amendment by 
sen strom thurmond rsc to limit appeals by convicted 
criminals who claim procedural errors in their trials by late 
wednesday lawmakers thought a compromise might involve delaying a 
final decision until after a commission appointed by supreme court 
chief justice william rehnquist presents its findings next year 
another controversial proposal also advanced by thurmond would 
allow some illegally obtained evidence seized in good faith by 
police officers to be admitted in court lawmakers said a possible 
compromise would involve writing into law the language from a 1984 
supreme court decision that allowed the use of evidence seized by 
police armed with a defective court warrant 
attorney general dick thornburgh came to the capitol to urge 
senate republicans to seek a bill resembling a tough version passed 
last month by the house that legislation included the death 
penalty and many other provisions stiffening penalties and 
increasing the antidrug powers of the authorities 
lawmakers also had to decide how to deal with other amendments 
that have nothing to do with illicit drugs these proposals 
written by senators realizing that the drug bill could be the last 
one to pass congress this year included language requiring warning 
labels on alcoholic beverage containers and imposing sanctions on 
south africa 
one thing the legislation lacked was a way to pay for itself 
lawmakers say 14 billion of the bills pricetag would be spent in 
1989 but concede that the government can currently only scrape 
together no more than 450 million to pay for it the senate has so 
far voted down efforts to raise taxes or slash other spending to 
provide the money 
even if the senate should approve a bill housesenate 
negotiators would have to agree to an identical version of the 
legislation before it could be sent to president reagan for his 
signature

a federal judge and lawyers began the tedious 
process on wednesday of whittling down a list of more than 100 
prospective jurors for the trial of two teamsters officials on 
racketeering and embezzlement charges 
the process of finding a panel of 12 will last at least through 
friday and possibly into next week 
harold friedman 66 is charged with two counts of labor 
racketeering two of embezzlement and two of making false 
statements to the labor department prosecutors contend the alleged 
700000 embezzlement scheme was masterminded by the late jackie 
presser 
friedman is president of the 5000member teamsters local 507 
an international vice president of the union since 1983 president 
of the ohio conference of teamsters and president of teamsters 
joint council 41 in northeast ohio he also is president of bakery 
workers local 19 in cleveland 
codefendant anthony hughes 52 local 507s recording 
secretary is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one 
count of embezzlement 
until recently both friedman and hughes were overshadowed by 
the defense of presser teamsters president from 1983 until he died 
of brain cancer on july 9 presser also was indicted on charges of 
labor racketeering and embezzlement 
questionnaires were handed out to some 125 prospective jurors on 
oct 3 to save lawyers time in the interrogation process district 
judge george w white presided over the start of jury selection 
about 25 possible jurors indicated the expected length of the 
trial from six to eight weeks would cause them personal problems 
and most were dismissed another three were dismissed after 
claiming to know one of the defendants 
with 86 possible jurors then packing the courtroom white asked 
if any of them would be unable to ignore pretrial publicity 
surrounding the case none responded 
federal prosecutors have alleged presser as secretarytreasurer 
of local 507 masterminded the alleged 700000 embezzlement scheme 
the trial culminates a federal probe that came to light on oct 
8 1982 when federal marshals and agents of the department of 
labor inspector generals office seized records at local 507 
the justice department hopes to prove that friedman and hughes 
helped place on the payroll of local 507 three people who received 
money but did no union work and benefitted personally by doing so 
presser and hughes have been identified in pretrial documents 
as fbi informants who would provide their fbi handlers with 
information about organized crime and teamsters innerpolitics 
friedman apparently had no such fbi link and court documents are 
unclear whether he knew anything about the others fbi connection

real estate mogul donald trump announced 
wednesday he has agreed to buy eastern airlines profitable 
northeast air shuttle for 365 million in cash and will rename it 
after himself 
i want to run it as a diamond an absolute diamond trump 
proclaimed to reporters at a news conference with texas air corp 
chairman frank lorenzo at the plaza hotel in new york another 
recent trump acquisition 
he said the threecity service would be renamed the trump 
shuttle and its bluesilver boeing 727s would be redecorated and 
emblazoned with red black and gold stripes 
the deal is expected to be completed by middecember if it 
survives government scrutiny and a legal attack by easterns 
unions who said the sale would be the death of the airline and 
vowed a fight to overturn the deal 
the announcement followed a week of speculation about the 
billionaire developers interest in buying the shuttle from ailing 
eastern which is a major subsidiary of texas air 
the price was well above previous estimates of what trump would 
pay 
its top dollar said robert joedicke an airline analyst 
for the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
many analysts and other observers had estimated that the shuttle 
which serves new york boston and washington dc and is the 
most profitable of easterns operations could fetch 200 million 
to 300 million texas air had tried earlier this year to transfer 
the shuttle operation from eastern to a new subsidiary for 225 
million but eastern unions blocked that attempt 
standard amp poors corp in announcing that it was keeping a 
close eye on eastern in the wake of the shuttle sale said 365 
million was a generous price the interest on that sum could 
recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling 
the shuttle the creditrating agency said 
for the imageconscious trump the purchase could be viewed more 
as a way to enhance his prestige and influence than a straight 
business deal 
earlier this year trump bought the legendary plaza hotel for 
400 million following a heated battle with other suitors trump 
has admitted that he was in love with the hotel for more than a 
decade and tore himself up to get it 
but there also could be compelling business logic behind trumps 
latest acquisition many analysts said trump might use the shuttle 
to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in atlantic 
city nj on the weekends 
its something that were looking at trump said 
trump now operates a helicopter service from new york to 
atlantic city the resort citys bader field is too small to handle 
the boeing 727s operated by the shuttle but the atlantic city 
airport 10 miles from the city can accommodate them 
trump noted a report that he intended to sell the land earmarked 
for a huge commercial development in manhattan to help finance the 
shuttle deal but he did not directly address its accuracy no 
interested party could afford to pay him what the 100acre site is 
worth he joked to reporters 
trump and lorenzo said the shuttle would maintain fares 
competitive with the shuttle service of pan am corp and would not 
lay off any employees the 365 million includes landing rights at 
airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 planes 
pan am said it welcomed trump into the shuttle market pan am 
claims its share of that market has jumped from around 24 percent 
in october 1986 to roughly 45 percent 
eastern said the airlines shuttle service had net income of 
around 168 million in 1987 on revenue of 403 million down from 
a 1985 profit of 282 million on revenue of 492 million 
according to spokesman robin matell pan am has not disclosed 
earnings from its shuttle operations 
the shuttle deal marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of 
eastern the miamibased carrier that has been scarred by 
managementlabor feuding and 1 billion in losses over the past 
decade

a demonstration that temporarily closed food 
and drug administration headquarters underscores the desperation of 
aids sufferers hoping for a chemical cure that so far has escaped 
researchers around the world 
the action tuesday at fdas headquarters building in nearby 
rockville md also highlighted a fundamental problem facing the 
agency charged by law with overseeing the safety and effectiveness 
of its drugs 
in essence the hundreds of demonstrators including more than 
100 arrested for blocking entrances to the building are asking 
the agency to recommend experimental aids treatments as soon as it 
determines they are no more dangerous than aids itself 
the agency says that to do that would eliminate a major reason 
for its existence to apply a scientific sorting process that tries 
to cull quackery from treatments proven safe and effective

containing a taxpayers bill of rights and the other offering 
relief for 20 million owners of mutual funds 
the senate bill which was approved tuesday night on an 871

75 billion price tag 
far more provisions are identical in both bills both would

the federal diesel tax on fuel for offroad use and raise some 
taxes to pay for the benefits 
the tax bill and a comprehensive plan for fighting drug abuse

gucci relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart 
the family and the firm it had built 
the company was a part of my life says giorgio paolos 
older brother i had always smelled the perfume of leather had 
always watched my grandfather in the shop in florence working with 
so much energy 
in 1984 maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize 
control and oust aldo the young bespectacled maurizio brought in 
a new team of managers 
the board decided the company had to be professionally 
managed explains cucchiani one of the young americaneducated 
executives 
but older family members saw it differently 
maurizio wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm says 
his cousin giorgio 
peace did not reign for long maurizios relatives alleged that 
the papers giving him half the company on his fathers death in 
1983 had forged signatures maurizios shares were frozen 
based on his relatives charges courts in florence and milan 
charged maurizio with exporting capital and evading taxes an 
arrest warrant was issued and maurizio took refuge in switzerland 
to replace him stateappointed custodians of his shares 
appointed a milan business professor maria martellini 
a new era has begun martellini says the company has a 
place in the market that is more important than the specific 
problems of the gucci family 
under its new management the company has launched a program to 
expand production standardize the quality of its stores and trim 
its product line which had expanded beyond leather goods to 
100000 items 
sales increased by nearly 4 percent from 2297 billion lire in 
1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 about 170 million at current 
exchange rates

last spring giorgio and his brothers roberto and paolo decided 
to sell most of their shares in the company the purchaser was 
investcorp an arab investment bank 
while a judge ruled in july that 40yearold maurizio could 
return to italy his shares are frozen if he loses his court 
cases he may have to sell some 
giorgio says he parted with his shares because the new 
management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional 
standards 
the new managers however insist the company will continue to 
reflect the vision of guccio gucci 
there is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and 
feuds says cucchiani the strength is the consumer who wants 
this brand the strength is also with the people who work with the 
company that want the gucci splendor and the artisans that want 
that splendor

something special happened when the widower and 
the divorcee each 60 years of age struck up a conversation while 
they waited in a supermarket checkout line 
before long they were getting together regularly for dinners 
movies and trips to the local museum 
they had many shared interests their children were grown and 
well established with families of their own 
neither of them was rich but both owned homes that had 
appreciated greatly in value since they had bought them many years 
before 
so after the joyous day of their wedding they were able to sell 
those houses buy a comfortable condominium and put the rest of the 
proceeds in incomeproducing investments 
what possibly could be wrong with a happy tale like this well 
not much maybe but it would have been even better if the sequence 
of events had been altered just a bit 
the couple needlessly forfeited about 35000 that could have 
paid for say a long honeymoon cruise 
if they had checked with a good financial adviser they would 
have sold their houses first and gotten married afterward 
that way say experts on the subject each could have claimed a 
tax break sheltering 125000 of the profits from the sale of their 
houses once they were married they could claim that exemption 
only once 
the 125000 exemption was written into the tax laws with an 
intent that is readily apparent to make it more practicable for 
people 55 years of age or older to help finance their later years 
with proceeds from the sale of a home 
but the rules had to be framed so that people werent encouraged 
to go into the propertyflipping business on their 55th birthdays 
cashing in on the tax break over and over again 
thus was it decreed that the exclusion could be taken only once 
in an individuals or a couples lifetime 
both spouses are ineligible for the exclusion if either of 
them previously claimed it points out the accounting firm of 
kmpg peat marwick 
only one exclusion is allowed per couple therefore even if 
the exclusion was not claimed previously a married couple cannot 
claim exclusions for two homes 
couples who are planning to be married and who both wish to 
take advantage of the exclusion should sell their residences prior 
to the marriage 
in some internal revenue service publications says william 
brennan an adviser on tax and investment planning the agency says 
the couple in our story having sold both houses before taking 
their nuptial vows might still run into a snag if they filed a 
joint tax return 
as a married couple the irs material says they are entitled to 
just one exemption 
but a memo issued last spring concludes that the critical time 
for determining the existence of a marriage is on the date the 
houses were sold brennan observes 
if they were sold before the marriage each is entitled to a 
125000 exclusion filing a joint return has no impact 
there are some other fine points about the 125000 exclusion 
that are noteworthy for anyone using a house as a building block in 
a retirement savings plan 
for one thing points out the accounting firm of deloitte 
haskins amp sells you must have owned and lived in the home for at 
least three of the five years preceding the sale to claim the 
exemption 
also you could conceivably find yourself in a situation where 
you might think about passing up the exclusion to save it for use 
on some future home sale 
says deloitte haskins amp sells since this is a onetime 
exclusion you should consider carefully the time you decide to use 
it

teamwork is fast outpacing individual effort 
in the corporate world and forwardlooking companies are 
encouraging employee unity through new means that often include an 
unorthodox business concept fun 
while the company picnic and christmas party still rank among 
the most popular extracurricular activities some companies are 
relying on more creative means to break down corporate hierarchies 
and build up team spirit 
having fun is absolutely critical because it energizes 
people said eric flamholtz professor of human resources at the 
graduate school of management at the university of california los 
angeles but you want to simultaneously develop new skills and 
insights that can be applied in a practical sense to make the 
organization more effective 
take an allday seminar for about 70 executives sales managers 
and support staff at a los angeles sales division of atampt 
communications 
following lunch guest speaker nigel livingwage approached the 
dais introduced himself as an expert in computer accessing took a 
sip of coffee and dropped dead 
livingwage also known as buzz noe is an actor and partner in 
capers a company that plans murder mysteries these days almost 
exclusively for corporate clients including pacific bell blue 
cross and honeywell 
the atampt employees had been given subtle clues throughout the 
morning that something was amiss a shifty waiter who never set 
down a coffee pot an appearance by an eccentric british mystery 
writer played by noes wife and partner lynn chaplin and a 
japanese businessman who was really a caucasian actor wearing 
makeup 
mr moto the japanese character was so convincing despite 
his phony appearance that three atampt employees approached him 
trying to sell him some telecommunications services noe said 
entertainment aside the amateur sleuthhounds now divided into 
six teams got down to the issue at hand who killed the speaker 
and why 
after a while questionnaires were handed out to be answered by 
the employees individually identical forms were then handed to 
each team to be answered as a whole 
the capers staff then graded the surveys and plotted statistics 
comparing the individual scores to the team scores 
the whole idea is that the group should do as well if not 
better than the individuals ms chaplin said if that wasnt 
the case it became clear that they didnt pool their resources or 
depend on the person who had the most correct answers 
the exercise ms chaplin said allows the teamwork concept to 
get out of the corporate environment and forces people who do not 
normally interact to communicate with each other 
it puts everyone on the same level she said it gives the 
big guy the opportunity to see that he always has something to 
learn from his support staff 
but such games are not without their critics 
its gimmicky said robert o metzger adjunct professor at 
the university of southern california and director of the campuss 
center for operations management 
its playing to managements natural desire to simple quick 
solutions to what in effect are very complex and involved 
management issues he said 
when you look at some of the efforts that have gone into 
improved teamwork you find that ford motor co spent eight years 
and several million dollars before employees felt they would not be 
risking their jobs if they stopped the assembly line because of 
what they believed was a problem in quality control metzger said 
flamholtz the ucla professor agreed 
teambuilding activities that most closely resemble everyday 
working situations are always more effective than those that 
dont he said 
but atampt branch manager dennis kruse who organized the murder 
mystery event said his goal was not to solve his divisions 
management problems 
it certainly helped to break down barriers kruse said 
thats the first step 
if its fine tuning youre looking for of course youll need 
more time and a more structured format

election of the first woman bishop in the 
historic apostolic succession rankled some sectors in that 
tradition but safeguards had been erected in advance to cushion 
the shock 
these aimed both in the us episcopal church in which the 
election occurred and in the worldwide anglican communion of which 
the u s church is a part to stave off ruptures as a result 
the event nevertheless heightened strains on the issue both 
domestically and internationally in that 70millionmember 
household of faith and frayed unity talks with roman catholicism 
and eastern orthodoxy 
they also along with anglicans claim a succession of bishops 
traced back to the time of jesuss apostles and passed on by that 
lineage but without women in it 
other churches including some protestant bodies with bishops a 
few women among them dont maintain that ancient succession 
the first woman chosen for it the rev barbara c harris 58 
of philadelphia was elected sept 24 by a convention in boston of 
the episcopal diocese of massacusetts as suffragan assistant 
bishop 
for many it is the occasion of great joy and celebration 
said episcopal presiding bishop edmond l browning of new york 
for many it is a troubling time that will test our 
commitment to the unity of the church 
it sent tremors through the anglican world already in turmoil 
over the lesser ordination of women clergy in a half dozen of its 
28 national branches including the us episcopal church and 
ruffled some ecumenical counterparts 
roman catholic archbishop john f whealon of hartford conn 
cochairman of u s anglicanroman catholic talks called the 
action a major setback to soughtfor unity similar roman 
reactions came on the international level 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie leader of the worlds 
anglicans said in london said the event would have farreaching 
consequences and he pledged to uphold unity as we begin to 
work out the implications 
rumblings of dissent also arose both domestically and 
internationally the rev jerome polititzer presdident of the 
prayer book society of the episcopal church said its survey of lay 
members show a majority oppose women bishops 
in london the church of englands bishop graham leonard a 
leading opponent of women priests said the event will cause deep 
divisions 
in common with many other bishops i would be unable to 
recognize a woman bishop or the validity of any ordinations or 
confirmations performed by her he said 
a few us episcopal bishops also hold this view and so far 
have declined to recognize even women clergy although they were 
authorized by the whole churchs convention in 1976 and about 
1200 women have been ordained 
despite continuing tensions over it both the 27millionmember 
u s church and anglicans internationally have taken steps for 
living with the differences without breakaing up 
with the posibility of a woman bishop being elected in mind the 
lambeth conference a onceinl0years world assembly of anglicana 
bishop in august approved what was called the great compromise 
passed by an an overwhelming majority of 423 to 28 the bishops 
of the 28 branches including both proponents and opponents of 
female clergy upheld the right of each branch to decide for itself 
whether to consecrate women bishops 
the measure calls for mutual respect between branches which 
disagree on the issue and exercise of courtesy between bishops of 
differing opinions conference resolution are not binding but 
carry much weight among members 
an international commission was authorized to work out means to 
hold the communion together once a woman was conscrated a bishop 
and anglican archbishop robert eames of ireland was named to head 
the sevenmember body 
runcie said the spirit of the lambeth conference has given 
all the bishops including those against the ordination of women 
the inspiration to maintain the highest possible degree of unity 
with those who differ 
in a similar backstop measure in the united states the 
episcopal churchs governing convention last july in detroit 
approved a scheme whereby any congregation rejecting a woman bishop 
could petition for a male episcopal visitor bishop to 
administer confirmations 
but the woman bishop still would make the periodic pastoral 
visits required by church law even to congregations rejecting 
women bishops 
the election of bishopelect harris 58 still remains subject 
to ratification by a majority of the churchs bishops and 118 
diocesan standing committees but there was no indication it would 
be widely challenged 
her consecration and installation is expected to be early next 
year in boston 
meanwhile another woman the rev margo elaine maris of 
minneapolis was among nominees for suffragan bishop of minnesota 
in an election scheduled oct 29

oscar arias sanchez was making a big mistake in 
his 1986 campaign for the presidency of costa rica said his 
campaign manager from the united states 
play down domestic economic issues new yorker joe napolitan 
urged arias instead emphasize the need for peace in central 
america 
arias turned around his losing campaign won the election and 
went on to father a central american peace plan that won him the 
1987 nobel peace prize 
the election was one more victory for the peripatetic americans 
who are finding more and more work these days as advisers to 
foreign political campaigns 
for 20 years americans have traveled the world to help 
candidates in both fledgling and longstanding democracies decide 
which issues are the key to success in their races they also tutor 
them in the latest us electioneering techniques and technology 
sensitive to any suggestion that they change the nature of the 
political systems they intervene in us campaign firms and 
advisers keep a low profile but americans have been deeply 
involved in national elections in more than 30 nations including 
australia canada panama spain britain france ireland 
nigeria mexico the philippines japan and greece 
in israel with a presidential election scheduled for nov 1 
labor party leader shimon peres is getting presidential campaign 
advice from david sawyer of the sawyermiller group based in new 
york 
sawyers firm also advised members of the opposition in chile 
where a wellorganized campaign against the president gen augusto 
pinochet resulted this month in voters rejecting his bid for 
another term 
while the americans claim credit for electing their clients 
most of them strenuously deny having any influence in the 
subsequent policy of the government 
the theme of a campaign however invariably determines the 
publics expectations of the winners policy 
i think its the same as in america acknowledged joe 
cerrell president of the international association of political 
consultants i dont see much difference they can impact policy 
they can change governments 
some might think americans in foreign campaigns would be 
controversial with opposition candidates claiming us 
manipulation theres good reason why that rarely happens 
all the sides use them so it would be the pot calling the 
kettle black said larry sabato a professor of political science 
at the university of virginia for instance both corazon aquino 
and ferdinand marcos had us advisers in their presidential 
election 
actually to people assessing whether to take us or not it 
doesnt appear to be a question of are we compromising on our 
values by taking in outsiders said mark mallochbrown a 
british adviser from sawyermiller who advised mrs aquino in her 
198485 presidential campaign 
the way they see it is if we bring in stateoftheart 
techniques is there a way we can win this election more 
effectively more honestly 
cerrell agreed that arias campaign on the central american 
peace issue was a prime example of a campaign strategy that had 
farreaching implications long after the election 
oddly enough arias was opposed to that campaign strategy 
napolitan recalls 
his argument was that everybodys in favor of peace nobody is 
in favor of war napolitan said 
we agreed with that but pointed out that the more he started 
talking about peace the more he would become identified as the 
peace candidate and thats what happened and to his credit he 
carried through after the election by coming out with his peace 
plan 
advisers are evasive about how much they earn they say it is a 
business secret and that their charges vary widely depending on 
the length of a campaign and what services a client needs 
published estimates of charges suggest a national campaign by a 
top us adviser costs about 150000 for the basic consultants 
fee with expenses tripling the bill 
sawyer said his firm advises some candidates such as mrs 
aquino for free 
sawyermiller maintains contracts with some clients even after 
the election 
to keep a high enough level of mobilization and enthusiasm for 
the political goals youre trying to achieve said 
mallochbrown requires a constant political campaigntype 
dialogue with the population 
napolitan has longstanding contracts with venezuelan parties 
where he has been running campaigns since the early 1970s 
campaign advisers typically go to a country conduct polls to 
find out what the key issues are among uncommitted voters then 
target those swing issues which may not be the concerns of the 
majority of the public 
sabato an expert on campaign advisers believes reliance on 
advisers and polls to chose campaign themes leads to passive 
reactionoriented government 
i think theres a natural tension between a representatives 
role as a delegate a faithful mirror of the constituency and as a 
trustee someone who is charged with making the right decisions 
even if they are unpopular said sabato 
if you are wedded to polling results and if they are readily 
available to you and consultants are constantly whispering in your 
ear and telling you what people are demanding youre much more 
inclined to fulfill your delegates role to the detriment of your 
trusteeship 
the consultants flatly disagree 
you cant have it both ways sometimes you have presidents in 
this country and others who are criticized because they are poorly 
advised or dont have advisers said napolitan 
you cant say the guy should not have advisers what is the 
whole government for really but to advise the president whats 
the difference if he gets expertise inside the country or outside 
the country 
the international association of political consultants has about 
125 members more than half of them american most of the rest are 
from europe but there are also australian japanese south and 
central american and middle eastern members 
american advisers draw on the experience they gain in the 
elaborate us campaigns for congress and the presidency 
this year well have 400 or 500 elections in america many of 
them very hardfought campaigns with a lot of money being spent 
said napolitan venezuela has one every five years i work on 
more elections in a twoyear period for example than any latin 
american has worked on in his life

its a familiar role the voice of wisdom and 
experience prevailing over headstrong young charges eager to take 
on the world 
lorne greene was the father figure as well as the father in 
bonanza tige andrews looked after hippie cops in the mod 
squad harry morgan was the gruff but forgiving leader of the 
misfits in mash 
in the case of fox broadcasting cos harddriving pulsating 
young crime drama 21 jump street the job goes to steven 
williams 
williams as capt adam fuller oversees a squad of rookie cops 
whose babyfaced looks allow them to pose as teenage toughs and 
ferret out highschool criminals the show also stars johnny depp 
holly robinson dustin nguyen and peter deluise richard grieco 
joins the cast in the new season as a rebel policeman partnered 
with depp 
im the daddy of jump street said williams in an 
interview the day before he returned to vancouver canada to 
resume filming on the series 
peter calls me the eye of the storm im the big cheese in 
charge the fuller we like to see is the consummate professional 
cop thats his job he teaches these young people hes their 
friend but hes also a student himself he learns from them his 
first duty is to make sure his wards become good cops and survive 
undercover work is dangerous both physically and mentally 
the tall slender actor with a beard and moustache took over 
the role from frederic forrest after about six episodes forrests 
role was written as a throwback to the 1960s but the producers 
felt the young people who watch the show couldnt relate to that 
fuller is a very contemporary character 
williams previously starred as lt jefferson burnett on the 
first season of cbs the equalizer and was the policeman in hot 
pursuit of john belushi and dan aykroyd in blues brothers 
prior to taking over the role he rode with officers from the 
los angeles police department 
i learned from that how dangerous undercover work is he 
said they put their lives on the line every day they deal with 
the worst element and when youre undercover it can be emotionally 
tough because you lose your identity you start to identify with 
the other side 
williams said he also asked policemen what they think when they 
see officers portrayed on television they said they hate seeing 
cops do dumb things he said you always see a cop stick his 
finger in dope and taste it real cops never do that it could be 
some bad stuff and theyd die you see cops check their weapons 
with all the sound effects click click click cops know their 
weapons they dont have to do that

the political coverup in the nbc miniseries 
favorite son might have worked if the conspirators hadnt 
underestimated the cynical jaded veteran fbi agent assigned to 
the case 
an unknown sniper has assassinated a contra leader and wounded a 
us senator on the capitol steps and the presidents chief of 
staff doesnt want the case solved 
so the case goes to nick mancuso an fbi agent on the verge of 
retirement and david ross an inexperienced young agent 
hes not over the hill said robert loggia who plays 
mancuso hes being forced to retire at 55 because thats fbi 
policy hes a maverick agent which exists in the fbi theyre not 
all plastic men the heavies pick him because they think hes past 
his prime and the kids a greenhorn a couple of stiffs wholl 
botch the job 
mancusos the conscience of the piece i guess in his own way 
hes the real patriot of the piece hes a man doing his job well 
serving his country well he can make a difference as an 
individual 
favorite son which centers on a plot to win the 
presidential nomination will air just one week before the real 
presidential election the sixhour threepart miniseries based 
on the bestselling political thriller by steve sohmer runs 
sunday monday and tuesday oct 31nov 2 
harry hamlin stars as an ambitious young senator linda 
kozlowski as his even more ambitious imagemaker lance guest as 
loggias fbi partner james whitmore as the president stepfanie 
kramer as the producer of a tv morning show ronny cox as the head 
of the cia kenneth mcmillan as the head of the fbi and mitchell 
ryan as the vice president jeff bleckner directed from sohmers 
screenplay 
favorite son is a powerful story of corruption in high 
places and as the suspense builds viewers will be guessing until 
the end which are the good guys and which are the villains 
the complex story functions on several levels its a thriller 
about a murderous plot to capture the presidential nomination it 
examines the power of television in making or breaking a candidate 
and its a vehicle that could lead to a series for robert loggia 
one of the hottest and most talented character actors in movies and 
television 
it could be a pilot but there are a few other steps said 
loggia we might do a movieoftheweek on mancuso its a really 
a case of waitandsee see what kind of ratings numbers it gets 
nick mancuso is a good character but i dont know if it can be 
projected into a series 
mancuso is similar to sam ransom the rumpled detective that 
earned an oscar nomination for loggia in the feature film the 
jagged edge loggia calls nick an italian version of sam 
we didnt do this picture with fbi cooperation said loggia 
but when we did an officer and a gentleman the navy was very 
apprehensive and didnt cooperate then afterward it came to be 
used by the navy as a recruiting film i wouldnt be surprised if a 
lot of young guys sign up for the fbi after seeing this miniseries 
we see mancuso go full out you see what makes him tick in the 
end the resolution of this character is very positive 
loggias acting career goes back to the days of live television 
he starred in two series the nine lives of elfego baca in 1958 
on the disney show and the cat in 196667 but in recent 
years his career has exploded 
it started with his role as a boozing sailor in an officer and 
a gentleman he was a cuban drug kingpin in scarface a mafia 
lawyer in prizzis honor a detective in the believers 
anwar sadat in a woman called golda a beachcomber in hot 
pursuit the murderous school principal in echoes in the 
darkness and a warmhearted toy manufacturer in the current hit 
big 
i got a nomination for jagged edge which wasnt expected 
he said the producer and director didnt expect the role to have 
that kind of impact its not a bad way to work to give more than 
they expect the best thing is youre not trapped in a heavy or 
ethnic role 
i think you aim for this kind of thing you can be a onetrick 
pony or have a whole bag of tricks i guess what were at now is to 
go from character supporting actor to character leading man id 
certainly rather carry the ball i think favorite son will help 
in this 
loggia recently returned from sri lanka where he costarred with 
david warner brian kerwin and alice krige in a spy movie a 
permanent title hasnt been selected but its been known as 
spies on ice and spooks 
next he goes to chicago to play the father in a family drama 
for cbs called the oconnors 
its a morality conflict he said were an irish catholic 
family one sons a priest ones in real estate at a heavy level 
hal linden plays a big real estate operator

the drought that laid waste millions of 
acres of wheat and grazing land across the midwest now threatens to 
create a new victim north dakotas already hardpressed schools 
few states are suffering more acutely from the drought than 
north dakota whose highly regarded schools were already reeling 
from a prolonged slump in crop and energy prices droughtaffected 
states like illinois oklahoma and nebraska have cut or frozen 
education spending this year but north dakotas current state 
appropriation of 3464 million is fully 42 million less than it 
spent on public schools seven years ago 
how serious is the drought for our schools on a scale of one 
to 10 it is about an eight its very serious it wouldnt have 
been so serious if we hadnt been struggling for the last six years 
with the oil problem said gov george sinner 
the drought has so far cost this economically depressed state 2 
billion a 10 percent drop in the states gross product sinner 
said in an interview at a time when the push for school reform was 
prompting many states to boost spending sinner this fall had to 
cut school aid 2 percent or 9 million the fourth education cut 
in north dakota in as many years 
the latest cut means state aid dropped by 52 per pupil 
spending per pupil is 3481 31st in the nation six years ago 
the state ranked 23rd 
teacher salaries average 21660 47th in the nation six years 
ago they ranked 30th 
yet in many ways the crisis is paradoxical north dakotans from 
the governor on down tend to regard public schools for all their 
apparent troubles as a comparative bright spot in the states 
picture 
the states 118000 students generally score well in tests of 
basic skills ninety percent graduate from high school the third 
best rate in the nation although educators concede thats at least 
partly because school is the only game in town for rural 
youngsters especially in hard times 
a statewide poll last september by the university of north 
dakota found that 41 percent of respondents think schools have 
improved from five years ago a comparable gallup poll conducted 
nationwide found just 25 percent of respondents felt that way about 
their schools 
demographically the schools have much going for them the state 
has fewer singleparent families than the national average north 
dakotans are ethnically homogeneous the state has a long ardent 
tradition of support for public education 
many here refer glowingly to the prairie ethic the 
toughness of the early german and scandinavian settlers who a 
century ago turned this harsh land into the nations leading wheat 
producer 
yet that very ethic may be making north dakotans slow to react 
to the schools crisis educators fear there is practically no 
chance for new state taxes this year to bail out schools said 
state senator bonnie heinrich a member of the legislatures 
education finance committee 
the prairie ethic is a doubleedged sword because weve got to 
change we cant just ask how did our ancestors tough it out 
before said david smette superintendent of the dickinson school 
district located in the western section of the state hardest hit 
by the agricultural and energy slumps 
the biggest fear is that the drought will hasten the already 
pronounced exodus of teachers and young people north dakota has 
become a favorite recruiting ground for teachers especially for 
districts in texas california and arizona that promise higher 
salaries and appealing lifestyles said peg portscheller president 
of the north dakota education association 
right now the talk among teachers of leaving is more than at 
any time ive ever heard said james peters a guidance counselor 
at dickinson high school 
seventy percent of young north dakotans are leaving the state 
after finishing school said portscheller in the most depressed 
places like dickinson its worse a visitor asked 50 high school 
seniors at dickinson high if they would stay in the state one said 
he would 
i dont think there are a lot of job opportunities here 
said nicole fruh 17 who plans to attend the university of 
minnesota at morris next year 
mary johnson president of dickinsons board of education said 
ive got a brother in denver a brother in minneapolis my sister 
left for oregon to look for work another sisters in new jersey 
and my folks are in arizona i wouldnt be surprised if my three 
kids leave someday thats the story of north dakota 
leaving the state is not necessarily what kids want but were 
not giving them the opportunity to dream to explore to build 
said portscheller 
north dakota ranks 50th in the number of students enrolled in 
advanced placement high school classes many schools lack art 
programs and offer little or no advanced math or science only 19 
percent of high school students take a foreign language compared 
with a third of high schoolers nationwide 
in north dakota reform isnt on the backburner it isnt even 
on the stove said portscheller 
most people in this state think schools are ok but educators 
generally agree that were in a state of crisis weve put children 
on hold she said we do a good job with basic skills but 
if you look beyond the basics like problem solving and the ability 
to make good decisions im not sure were cutting the mustard 
in dickinson where teachers and administrators have already 
been laid off there is talk of eliminating entire programs if the 
economy doesnt improve 
science labs at dickinson high are short of specimens 
microscopes and other equipment the elementary school has no 
central library and just one instructional computer 
the dickinson district cut 12 million from its budget in the 
last two years the current 98 million budget includes a 500000 
deficit that will almost certainly lead to more cuts and possibly 
layoffs 
as area oil jobs have disappeared and farm prices have dropped 
land values have declined and school budgets heavily dependent on 
property taxes have suffered accordingly dickinsons property tax 
valuations have dropped from a high of 24 million in 1984 to a 
current 17 million local real estate agent robert karn said homes 
that sold for 68000 four years ago now go for 32000 
for many small districts the drought may prove the last straw 
before consolidation a dreaded step in isolated towns where 
having a school is what keeps them on the map but many such 
districts barely meet minimum standards according to a report on 
north dakota school problems issued last january 
state sen heinrich sighed when asked about the future of north 
dakota schools 
theres always hope she said if the feds come up with a 
great drought program if we can get some light industry if opec 
lets oil prices go up a bit and if it would rain

crude oil futures trading has been volatile amid 
rumors about opec production and analysts predict the market will 
remain nervous as long as the cartels problems remain unresolved 
the price for the november contract for west texas intermediate 
oil changed course several times during tuesdays session trading 
as high as 1374 and as low as 1330 a barrel the contract for 
the benchmark us crude settled at 1355 down 5 cents from 
mondays close 
like mondays session when november west texas intermediate 
climbed 66 cents tuesdays trading was dominated by rumors and 
speculation about production by the 13members organization of 
petroleum exporting countries analysts said 
prices rose monday as saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
exporter reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota if 
other members of opec did 
on tuesday prices again moved higher said richard redoglia a 
trader with merrill lynch energy futures but the market turned 
lower when saudi king fahd failed to discuss opec members 
inability to stay within their output quotas during an address 
redoglia said 
rumors that the united arab emirates was willing to cut its 
production then hit the market and prices advanced again before 
finally slipping lower at the end of the day he said 
redoglia who described trading as volatile attributed 
tuesdays brief rallies to short covering in which investors buy 
contracts to offset those they sold earlier 
he said the markets underlying fundamentals remained negative 
the bearishness about opec overproduction is still there he 
said predicting the market is going to continue trading like 
this until opec can resolve its differences

the wedding invitations printed in delicate 
script were mailed to a select group of international bankers 
promising a grand affair 
but the bride and groom were really undercover federal 
agents and the nuptials were a charade which resulted in the arrest 
of 11 partygoers linked to an alleged international drug and 
moneylaundering operation 
seven of the 11 were nabbed saturday night as they rolled into 
tampa in chauffeured limousines for what was supposed to be a wild 
bachelor party in a penthouse suite 
they thought they were really going to a stag party not a one 
of them had any idea of what was going on joseph p ladow jr 
assistant special agent in charge of the us customs office in 
tampa said tuesday after indictments were unsealed naming 85 
defendants including an international bank 
individuals in 10 us cities and paris and london were accused 
of participating in a ring that laundered profits for the colombian 
cocaine trade through the luxembourgbased bank of credit and 
commerce international or bcci holdings 
bcci two subsidiaries and nine bank officials were charged with 
laundering 14 million in drug profits collected in seven us 
cities 
the elaborate wedding ruse began months ago when federal 
authorities tried to come up with a way to arrest as many suspects 
at once to reduce the chances they would escape 
a wedding was a perfect opportunity ladow said 
an undercover customs agent had infiltrated the alleged money 
laundering operation posing as a financier and investor as his 
relationship with suspects developed he introduced a woman he said 
was his fiancee and business partner 
the couple became a part of the suspects social and business 
scene traveling to parties dinner engagements and sporting 
events including a championship boxing match in miami authorities 
said 
six months ago they announced their engagement 
invitations went out for the marriage of kathleen corrine 
erickson and robert l musella the agents fictitious names 
the affair was set for sunday at the exclusive innisbrook resort 
and golf club near tarpon springs 35 miles northewest of tampa 
federal agents did not tip the resort to their plan 
as guests and their families arrived they were greeted by 
undercover agents posing as friends of the happy couple and were 
wined and dined at cocktail parties 
eight to 10 limousines ferried partygoers to tampa for the 
bachelor bash 
we had undercover agents in the cars ladow said all the 
way over there were comments about hey were going to party 
tonight 
when the bankers stepped off an elevator into the arm of waiting 
agents they didnt understand what was happening officials said 
one suspect apparently had been to a recent striptease party 
where a dancer placed handcuffs on him before her bumpandgrind 
routine so when the handcuffs were slapped on him saturday night 
he didnt get upset according to agents 
he was all smiles he said all right lets party said 
ladow he thought it was a prelude to the same thing 
but as things began to sink in another suspect moaned i 
thought they could only do this in the movies

the broiler a tender young chicken that 
doesnt live to a ripe old age is gradually becoming a locally 
grown food item in the third world instead of an imported delicacy 
says agriculture department analyst ary vocke 
one reason has been the modernization of chicken production in 
some third world countries where technology and us grain have 
been used to begin or expand domestic broiler industries 
for example he said the grandparents of a broiler raised 
in saudi arabia may be from europe the corn in his feed ration 
from the united states and the soybean meal from brazil 
vocke added the automated feeding equipment that delivers the 
ration may be from the united states the saudi arabian family that 
eats this broiler probably used to eat chicken from western europe 
and the united states 
because of the rapid growth of poultry production the third 
world has become a net importer of coarse grains such as corn and 
sorghum he said and continued expansion will likely create even 
more markets for the united states and other grain exporters 
vocke who works in the departments economic research service 
described third world poultry development and its impact on trade 
in a new report on world agriculture 
the countries listed as major chicken meat importers included 
saudi arabia iraq egypt hong kong singapore kuwait yemen arab 
republic oman jamaica iran zaire and mexico third world 
exporters included brazil and thailand 
modern broiler production even in countries that are short on 
feed doesnt have to be linked to land and climate the way crop 
production is 
raising broilers has become an industrial activity the final 
step in the production process vocke said the first step 
includes grain producers and foundation poultry breeders the grain 
and breeding stock they produce are inputs for feed manufacturing 
and hatching egg operations 
the feed rations and young chicks are the ingredients for the 
final step raising the chicks to market size because grain and 
breeding stock are easily transported broilers can be raised 
almost anywhere 
vocke noted that the broiler industry which was pioneered in 
the united states and raised to a high degree of specialization is 
relatively new sixty years ago chickens were raised mostly for 
eggs by farm families chicken meat from young fryers and old 
hens was a byproduct 
city consumers found chicken often expensive relative to pork 
and beef in grandmothers time chicken on sunday was a family 
treat 
these conditions are not much different from those found in 
many third world countries today vocke said few foresaw the 
technological and organizational innovations that created the 
broiler industry 
the integration of the industry from feed preparation to 
slaughter and marketing resulted in reduced broiler production 
costs and lower retail prices broilers made a hit with american 
shoppers and consumption levels rose 
it is this experience that is being relived in the third world 
but vocke said the technology transfer to the countries beginning 
to expand poultry output requires money or foreign exchange for 
the purchase of hatching and growing facilities 
feed mills for preparing rations are a high priority he 
said a local mill can reduce the recurring cost of importing 
feeds even if some of the ingredients still have to be imported 
also storage bins and equipment for feed ingredients may have 
to be imported and if slaughtering is to be done in modern plants 
that could mean further import spending 
in traditional markets chickens are sold live and often 
slaughtered on the spot vocke said with urbanization and 
increasing concern about sanitation slaughtering in plants becomes 
more common 
broiler productivity has been hampered by the shortage of 
foreign exchange in some third world countries he said zimbabwe 
for example is selfsufficient in grains but has a lack of foreign 
exchange to import vitamins medicines and minerals for use in 
higher quality feed 
the developing broiler industries are also hurt if they cant 
import chicks or hatching eggs from the united states or europe 
vocke said that the proportion of total poultry output coming 
from modern operations is estimated at between a third and 
twothirds in the lowerincome countries of asia and africa 
in the higher income countries of latin america north africa 
and the far east the proportion is between 70 percent and 90 
percent he said in some middle eastern countries it is above 
90 percent 
but broilers are not always the locally favored source of animal 
protein vocke said and unlike chickens grazing cattle sheep 
and goats dont compete with humans for grains grown for domestic 
consumption or for foreign exchange to import grains 
some countries however do not have sufficient land or a 
suitable climate either to provide grazing for ruminants such as 
cattle and goats or to grow grain to feed poultry or pigs he 
said when demand for animal proteins grows countries can import 
meat or in the case of broilers may import the production 
technology and the feed ingredients to raise the birds locally

deliveries of some of boeing cos new 747400 
jumbo jets will be delayed by a month or so boeing commercial 
airplanes said 
dean d thornton president of the boeing operating company 
said tuesday that of the 161 747400s ordered by 21 customers 20 
planes will be delivered an average of one month past the 
previously agreed upon date 
we intend to obtain federal aviation administration 
certification of the 747400 in december to deliver the first two 
aircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule by 
mid1989 thornton said 
two deliveries will be pushed back from december to early 1989 
and there will be a substantial reduction in firstquarter 1989 
deliveries the company said in a news release most of the 
deliveries will be made up in the second quarter of 1989 it said 
thornton said far more orders for the new jet were received from 
customers on an earlier schedule than anticipated when the program 
was launched in october 1985 
thornton said the delays are due to the increase of 747 
production rates at boeings everett plant from two planes to five 
a month and to customers seeking a wider variety of plane 
configurations than on earlier programs 
the delays also stem from the 747400s being offered with three 
different engine types with each being introduced and certified in 
a record four months 
boeing is doing its best to minimize the impact of the delays on 
customers thornton said including working overtime and 
reassigning additional experienced workers to the 747 plant 
the new jet which made its first flight earlier this year is 
the largest commercial jet in production the plane will be able to 
carry 412 passengers more than 8000 miles and greater passenger 
loads on shorter trips

donald trump has bought the profitable eastern 
airlines shuttle from texas air corp for 365 million cash and 
will rename it after himself it was announced today but easterns 
militant union leaders called the sale the death of the airline and 
vowed a fight 
i want to run it as a diamond an absolute diamond the 
flamboyant real estategambling mogul proclaimed to reporters at a 
joint news conference with texas air chairman frank lorenzo at the 
plaza hotel in new york another recent trump acquisition 
youre going to be flying with something thats quality and 
good trump said of the moneymaking commuter service between the 
heavily traveled cities of boston new york and washington 
he said the shuttle will now be called the trump shuttle and 
its bluesilver boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with 
red black and gold stripes the deal is expected to be completed 
by middecember 
lorenzo told reporters the sale was not our preferrred 
course but he said easterns militant unions had created a 
situation that deprived management of the right to negotiate 
the texas air chief also confirmed speculation he had talked 
with takeover strategist carl icahn head of trans world airlines 
inc about selling him other operations of eastern which 
lorenzos company bought two years ago creating the nations 
biggest airline company texas air also owns continental airlines 
a nonunion carrier based in houston 
trump and lorenzo said the shuttle will maintain fares 
competitive with the northeast shuttle service operated by pan am 
corp and wont lay off any employees the 365 million cash 
acquisition substantially above previous estimates of the 
shuttles sale price includes landing rights at airports in the 
three shuttle cities plus 17 planes 
trump noted recent reports that he intends to sell the land 
earmarked for a huge new commercial development in manhattan to 
help finance the shuttle deal no interested party could afford to 
pay him what the 100acre site is worth trump joked to reporters 
the sale marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of 
eastern the miamibased carrier that has been scarred by 
managementlabor feuding and 1 billion in losses over the past 
decade 
the shuttle is considered easterns crown jewel eastern 
officials testified recently that the shuttle is the airlines only 
remaining profitable operation 
when word of the deal leaked earlier today easterns machinists 
vowed to seek a federal court order against it 
in washington attorney joseph guerrieri representing the 
machinists union said he was readying a request to us district 
court in washington to grant an injunction against the sale and 
would file it later this week 
the sale of the shuttle is the death knell of eastern airlines 
as we know it we just cant allow the employees to be walked over 
in this manner we intend to keep eastern airlines a viable entity 
by seeking to enjoin this sale guerrieri said by telephone 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak confirmed pilots and flight 
attendants unions were informed of the sale today but did not 
disclose details 
nancy currier vice president of the transport workers union 
local representing eastern flight attendants said eastern

airshuttle lp a new subsidiary of texas air

silicon valley guru steve jobs arranged a 
grand debut today for his latest attempt to put highpowered 
computers into the hands of the ordinary person the next computer 
workstation 
the 2hour product demonstration in san franciscos swank 
louise m davies symphony hall before 3000 guests comes a year 
after it had been promised prompting critics to dub the 
secrecyshrouded machine the eventually 
the computer wont immediately be available and next inc of 
palo alto calif so far has refused to say when the machine will 
be on the market 
besides its release date the big question is the machines 
price tag 
nexts machine is designed with the power of an engineering 
workstation the kind that normally sells for upwards of 30000 to 
50000 jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less but 
just how much less is unknown 
analysts early on speculated the machine would range from 3000 
to 5000 but estimates now range up to 7000 to 10000 
jobs who cofounded apple computer in 1976 in his parents 
garage has said the next computer was initially designed for 
college students and academic researchers although analysts 
believe he now envisions a wider market 
its been speculated his machine will be capable of competing 
with such hotselling technical workstations as those from sun 
microsytems inc apollo computer inc and hewlettpackard co some 
of those companies are working on similar products that eventually 
will be sold for about 15000 
jonathan seybold a leading los angelesbased trade publisher 
who has seen the next says industry critics all going to 
change their minds after the machines debut 
from a hardware and software standpoint this is a remarkable 
achievement and will have a significant impact that will spread 
well beyond the number of computers next will sell he said in a 
recent interview 
some details of the computer have leaked out the most reliable 
one being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and 
17inch monochrome monitor 
dazzling display postscript software by adobe systems and other 
software are widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics 
possibly offering photolike realism and numerous type fonts and 
sizes a laser printer also is expected to be offered which would 
vastly improve industry reproduction quality standards 
in hardware the next is expected to come with an erasable 
optical disk drive which could increase current computer storage 
as much as 50 times allow the storage of detailed images such as 
photographs and give stereosound capability 
jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32bit 
motorola 68030 chip the industrys fastest a connector to an 
industry standard network called ethernet that will allow next to 
share files with other types of computers and mathematica 
software of special use for sophisticated math equations 
this is going to be the biggest little computer in the 
world said greg stephens an independent santa clara software 
specialist 
a computer workstation is a machine about halfway between the 
computing capabilities of a personal computer and a mainframe

the baby of the honda family has grown not up 
but stronger and longer 
redesigned for the 1988 model year the civic hatchback dx 
showed just how far the honda civic has come since its us 
introduction in march 1973 
back then the car was 1469 inches long with 866inch 
wheelbase and curb weight of 1605 pounds it looked something akin 
to a beer can on wheels the 1988 civic hatchback dx test car was 
92 inches longer nearly 400 pounds heavier and had a wheelbase 
that had grown by nearly 12 inches 
add the new models 15liter 16valve fuelinjected 
fourcylinder engine the early civic had a puny 1200cc engine 
in 1973 and this is no beer can any longer 
the civic line hondas lowestpriced car line offers sedan 
hatchback and wagon models 
but it doesnt get just firsttime car owners honda said median 
age of buyers of the test car the hatchback dx is about 35 and 
median household income is 38300 spokesman bob butorac said 594 
percent are male and 763 percent have college education 
the civic line has done well over the years looking at the 
previous civic redesign beginning in the 1984 model year for 
example sales increased steadily from 136401 in calendar 1984 to 
173110 in 1987 thats a far cry from the 38957 civics sold in 
calendar 1973 
price has increased too base price for the hatchback dx is 
8310 compared with 2250 for a hatchback civic in 1973 
competition also has changed today the civic faces a number of 
subcompact rivals some with lower starting prices among them are 
the toyota corolla fx which starts around 8000 and mazda 323 
which starts at more than 6000 theres also the subcompact 
hyundai excel hatchback which starts at 5395 
but butorac said the civic has a substantially different class 
of standard features and a substantially different powertrain and 
honda doesnt consider the hyundai a direct competitor hyundai 
officials name the civic as one of their competitors however 
the test civic hatchback dx showed why even with all the 
competition some buyers still decide on the civic 
fit and finish was excellent inside and out the car with 
fivespeed manual transmission was peppy thanks to the the 90 
horsepower the engine can crank out the engine is standard in the 
hatchback dx but a 70horspower version is standard in regular 
civic hatchback model 
the car was fun to drive around town and fit in small parking 
spaces easily most of the time at times however such as when 
the car was at a standstill it took effort to move the steering 
wheel there was no power steering 
on the highway the car moved well but the ride could be 
punishing jostling there also was a fair amount of road noise 
but fuel economy was admirable with the car getting 30plus miles 
to the gallon in demanding driving in both the city and on the 
highway 
the interior was pleasant with easy to read gauges and 
moldedtype front bucket seats that looked modern rear legroom was 
nearly nonexistent if the front seats were pushed all the way back 
and reclined some there were three seat belts in the back but 
three adults would have a tough time sitting there for long 
the car had nice touches to the left of the driver was a small 
drawer for coins the hatchback area was covered by a ledge that 
hid items stored below the ledge doubled as a shelf for the rear 
seat if more cargo room was needed the split rear seat folded 
down 
while the 1988 redesigned civic is too new for reliability 
tests past consumer reports rankings based on owner reports of 
trouble showed 198286 civics had a much better than average rating

a day after the board of directors of 
holly farms corp approved a defense plan against hostile 
takeovers rival poultry processor tyson foods inc made a 1 
billion offer to buy the company 
springdalebased tyson the nations largest poultry processor 
on tuesday offered 45 cash and a quarter share of its class a 
common stock for each of holly farms 181 million outstanding 
shares 
the deal would be worth 1 billion based on tuesdays closing 
prices holly farms closed at 43 a share up 237 in new york 
stock exchange trading while tyson rose 625 cents a share to 
1762 in national overthecounter trading 
officials of holly farms based in memphis tenn said today 
its board of directors would consider the offer in due course 
but declined further comment 
robert justice tyson executive vice president for community 
relations said tyson general counsel jim blair would not be 
available to answer questions tuesday night 
several hours before tyson announced its offer holly farms had 
announced it had been approached by an unidentified company 
regarding a possible business combination holly farms said no 
specific proposal had been received and holly farms did not intend 
to seek one 
the board of directors of holly farms believes the best 
longterm interests of the company and its shareholders will be 
served by the company continuing to operate as an independent 
entity stated r lee taylor president and chief and executive 
officer 
the company also said it had activated a shareholder rights 
plan commonly known as a poison pill takeover defense aimed 
at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
in a letter to taylor tyson chairman and chief executive don 
tyson son of the companys founder referred to a meeting with 
holly farms officials four weeks ago in memphis and said he 
believed it was an ideal time for the companies to merge 
tyson said the offer would expire by close of business oct 19 
and asked for access to nonpublic corporate information from holly 
farms to help determine whether his company might increase its 
offer 
tyson is a whollyintegrated poultry company which produces 14 
million pounds of chicken meat a week according to justice 
justice said tyson has hatcheries grows its own chickens 
operates its own feed mills has its own processing plants and 
markets both whole chickens and value enhanced products to 
supermarkets fast food chains and institutional customers 
according to the companys 1987 annual report tyson had gross 
sales last year of about 18 billion with net income of 67 
million tyson has 25600 employees justice said 
holly farms is a diversified foods company with about 50 
percent of its sales concentrated in chicken the company also 
provides other meats for the food service industry and mills flour 
holly farms apparently made its announcement before receiving 
the tyson proposal stating that it had not received any written 
proposals 
holly farms spokesman ted bailey in memphis declined to comment 
at that time on how many businesses had expressed interest in a 
merger or which companies were involved 
we remain committed to our shareholders a leader in longterm 
investment performance for shareholders a leader in longterm 
dividend growth and a leader in financial strength and cash flow 
taylor said we believe we have established a superior record in 
all these respects even in poor years we have every reason to 
believe that our future record will be even better 
holly farms had sales of 16 billion last year and net income 
of 362 million or 206 a share in the first quarter of this 
year holly farms reported sales of 5042 million and net income 
of 298 million or 165 per share 
tyson 58 son of the companys founder is a bearded balding 
cannonball of a man wears a tan uniform on the job the same type 
of clothing worn by his workers the companys orange and yellow 
logo is on the uniform along with his name 
if we had suits on we might not go out in the chicken house 
or the feed mill or the processing plant tyson told the 
associated press in a 1985 interview 
forbes magazine this week listed tyson as the 245th wealthiest 
us resident with an estimated net worth of 330 million

sundstrand corp has agreed to plead guilty to 
fraud charges brought after a federal investigation revealed the 
company had been overbilling the defense department for airplane 
parts authorities said today 
sundstrand has agreed to pay a 115 million settlement the 
largest single fraud settlement in history us attorney anton 
valukas said at a news conference 
what you have in a sense is a tragedy valukas said you 
have a company that set out to defraud the government 
the only way that type of activity can be deterred is through 
swift legal action he said 
sundstrand spokesman claude vernam was not immediately available 
for comment said a secretary in his rockford office who would 
identify herself only as karen 
rockfordbased sundstrand makes flightdata equipment engine 
startup systems and other electronic equipment for military and 
commercial aircraft 
the pentagon accounts for 42 percent of the companys 14 
billion in annual sales 
valukas would not comment on a published report that the 
aerospace contractor could be suspended for a time from doing 
business with the defense department 
the company agreed to plead guilty to a fourcount criminal 
information that accused sundstrand of overcharging the department 
of defense from 1981 through 1985 and concealing millions of 
dollars in cost overruns on designanddevelopment contracts 
officials said 
the company also was accused of conspiring to undermine the 
contractbidding process by spending more than 100000 to provide 
department of defense personnel with liquor meals theater tickets 
and other amenities in a bid to gain greater access to them 
sundstrand has provided a goodquality product for a long 
period of time unfortunately weve been paying too much for it 
francis holland regional commander of defense contract 
administration services said at the news conference 
in its annual filing with the securities and exchange commission 
earlier this year sundstrand said the government has advised 
that it intends to charge the company with criminal violations in 
rockford and seattle sunstrand operates a subsidiary part of its 
advanced technology group in redmond wash near seattle 
sundstrands sec filing said the company was in the process of 
entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions 
it added that settlements could result in the imposition of

seeking federal permission to acquire at least 15 million of the 
drug retailers stock 
walgreen the nations largest drugstore chain also reported a 
22 percent increase in its fourthquarter net income and a 25 
percent profit gain for the 1988 fiscal year

withdrawn

the european economic community 
commission said wednesday it has resumed an inquiry into alleged 
anticompetitive practices in the spare parts market by ford motor 
cos british subsidiary and other car makers based on a court 
ruling last week 
the european court of justice said two car makers swedens ab 
volvo of sweden and renault of france could refuse licenses to 
spare parts makers if they did not abuse this power of refusal 
on wednesday the eec commission said its probe must show if 
ford and others which it did not name engaged in abusive 
practices violating eec antitrust rules 
the court said illegal practices included arbitrary refusal to 
supply spare parts charging unfair prices or not making parts for 
models that were still on the road in large numbers 
the eecs inquiry was begun several years ago following 
complaints by independent spare parts makers that car makers used 
their copyright and design rights to prevent them from making and 
selling components 
the commission threatened to sue ford uk ltd in 1985 after a 
complaint by british spare parts makers but suspended its action 
when ford agreed to change some of its practices 
investigation of the substance of the complaint against ford is 
continuing the commission said

a 17 million wrongful death suit filed by 
a cancer victims family against the maker of pall mall cigarettes 
probably wont be scheduled for retrial until next spring at the 
earliest the plaintiffs attorney predicts 
circuit judge gray evans of greenwood probably will st the 
second trial date soon now that the mississippi supreme court has 
refused to rule on issues in the case before it is heard by a 
second jury attorney don barrett said in a telephone interview 
wednesday from his lexington office 
barrett represents the family of nowdeceased nathan henry 
horton of durant in a case against american tobacco co the maker 
of pall malls and new deal tobacco and candy co of greenwood a 
local cigarette distributor the first circuit court trial in 
lexington which attracted dozens of wall street analysts and 
national news media ended jan 29 in a hung jury 
we hope its real soon barrett said of the second trial 
date weve had a problem of course with the death of one of our 
circuit judges arthur clarke so judge evans is really snowed 
under and the horton family understands that but we believe hell 
give us a setting as soon as his schedule will permit 
national antismoking advocates had hailed the first horton 
trial as a chance to ruin cigarette manufacturers long string of 
victories in cases seeking damages for cancer victims who smoke 
horton died of cancer on jan 26 1987 and his family contends the 
two packs of pall mall cigarettes he smoked each day for 35 years 
caused his death 
since the hung jury in lexington a federal court jury in new 
jersey held a cigarette company partially responsible for the 1984 
death of rose cipollone and awarded 400000 in damages to her 
widower antonio cipollone 
barrett said the new jersey case may be psychologically 
important in the horton retrial however he added were going 
to win our case on the evidence we present 
attorneys for the tobacco company have repeatedly said they 
wont comment on any aspect of the pending case 
the mississippi supreme court without a written opinion 
refused on sept 21 to hear an appeal filed by hortons family the 
plaintiffs had wanted the high court to rule on 15 legal issues in 
the case before it went to a second trial 
one of the main issues the high court was asked to determine is 
whether the horton family can introduce evidence of advertising 
they contend might have encouraged hortons smoking habit 
defense attorneys wanted the state supreme court to decide 
whether federal tobacco labeling laws warning of health risks would 
make the advertising arguments moot 
hortons family counters that he began smoking the cigarettes in 
1955 10 years before the us surgeon general required a warning 
label on cigarette packages however they say the cigarette maker 
knew then that its product was harmful and addictive

european economic community budget 
commissioner henning christophersen said wednesday the 1989 draft 
budget would be some 2 billion european currency units or 226 
billion less than initial projections 
he said the revised budget would be presented to the european 
parliament which must approve it and to the decisionmaking eec 
council in early november 
christophersen said about 1 billion ecus could be cut from the 
budget mainly due to higher world market prices for cereals and 
oilseeds 
he added that the 1988 budget is likely to produce a surplus 
of another one billion ecus due to a growthinduced increase in 
customs duties and the effect of applying the new budget discipline 
rules 
the new budget discipline rules are the guidelines on 
agricultural expenditure fixed by the 12 eec heads of state at the 
brussels summit in february 
next year farm expenditure is set at 277 billion ecus

earnings for the three months ended sept 30 totaled 114 
million vs 118 million a year earlier earnings per share

hilton hotels corp reported its 
profit rose 22 percent in the third quarter partly because of 
improved results in its casino operations 
hilton said wednesday it earned 272 million or 57 cents a 
share in the quarter ended sept 30 up from 223 million or 44 
cents a share a year ago sales totaled 2361 million up 19 
percent from 1982 million a year earlier 
gambling revenue nearly doubled jumping to 331 million from 
185 million in the 1987 third quarter the gain was partly due to 
better results at hiltons nevada casinos and to the companys 
interest in the conrad international hotelcasino in queensland 
australia 
operating revenue in the hotel sector declined 12 percent to 21 
million the drop was largely due to a onetime credit that boosted 
revenue in the 1987 quarter and a charge for taxes that depressed 
the figure for the latest quarter said roy judge a vice president 
and assistant to the chairman 
hilton said hotel occupancy increased to 71 percent from 70 
percent a year ago while nevada gaming occupancy reached 90 
percent against 83 percent in 1987 
for the year to date profit rose 17 percent to 957 million

appliance maker whirlpool corp 
reported a 294 percent drop in third quarter earnings wednesday 
primarily because of the higher costs of materials 
the company said it earned 315 million or 45 cents per share 
on sales of 12 billion in the julyseptember period this year 
compared with 446 million or 63 cents per share on 11 billion 
in sales during the same three months last year 
the thirdquarter sales up 54 percent from the third quarter 
of 1987 set a company record and were attributed to increases in 
shipments of whirlpools kitchenaid and kenmore products

increases and acquired emerson electric cos dishwasher and trash 
compactor manufacturing business 
for the first nine months of the year whirlpool earned 1061

julyseptember period last year the company earned 1515 million 
or 209 a share on sales of 32 billion 
whirlpool said the drop in third quarter earnings and the 30 
percent decline so far this year was due largely to higher material 
prices not covered by price increases 
a weak kitchencabinet business and a 108 million addition to 
the 1987 figures because of an accounting change also played roles 
in the earnings weakness this year the company said

the plunge in prices for oil mexicos 
leading export has prompted the government to announce painful 
budget cuts consider an international monetary fund contingency 
loan and renew calls for a better deal on the foreign debt 
it also highlights a stubborn battle against inflation and an 
ambitious trade liberalization program meant to diversify mexicos 
export earnings and wean the nation from dependence on 
oilgenerated revenues 
pemex the government oil monopoly said on oct 7 that average 
spot market prices for mexican crude had sunk to about 9 a barrel 
and that revenues for this year would fall below 1987s 86 
billion 
last year oil accounted for 41 percent of total mexican export 
revenues and helped the country post an overall 84 billion trade 
surplus 
reacting to the drop in oilbased earnings estimated by one 
energy department official at 2 billion below official projections 
so far this year president miguel de la madrids administration 
announced more than 200 million in budget cuts last friday 
the administration took pains to assure mexicans whose 
paychecks are worth half what they were in 1982 that the cuts 
would spare social programs 
we can manage the problems caused by falling oil prices with 
some sacrifices agustin f legorreta president of the private 
business coordinating council said tuesday 
the falling price of oil has spurred new calls for renegotiation 
of mexicos 104 billion foreign debt legorreta said interest 
payments on the debt are sucking funds away from economic 
development 
the government has been using its foreign reserves to support a 
7monthold peso currency exchange rate freeze as part of an 
antiinflation wage and price stabilization program if the price 
of oil keeps dropping however the government may actually be 
forced to add to the debt burden 
most analysts believe the government when it says inflation is 
its no 1 economic priority and say presidentelect carlos salinas 
de gortari will try to maintain the fight salinas takes office 
dec 1 
the danger of hyperinflation is so big that the effort should 
continue said jacobo zaidenweber president of the mexicounited 
states chamber of commerce in a recent interview it could take 
between one and three years in one form or another 
under terms of a 1987 foreign debt rescheduling agreement with 
the imf mexico has the option to draw up to 12 billion in 
contingency loans if the price of crude oil drops below the 9 
barrier 
hard currecny reserves which reached a high of 16 billion in 
april dropped to an estimated 12 billion in july as the 
government propped up the peso against the dollar 
the government has resisted fresh calls to devalue and give 
mexican entrepreneurs a new export advantage that could help offset 
the shrinking trade surplus a devaluation would generate new 
inflationary pressures the antiinflation plan has officially 
reduced annualized inflation from a record 1592 percent in 1987 to 
about 45 percent this year 
although resisting the calls to devalue the administration has 
stressed the importance of nonoil exports to make up for the 
shortfall in oil revenues 
through june mexicos firsthalf merchandise trade surplus 
totalled 24 billion well below 1987s firsthalf surplus of 
476 billion according to the center for private sector economic 
studies but nonpetroleum exports at 71 billion were up 20 
percent over the same period in 1987 
however the surplus was hurt when merchandise imports surged by 
53 percent between january and june to 83 billion that was

credit comes for the latin word for believe 
one year ago as the stock market went down in flames americas 
lenders almost stopped believing 
the credit crisis that nearly imposed gridlock on the financial 
system is one of the least understood yet most important aspects of 
last octobers historic plunge 
in human terms the crisis sprang from a loss of faith that 
participants in the market would honor their commitments markets 
are founded on that belief and cannot function without it 
the stock market depends on the banking system because every 
trade involves money passing from a sellers bank to a buyers 
banks also provide lines of credit for investors 
instead of making fresh loans during the crash some big new 
york banks actually demanded more collateral on existing loans from 
desperate customers that had to meet margin calls 
only decisive action by the federal reserve prevented the banks 
response from triggering a wave of defaults that could have ushered 
in a fullfledged panic 
a year later in spite of numerous studies little has been done 
to rebuild the financial system so the next stock market collapse 
does not bring the circulation of money to a deadly standstill 
all financial panics result from the withdrawal of credit by 
the banks its the grease in the engine and the engine seizes up 
without it said martin mayer a veteran banking writer 
the survival of the markets through black monday proved the 
financial system can withstand a major shock but a bit of luck was 
involved 
if the crash had occurred one week earlier banks and the money 
transfer wires would have been closed for columbus day traders 
would have piled up huge debts with no way to pay them 
it would have been horrendous the system would not have 
worked it would have stopped said paul allen a partner in the 
consulting firm of mckinsey amp co 
to a degree the banks caution on lending last year is 
understandable banks have a duty to both federal regulators and 
their own shareholders not to throw money away on loans that will 
not be repaid 
complicating credit decisions last year were deficiencies in the 
back offices the operations that work out who owes what to whom 
and then carry out deliveries of securities and payments for them 
these back offices known as clearing and settlement systems 
have grown haphazardly into a disjointed network that is unsuited 
for a world of global trading and tightly interconnected markets 
a clearing and settlement network consists of organizations that 
help stock exchanges sort out the terms of a trade and then make 
the swap by taking in the securities from the seller and the 
payment from the buyer if one side or the other defaults the 
system is supposed to make good on the deal 
in spite of safeguards some regulators feared last october that 
a single default in the back offices could have set off a chain 
reaction of defaults 
the worriers included new york fed president e gerald corrigan 
who many regard as a hero of the crash because he oversaw the feds 
emergency lending and armtwisted bankers into supplying credit to 
financial institutions 
the possibility of a major default in one of the clearing and 
settlement systems was the greatest threat to the stability of 
the financial system as a whole in that period corrigan said 
last may 
most proposed reforms have dealt with highly visible matters 
an express lane for individual investors coordinated circuit 
breakers for stocks and futures 
far less attention has been paid to clearing and settlement the 
invisible side of the financial system 
its not a subject that people have considered sexy it is 
sexy youre talking about well over a trillion dollars a day 
said mayer the banking writer and author of a new book 
markets 
each of the major exchanges has its own system for clearing and 
settling and each system has different rules the fragmentation 
was acceptable when chicago stuck to beans and bellies but it does 
not work in the era of index arbitrage when traders simultaneously 
do business in multiple markets 
delays in settlement keep traders guessing about whether their 
sales and purchases will actually go through it takes five days to 
be paid for stocks sold on the new york stock exchange some 
foreign exchanges take months 
changes are coming but slowly the nyse says it will not reduce 
the lag in payment and delivery from five days until sometime in 
the next decade 
the irony is that settlement problems could push a customer into 
default even if it had plenty of money coming to it a point made 
by the presidential task force in its post mortem on the crash 
the fragility of the settlement system is worsened by a practice 
known as daylight overdrafting in which banks cash checks for 
big customers or other banks before the money to cover the checks 
has arrived 
these overdrafts are huge a fact that becomes apparent only 
when something goes wrong in november 1986 the bank of new york 
had to take out an emergency overnight loan of 26 billion from the 
federal reserve because of a computer bug 
the real issue is what youve got is risk piled on top of 
risk said mckinseys allen 
global trading is exacerbating the problem big us banks 
routinely shut down for the night with giant holes in their books 
because they have not received money from abroad to cover 
overdrafts 
theoretically a major default overseas could knock out a us 
bank while all its officers were asleep 
although the 1987 stock market crash began in the united states 
the next one could well start in japan or europe or a big 
institution could fail for reasons unrelated to a stock crash as 
continental illinois bank nearly did in 1984 
americans say the european clearing and settlement systems are 
one place trouble could start the two biggest european systems 
handle a combined 90 billion a week but unlike their us 
counterparts dont guarantee that the parties to a trade will 
fulfill their obligations 
there are few institutions that seem to monitor and are fully 
aware of that type of risk said abraham gulkowitz senior vice 
president for credit policy at bankers trust co 
the federal reserve is cutting back on the size of overdrafts 
banks are allowed to make but since global markets are here to 
stay the longterm solution is for banks to stay open around the 
clock 
in the end there is a danger that the markets survival through 
black monday will create a false sense of security leading 
bankers brokers and traders to believe that reforms are not needed 
because the federal reserve will always be there to bail the system 
out

here are some changes in the clearing and 
settlement system that would reduce the likelihood that another 
stock market crash will send the financial system into gridlock 
speed up settlements delayed settlements tie up money and keep 
traders exposed to risks the new york stock exchange has said it 
recognizes the problem and will move by 1990 to twoday clearing 
that is straightening out who owes what to whom however 
settlement will continue to take places five days after trading 
until sometime later in the 1990s 
keep banks open banks need to move to aroundtheclock 
operations so they can meet the needs of financial institutions 
that do business at all hours this will reduce risks and keep 
banking business from moving to foreign banks 
reduce overdrafts customers should have to pay for the 
privilege of getting cash from a bank before the money to cover the 
withdrawal has been deposited this should discourage overdrafts 
and reduce the vulnerability of banks to defaults 
update laws revise the federal bankruptcy code and other laws 
so they treat stocks futures and options more consistently for 
example banks should have clear rights to obtain liens on put 
options that are pledged as collateral 
permit crossmargining with changes in laws exchanges would be 
freer to allow traders to pledge assets in one market as collateral 
against liabilities in another for example put options against 
stocks this would help traders with hedged positions and ease the 
selling pressure in a falling market the chicago mercantile 
exchange and options clearing corp plan to allow crossmargining 
next year 
improve equipment make sure computers and communication systems 
are secure and have backups many observers feel the sense of 
panic on oct 20 was heightened when the fedwire which handles 
money transfers between banks briefly failed 
look overseas us authorities should take the lead in 
improving the security and efficiency of foreign clearing and 
settlement systems in todays interlocked markets a major default 
in a system overseas would quickly affect the united states

stock prices showed a broad loss today as 
traders uneasily awaited thursdays monthly report on the nations 
international trade position 
the day began amid widespread talk that the nations trade 
deficit for august due to be reported thursday by the commerce 
department would be larger than previously expected 
that conjecture contributed to weakness in the dollar in foreign 
exchange and interest rates rose in the credit markets 
prices of longterm government bonds which move in the opposite 
direction from interest rates fell more than 5 for each 1000 in 
face value 
analysts also said there was some disappointment among traders 
over the markets inability to extend the rally that carried the 
dow jones industrial average to its highest closing level of the 
year on monday

clarence thomas chairman of the equal 
employment opportunity commission on wednesday criticized a 
general accounting office report that said the eeoc did not fully 
investigate as many as 80 percent of job discrimination claims over 
a threemonth period last year 
in a statement thomas said the report by gao an investigative 
arm of congress trivializes civil rights enforcement to a level 
commensurate with widget making its politically motivated highly 
misleading and deficient in several major regards 
thomas criticized the gao report for failing to note 
improvements in eeocs program and its successes in civil rights 
enforcement conducting a limited overly mechanical study that 
ignored the complexities of civil rights enforcement and 
recommending old ideas for improvement and disregarding initiatives 
implemented by eeoc 
eeocs recent unprecedented success in comparison to the 
agencys past record was virtually ignored by gao in this report 
said thomas we have investigated more charges filed more 
lawsuits and obtained more tangible benefits for victims of 
unlawful discrimination than any previous commission 
he said the reports inaccurate and misleading findings impugn 
the reputations of many career civil servants and undermine the 
progress we have made as a civil rights enforcement agency 
we have buttressed our strengths thomas said we have 
acknowledged our weaknesses and taken steps to correct them our 
program is working 
in its report released tuesday by rep augustus hawkins 
dcalif chairman of the house education and labor committee gao 
said the stated policy of eeoc since 1983 has been to fully 
investigate charges of violation of federal state and local 
antiemployment discrimination laws 
gao reviewed investigations of charges closed between january 
through march 1987 in which no evidence of discrimination was 
found the investigators said 41 percent to 82 percent of the 
charges closed by the six eeoc district offices and 40 percent to 
87 percent of charges closed by five state agencies were not fully 
investigated 
hawkins who asked for the study said i find it outrageous 
that there are people across the country who may have a legitimate 
job discrimination claim denied because the eeoc mishandled the 
case didnt enforce the law and was more concerned with reducing 
paperwork than with protecting claimants civil rights 
thomas said gao acknowledged it has a lack of expertise in 
evaluating evidence to determine whether discrimination had 
occurred 
gao has a fundamental lack of understanding of the 
investigatory and judicial principles of witness credibility 
evidence and burdens of proof inherent in civil rights 
enforcement he said gao refused to seek clarification of the 
evaluation standards used by eeoc and ignored our attempts to 
define those standards 
a full investigation is that amount of investigation required 
to make a sound determination on the merits of the charge said 
thomas it is nothing more and nothing less

tourists will find it easier to tuck british 
banknotes into their wallets in a few years as the present series 
of large unwieldy bills is replaced by smaller currency the bank 
of england announced wednesday 
united kingdom banknotes are quite quite large 
internationally said a spokesman for englands central bank 
requesting anonymity there seems some logic in reducing their 
size so people can fit them into their wallets 
the banks dseries notes introduced in 1970 will be phased 
out in gradual stages beginning with the introduction of a new 
eseries 5pound bill in 1990 which is the equivalent of 850 
and continuing with new 10pound 20pound and 50pound bills 
through 1994 the spokesman said they are the equivalent of 17 
34 and 85 respectively 
the dseries notes will remain legal tender 
unlike the united states where federal reserve notes are a 
uniform size and color british banknotes come in various 
dimensions and hues 
the blue 5pound note slightly larger than a us dollar bill 
is dwarfed by the greenish 50pound note nearly the size of a page 
from a paperback novel 
the average reduction will be about 05 inches or 127 
centimeters in length and width the bills will remain different 
sizes to help blind people distinguish between them the spokesman 
said 
britons carry more of the highdenomination notes than they used 
to the spokesman said the most popular is the pink 10pound note 
with 610 million in circulation 
the bank of england will save substantial paper costs by 
reducing the size of the notes and producing them with advanced 
printing technology the spokesman said 
though final designs remain to be worked out all the bills will 
continue to feature a portrait of queen elizabeth ii on the front 
and a historical figure on the reverse the spokesman said 
the reductions in size for each bill are 
fivepound note from 3 inches by 57 inches to 27 by 53 
inches 10pound note 334 inches by 594 inches to 295 inches by 
56 inches 20pound note 35 inches by 63 inches to 314 inches 
by 586 inches and 50pound note 37 inches by 665 inches to 
334 inches by 614 inches

kroger co employees are concerned that 
another takeover attempt might be looming even though a big 
investment firm has withdrawn its 503 billion buyout bid and the 
giant supermarket chain has undertaken a major defensive 
restructuring 
employees at kroger headquarters say they are relieved kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co which specializes in corporate takeovers 
withdrew its 64pershare buyout offer on tuesday but concern 
about kroger and their jobs remains 
i think we are going to make it but it will still be tough 
said george aulick of krogers management information systems 
department 
dart group inc of landover md began the bidding for kroger 
on sept 19 with a 432 billion 55pershare offer dart has not 
improved its offer but has not indicated whether it too was 
withdrawing from the scene 
to thwart both buyout offers kroger has undertaken a 46 
billion corporate restructuring that includes the sale of some of 
the companys stores and food processing businesses last week 
kroger dismissed 300 of its approximately 800 headquarters 
employees as part of the restructuring in order to save 13 
million annually 
aulick said he believes attempts to acquire the company will end 
because kohlberg was unsuccessful in its bid for kroger after a 
threeweek effort he noted that krogers stock price fell after 
kohlberg withdrew reflecting speculation that there would be no 
further buyout offers that might drive the price higher 
krogers stock fell 262 a share to 55 in heavy trading 
tuesday on the new york stock exchange but closed 1 higher at 56 
on wednesday 
but kroger headquarters employee bruce house said he thinks 
another buyout attempt probably is looming 
i think attempts to take over the company will continue the 
climate is ripe for them now and kroger is a solid company which 
makes it attractive house said 
kroger officials say the restructuring which will result in a 
smaller and more indebted company is a better deal for 
shareholders than the kohlberg offer kroger shareholders will get 
a 40 a share special cash dividend plus notes and stock in the 
restructured company 
a few kroger employees were surprised but not disappointed by 
kohlbergs decision to withdraw 
i was happy but caught off guard employee pam wurtzler 
said we thought it was good the companys kroger plan seems to 
have worked 
company employees said they have not heard whether more firings 
were planned the remaining employees are concerned about their 
futures 
i have mixed emotions about everything house said its 
been so rough the last two weeks 
after last weeks firings which many employees blamed on 
kohlbergs takeover attempt there were few kind words for the 
buyout specialists 
they made their money they stripped the company they did 
their damage and now theyre gone aulick said im glad 
theyre gone were going to make it 
the 105yearold kroger has about 170000 employees and 52000 
shareholders the companys main businesses are its supermarkets 
and convenience stores with operations in 29 states 
kroger said wednesday it has received federal trade commission 
approval to sell 24 florida choice supermarkets and 24 florida 
choice liquor stores all located in florida to the kash n karry 
firm for 55 million the transaction is to be completed by friday

the dollar fell to its lowest point since the 
early summer on wednesday continuing a swift descent that was 
blamed on nervousness about thursdays report on the us trade 
deficit 
meanwhile gold prices were mostly higher 
a big deficit would indicate that the dollar needs to fall 
further to erase the trade deficit by making us goods cheaper in 
world markets 
since its latest peak on sept 1 the dollar has fallen 6 
percent against the japanese yen 4 percent against the british 
pound and more than 3 percent against the west german mark the 
steepest slide has occurred this week 
this is the first time in a long time that ive sensed the 
currency markets to be as nervous as they have been in the last 48 
hours said marc cohen a vice president for republic national 
bank of new york 
some traders said the dollar might fall if the commerce 
department reported an august trade deficit greater than 11 
billion or so compared to 95 billion in july 
however the markets reaction to trade numbers is 
unpredictable if sentiment has shifted decisively against the 
dollar even a small deficit could fail to boost the currency 
it appears there had been a consensus in the market that the 
dollar fundamentally should drop cohen said 
theres a sense developing that were getting to the end of 
the line on monthly improvements in the trade deficit said craig 
sloane a currency analyst for smith barney harris upham amp co 
the dollar began to ease in tokyo where trading ends before 
europes business day begins following japanese central bank 
president satoshi sumitas indications that he isnt too concerned 
about the japanese yens recent strength 
sumitas statements some frankfurt dealers said triggered 
sales of billions of dollars by institutions in japan 
in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 12965 yen from 13115 
yen late tuesday it was the first time the dollar closed below the 
130yen level since june 24 later in london it was quoted at 
12920 yen in new york the dollar plunged to 12903 yen from 
13107 late tuesday reaching its lowest point since june 23 when 
it closed at 12855 
market participants said the bank of england repeating 
tuesdays move came into the market wednesday selling modest 
amounts of sterling when the currency traded at about 17270 but 
the intervention failed to stem the dollars fall and the pounds 
rise 
at the end of the day it cost 17305 to buy one pound more 
expensive than 17175 late tuesday in new york the pound rose to 
17364 from 17172

holly farms corp said wednesday it will 
consider the nearly 900 million takeover offer from rival poultry 
processor tyson foods inc 
tyson the nations largest poultry processor offered late 
tuesday to pay 45 in cash and a quarter share of its class a 
common stock for each of holly farms 181 million outstanding 
shares 
in a brief statement wednesday holly farms said its board of 
directors would study the offer the company declined to offer any 
other comment 
i think holly farms will sell to tyson only as a last 
resort said john m mcmillin an analyst with the investment 
firm prudentialbache securities in new york 
however john lawrence an associate analyst at the investment 
firm morgan keegan in memphis predicted a deal would be worked out 
between the two poultry rivals 
holly farms stock rose sharply in heavy trading jumping 662 
a share to 4962 in composite new york stock exchange trading 
tyson fell 62 cents a share to 17 in overthecounter trading 
mcmillin said he estimated holly farms was worth at least 55 a 
share or about 6 a share higher than tyson offered lawrence put 
holly farms value at between 50 and 55 a share 
mcmillin said holly farms managers could seek a higher bid from 
a third party but he speculated they might try to buy the company 
themselves in a leveraged buyout 
a leveraged buyout is financed with debt that is repaid with the 
target companys cash flow or sale of assets 
theres a couple of options mcmillin said one is to look 
for a white knight which could potentially be a phillip morris or 
a sara lee look for a company to basically choose who they want 
to get married to 
the other is to pursue a managementled leveraged buyout take 
the company private i think thats what theyre pursuing right 
now he said 
several hours before tyson disclosed its offer holly farms had 
announced it had been approached by an unidentified company 
regarding a possible business combination holly farms said no 
specific proposal had been received and the company did not intend 
to seek one 
the company also said it had activated its poison pill 
takeover defense which is designed to make a hostile takeover 
prohibitively expensive 
bob justice a spokesman at tysons headquarters in springdale 
ark said wednesday that tyson had not heard from holly farms 
about the offer 
we are just waiting on whatever decision they are making over 
there we are standing by he said we do have a timetable of 
oct 19 thats our deadline hopefully they can make a decision 
prior to that and we feel optimistic about a response before 
that 
mcmillin said a merger would increase tysons share of the 
national poultry market from 18 percent to 28 percent 
tyson produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat each week from 
an operation that includes hatcheries feed mills processing 
plants and a sophisticated marketing arm the company sells both 
whole chickens and processed products to supermarkets fast food 
chains and institutional customers 
tyson had revenues of about 18 billion in its most recent 
fiscal year with an aftertax profit of 67 million it has 25600 
employees 
holly farms is a diversified foods company with about 50 
percent of its sales concentrated in chicken the company also 
mills flour and provides other meats for the food service industry 
holly farms had sales of 16 billion last year and net income 
of 362 million

precious metals futures prices rebounded wednesday in response 
to weaker bond prices and a softer dollar but analysts continued to 
predict that gold would soon return to its recent lows below 400 a 
troy ounce 
on other markets energy futures rallied sharply livestock and 
meat gained grains and soybeans were mixed and stockindex 
futures retreated 
gold for october delivery traded as high as 409 a troy ounce on 
new yorks commodity exchange and december gold hit 416 as traders 
interpreted lower bond prices and the weaker dollar as bullish 
signals for the precious metals 
but to chartwatching technical traders those gold prices the 
highest in three weeks meant the market was overbought the 
technicians sold driving the december contract down to a close of 
41220 although the spot contract held up well settling at 
40840 
analyst peter cardillo of josephthal amp co in new york said the 
bond and dollar weakness that precipitated wednesdays gold rush 
was largely based on expectations that the government would report 
a widening of the us trade deficit in a report due out thursday 
morning 
meanwhile he said the low inflation rate ample gold supplies 
and other factors that led to the gold markets collapse last month 
remain in place 
i think the market is in an overbought condition and i think 
well test the recent lows of 390 to 395 in the december 
contract cardillo said 
gold settled 380 to 470 higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 41220 a troy ounce silver was 119 cents 
to 12 cents higher with december at 6395 a troy ounce 
energy futures prices galloped higher on the new york mercantile 
exchange paced by unleaded gasoline which surged the 
2centsagallon daily limit before late profittaking reduced the 
gains 
crude oil settled above 14 a barrel for the first time in two 
weeks 
the rally reflected a general mood of reassessment about the 
ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to 
curb their crude oil production and boost prices said peter 
beutel an analyst in new york with elders futures inc 
cardillo said the oil rally was linked to growing signs that the 
ceasefire between iran and iraq would develop into a lasting peace 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 56 cents 
higher with november at 1411 a barrel heating oil was 101 cents 
to 176 cents higher with november at 4084 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 140 cents to 195 cents higher with november 
at 4266 cents a gallon

personal computer industry pioneer steve 
jobs unveiled his next computer workstation calling it a 
university on a desktop during a glitzy product demonstration 
on wednesday that rivaled a hollywood premier 
this will serve not only as the latest stateoftheart 
technological tool but as a partner in thought jobs told 3000 
people gathered at san franciscos posh louise m davies symphony 
hall 
its performance is staggering the 33yearold cofounder of 
apple computer inc said as students industry executives and 
potential software contributors wildly cheered 
jobs founded next inc in 1985 after leaving apple in a power 
struggle with john sculley the chairman and chief executive 
officer 
jobs a college dropout said his longawaited computer would be 
available to universities by april of next year at a price around 
6500 about twice early estimates it eventually will sell for 
commercial use at about 10000 but jobs would not say when it 
would be made available to the general public 
a special laser printer featuring the highest resolution 
capabilities in the industry will be sold along with the next for 
2000 
this is going to be the biggest little computer in the 
world said greg stephens an independent santa clara calif 
software specialist 
stewart alsop the influential publisher of the pc newsletter 
called the machine a landmark computer 
over time it will change the way people look at computers 
thats the innovation here thats what all the hype is about 
alsop said after the presentation 
but microsoft corps chairman william h gates has derided 
the next saying it represents little in the way of innovation 
whats novel about it is it as much of an advance as the mac 
apple macintosh was with its graphics interface is it marketed 
to a broad enough part of the market he asked implying it was 
neither 
one thing it lacks is a color monitor although jobs said one 
would be available in about a year 
to those in attendance at the demonstration the software was 
the biggest innovation 
using its own distinctive set of symbols the next is easy to 
program allowing college professors for example to design 
illustrations of complex scientific principles according to their 
own needs 
the next uses a simplified version of unix the standard 
operating system for advanced workstations 
among other things it allowed jobs during wednesdays 
demonstration to recreate the sounds of a thunderstorm martin 
luther king jrs i had a dream speech and a speech from john 
f kennedy all computergenerated 
in an agreement also announced wednesday international business 
machines corp has licensed the right to use the symbols and 
commands developed by next and probably will use the technology on 
ibm computers that run unix the new york times said last month 
that ibm paid 10 million for the license 
the agreement with ibm will solve one of jobs biggest problems 
getting software writers to convert programs to a single system 
this way they will be able to make sales to users of both next and 
ibm computers 
although the next initially will be available only to 
universities analysts expect jobs to aggressively move into other 
markets within a few years 
hes seeding for the future said bruce lupatkin senior 
technology analyst at san franciscobased hambrecht amp quist inc 
there was a lot of hype and anticipation about this thing 
and jobs has lived up to all those expectations lupatkin added 
one of the biggest innovations in hardware was a robotbuilt 
streamlined printed circuit board only 1foot square that jobs said 
packs enough power and speed to approach mainframe computer 
capabilites he called it the worlds most compact circuit board a 
device which runs any computer 
each board is built in 20 minutes at a factory in fremont some 
by robots with vision and others that can place up to 150 parts per 
minutes jobs said 
the next comes in a black magnesium case with a tiltup 
17inch screen 
data is stored on a device that is similar to a compact disc 
player but uses a disc that can be erased and rewritten upon next 
said the device supplied by canon inc has about 50 times the 
storage capacity of competitive products 
once or twice in a decade something like this comes along and 
i believe its going to change the future of computing next is 
incredibly great said jobs 
the next will compete with such hotselling technical 
workstations as those from sun microsytems inc apollo computer 
inc and hewlettpackard co some of those companies are working on 
similar products that eventually will be sold for about 15000 
apollos manager of educational business pierre bouchard said 
in a prepared statement wednesday that jobs has a lot of catching 
up to do in the university market big software companies may 
not be willing to take the time and money to adapt to his system 
an untested concept bouchard said 
at a news conference after the demonstration jobs said software 
by adobe systems inc and other companies gives the next 
exceptionally vivid graphics offering photolike realism and 
numerous type fonts and sizes 
the next is built around three chips from motorola inc 
including the 68030 microprocessor a math chip and a signal 
processing chip it also has connections to industrystandard 
network called ethernet that will allow next to share files with 
other types of computers mathematica software of special use for 
sophisticated math equations and builtin reference sources 
including a dictionary and the complete works of shakespeare

real estate mogul donald trump ended a week of 
speculation wednesday by announcing he has agreed to buy eastern 
airlines profitable northeast air shuttle for 365 million in cash 
and will rename it after himself 
i want to run it as a diamond an absolute diamond trump 
proclaimed to reporters at a joint news conference with texas air 
corp chairman frank lorenzo at the plaza hotel in new york 
another recent trump acquisition 
he said the threecity service would be renamed the trump 
shuttle and its bluesilver boeing 727s would be redecorated and 
emblazoned with red black and gold stripes 
the deal is expected to be completed by middecember if it 
survives government scrutiny and a legal attack by easterns unions 
easterns militant union leaders said the sale would be the 
death of the airline and vowed a fight to overturn the deal 
the announcement of the sale followed a week of speculation 
about the billionaire developers interest in buying the shuttle 
from ailing eastern which is a major subsidiary of texas air 
the 365 million price tag was well above previous estimates of 
what trump would pay 
its top dollar said robert joedicke an airline analyst 
for the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
many analysts and other observers had estimated that the shuttle 
which serves new york boston and washington and is the most 
profitable of easterns operations could fetch from 200 million 
to 300 million texas air had tried earlier this year to transfer 
the shuttle operation from eastern to a new subsidiary for 225 
million but eastern unions blocked that attempt 
standard amp poors corp in announcing that it was keeping a 
close eye on eastern in the wake of the shuttle sale said the 365 
million was a generous price the interest on that sum could 
recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling 
the shuttle the creditrating agency said 
for the flamboyant and imageconscious trump the purchase of 
the shuttle could be viewed more as a way to enhance his prestige 
and influence than a straight business deal 
earlier this year trump bought the legendary plaza for 400 
million following a heated battle with other suitors trump has 
admitted that he was in love with the hotel for more than a 
decade and tore himself up to get it 
but there also could be compelling business logic behind trumps 
latest acquisition many analysts said trump might use the shuttle 
to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in atlantic 
city nj on the weekends 
its something that were looking at trump said at the news 
conference 
trump now operates a helicopter service from new york to 
atlantic city the resort citys bader field is too small to handle 
the boeing 727s operated by the shuttle but the atlantic city 
airport 10 miles from the city can accommodate them 
trump noted a report that he intended to sell the land earmarked 
for a huge commercial development in manhattan to help finance the 
shuttle deal but he did not directly address its accuracy no 
interested party could afford to pay him what the 100acre site is 
worth he joked to reporters 
trump and lorenzo said the shuttle would maintain fares 
competitive with the competing shuttle service of pan am corp and 
would not lay off any employees the 365 million price tag 
includes landing rights at airports in the three shuttle cities 
plus 17 planes 
pan am said it welcomed trump into the shuttle market pan am 
claims its share of that market has jumped from around 24 percent 
in october 1986 to roughly 45 percent 
eastern spokesman robin matell said late wednesday that the 
airlines shuttle service had net income of around 168 million in 
1987 on revenue of 403 million down from a 1985 profit of 282 
million on revenue of 492 million pan am has not disclosed 
earnings from its shuttle operations 
the shuttle deal marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of 
eastern the miamibased carrier that has been scarred by 
managementlabor feuding and 1 billion in losses over the past 
decade 
i think the sale was inevitable you could see it coming 
said frank borman the former astronaut and chairman of eastern 
the inevitable problem at eastern has been a very recalcitrant 
union leadership borman said in a telephone interview from las 
cruces nm where he works as an aviation consultant 
he said 365 million was a fair price for the shuttle

cbs inc said wednesday its thirdquarter profit 
climbed 16 percent reflecting improved broadcasting results and a 
hefty amount of interest earned on the money it has amassed from 
asset sales 
the company also said its board had boosted the quarterly 
dividend by 47 percent a move that some shareholders have been 
pressing for in the wake of the recent sales of major assets such 
as the magazine and records divisions 
cbs said the dividend boost to 110 a share reconfirms our 
confidence in cbss future prospects and represents a tangible 
sharing with our shareholders of our financial wellbeing 
but on the new york stock exchange cbs fell 75 cents a share 
wednesday to 17812 
for the three months ended sept 30 cbs said it earned 699 
million or 272 a share compared with 601 million or 231 a 
share a year earlier 
thirdquarter revenue rose 4 percent to 5688 million from 
5455 million a year earlier 
the cbs broadcasting group posted an operating profit of 49 
million up 7 percent from 456 million a year earlier 
laurence a tisch president and chief executive sales and 
profits were up at the cbs television network despite the 
presidential election coverage and disruptions to the fall season 
caused by the nowresolved writers strike 
results for the companys television stations were mixed with 
soft local advertising demand in some markets the company said 
while the radio division had higher sales and profits 
but a big contributor to the improved overall results was the 
445 million in net corporate interest income recorded for the 
quarter the company had a net interest expense of 23 million in 
the quarter last year 
for the first nine months of the year cbs had a profit of 111 
billion or 4316 a share up more than fivefold from earnings of 
2009 million or 784 a share a year earlier 
ninemonth revenue edged up 1 percent to 201 billion from 
199 billion a year earlier 
the ninemonth results include an 8666 million gain on the 
sale of the cbs records division to sony corp 
the new dividend up from 75 cents a share last quarter is 
payable dec 12 to shareholders of record nov 23

striking united auto workers at a chrysler 
corp assembly plant on wednesday narrowly rejected a new contract 
a week after walking off their jobs a union official said 
george burr president of uaw local 110 said the threeyear 
agreement was rejected by 41 votes with 1197 members voting 
against it and 1156 voting for it 
the suburban st louis plant is the only one producing the 
longwheelbase minivan said chrysler spokesman lloyd northard 
it was the second vote on the contract which was worked out 
last friday two days after some 3200 union members walked off 
their jobs when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline 
in a vote sunday the contract was rejected by 61 percent of the 
unions rankandfile amid reports of illegal balloting 
burr said he thought the contract was rejected wednesday because 
of union members concerns about outside contracting and 
outsourcing the practice of shipping out work from the plant 
to lowerpaid workers 
those issues were taken away from local 110 bargainers by the 
international uaw burr said 
the vote sends a message that the primary concern of the 
people on the line and in the plant lies in the outsourcing and 
outside contracting arena burr said we recognize that this is 
a problem 
burr said the local leadership would be meeting thursday and 
would be in contact with the unions national leadership 
anthony p st john vice president for human resources at 
chrysler motors said the company was deeply disappointed by 
the vote because the local union bargaining committee as well as 
uaw region 5 and the international union had approved the 
agreement last friday 
the result is that the st louis plant employees continue to 
lose wages several hundred employees elsewhere at chrysler will 
remain on layoff and the corporatewide profit sharing program for 
all employees is affected adversely as is chryslers loss of 
revenue resulting from the strike st john said 
we are considering the options available to us in this nowin 
situation he said

a battle for control of zenith electronics corp 
officially began wednesday when the companys largest shareholder 
began soliciting shareholder consents for its plan to sell the 
troubled company 
brookhurst partners a limited partnership formed by new york 
investors herbert b abelow and nicholas l ihasz mailed blank 
consent forms to all zenith shareholders along with a letter 
outlining its proposals and urging shareholders to sign and return 
the forms 
if a majority of shareholders return signed forms by dec 4 the 
brookhurst proposals will take effect just as if shareholders had 
voted by proxy brookhurst said in a statement 
brookhurst wants to shrink zeniths board of directors from 10 
to six members and replace three of the remaining six with its own 
nominees who would be committed to a sale of the entire company 
the dissident shareholders said shareholder value can be 
maximized only through the sale of zenith and the election of our 
nominees to the board of directors will best ensure that the sale 
of the company is both actively pursued and fairly considered 
brookhurst also is seeking a change in zeniths bylaws to permit 
shareholders owning at least 10 percent of the companys stock to 
call a special meeting of shareholders brookhurst partners owns 
61 percent of zenith which is based in glenview north of chicago 
officials of zenith the last us television manufacturer have 
contended in a lawsuit that brookhurst actually was seeking only to 
drive up the price of zeniths stock so it could sell its shares at 
a profit the company has asked the us district court in chicago 
to block the groups move
