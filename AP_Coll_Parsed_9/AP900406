democratic gubernatorial candidate ann 
richards on thursday denounced an unattributed allegation that she 
was in a restroom where several women appeared to be smoking 
marijuana almost 11 years ago 
do you think this country has reached the point now that 
unsubstantiated people can say what they want to and suddenly it 
takes on the vein of truth by appearing on television and in the 
newspapers ms richards said at a campaign stop in dallas 
the state treasurer blamed her runoff opponent in tuesdays 
primary election attorney general jim mattox for spreading rumors 
about drug use 
mattox has said he possesses sworn statements from people who 
say they know ms richards used illegal drugs in the past but 
mattox repeatedly has refused to reveal the names of those people 
or offer any other evidence to back up his accusations 
the houston post on thursday quoted a woman it didnt identify 
as saying she had seen ms richards with a group of women in the 
restroom of an austin hotel during the national association of 
women in construction convention in 1979 
the woman who refused to tell her story unless guaranteed her 
name not be used told the post when you walked in the door you 
could smell the definite aroma of marijuana 
when i walked in ms richards put her hand behind her and 
held it the girl on the end who i did not know had a roach or a 
joint that had been smoked down in her hand the woman told the 
newspaper 
the post report said the woman felt compelled to recount the 
incident after watching ms richards refuse during televised 
debates to answer yes or no to the question of whether she had ever 
used illegal drugs 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic has said she has not had 
an alcoholic drink nor a moodaltering chemical in 10 years 
asked about the alleged 1979 incident the state treasurer said 
i have no idea what theyre talking about 
ms richards said thursday she was shocked the allegations had 
been reported the surprising part is that now people are willing 
to put it in print with no substantiation at all thats not what 
this country is all about she said 
at a thursday campaign stop in lubbock mattox said he promised 
confidentiality to people who alleged ms richards has used drugs 
he also refused again to release his income tax records as ms 
richards has requested unless she releases her medical records 
when asked why he said because i intend to win this 
campaign and i choose the playing fields and i choose the methods 
by which we are going to play this game that just happens to be 
the way politics work 
mattox has repeatedly said he expects to win the runoff and face 
republican clayton williams in november releasing his income taxes 
when williams hasnt done so would give williams a signficant 
advantage mattox said

an unusual financial arrangement devised to 
promote conservation in the third world could help eastern europe 
begin to repair its badly damaged environment a us lawmaker says 
rep john lafalce dny has proposed in a letter to president 
bush that the united states initiate socalled debtfornature 
swaps with eastern europe to clean up what lafalce said could be 
the final and longest lasting legacy of the stalinist period 
under his proposal the eastern european countries debts to the 
united states would be forgiven in exchange for their commitment to 
redirect the savings to cleaning up their environment 
lafalce also proposed that a multinational environmental trust 
fund be set up for eastern europe 
the problems seem to be very severe said peter preuss a 
toxicologist at the environmental protection agency who recently 
visited poland and hungary 
preuss explained for example that the water in the vistula 
river at krakow poland is not only undrinkable its too dirty for 
industrial use 
it is so salty and acid that the industries along the river 
cant even use it for cooling water preuss said 
levels of air pollutants are many times higher tens of times 
higher than anything found in the united states he said 
in the small blackened town of copsa mica romania every 
building tree and patch of ground is covered with soot and dust 
from factories that dye rubber and produce nonferrous metals 
in january lafalce a senior member of the house banking 
committee and chairman of the house committee on small business 
led a congressional delegation to yugoslavia poland east germany 
hungary and czechoslovakia 
the plan was to discuss trade investment and business with 
eastern european officials but intruding into our discussions of 
all these issues was the problem of environmental degradation 
lafalce said 
on our trip to central europe we saw great hope and great 
expectations he said in his letter to the president but we 
also saw polluted rivers and the dull gray hazy hues of polluted 
skies 
indeed the problems are daunting and can barely be 
exaggerated he wrote 
in the upper silesia region of poland researchers have observed 
an increase in mental retardation because of metal particulates in 
the air 
life expectancy is decreasing in hungary and mothers are 
protesting about the respiratory problems that polluted air is 
causing their children lafalce said 
lafalces staff said legislation to provide for the debt swaps 
and the trust fund to be administered by the new central european 
bank for reconstruction and development will be introduced in 
april 
debt swaps for conservation have been used to encourage third 
world countries to establish nature preserves and to devote 
resources to conservation 
the first such swap was executed in july 1987 by a washington 
environmental organization called conservation international which 
purchased and forgave 650000 of bolivias foreign debt in 
exchange for the establishment of a wildlife preserve the 
arrangement has been widely imitated by other environmental groups 
polands foreign debt is about 40 billion of which 3 billion 
is owed to the united states poland has not made any payments on 
the debt in recent years lafalce said 
hungary on the other hand owes most of its outside debt to 
commercial banks not governments lafalce said if governments 
forgive debt to finance environmental cleanup projects banks 
might do the same he said 
he has proposed that up to 20 billion be put into an 
environmental trust fund under the auspices of the central european 
bank for reconstruction and development about 10 percent of that 
or 2 billion would come from the united states 
the encouragement of environmental cleanup projects in eastern 
europe could benefit american business lafalce said 
businesses in the united states have the experience and 
technology needed to deal with these problems he said 
therefore they could expect to play a leading role in 
establishing the necessary water and sewage treatment and other 
facilities required to solve the problems

a private school as negligent in the death 
of a teenage student during a schoolsponsored climb of mount hood 
in 1986 that claimed nine lives and should pay the boys father 
500000 a jury decided thursday 
but the multonomah county circuit court jury cleared mountain 
guide ralph summers of negligence for his part in helping lead the 
13member oregon episcopal school party up the mountain 
sixteenyearold richard haeder jr was one of the nine who died 
after the group became lost in a blizzard during the may 1986 
climb summers was among the four who survived 
the verdict on the lawsuit by haeders father richard came 
after about five hours of deliberations 
im happy to have justice done the elder haeder said after 
the verdict if nothing else comes out of this it is that my son 
did not die in vain 
haeder said much of the 500000 award would go toward creating 
scholarships or other funds to honor his son it isnt the 
money he said i wanted everyone to know those deaths were 
needless 
neither summers nor representatives of the school would comment 
the lawsuit accused the school and summers of negligence in 
planning and carrying out the trip 
the climbers tried to reach the top of the 11235foot mountain 
in deteriorating weather got lost in the blizzard as they 
retreated and had to build a snow cave for shelter as the sun set 
the next morning summers and a student hiked to safety and 
notified authorities the snow cave wasnt marked however and 
authorities searched for two days before they found it of the nine 
students and two faculty members inside only two teenagers 
survived 
the jury began deliberating about 2 pm after closing arguments 
in the case 
haeders attorney paul luvera told jurors they were leading 
a group of schoolchildren up a mountain for no good reason this 
wasnt a group of mountain climbers they were schoolchildren 
richie was crying he wanted to go back and they kept going 
luvera said and then he died a horrible painful death with 
people dying all around him in a tomb made of ice 
calling the lawsuit richard and judith haeders final eulogy 
to their son luvera asked that jurors award them 276 million 
luvera said evidence and testimony in the case showed summers 
didnt follow a correct compass bearing or use a map while 
descending the mountain through a snowstorm 
they were lost coming down lost when they dug the snow cave 
and lost the next day when they went for help he said 
he also said summers told inconsistent stories about who was 
leading the climb he or the rev thomas goman both men failed to 
adequately respect the weather and went too far up the mountain 
he said 
attorney mark wagner representing summers and the school told 
the jury to remember the storm that struck the mountain was three 
times stronger than had been predicted 
people died because a storm came in before our people got off 
the mountain he said in the real world accidents do happen 
and it doesnt mean people are negligent or at fault

the pennsylvania governors race is 
tipping conventional political wisdom on its ear when it comes to 
the issue of abortion 
democratic gov robert p casey is an unyielding foe of 
abortion contrary to his national party platform caseys chief 
republican challenger state auditor general barbara hafer is 
firmly prochoice a position that puts her at odds with the gop 
national platform 
while leaders of both parties say they can accommodate people on 
both sides of the issue a caseyhafer contest could test the 
loyalties of many rankandfile members in both parties 
its a difficult one for me said natalie schmoyer a 
marketing consultant and prochoice democrat from suburban 
philadelphia i feel very strongly about the choice issue but 
im also a democrat who votes for democrats its a hard 
choice 
caseys and hafers views on abortion have attracted two more 
candidates to the gubernatorial race an antiabortion republican 
and a prochoice democrat campaigning almost exclusively on the 
abortion issue 
the republican 34yearold marguerite luksik has done little 
campaigning but said she felt compelled to run because no one else 
came forward to challenge hafers prochoice stand 
sometimes i think that not defending your principles is the 
worst thing you can do said mrs luksik who runs a home day 
care program for single parents then it looks like you really 
dont believe in them 
prochoice democrat phil berg a 45yearold lawyer said 
caseys opposition to abortion is the only reason he decided to 
challenge the governor berg who calls himself the conscience of 
our party thinks hafer will have a good shot at becoming 
governor if she and casey face off in november 
were in uncharted territory said g terry madonna 
director of the center for politics and public affairs at 
millersville university of pennsylvania 
madonna expects casey 58 and hafer 46 to win their 
respective primaries on may 15 but he said the contests could 
become a barometer of public sentiment on abortion 
the test will be whether the prolife supporters can energize 
their forces for luksik madonna said theres no doubt that 
the prochoice people have galvanized and energized their forces 
while casey signed into law one of the nations most restrictive 
abortion laws last year and the state legislature is 
overwhelmingly antiabortion surveys show many voters lean the 
other way 
a recent poll commissioned by hafer found 50 percent of those 
surveyed felt a woman should have the right to have an abortion 
while 9 percent said abortion should be illegal in all cases 
about 14 percent of the respondents favored abortion only if the 
mothers life was in danger and another 26 percent said abortion 
should be allowed if the mother was in danger and in cases of rape 
or incest 
the telephone survey of 800 registered voters was done in 
midmarch by michiganbased market opinion research and had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 35 percentage points 
patrick killian hafers campaign manager said the results were 
encouraging because they indicate abortion will be the wild card 
in the race 
killians counterpart in the casey camp james carville said 
the results could not be interpreted as support for hafer because 
not all prochoice voters would support her carville said the same 
caveat applied to the prochoice candidacy of berg in the 
democratic primary 
i believe in pennsylvania the vast majority of democrats and 
the vast majority of republicans see abortion as only one issue 
carville said it isnt going to be just an election on 
abortion 
the abortion issue aside casey is a popular firstterm 
incumbent who is credited with keeping his states finances stable 
while many neighboring states run deficits 
hafers campaign has gone through a rough stretch in which she 
was criticized for calling casey a redneck irishman from 
scranton antagonizing blacks with her comments about a black 
state prisons chief and charging personal and political expenses to 
the state

labors traditional allies in congress are 
steering clear of the greyhound strike because bus passengers dont 
carry political clout and lawmakers are skittish about taking sides 
in the violent dispute legislators and others say 
members of congress fly in airplanes they dont ride buses 
these passengers tend to be poor folks who are not active 
politically said rep tom downey dny 
democrats who sometimes take the lead on labor issues also said 
president bushs handsoff approach to such disputes he vetoed a 
unionbacked plan to help settle the eastern airlines strike has 
inhibited lawmakers from jumping into the fray 
congress historically has sat on the sidelines for months before 
injecting itself in labormanagement disputes and neither 
greyhound nor striking drivers who walked out five weeks ago has 
asked congress to intervene 
still there has been no flurry of floor speeches on the strike 
which has been marked by shootings and bomb threats and has choked 
transportation in small communities around the country one house 
members call for hearings has gone unheeded 
several lawmakers have written to labor secretary elizabeth dole 
and transportation secretary samuel skinner asking for help last 
year mrs dole intervened in the pittston coal strike by 
appointing a supermediator who helped reach a settlement for 
appalachian miners 
mrs dole believes her involvement in the greyhound walkout 
would be premature because federal mediators are working on the 
matter said spokeswoman dale tate 
greyhounds 6300 drivers and about 3000 of its office and 
maintenance workers walked out march 2 over wages and job security 
the company which operates the only nationwide bus system has 
been running on a reduced schedule since then using replacements 
and union members who cross picket lines 
officials of both greyhound and the striking amalgamated transit 
union say congress might be paying closer attention if middle or 
highincome americans used buses 
if this were happening to airplanes it would be in every 
politicians speech in every headline said greyhound chairman 
fred g currey 
added union spokesman jeffrey nelson these people arent 
spending their spare time writing letters to the editor theyre 
not making long distance phone calls to congress demanding action 
nelson said that although the strike isnt on the top of 
congress agenda lawmakers helped persuade the director of the 
federal mediation and conciliation service bernard e delury to 
personally involve himself in negotiations 
this is the best we can expect from the government at this 
point nelson said adding that arm waving and standing on 
desktops wouldnt accomplish a resumption of talks the company 
has refused to return to the bargaining table until a week goes by 
without any acts of violence 
rep nick rahall dwva has called for the house public works 
and transportation committee to hold hearings on the strike but 
without success 
there should be a higher level of consciousness about it 
rahall complained hearings would put pressure on both sides to 
sit down and engage in collective bargaining and work toward an 
agreement i think we should discuss overall safety concerns and 
say hey we are in an emergency here 
downey said the violent nature of the strike also has kept 
lawmakers quiet along with sniper attacks bomb threats and 
brickthrowing incidents one striker was crushed to death by a bus 
driven by a replacement driver on wednesday night in boston a 
suspicious fire destroyed a bus and later its doors were found to 
have been welded shut 
theres a level of violence out there no one wants to be 
associated with downey said 
rep pat williams dmont blamed congress reluctance on the 
tone bush set with his eastern veto an override attempt in the 
house last month failed 
i would be willing to have congress enter tomorrow but our 
entry would only create thunder and accomplish nothing given the 
administrations stand williams said 
as with eastern the delay by the white house and the labor 
department benefits management and not the workers workers are 
going bankrupt daily unions are being broken and management 
seems to be surviving williams said

a horde of hubbles hubbells and 
possibly even a couple of hubbels will descend on kennedy space 
center next week drawn by the shuttle launch of a space telescope 
thats named for one of their own 
they are all relatives of the late astronomer edwin powell 
hubble whose discovery in the 1920s that the universe is expanding 
gave rise to the bigbang theory of creation 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope due to lift off tuesday 
aboard discovery is a tribute and memorial to hubble 
edwins being honored by nasa and it gives us an excuse to 
get together and learn a little more about things and to pass the 
heritage on to the next generations said harvey hubbell iv 60 
a distant relative and retired businessman from north palm beach 
who is organizing the affair 
nearly 200 descendants of richard hubball a 17thcentury 
immigrant from england are expected to begin to arrive this 
weekend the hubball name has changed over the generations 
it doesnt matter whether someone is a cousin once twice or 
even thrice removed from the astronomer everyone is welcome said 
robert l hubbell 71 president of the hubbell family historical 
society the retired foreign service officer from falls church 
va is bringing two grandchildren 
the family reunions held every two years this is an off year 
have tended to attract only the older generations hubbell said 
but this is catching the interest in the younger generation 
edwin hubble who died at age 63 in 1953 studied the stars and 
galaxies during the 1920s from mount wilson observatory in the san 
gabriel mountains above pasadena calif his survey revealed a much 
larger universe than anyone imagined 
he concluded galaxies were moving away from earth at velocities 
proportional to their distances supporting the concept that the 
universe originated 15 billion or so years ago in a cosmic 
explosion known as the big bang 
there were other noted family members 
harvey hubbells grandfather harvey hubbell invented the 
pullchain electric socket and the conventional duplex wall socket 
the factory he started in 1888 in connecticut has grown into 
hubbell inc a fortune 500 company 
there was carl owen hubbell the hall of fame pitcher who played 
for the new york giants from 1928 through 1943 john lorenzo 
hubbell established his first trading post on the navajo 
reservation in northeastern arizona in 1876 
the nearly 400 members of the hubbell family historical society 
arent the only ones with reason to be proud relatives from edwin 
hubbles mothers side also plan to attend the reunion and launch 
lena james jump 75 a third cousin on his mothers side will 
be there with her three sisters 
national aeronautics and space administration representatives 
will meet with the family monday the next morning chartered buses 
will take the group to a special viewing area at kennedy space 
center provided the launch is on time 
a pool party is planned for tuesday afternoon followed by a 
tour of the space center on wednesday and a luncheon at nearby 
patrick air force base on thursday 
the astronomers closest living relatives two sisters arent 
coming 
helen hubble lane 91 and betsy hubble 85 are in ill health 
and will be watching televised coverage from their homes in el 
paso texas 
the astronomers wife grace died in 1974 and the couple had 
no children three other sisters and two brothers are dead

seventeen soviet lawyers who have watched the 
upheaval in their country from afar for the past seven months are 
heading home today with plenty of ideas for more changes 
some want to help handicapped children and improve soviet 
justice another hopes his soviet rock star client will make 
american audiences forget madonna 
the 17 are the first to participate in an american bar 
association program that placed them as interns in us law firms 
law schools and government offices 
we believe these 17 each selected for having a spark of 
idealism will be among the leading players in the continuing 
debate on soviet reforms said steven raikin the programs 
director 
the soviet visitors in their early 30s said there is a lot to 
like here but found flaws in the american system they do not want 
to duplicate back in the soviet union 
after declaring that the adoption of children in the united 
states works 10 times better than in the soviet union olga 
djujeva frowned while assessing the american juvenile court system 
it works badly because it is structurally and financially 
weak she said this is not how we are going to do it in the 
ussr 
ms djujeva a moscow state university teacher who specializes 
in family law and childrens rights said her experiences at the 
law schools of cornell university in ithaca ny and valparaiso 
university in indiana have given her a renewed commitment to 
change things 
we have no foster parenting in the soviet union we someday 
will and handicapped children we do not see them because they 
are in special institutions in this country handicapped children 
are part of your open society 
the aba program funded by the new yorkbased soros foundation 
and other private donors was created in anticipation of the 
growing opportunities for joint sovietamerican business and to 
foster mutual understanding between lawyers in both countries 
we learned as much about the soviet system as these 17 kids 
learned about ours raikin said historically soviet lawyers 
have not occupied a major role in their society in the last couple 
of years however theres been an explosion of interest among 
soviet lawyers to play a larger role 
raikin added the next couple of years will be crucial 
everythings up for grabs right now the whole legal reform 
agenda 
up for grabs also are potentially lucrative business contacts 
between east and west a fact not lost on valentin blueger who has 
tried to steer his practice in latvia to entertainment and 
international law 
blueger spent his time with the nashville law firm that 
represents the grand ole opry an experience he says will help him 
better represent soviet rock star laima vaikule 
shes like your madonna blueger said of the singer who has 
sold 20 million records in the soviet union and is trying to make 
her mark in the us market 
the potential is great says blueger with a laugh at the 
mention of several soviet athletes now playing in the national 
basketball association 
raikin said the soviet economy is in desperate need of foreign 
investment but not many soviets know how to facilitate such deals 
valentin is a natural dealmaker 
irene mashlenko an employee of the soviet ministry of justice 
in moscow split her time in the united states between the staffs 
of a state attorney in montgomery county md and a defense lawyer 
after seeing both sides i now think that your system of 
punishment is very severe the terms of imprisonment for 
nonviolent crimes are too long 
but one of the most recent criminal trials mashlenko sat through 
ended in acquittal giving her the best evidence that the us 
system of justice is really a just system 
nearly 200 soviet lawyers applied for the program and more than 
100 us law firms and law schools applied to become hosts 
a new competition will begin in june ending with the selection 
next fall of 30 new interns

an amazonian nature reserve the size of 
connecticut could become an important tourist attraction helping 
to show third world countries they can make more money saving 
forests than logging them conservationists say 
the tambo patacandamo reserve in a remote nearly uninhabited 
amazon valley has among the highest numbers of rare and exotic 
birds and animals of any area in the world said charles munn an 
ornithologist with wildlife conservation international in new york 
set aside as a reserve the park could help promote 
ecotourism as a means for third world nations to profit from 
their wilderness areas without destroying them munn said 
before being declared a park feb 17 the area covered by the 
37millionacre reserve had been drawing about 9000 tourists a 
year generating 2 million annually for peru 
this area can be selfsustaining immediately if they enact a 
gate fee of even 5 a day per visitor munn said this is 
unusual it could simply live off of gate receipts 
about one out of every eight species of birds in the world is 
found in tambo pata munn said in an interview tuesday 
in three square miles of southeastern peru you can see 560 
species which is a world record he said you can see 330 in 
one day which is not bad 
all of canada and the united states have only about 830 species 
among the peruvian birds are eight species of brightly colored 
macaws the worlds largest and most endangered parrots they 
congregate in great wildlife spectacles around macaw licks 
where they eat clay to help digest their food 
the reserve is also home to the endangered 6footlong giant 
otter which travels in family packs and eats anacondas among 
other delicacies the park has whitewater rafting that will 
knock your socks off munn said 
peru announced last month the establishment of a 1millionacre 
reserve kugapakorinahua indian reserve to protect the kugapakori 
and nahua indians who remain out of contact with civilization 
munn said 
if you go in there they kill you said munn so you dont 
go in there 
the two new reserves are near the manu biosphere reserve an 
even larger park roughly the size of massachusetts 
this area of peru is not among those affected by guerrilla and 
cocaine trafficking violence munn said i take my family down 
with me including two young children he said 
peru has a fantastic system of parks and reserves on paper 
said adrian forsyth a tropical ecologist with conservation 
international in washington dc if they can just get the 
support needed to have them operate i think conservation in peru 
will be in pretty good shape 
the tambo patacandamo reserve located north of the city of 
puerto maldonado about 500 miles southeast of lima covers a 
varied landscape in the andes foothills ranging from lowland 
tropical rain forest to mistshrouded cloud forest at elevations up 
to 10000 feet 
besides its spectacular bird population it contains half again 
as many trees as any other region in the amazon munn said and it 
is virtually untouched 
the important thing here is there are basically no people 
living in this entire area said munn it is the last big 
valley in entire western amazon that has no people living in it 
peru is also considering setting aside several million 
additional acres of rubber and brazilnut forest in the area 
adjacent to the part of brazil where francisco chico mendes an 
environmental activist and rubber tapper was murdered in december 
1988 munn said

senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine and six democratic colleagues are off to the soviet union 
today for talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
lithuania is sure to be on the agenda when the senators see 
gorbachev and other soviet officials 
while the group intends to talk with leaders of the baltic 
republics in leningrad before they head to moscow mitchell said 
they wont try to cross into lithuania which is trying to secede 
from the soviet union 
mitchell said thursday that he and senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan had been assured by visiting foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze that the soviets want to solve the lithuanian 
situation by negotiation and dialogue 
they have concluded as a matter of policy that a process that 
does not involve the use of force is in their best interest

taxpayers could elect to check off 3 instead 
of the current 1 on their income tax returns to finance federal 
election campaigns under a new public funding proposal by three 
democratic senators 
sens john kerry of massachusetts joseph biden of delaware and 
bill bradley of new jersey all seeking reelection this year 
introduced a bill thursday to expand public financing of 
presidential campaigns to congressional races as well 
kerry acknowledged that the proposal to be offered as an 
amendment to a campaign reform bill already approved by the senate 
rules committee faces an uphill fight when the legislation is 
considered by the full senate most likely next month 
democratic leaders in both the house and senate and public 
interest groups such as common cause have all but abandoned hopes 
of winning passage of public campaign financing in the face of 
intense opposition from president bush and other republicans 
but kerry bradley and biden said taxpayer financing is the only 
way to fully reform a system discredited by politicians raising 
campaign dollars from individuals and groups who then expect 
special treatment from the government 
we are engaged in what i fear is moderate reform said 
biden i fear that moderate reform is somewhat like moderate 
chastity the mere existence of money means to some that the entire 
process is tainted 
if advertised and promoted by the internal revenue service and 
the federal election commission kerry said the checkoff could 
raise an estimated 60 million for every twoyear election cycle 
despite a recent decline in its use by taxpayers for presidential 
campaigns 
the tailoff has been a reflection of the fact there has been 
no push to get people to do it and the increased cynicism of 
the public they dont want to contribute their dollars to a 
system they dont think is sensitive to them he said 
when senate democrats last tried to pass a public campaign 
financing law two years ago they were unable in eight attempts to 
break a republican filibuster 
since then many democrats after reaping large contributions 
from labor and corporate political action committees in recent 
years also have become wary of public financing 
if we need to have another filibuster then lets have another 
filibuster kerry said just because you fail once doesnt mean 
you shouldnt come back and test whether theres a change in 
consciousness 
on a strict partyline vote the senate rules committee last 
month approved a bill by majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and sen david boren dokla that would impose voluntary spending 
caps ranging from 16 million to 92 million on individual senate 
candidates 
but democrats acknowledged that was just a starting shot to 
force the start of serious negotiations 
both mitchell and senate gop leader bob dole of kansas have 
somewhat embraced the recommendations of a bipartisan task force 
they appointed calling for flexible spending ceilings no 
public financing and a diminished role for pacs and outofstate 
contributors 
in the house there has been little progress in narrowing 
disagreements between the two parties and within each party 
speaker thomas s foley dwash and republican leader robert h 
michel of illinois met for 40 minutes on the issue wednesday but 
agreed only to meet again when congress returns april 18 from a 
spring recess

justice department official michael boudin 
the son of noted civil liberties lawyer leonard b boudin is under 
consideration for a federal judgeship by the bush administration 
according to sources familiar with the selection procedure 
boudin 50 a deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust 
is being considered for a vacancy on the us district court here 
said the sources who spoke thursday on condition of anonymity 
the fbi is conducting a background check and the american bar 
associations judicial screening committee is interviewing lawyers 
to assess boudins qualifications 
the possible nomination by a republican president is interesting 
because boudins father was long associated with leftwing causes 
and his sister kathy boudin is an imprisoned radical 
but michael boudin is a quintessential member of the legal 
establishment who has a reputation as an outstanding appellate 
lawyer 
he was graduated first in his class from harvard law school in 
1964 clerked for supreme court justice john marshall harlan ii and 
became a partner at the prestigious washington law firm of 
covington amp burling 
an administration official said boudins name has been cleared 
with conservatives who might be expected to raise opposition 
because of the notoriety of his family boudin is highly regarded 
by conservatives the official said 
the nomination if made by bush would be subject to senate 
confirmation 
leonard boudin who died last fall was a respected civil 
liberties attorney who represented actorsinger paul robeson as 
well as antiwar activists daniel ellsberg and benjamin spock he 
also represented cuban government interests in this country 
the elder boudins most famous legal victory was a 1958 supreme 
court decision that held the state department could not revoke 
passports for political reasons 
michael boudins sister kathy is serving a 20year prison term 
for murder arising from her involvement in a 1981 armored truck 
robbery in rockland county ny in which a guard and two police 
officers were killed 
previously ms boudin 46 had been a fugitive wanted for 
questioning about a 1970 explosion in a greenwich village townhouse 
in new york city that killed three members of the weather 
underground

parent groups leery of rock song lyrics about 
sex and violence are pinning their hopes on a new music industry 
labeling plan and are asking state lawmakers to end their drives to 
require warning stickers 
we are asking state lawmakers to give the voluntary system a 
chance to work tipper gore president of the parents music 
resource center said thursday at a news conference 
she and ann lynch president of the national pta said an 
industrywide voluntary system is a better answer to parents needs 
than mandatory labeling 
we can accommodate the rights of artists to express themselves 
freely with the rights of parents of consumers to know for 
example if the music their kids want to buy says suicide is a good 
idea gore said 
she said legislators in 13 states have agreed to abandon 
attempts to pass or revive bills to require warning labels on 
recordings she urged a similar course in the six states where such 
measures are still pending 
six major record companies warner brothers mca cbs 
capitolemi rca and polygram said last week that they plan to 
create an industrywide standard for warning labels 
gores group and the pta among others have expressed concern 
about music they believe encourages violence suicide drug use 
sexual promiscuity bigotry and satan worship 
gore and lynch said they were confident the uniform standard 
would result in better compliance than a 1985 agreement that called 
for voluntary warnings or printed lyrics on albums the companies 
determined to be violent or explicit 
we take the industry on good faith that they really do mean to 
seriously address the problem we take them at their word and we 
believe they will do the job correctly this time gore said 
it still will be up to recording companies to decide which music 
merits a warning label she said but she said the commitment to 
create a standardized label shows the industry is willing to 
provide the tools to make a voluntary system work now it is up to 
parents to use that tool wisely 
tom susman a member of the west virginia house of delegates 
said he had withdrawn a mandatory labeling bill inspired by a local 
disk jockeys concern 
we hope for a positive outcome susman said of the latest 
music industry scheme if not then it will be up to the 
legislators to look at this issue again 
record merchandising industry executives indicated last week 
that pressure from state legislatures was at least partly 
responsible for their decision to standardize and try to broaden 
the labeling system the music industry has been lobbying hard in 
state capitols to kill legislation to require warning labels 
states where lawmakers have promised not to pursue or revive 
mandatory labeling bills include arizona iowa maryland oklahoma 
west virginia alaska illinois kansas minnesota new mexico new 
york tennessee and rhode island gores group said 
measures sponsored by others are still alive in new york and 
rhode island according to the national association of recording 
merchandisers bills also are pending in missouri florida 
delaware and pennsylvania

the united states lands in the middle of the pack 
in rankings of life expectancy and death rates in 33 developed 
nations according to new figures from us health officials 
atop the list japan 
in the united states the average life expectancy is 75 years 
trailing japan by 41 years but beating the lowest of the 33 
hungary by more than five years the national centers for disease 
control reported thursday 
the average hungarian lives 697 years the cdc said 
the united states also ranked near the middle of the 33 nations 
in death rates from all causes 8284 deaths are reported for each 
100000 people each year japan was best at 6288 romania worst at 
1242 
the leading cause of death in the united states heart disease 
hits harder here than in other countries the us mortality rate 
from heart disease was 382 per 100000 per year for men and 214 for 
women compared with 339 and 206 in the other 32 developed 
countries 
throughout the 33 countries heart disease accounted for 30 
percent of deaths with cancer causing 21 percent and stroke 
causing 14 percent 
fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries about 15 
million a year are attributed to smoking the cdc said 
fewer americans smoke compared with the other countries 31 
percent of us males and 26 percent of american females smoke 
compared with 41 percent of men and 29 percent of women in the 
other countries 
the large number of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking 
indicates that reduction of this risk factor would substantially 
increase life expectancy in the developed world the 
atlantabased cdc said 
the cdc study included countries defined as developed according 
to a 1963 un standard pegged to reproductive rates countries 
where the average woman has fewer than two daughters who 
themselves survive their childbearing years 
such areas include the united states and canada the soviet 
union most of europe some latin american nations japan and 
australia 
the cdc study cited life expectancies and death rates in the

just as smallpox was wiped out in the 1970s two 
other debilitating diseases polio and guinea worm could be wiped 
out in the near future global health advocates say 
the international task force for disease eradication said 
thursday in a report published by the us centers for disease 
control that eradication of guinea worm disease which strikes 10 
million people a year largely in the third world is feasible 
if the necessary commitment and resources can be mobilized 
and worldwide polio eradication is technically possible by 
2000 the task force said 
but three other global maladies measles tuberculosis and 
leprosy are not now eradicable the task force said citing 
the need for better measles vaccine improved tests for tb and 
leprosy and the social stigma surrounding the latter 
the benchmark in disease eradication came in 1977 when smallpox 
was eliminated from the planet with efforts spurred largely by the 
united states 
people around the world continue to be plagued by guinea worm 
and polio and public and political awareness along with 
increased national and international commitment will be needed 
to eradicate them the task force reported 
whatever priority countries might give to these diseases the 
matter of resources to the countries concerned is often very 
great said dr donald hopkins project director for the task 
force 
the ideal situation he said is one in which the more 
affluent countries have a direct national stake in seeing that a 
disease is eradicated and are helping less affluent countries to 
get rid of it 
the task force launched at the carter center of emory 
university in atlanta includes representatives from the world 
health organization the united nations childrens fund or unicef 
the us centers for disease control and other agencies 
the task forces assessment on eight worldwide diseases 
guinea worm disease infects 10 million a year eradication is 
feasible with commitment and resources the carter center last week 
announced that american cyanimid co donated enough of a 
guineaworm fighting chemical to make eradication possible within 
five years 
polio kills 25000 a year eradication is technically 
possible improved vaccine would help goal to eliminate in 
western hemisphere by years end 
onchocerciasis blinds 340000 a year eradication of disease 
not now feasible but associated blindness could be eliminated 
through control of carrier worms 
yawsendemic syphilis strikes 25 million a year with 
political and financial inertia eradication not feasible now 
rabies kills 52000 a year albeit virtually none in the 
united states eradication not feasible no vaccine for wildanimal 
populations 
measles kills 2 million a year not now eradicable virus very 
infectious and vaccine not effective in youngest infants hopkins 
said he remains somewhat optimistic for the eradication of measles 
which was believed almost wiped out in this country before a 
comeback in the last few years sooner or later an improved 
vaccine is going to be developed he said 
tuberculosis kills 2 million to 3 million a year eradication 
not feasible need improved tests chemotherapy and vaccine 
leprosy strikes more than 11 million a year eradication not 
now feasible need for improved tests and chemotherapy and 
overcoming of social stigma surrounding the disfiguring disease

there is a ticking time bomb in the upcoming 
superpower summit between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the status of lithuania 
while us officials say they hope the may 30june 3 summit will 
produce major arms agreements a deterioration of the situation in 
the secessionist baltic republic could have explosive impact on the 
summit and on future ussoviet relations 
secretary of state james a baker iii spelled this out clearly 
in a threehour private session with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze on wednesday night according to both us and soviet 
officials 
gennadi gerasimov the glib soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
had no trouble slipping into american slang when characterizing the 
tone of bakers message 
there was a serious hardball exchange of opinions on this 
subject yes sir gerasimov told a reporter 
bush has come under considerable pressure from congress for not 
speaking out more assertively in behalf of lithuanian independence 
some lawmakers have threatened the soviet union with sanctions if 
force is used to thwart lithuanian freedom 
we are obligated to do whatever we can to encourage the 
soviets to grant the baltic nations their freedom what does 
america stand for if we dont stand for freedom asked sen 
robert c byrd dwva 
proindependence lithuanian activists have been demonstrating in 
front of the white house daily if the summit is held in 
washington these demonstrators are likely to provide a noisy and 
constant backdrop to any bushgorbachev talks 
just hours after the superpower summit was announced on 
thursday senate minority leader bob dole rkan suggested that 
the current level of tension in lithuania makes holding the summit 
a little more difficult 
if moscow escalates its crackdown in lithuania or moves with 
force in the other baltic republics of estonia or latvia congress 
could react angrily about trade or anything else dealing with the 
soviet union dole said 
he said he was less certain whether it would spill over into 
arms control agreements 
to date bushs approach has been cautious and nonjudgmental 
voicing general support for the selfdetermination rights of 
lithuanian citizens but declining to criticize gorbachev for the 
steps he has taken so far 
bush has urged restraint on both sides and a peaceful resolution 
of the crisis that began march 11 when the lithuanian parliament 
declared independence from moscow 
lithuania makes the summit all the more important said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater he suggested tough love 
tactics would be in order for dealing with the soviet leadership 
bush no doubt had lithuania on his mind when he commented on the 
first superpower summit of his presidency on us soil this is 
time for a lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion 
at this point no one knows just how the lithuania wild card 
will be played 
us officials say the existing situation in lithuania is not 
such that it would interfere with summit planning 
senate majority leader george mitchell who begins a fiveday 
visit of the soviet union today as part of a sixmember democratic 
senate delegation applauded bush for deciding to go ahead with the 
superpower meeting 
after he met with bush on thursday mitchell was asked if 
lithuania was casting a cloud of uncertainty over the summit 
the answer to that requires the development of further 
events mitchell said 
we dont know what events may occur in lithuania mitchell 
added it is my hope that there will be a peaceful resolution of 
the situation in lithuania and that the united states and the 
soviet union will reach meaningful fair balanced and verifiable 
agreement on arms 
the united states has never recognized the 1940 forced 
incorporation of the three baltic republics into the soviet union 
but neither has it extended diplomatic recognition to the new 
government of lithuania formed march 11 
moscow has repeatedly said force wont be used against lithuania 
and shevardnadze reiterated that view in his meetings with baker 
this week 
furthermore in recent days both sides have shown they may be 
willing to negotiate a compromise 
even so any change for the worse could threaten to make the 
upcoming summit even more turbulent than the stormtossed session 
bush and gorbachev experienced at their shipboard mediterranean 
summit in december at malta

the government said it will seek a 
change in the constitution after king baudouin was restored to 
power following a twoday suspension that allowed him to avoid 
signing an abortion bill into law 
at the request of baudouin a devout catholic long opposed to 
abortion the government suspended him wednesday then passed the 
abortion bill itself and asked the legislature to restore the king 
parliament by a 245to0 vote restored the king as head of 
state thursday however 93 lawmakers abstained and 58 were absent 
prime minister wilfried martens told lawmakers that to prevent 
a recurrence of similar problems in the future the government 
intends to propose a structural change in the constitution 
he did not elaborate but his centerleft government will likely 
seek to curtail the kings already largley ceremonial powers even 
further possibly by removing the need for the kings signature 
before a bill can become law 
the suspension set off a debate about the role of the king and 
his already largely ceremonial powers 
legal experts say the king cannot cast aside his constitutional 
role on moral grounds only if he is physically or mentally unable 
to rule 
vatican radio in rome praised the king calling his stand a 
noble and courageous choice that was dictated by his very 
strong moral conscience and his undisputible sense of statehood 
parliament adopted the abortion bill march 29 it allows 
abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if a doctor deems his 
patient to be in a state of distress until now abortion was a 
criminal offense

some women may feel regret sadness or guilt 
but most do not develop mental health problems from legal 
voluntary abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy according 
to a study published today 
the study in science magazine said some women may experience 
emotional distress but for the vast majority legal abortion of 
an unwanted pregnancy in the first trimester does not pose a 
psychological hazard 
olivia gans director of american victims of abortion called 
the study a manipulation and a rehash of data from earlier 
studies 
when you look at these studies you can twist them any way you 
need to to get whatever conclusion you want she said 
the new study was commissioned by the american psychological 
association which asked six experts to examine all current 
research and determine if a valid conclusion could be drawn about 
postabortion psychological effects 
nancy e adler a university of californiasan francisco 
professor of psychiatry and lead author of the report said the 
panel surveyed more than 200 studies and found only about 19 or 
20 that met solid scientific standards 
once those studies were examined she said the conclusion was 
really quite clear 
the apa convened the panel in 1988 after thensurgeon general c 
everett koop said studies were inadequate to draw final conclusions 
about the effects of abortion on womens mental health 
in the science report the authors said case studies have shown 
that some women do experience severe distress after abortion 
and require sympathetic care 
but for most women who have voluntary abortions severe 
negative reactions are infrequent in the immediate and shortterm 
aftermath the study said while the greatest distress is 
likely to be before the abortion 
severe negative reactions after abortions are rare and can 
best be understood in the framework of coping with a normal life 
stress the study said 
i feel comfortable about the conclusion that there is little 
psychological hazard for women adler said in a telephone 
interview but she noted that there is a need for scientific 
studies that would compare the effects of abortion with that of 
other stressful events in life such as divorce or death of a 
family member 
adler said studies of the psychological effects of a death have 
shown that if there is no negative mental health response within a 
few months there is little likelihood that one will develop later 
as a result she said there is reason to believe that there 
will be very little longterm effect from abortion but she 
added as a scientist i really cant say anything beyond two 
years 
two years is not enough said gans who said she had an 
abortion in 1981 i know many years later you still have to deal 
with emotional debris of that experience 
she said the effects can show up five to 10 years later and she 
described them as similar to the posttraumatic stress disorder 
experienced by combat veterans 
gans organization american victims of abortion is associated 
with the national right to life committee 
other findings of the science report include 
most women report feelings of relief and happiness after a 
first trimester abortion one study showed that 76 percent of women 
reported feeling relief two weeks after an abortion and only 17 
percent reported guilt 
a study of 360 adolescents seeking pregnancy tests compared 
those who were not pregnant those who were pregnant and sought 
abortion and those who carried their babies to term after two 
years the study said the abortion group showed if anything a 
more positive psychological profile than either of the other two 
groups 
women obtaining second trimester abortions according to one 
study experienced more distress than those getting abortions in 
the first three months of the pregnancy those having difficulty 
deciding on abortion are also more apt to experience negative 
effects afterward the study said 
in addition to adler the coauthors of the science study were 
henry p david of the transitional family research institute in 
bethesda md brenda n major of the state university of new york 
buffalo susan h roth of duke university durham nc nancy f 
russo of arizona state university tempe and gail e wyatt

a deadly ebola virus outbreak among imported 
laboratory monkeys apparently isnt harming people as evidenced by 
four animal handlers who have become infected but not sick 
the virus related to the deadly ebola virus of africa has 
turned up in monkeys from three philippine importers since fall 
the licenses of three of the nations largest monkey importers have 
been revoked amid concerns about the viruss spread 
researchers with the national centers for disease control said 
thursday that four workers at hazleton research products of reston 
va the first laboratory where the virus appeared have now been 
infected but unlike african ebola virus which attacks suddenly 
and produces serious and often fatal illness the virus from the 
philippines isnt making humans sick 
in nobodys book can this virus be considered the same said 
dr susan fisherhoch a cdc specialist in ebola virus its not 
as pathogenic thats for sure 
you would expect them to be ill within a few days of 
exposure 
she said researchers have no idea why this latest virus which 
has killed numbers of monkeys is not affecting the humans it 
infects 
we dont know ms fisherhoch said adding that the virus 
does have a high rate of transmission 
the four infected workers were among five animal handlers at 
hazleton who had what the cdc termed a high level of daily 
exposure to the infected animals 
in a 1976 epidemic of ebola virus in zaire it is believed that 
98 percent of the people infected became ill and the fatality rate 
among patients was 88 percent 
inspectors from the cdc are continuing to check the three large 
primate importers who were shut down last month as well as other 
importers no decision has yet been made regarding when the three 
might resume business ms fisherhoch said 
cdc researchers suspect that the philippine virus which is 
closely related to african ebola but not identical does not 
reproduce itself well once it infects a person 
one of the animal handlers who became infected showed high 
levels of antibodies to the virus but tests to detect the actual 
virus in his blood were unsuccessful ms fisherhoch said 
he had cut himself so we knew he was most definitely 
inoculated with the virus she said but he never developed a 
high load of virus in the blood 
thats an indication in one case that the virus does not 
replicate very well

a farreaching clean air bill goes to the 
house floor after clearing a committee by a lopsided 421 vote 
moving congress a step closer to enacting tougher air pollution 
controls 
the energy and commerce committee approved the complex and 
costly clean air package late thursday after resolving the thorny 
issue of helping midwest utilities cope with tougher acid rain 
controls 
the acid rain compromise approved 394 aims to help midwest 
states pay for cleaning up pollution caused by utility plants by 
providing a pollution allowance system and a oneyear extension 
for initial compliance in some cases 
critics of the measure have said it would cause electric rates 
to jump legislation passed by the senate earlier this week 
includes a similar provision 
pleas from some midwest congressmen for a nationwide energy fee 
or tax were rejected 
the compromise allows us to recoup some costs said rep 
michael oxley rohio although indicating he would like to have 
seen more aid for the region this is a tough tough bill for my 
part of the country and were going to feel it for a long time 
a lot of blood was spilled in these debates said rep jim 
cooper dtenn who vigorously opposed proposals such as a tax or 
energy fee to help the midwest 
only rep william dannemeyer rcalif voted against the house 
measure 
like the senate bill approved 8911 on tuesday the house 
legislation calls for sweeping emission controls on automobiles and 
industry including a requirement that electric utilities cut 
annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons or roughly in 
half 
sulfur dioxide especially from midwest electric power plants 
that use high sulfur coal is the source of the acid rain that has 
caused problems with lakes and streams in much of the northeast and 
midatlantic states 
the bush administration has estimated the senate legislation 
would cost the economy 215 billion a year when all provisions go 
into effect 
the house bill has been said to be slightly cheaper 
environmentalists say much of that cost will be offset by lower 
health costs 
house speaker tom foley dwash has indicated he wants to 
begin floor action on the clean air bill by early may the house 
and senate versions then would have to be worked out in a 
conference committee 
several congressmen have indicated they intend to pursue 
additional amendments on the house floor but congressional sources 
suggested thursday that it is unlikely that major changes will be 
made in light of the onesided committee vote 
rep john dingell dmich the panel chairman said the 
legislation was significantly better in protecting the 
environment than the senate version 
dingells committee tackled the most controversial aspects of 
the legislation including the acid rain issue behind closed 
doors private committee negotiations last week produced 
compromises on controlling urban smog and releasing toxic 
industrial chemicals 
more than 150 lobbyists representing everything from 
environmental groups to oil and chemical companies gathered 
outside the closed committee hearing room wednesday and thursday as 
committee members and their staffs worked out the acid rain 
agreement 
rep henry waxman dcalif for years a leading advocate in 
congress for tougher air pollution controls noted it had been 
eight years since the full committee tackled clean air legislation 
this legislation is long overdue agreed rep gerry 
sikorski dminn its a real victory for our lakes lungs and 
resources 
meanwhile the latest survey by the environmental protection 
agency released thursday showed that using 1988 figures smog 
continues to plague more than 100 cities and affect about 121 
million people

some in congress want to create the job of 
compost czar and think agriculture secretary clayton yeutter should 
wear the title 
a house agriculture subcommittee headed by rep george e brown 
jr dcalif approved by voice vote thursday an amendment to the 
1990 farm bill that would require yeutter to designate a 15member 
compost task force which he would head 
the measure if it became law would require a study of methods 
used to make compost out of agricultural waste evaluations would 
include wastes from the production processing and distribution 
of food fiber forestry livestock and fish products compost is 
a mixture of decomposing vegetable refuse used for soil 
fertilization 
officials at the agriculture department were apparently caught 
offguard by the compost amendment 
kelly shipp yeutters press secretary said she had not been 
aware of a move to create a compost bureaucracy until there was an 
opportunity to study the proposal ms shipp said there would be 
no yeutter position on the matter 
but surely she joked this wouldnt mean that everybody would 
have to bring their grass clippings to usda just because yeutter 
was the nations compost czar 
what are we up to about 30 billion by now for what everybody 
wants in the farm bill she said if we put together all the 
task forces and special offices they want us to have wed probably 
have to go out and buy another building as big as the two we have 
now 
the brown amendment which now goes before the full house 
agriculture committee said that the composting of agricultural 
wastes can help prevent contamination of water supplies and 
alleviate waste removal burdens on farmers 
further it said compost can be a safe and useful soil 
additive which can help to stabilize and enrich the soil and 
reduce the use of chemical fertilizers 
the department of agriculture is uniquely qualified to 
research appropriate uses and markets for compost the proposal 
said 
among its provisions the amendment would require yeutter to 
establish standards for compost quality and come up with 
definitions for processing handling and using compost 
further it would require usda to initiate extension efforts 
including seminars demonstration projects and dissemination of 
materials to inform the agricultural community about the 
benefits of compost

lowincome families on food stamps will come 
out substantially ahead under the new federal minimum wage law 
according to a senior agriculture department official 
every case is different but most food stamp recipients will 
keep at least 64 cents in benefits for each dollar they gain in 
wages said assistant secretary catherine bertini who oversees 
usda food and consumer services 
the food stamp program is not an alternative to work she 
said thursday in a statement we want to encourage people to 
work earn money and support themselves and their families 
the federal minimum wage rose to 380 an hour on april 1 from 
335 and will rise again next april 1 to 425 an hour 
food stamp benefits are allocated on the basis of several 
factors including household size and net income as determined by 
deducting expenses for such items as housing utilities and day 
care 
bertini cited an example of a family of three claiming the 
maximum deduction for housing earning 580 per month in wages and 
receiving 207 in food stamps under the new minimum wage law the 
familys earnings would increase by 78 to 658 per month while 
food stamp benefits would be reduced by 19 per month 
that would total 787 per month under the old minimum wage and 
846 under the new law a net gain of 67 per month she said 
the gain in wages more than makes up for the loss in food 
stamps bertini said in fact for each new dollar earned with 
the new minimum wage this household would keep 76 cents in food 
stamp benefits 
more than 19 million people get benefits under the food stamp 
program which is estimated to cost 148 billion this year

be polite prompt and keep promises if doing 
business internationally says an agriculture department report 
it also helps when traveling to a prospective new market to 
learn in advance as much about the countrys culture 
for example when in mexico it is customary to inquire about 
a colleagues wife and family whereas in many middle eastern 
countries it is taboo the report said patting a us 
colleague on the back for congratulations is a common practice in 
japan however this behavior would be discourteous 
the suggestions were include in the april issue of agexporter 
magazine by the departments foreign agricultural service 
keep promises the report said a good way to lose 
customers is to break promises the biggest complaint from foreign 
importers about us suppliers is a failure to ship as promised 
other important consideration involve religious and national 
holidays trying to conduct business in the united states on the 
fourth of july would be difficult if not impossible likewise 
different dates have special meaning in various countries 
a little research and observance in cultural behavior can go a 
long way in international commerce the report said likewise 
a lack of sensitivity to anothers customs can stop a deal in its 
tracks

a house bill created in response to an 
alleged rapists acquittal by jurors who said the woman asked for 
it would bar evidence from court concerning the rape victims 
clothing 
a fort lauderdale jury last year acquitted steven lamar lord 
26 of lawrenceville ga after his attorneys introduced as 
evidence the victims miniskirt and testimony that she wasnt 
wearing underwear the defense used the clothing to challenge the 
womans character and attempt to show she was looking for trouble 
it was not relevant at all to whether the person on trial 
actually committed the crime the bills sponsor rep elaine 
gordon said thursday it only had to do with an attack on the 
character of the victim 
the bill passed a subcommittee of the criminal justice committee 
60 it will be considered next by the full committee

the head of the social security administration 
says the agency has erected mindboggling obstacles to poor 
homeless and disabled people who need its help 
far too many people arent receiving supplemental security 
income benefits because they dont know about them dont 
understand them or cant figure out how to apply social security 
commissioner gwendolyn s king told the house select committee on 
aging on thursday 
its more than a little hard she said of the 15page 
application form it boggles the mind 
the supplemental security income program provides monthly cash 
benefits to poor aged blind and disabled people it provides up 
to 386 a month per individual or 579 a month per couple for those 
who meet strict and complex rules that take into account ordinary 
social security payments and other income 
about 46 million people receive the benefits but studies have 
concluded that as many as 50 percent of those eligible for ssi are 
not participating 
a 1988 survey conducted for the american association of retired 
people found that nearly onefourth of those over 65 living near or 
below the poverty line had never heard of it and only 22 percent 
received its benefits 
king said that when she took the job last year she found the 
program of ssi benefits an absolute maze a patchwork of 
information and instructions that confused me 
the agency has a moral obligation to find eligible people and 
help them apply and will increase its outreach efforts but no 
large new appropriation is needed she said 
maria foscarinis director of the national law center on 
homelessness and poverty a private advocacy group criticized the 
social security administration saying the government failed to get 
benefits to homeless people suffering the most extreme 
deprivation imaginable 
bills in the house and senate would require the social security 
administration to regularly visit shelters to explain benefits 
help homeless people apply and provide other assistance 
congress authorized the agency to conduct outreach demonstration 
projects in 1987 but the agency never conducted them arguing no 
money was appropriated congress provided 35 million for research 
into outreach programs and demonstration projects in the current 
budget

the navy has recovered the only surviving 
example of a preworld war ii fighter from the pacific bottom where 
it sat for almost 50 years 
probes had shown the plane was in nearperfect condition for 
most of the time it was underwater but a fishing net recently 
damaged the plane which was pulled out of the ocean wednesday 
officials said 
the f3f2 fighter a biplane made by the grumman corp was 
discovered more than a year ago in about 2000 feet of water some 
10 miles off the coastline 
the salvage effort funded by the san diego aerospace museum 
was coordinated with a navy effort to recover a helicopter that 
crashed in the same area last year 
robert rasmussen director of the naval museum was upset the 
plane was damaged before it could be recovered 
it was on the bottom for 49 years and was in absolutely 
perfect condition when it was found and then to come back and find 
its been torn apart by a fishing net its very disappointing 
extremely disappointing rasmussen said 
sometime during the past several months a fishing net snared 
and dragged the plane several hundred feet across the ocean the 
planes two right wings and the pilots canopy were torn off and 
the tail severely damaged 
the plane was ditched aug 29 1940 when the pilot robert 
galer was unable to reach the aircraft carrier saratoga 
galer a 76yearold retired brigadier general returned to see 
the salvage operation thursday 
i just wanted to get it down then worry about being sorry 
galer said about his 1940 flight its nice to see an old friend 
after so long but i hate to see it so beat up 
the plane will be restored at the san diego aerospace museum and 
then shipped to the national museum of naval aviation in pensacola 
fla it is the only surviving example of the navys prewar fighter 
a similar civilian version of the plane is on display at the 
smithsonian institution in washington dc

the 1990s may be a doordie decade for 
important aspects of the worlds environment an expert on 
overpopulation says 
if we dont see some real action in this decade it will 
probably be too late to avert some very serious problems anne 
ehrlich who with her husband wrote the current book the 
population explosion told a conference thursday on solving 
global environmental problems 
those problems include inadequate food production global 
warming species extinction and deforestation said mrs ehrlich 
associate director for the center for conservation biology at 
stanford university 
at the moment the rich countries are doing most of the 
environmental destruction of the planet but the poor countries are 
getting to be bigger and bigger players said her husband paul 
ehrlich stanford university professor of population studies 
carbon dioxide believed to contribute to global warming was 
one measure of environmental deterioration that the ehrlichs and 
other scientists discussed at the conference attended by about 
1200 students teachers gardenclub members and corporate 
executives 
the united states with about 5 percent of the worlds 
population produces 25 percent of the worlds output of carbon 
dioxide said peter raven professor of botany at washington 
university in st louis 
chicago puts out as much carbon dioxide as china he said 
its a peculiar world the people at the top are consuming far 
far more than a vast number of people at the bottom its much too 
unequal and its unequal in a way that affects the sustainable 
productivity of the world 
erlich said the current world population of 53 billion is 18 
billion more than in 1968 when he first prophesied the problems of 
overpopulation in his book the population bomb 
at a worldwide growth rate of 95 million people per year we 
are driving the earth into impoverishment said george woodwell 
president of the woods hole research center in woods hole mass 
we are living on its capital he said were eating up the 
standing stocks of trees and nutrients and soil in the process of 
feeding the current 53 billion people on earth in doing that we 
make the earth less capable of supporting people in the future 
the most serious population problem in the world is in the 
united states erlich said one american causes 20 times more 
destruction than one person in the third world and one rich 
american causes 1000 times more destruction he said 
its not how many people you have but how those people 
behave he said the most common misperception of the 
population problem is that its a problem of poor indians who dont 
know how to use condoms actually the problem in the world is that 
there are too many rich people 
the ehrlichs based their figures on 1987 statistics compiled by 
the united nations on per capita commercial energy consumption an 
index used by environmentalists to measure damage to the earth 
citizens of highly developed nations can help stop the spiral by 
practicing conservation and when necessary accepting a lower 
standard of living ehrlich said 
but that does not mean the citizens of wealthy nations have to 
resort to living like peasants he said 
in highly affluent sweden for instance the average person uses 
about 60 percent of the energy as consumed by the average american 
and enjoys a comparable standard of living he said 
the idea of perpetual economic growth is insane and yet its 
an insanity that grips our entire culture ehrlich said when 
you hear people say we have to favor economics over the 
environment thats like saying weve got to favor eating over 
breathing 
there is no way you can keep the size of the economy growing 
without destroying the environment and killing off your society 
but ehrlich said the bright side is we know societies can 
change very rapidly when the time is right 
frederic krupp executive director of the environmental defense 
fund said he sees signs americans are beginning to rally behind 
the green movement and demand biodegradable products energy 
efficient appliances and sound environmental policies

two out of three defendants charged with 
felonies in 39 of the nations largest counties were released from 
police custody pending court action says a justice department 
study 
the sampling released thursday of 11063 felony cases filed in 
february 1988 showed that 66 percent of the defendants were freed 
on bail bond or their own recognizance while awaiting trial or the 
dispositions of their cases 
thirtyone percent were held in jail pending trial because they 
were unable to post bail and 4 percent were ordered held without 
bail following their arraignments the study said 
the statistics gathered from local courts by the justice 
departments bureau of justice statistics were intended to be a 
sampling of the disposition of felony charges in 75 of the nations 
largest counties 
the study tracked the felony cases from initial filing to 
disposition in courts in 39 local jurisdictions including the 
district of columbia 
the suspects crimes included murder rape and drug sales and 
possession 
bail is requested by prosecutors to guarantee that a defendant 
will appear in court for subsequent proceedings and does not 
necessarily reflect the seriousness of the charges against the 
defendant

a new survey says onethird of american adults 
say they or someone in their family have sought help from a 
psychiatrist or a psychologist 
but the survey released thursday also found widespread 
opposition to putting any kind of mental health facility or housing 
for people with mental illness in their neighborhoods 
miles shore director of the robert wood johnson foundations 
program on chronic mental illness said he was encouraged that 
nearly 90 percent describe mental illness as a serious health 
problem and many believe it can be treated 
but he said the survey points out a contradiction in what he 
called the notinmybackyard or nimby phenomenon 
on the one hand people do object to siting these facilities 
in their back yard on the other hand over half recognize that 
mental illness can improve and that keeping up a normal life 
which includes community living will help with that 
improvement he said 
the survey found that 74 percent of those polled believe 
correctly that anyone can become mentally ill and that mental 
illness can be cured and 53 percent believe that keeping up a 
normal life in the community will help a person with mental illness 
get better 
but two in three believe there is a lot of stigma attached to 
mental illness according to the survey commissioned by the 
foundation

us officials are varying routes to 
work and guards have been reinforced around some american homes 
because of intelligence reports that communist rebels plan to kill 
another american us sources say 
the us embassy refuses to comment on details of increased 
security for the more than 40000 american troops diplomats aid 
workers and dependents stationed in this former american colony 
privately however american officials admit they are concerned 
that the new peoples army the armed wing of the outlawed 
communist party of the philippines will strike again perhaps 
before talks on the future of us military bases begin next month 
the rebels oppose the bases and have frequently threatened to 
attack americans allegedly involved in counterinsurgency despite 
us denials of any such role 
were looking over our shoulder said one diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity there are intelligence reports 
that they may try something 
during the past year rebels have killed five americans 
including army col james n rowe a vietnam war hero slain last 
april 21 on his way to the joint us military assistance group in 
suburban quezon city 
last september two american civilians working at an air base in 
tarlac province were gunned down on the day vice president dan 
quayle arrived in manila 
two american civilians not employed by the government were 
killed earlier this year in separate incidents on the islands of 
bohol and masbate police believe one of the americans was killed 
by mistake and the other refused to pay protection money to the 
rebels 
last month brig gen gerardo flores intelligence chief of the 
philippine constabulary predicted the rebels would try to kill an 
american to dramatize opposition to the bases 
the lease on the bases expires next year and us and filipino 
officials are expected to begin talks on a new agreement next month 
opposition to the bases is growing within the urban classes 
which see them as an infringement on sovereignty us and filipino 
officials fear the rebels will seek to exploit that opposition by 
staging an attack on an imperialist 
to cope with the threat some us diplomats and military 
officers are varying their routes to work and are staggering office 
hours to avoid travel during rush hour the favorite time for urban 
attacks 
extra security guards have been stationed at the homes of some 
american officials according to sources within the diplomatic 
community children of some military officers have been told not to 
report their addresses to private schools they attend 
at the subic bay naval base 50 miles west of manila the us 
navy has banned most nonessential travel to the capital by the 
6000 sailors 
airmen stationed at clark air base 50 miles north of manila 
have been ordered not to travel to and from manila at night and 
have been discouraged from visits to much of the country 
the far east network which broadcasts television programs to 
the us military community airs frequent announcements urging 
viewers to think security they include warnings against wearing 
uniforms off post or answering the telephone with a military rank 
everyone is a little jittery said one source in the 
diplomatic community who spoke on condition of anonymity 
theyre all waiting for something to happen they just dont know 
when or where 
communist rebels claim they will not target the estimated 80000 
to 100000 american civilians residing in the country 
our main target are the us occupation troops and all us 
personnel who are involved in counterinsurgency said rebel 
commander romulo kintanar in a recent statement to news 
organizations we differentiate between the american people who 
are not our enemies and their imperialist government which is 
colonialist and oppressive

donald trump rubbed a genies lamp 
and lasers lashed the sky to herald the opening of the taj majal 
his glitzy new casino 
but the billionaire real estate developer will need more than 
electronic miracles for the citys newest and grandest gambling 
emporium to break even in an industry whose growth has slowed 
lately analysts said 
at the grand opening for the billiondollar 1250room 
51story casinohotel trump came on stage thursday night and 
touched an aladdins lamp setting off a green laser that shot up 
to a red ribbon along the hotels outside cutting the bow in two 
a max headroomtype genie appeared on a giant screen flanking 
the stage and said trump was master for making this casino of 
princes and princesses and genies and magic 
then the fireworks began watched by thousands of boardwalk 
spectators and celebrities including former heavyweight champion 
michael spinks 
trump was introduced by entertainer merv griffin who in 
november 1988 swapped the taj mahal with trump for the adjoining 
resorts casino hotel 
resorts has since filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
griffin teased trump about the gossip swirling around who he 
would bring to the ceremony his estranged wife ivana or his

a healthy baby girl was born to a couple who 
conceived the child to serve as a bone marrow donor for their 
cancerstricken daughter 
abe and mary ayala revealed eight weeks ago that they had 
conceived the baby named marissa eve as a last resort to save the 
life of their 18yearold daughter anissa who is dying of 
leukemia 
the baby weighed 6 pounds 4 ounces at birth tuesday night at 
queen of the valley hospital in suburban west covina the couples 
niece lydia sanchez said thursday 
shes beautiful she looks just like anissa sanchez said 
the ayalas chose eve as a middle name because eve means 
life she said 
fetal tests have shown the babys marrow is compatible with 
anissas and doctors said the transplant could occur in six months 
the chance the transplant will cure anissa has been reported as 
between 70 and 80 percent 
anissas leukemia has remained stable said dr patricia konrad 
who will perform the surgery the wait is planned primarily so the 
baby will grow and enough marrow can be taken from marissa eve to 
give her older sister a fighting chance 
the case drew considerable attention as medical ethicists voiced 
qualms about creating one child to save another they said the baby 
was not concieved as an end in itself but for a utilitarian 
purpose 
the middleaged couple said they were hurt by such talk and 
that they would love the baby even if it proved to be an 
incompatible bone marrow donor for their stricken daughter 
almost 24 ounces of marrow would be taken from an adult donor 
if one was available konrad said she would be lucky to get half 
that amount even after freezing the umbilical cord to use its cells 
to supplement the marrow transplant 
the baby faces little risk konrad said the procedure requires 
the infant to be put under general anesthesia to block pain while a 
needle is inserted usually twice into the hip bone to remove the 
marrow 
leukemia a cancer of white blood cells typically is treated by 
killing bloodproducing cells with chemotherapy or radiation 
marrow from a matching donor usually a sibling is then 
transplanted into the leukemia patient so the healthy stem cells 
can produce healthy blood cells 
after waiting almost two years the couple said the national 
marrow donor program had failed to find a suitable living donor for 
anissa with the odds reported to be about 1 in 20000 
abe ayala told the associated press in february we just cant 
stand idly by and do nothing about it and wait for anissa to die 
the odds were even longer when the ayalas who are in their 
mid40s decided to gamble in the fall 1988 by trying to have 
another child 
ayala had to undergo an operation to reverse a vasectomy he had 
16 years earlier with about a 50 percent chance of success women 
of mrs ayalas age have a 73 percent chance of conception and 
there was only a 25 percent chance the baby would prove to be a 
compatible donor 
abe told reporters in february this is our miracle baby 
the ayalas live in the los angeles suburb of walnut with anissa 
and a 19yearold son airon

police said gunmen working for drug traffickers killed another 
policeman thursday in medellin bringing to 15 the number of 
officers killed there since monday

explode a bomb in a wealthy section of bogota in retaliation

serpas apartment is 1 blocks from the site and that the interior 
minister passed by the truck minutes before police discovered the 
bomb

bogota headquarters the blast killed 63 people 
the attack was part of the terrorist campaign meant to force the 
government to abandon its policy of extraditing drug traffickers 
barco revived the policy in august as part of a usbacked 
crackdown after drug traffickers killed a leading presidential 
candidate 
bombings and other terrorist actions ended in january when the 
drug lords declared a truce but they announced last week they were 
resuming their campaign when the government extradited another drug 
suspect

lithuanian lawmakers took a conciliatory tone with 
moscow in seeking talks on independence but the kremlin continued 
its hardline position as soviet troops took over another 
government building in the baltic republic 
soldiers dressed as police invaded the lithuanian prosecutors 
offices thursday forced employees outside and took over the 
building witnesses and spokesmen for the republics parliament 
said 
on wednesday lithuanias secessionist government accused moscow 
of backing forces seeking its overthrow but a day later the 
legislators were conciliatory 
in a message to president mikhail s gorbachev the lawmakers 
wrote they value highly your efforts aimed at the peaceful 
solution of problems but think talks should not be accompanied 
by the willful actions of your armed forces 
lithuania forcibly incorporated into the soviet union with the 
baltic states of estonia and latvia in 1940 declared independence 
on march 11 and has been in a confrontation with the kremlin ever 
since 
estonia is cautiously following lithuanias lead on march 30 
its new parliament declared estonia under soviet occupation and set 
an indefinite transition period for independence on thursday 
estonian leaders decided to stand firm on their demands for 
independence despite gorbachevs wrath informed sources said 
latvia also appeared headed toward independence its communist 
party congress was due to open today 
in lithuania there was apparent movement toward common ground 
with moscow including a possible referendum on independence that 
could bring lithuania closer to compliance with a new soviet law on 
secession 
edward tuskenis of the lithuanian parliaments information 
office called the lawmakers message a diplomatic and 
conciliatory response to gorbachevs demand that lithuania 
renounce its independence declaration 
the message addressed gorbachev as deeply esteemed 
president and said the parliament reiterates its readiness to 
begin a dialogue and to discuss measures to establish new relations 
between our states 
late thursday however about 50 armed men entered the 
prosecutors office site of a previous soviet attempt to seize 
power from officials appointed by the new lithuanian government 
henrika pocei secretary to lithuanias chief prosecutor said 
from vilnius the men fully occupied the building and there are 
six or eight paratroopers on each floor dressed as policemen 
the chief prosecutor is the republics highest law enforcement 
authority 
at the same offices last week moscow officials tried to remove 
lithuanianappointed chief prosecutor arturas paulauskas and 
install their own man 
employees refused to obey the moscow loyalist and soldiers were 
posted in the building on march 30 in the first occupation by 
soviet troops of a lithuanian government building soldiers earlier 
took control of at least five communist party buildings 
the occupations were attempts by the soviet government to assert 
control over the republic 
tuskenis said the lawmakers message to gorbachev is saying 
that we can appreciate moscows point of view and pushes for 
negotiations 
but tuskenis said parliamentary leaders still ruled out 
gorbachevs demand saturday that lithuania renounce independence so 
talks could begin 
in london lithuanias de facto spokesman algis cekuolis 
expressed a willingness to agree to other concessions including a 
continued soviet military presence retention of current economic 
ties with moscow and a referendum on independence 
the announcement was the first such public offer from the 
lithuanians 
tuskenis said such a position had not been not fully approved by 
the lithuanian government but he said lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis has said he may agree to a referendum 
us secretary of state james a baker iii held a second day of 
talks thursday with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in 
washington 
soviet tv reporting late thursday on shevardnadzes trip 
showed prolithuanian demonstrators in moscow the report said the 
protesters tried to complicate the visit but that superpower 
goodwill outweighed tension over lithuania 
president bush and gorbachev will meet for a summit in the 
united states beginning may 30 us and soviet officials said 
thursday

a deli owner who lost a lawsuit against 
paul newman and his food companies says the court battle was a 
mismatch because of the actors status as a movie screen idol and 
philanthropist 
but members of the jury said they spent their time gazing on the 
evidence not at the star and newman called westport deli owner 
julius golds remarks sour grapes 
juror gail mcculley said all but one of the six jurors began 
deliberations convinced that golds claims were without merit 
mcculley and juror beverly willis agreed that newmans celebrity 
status didnt influence them 
it made no difference who he was we treated him just like we 
would you willis said he was just another guy there just 
another person 
the superior court jury deliberated five hours over two days 
before deciding thursday afternoon that newman never promised gold 
8 percent stock in his businesses newmans own inc and salad king 
inc 
the academy awardwinning actor was cheered as left the 
courthouse and quickly surrounded by a crowd of about 200 reporters 
and spectators 
all right cool hand luke yelled one wellwisher 
congratulations paul shouted another as a couple of motorists 
tooted their horns 
gold the owner of a westport deli claimed he was owed the 
stock for helping newman start the businesses in 1982 and 1983 
im disappointed gold said i brought the case because i 
thought i was wronged i realized i was dealing with an uphill 
battle going against a celebrity of world status 
newman said he felt sorry for gold but he said the suggestion 
he was helped by his fame was sour grapes and a lot of whining 
its just tragic all of this energy and time could not have 
been spent in more charitable pursuits but thats the nature of 
the beast newman said 
ae hotchner who is chief operating officer of newmans 
companies was also a defendant the jury found in his favor 
concluding that gold had not reached an implied contract with 
either him or the newman companies 
newman and hotchner started newmans own on a whim beginning 
with salad dressing that newman originally made in the basement of 
his westport home the product line was later expanded to include 
spaghetti sauce popcorn and lemonade 
all profits 28 million to date have gone go to charity the 
westportbased companies had a record 42 million in sales last 
year up from 36 million in 1988 
gold testified that he too would give any proceeds to charity 
if he won the case

the museum under attack for an exhibition of 
sexually graphic photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe is 
finding an upsurge in community support a little overwhelming 
more than 3000 people were expected to attend the shows 
opening tonight said dennis barrie director of the contemporary 
arts center three times more than the largest crowd ever to fill 
the small downtown museum 
were going to have to regulate the flow into the gallery 
barrie said 
before the big party barrie may learn whether a local court 
believes that the exhibit violates local community standards 
hamilton county municipal judge edward l donnellon was set 
today to hear the museums request for a jury verdict on whether 
the exhibit is obscene the museum sought the verdict after local 
law enforcement agents threatened to shut the exhibit 
about 400 people have paid 25 to 150 each to become museum 
members in the last 10 days a period when the museum usually might 
sign 10 members barrie said 
tickets to tonights opening were available only to the arts 
centers patrons the exhibit opens to the public saturday 
the 175photograph exhibit includes nine controversial pictures 
that portray nude children or homoerotic and sadomasochistic sex 
acts the museum is putting the photos in a separate room that 
minors are prohibited from entering 
the exhibit of the work by mapplethorpe who died of aids march 
1989 prompted congress to limit funding to the arts after sen 
jesse helms rnc declared the photographs obscene 
they were exhibited without incident at private museums in 
several cities before coming to cincinnati 
i think sadly cincinnati will get a bit of a black eye from 
this barrie said but the real story is that while theres a 
vocal minority theres a majority that says we support freedom 
the museum says the exhibit is constitutionally protected 
because it is art despite the sexually graphic pictures 
in a supporting affidavit bruce h evans director of the 
dayton art institute said the exhibit demostrates mapplethorpes 
skill as a photographer as well as the range of emotional reaction 
his works produce 
it can be for example the breathtaking sense of simple 
beauty of a human figure or floral still life or a 
gutwrenching sense of disgust to acts of human sadism evans

the right of attorneyclient privilege is being 
tested in the stuart murder case as prosecutors try to pry 
information from the lawyer for the man who apparently killed 
himself after he became a suspect 
prosecutors trying to unravel charles stuarts alleged plot to 
kill his pregnant wife asked a judge thursday to lift the privilege 
that has silenced stuarts former attorney 
the courts have ruled both ways in previous cases in which 
lawyers have been asked to disclose what they were told in 
confidence legal experts said 
theres always going to be a temptation that this is an 
important case and you need that information said william j 
genego a law professor at boston university 
suffolk superior court judge james donohue took the case under 
advisement after the hearing thursday which was closed because of 
a grand jury investigation 
the motion centers on a conversation stuart had with his 
attorney john dawley before he died on jan 4 
dawley has refused to reveal the details but it is believed 
stuart disclosed his role in the oct 23 shooting death of his 
pregnant wife carol 
paul leary an assistant district attorney said his office was 
asking the court to allow prosecutors to get information from 
dawley 
we will pursue every avenue to get to the truth leary said 
this may be one of them 
another key witness in the case is stuarts younger brother 
matthew who provided the dramatic revelations that led to charles 
stuarts suicide 
prior to january authorities believed stuarts tale that he and 
his wife were attacked by a mugger but matthew told police that 
his brother instructed him to be at the murder scene where charles 
gave him some of his wifes belongings and a revolver 
matthew stuart was called before the grand jury last week but 
he reportedly refused to testify to avoid selfincrimination his 
attorney nancy gertner attended thursdays court hearing 
representing the stuart estate 
we believe the attorneyclient privilege extends past death 
period gertner said 
deborah ramirez a visiting law professor at northeastern 
university said judges can order an attorney to disclose 
privileged information from a dead client but some courts have 
ruled in the other direction she said 
if i were a judge i would find a way to order that the 
privilege not apply she said but i think im in the 
minority 
legal experts disagree over whether the power to waive the 
privilege can transfer to the clients heirs in this case 
stuarts mother is the administrator of his estate her attorney 
richard clayman said even if she can waive it she wont waive 
it

black factions broke out today in natal leaving at least 10 people 
dead despite an accord by president fw de klerk and nelson 
mandela to resume peace talks

klerk and mandela agreed in cape town thursday to talks on ending 
whiteminority rule and sharing power with south africas 28 
million disenfranchised blacks 
both leaders said a date for new talks would be announced

end to the black factional fighting that has left hundreds dead in 
recent weeks the political violence is believed to be the worst 
since the mid1980s 
de klerk said late thursday the two leaders discussed the 
fighting frankly and clearly i had the impression that there 
is a general agreement that violence had to come to an end and that 
there was a need for creating an atmosphere in which normal 
political processes could take place 
but rival zulu war bands armed with guns knives and sticks 
clashed around pietermaritzburg in southeastern natal today police

where the clashes had been concentrated police said heavily armed 
army troops were helping police restore order

their homes to escape the fighting between rival zulu factions of 
the conservative inkatha movement and the united democratic front

nine the anc is calling for an end to the state of emergency and 
other measures before it agrees to fullscale talks 
de klerk also said thursday he objected to the anc pressuring 
tribal homeland leaders not to meet with the government 
mandela said nothing could be further from the truth than 
charges of anc intimidation 
in addition to mandela de klerk had been scheduled to meet with 
six homeland leaders but four did not show up de klerk said some 
of the leaders were pressured not to come and that choice was not 
voluntary in any sense of the word 
mandela and other anc leaders have called for unity among all 
black political factions in order to present a solid front 
but the anc does not recognize the homeland governments it says 
the division of black south africans into 10 tribal areas deprives 
blacks of citizenship land ownership and work rights leaving most 
of the country for whites 
meanwhile thursday the military of the nominally independent 
homeland of venda overthrew the government and said the area should 
be reincorporated into south africa radio reports said there were 
no immediate reports of fighting or casualties 
there are four nominally independent homelands in south africa 
and there have been military coups in three in the last 2 years 
the four leaders of the independent homelands were not invited to 
the talks 
de klerk legalized the anc and other outlawed black opposition 
groups in february shortly before mandela was released from jail 
the president says he wants to share political power with blacks 
and end all judicial forms of racial segregation 
mandela was released from jail in february after 27 years he is 
the de facto leader of the anc while the guerrilla movements 
president oliver tambo recovers from a stroke at a swedish clinic

market mood thursday afternoon when major institutional investors 
began actively buying shares to support the falling market the 
move helped the nikkei index wipe out most of a 108894point 
morning loss to close the day thursday down only 19388 points 
the market has entered on a rebounding phase as domestic 
demandrelated issues and largecapital stocks including steel 
issues were bought briskly said masaya hashizume an analyst 
with nikko securities 
the relatively large trading volume of 800 million shares 
signals the beginning of a market turnaround he said

monetary authorities from the united states japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada

prime minister toshiki kaifu said today the broad 
trade reforms approved by the united states and japan could be 
painful but will improve living standards 
consumer groups said the changes could hurt community 
development and go against with cultural values however 
speaking at a news conference kaifu said japan must carry out 
its end of the accord announced thursday in washington as a 
responsible member of the international community 
the agreement reached after four days of discussions sets 
forth complex proposals aimed at lowering americas huge 49 
billion trade deficit with japan 
i ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of 
my country kaifu said 
in the end he said the reforms will improve the lives of the 
japanese 
the talks were unprecedented because they aimed not at boosting 
sales of specific foreign products but at easing barriers to trade 
in both countries 
but the federation of specialty stores associations said in a 
statement it would do its best to prevent the decisions from 
being enforced by keeping close ties with other groups and 
promoting consumer awareness and cooperation 
it focused its attack on the most controversial of the proposed 
japanese reforms revision of a law that protects small retailers 
by restricting the opening of large department stores a process 
that takes about 10 years 
the united states sought abolition of the law contending larger 
stores are more likely to sell foreign products 
kaifu said effects of the revision would be severe but he 
added i believe it is important for me and all of you to think 
of the viewpoint of consumers interests 
the associations statement said however the decision will 
do nothing but weaken minor retailers devastate shopping districts 
and slow economic and cultural development of the community 
the association claims a membership of 50000 small retailers 
nationwide the trade ministry says japan has 16 million retail 
shops with fewer than 50 employees and 800000 tiny 
momandpop stores 
the talks on barriers to trade known as the structural 
impediments initiative began last july until this week they had 
made little headway 
japan said the united states contributed to the trade imbalance 
with its large budget deficit low savings rate shortterm 
corporate planning and weak education system us negotiators 
promised to remedy these problems 
us officials have argued the changes sought in japan would 
benefit japanese consumers who pay some of the worlds highest 
prices as a result of a complex distribution system and numerous 
government restrictions 
japanese consumers however have not formed strong 
organizations to press for change and many japanese identify their 
own interests with those of their companies 
larger is not necessarily better said naokazu takeuchi head of 
the japan consumers union one of the nations largest consumer 
groups 
it is not cheap pricing that we consumers want he said 
we have to take many elements cultural aspects community 
relationship into consideration before making decisions 
kaifu said the promised package of reforms would benefit not 
only the united states and japan but also the whole world serve 
to prevent the rise of protectionism and thus contribute to the 
steady development of the world economy 
the japanese measures included in the interim report have been 
attained after undergoing a difficult domestic process and their 
implementation may in some cases be painful kaifu said it 
is my conviction however that they are essential in furthering 
japans own national interest 
among japans pledges was one to spend more on public works such 
as housing sewers parks airports and port facilities 
the united states believing such spending will boost japans 
demand for foreign goods and services sought a spending target 
but japan said it will decide expenditures annually to avoid 
overheating the economy 
on the retail store law which the united states wanted 
abolished japan said it will improve how the law works revise it 
next year and then review it again in another two years 
if by then it still takes 10 years to open large stores 
specific areas of the country would be exempted from the law 
japanese officials said 
because the agreement said specific areas the law will not 
be abolished an official of the ministry of international trade 
and industry said on condition of anonymity

an east german leftist party and a 
conservative alliance cleared away some ideological differences in 
efforts to build a broad coalition government the adn news agency 
said today 
christian democratic leader lothar de maiziere whose party 
holds the most seats in parliament was asked to try to form a 
government during thursdays inaugural session of the new 
legislature 
de maiziere is trying to resolve differences over reunification 
and build a broad coalition from the 11 parties represented his 
success would speed the merger of the german states the principal 
issue in the countrys first free elections on march 18 
the christian democrats are part of a conservative alliance that 
also includes democratic awakening and the german social union the 
alliance has tried to ally with the leftleaning social democrats 
despite serious ideological differences between that party and the 
social union 
those two parties were able to put aside some differences in a 
latenight meeting according to east germanys adn news agency 
adn quoted social democrat chief markus meckel as saying there 
are still differing views between the two parties but no 
obstacles that cant be overcome 
de maiziere needs a broad coalition to ensure the twothirds 
vote needed to enact constitutional changes required for 
unification 
members of the conservative alliance follow the policies 
espoused by their likeminded colleagues in bonn led by chancellor 
helmut kohl 
kohl said again today his countrymen will not face a tax 
increase to finance the heavy costs of german unification 
a tax increase would unnecessarily brake the economic upswing 
and have a counterproductive effect kohl said in the west german 
city of ludwigshafen 
unification was a prominent theme of thursdays inaugural 
session of the 400member parliament and the lawmakers formally 
dismantled the communist system that ruled for four decades 
despite differences over how to proceed with unification east 
german political parties together oppose a proposal by the west 
german central bank to trade east marks for west marks at a 21 
exchange thousands of east germans rallied nationwide thursday to 
demand a 11 rate which would offset unemployment and inflation in 
east germany once the countries unite 
however west germany said thursday it was moving ahead with 
plans to replace the nearly worthless east german currency with the 
mighty western mark by summer 
the east german lawmakers chose christian democrat sabine 
bergmannpohl to serve as parliament president he said he hoped 
the legislators do justice to our responsibilities and that we 
soon sit in a common german parliament 
the parliament also created the office of president a 
ceremonial head of state and abolished the communist collective 
body the council of state 
dr bergmannpohl will serve as head of state until the 
lawmakers elect a president de maiziere will likely be chosen 
premier 
running the country now is the communistled caretaker 
government headed by premier hans modrow who took over after 
hardliner erich honecker was ousted in october 
the alliance for germany favors rapid reunification while the 
leftleaning social democrats favor a gradual merger 
hundreds of thousands rallied nationwide thursday to protest the 
proposed 21 exchange rate and demand west german chancellor helmut 
kohl live up to his promises of prosperity for east germans kohl 
campaigned hard for de maiziere 
about 50000 people rallied in east berlin and another 50000 
marched in leipzig the state news service adn said rallies also 
were reported in the cities of halle neubrandenburg magdeburg 
dresden gera potsdam and cottbus the government news agency adn 
reported 
despite the uproar west german finance minister theo waigel 
confirmed newspaper reports that under the proposed currency union 
east germany would relinquish control of monetary policy to the 
west german central bank bundesbank 
waigel said government ministers were studying a 50page draft 
proposal for replacing the east german mark he said west germany 
would like basic agreement by next month and establishment of the 
common currency sometime this summer 
adn also said 40000 east germans lost their jobs in march east 
germanys many inefficient and obsolete industries are having 
difficulty competing with the flood of western products now 
available to east germans

a jury convicted and sentenced 
to prison 23 islanders for torturing and burning to death six 
people in a frenzied witch hunt that terrorized their tiny atoll in 
the south pacific 
the sevenman twowoman jury at the tribunal of papeete handed 
down the penalties late thursday they ranged from three to 14 
years imprisonment for those who particiapted in the 1987 slayings 
prosecutor raymond morey had recommended penalties ranging from 
five to 20 years 
the defendants mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of 
faaite showed no reaction when the sentences were read another 
suspect a minor will be judged in a separate proceeding 
i find these penalties very heavy said roman catholic 
archbishop michel coppenrath the highestranking church official 
in french polynesia the repentance of the accused is sincere 
the heaviest sentence 14 years went to farmer francois mauti 
25 on convictions of murder complicity in murder and inflicting 
mortal blows he led a band of disciples that organized the 
violence in sept 24 1987 
i had a spirit under the spell of the devil mauti told 
judge marcel bihl i lost my head but i believed i was on the 
holy path shunning the evil fighting within me 
during the nineday trial the court heard defendants speak of 
being swept away by demons or religious frenzy as they hunted down 
and killed neighbors they thought were possessed 
the terror had roots in august 1987 visit by three women who 
arrived from tahiti 300 miles to the west the women claimed to 
represent the roman catholicaffiliated movement christian renewal 
but church authorities deny they had any official role in the 
movement 
the group already had a strong following on faaite a sunny 
atoll of white sand that is home to about 180 people the women 
regarded as priestesses by the islanders took over the 
communitys whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the 
religious authority 
the trios leader alexandra silvia conducted services in a 
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that god would 
abandon faaite the defendants said 
miss silvia suggested demons were in their midst defendants 
said and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow 
islanders who failed to attend her daily services 
my words were misinterpreted testified silvia a 
55yearold dental secretary who was not charged i only gave 
prayers that cured those who were sick 
but the defendants said the mood of the onceplacid atoll swung 
between ecstasy and dread inspired by silvia and her assistants 
the trio left faaite in late august and anointed seven disciples to 
continue their work 
a few days later a 14yearold boy reported a vision that the 
devil had possessed his aunt the islanders gathered in nightlong 
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised 
they repeated the ritual with two other people but ioane 
harris the assistant mayor publicly denounced the women on sept 
2 maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck beat and 
drowned him and threw his body on a bonfire built before the 
church 
it was necessary to purify him one defendant said it was 
necessary to purify the village 
five more people were killed over the next two days 
most islanders took no part in the carnage but it was sept 4 
before anyone established contact with papeete the capital of 
french polynesia and reported trouble on the atoll 
the mayor who had been on vacation and a roman catholic priest 
arrived the next day with police in time to prevent four more 
executions 
psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic 
christianity mixed with ancient polynesian beliefs in the 
supernatural produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated 
island lacking institutional authority the three women were not 
put on trial since they had left faaite before the murders

have been identified by authorities 
he said 10 other inmates remained unaccounted for in the riot 
that began sunday at the overcrowded victorian prison officials 
say a prisoner was fatally injured and 49 other people were hurt

other prisons reported seeing bodies inside the prison and reports 
persisted thursday of prisoners being hanged and tortured by fellow

chaplains microphone and urged others to take action 
at no time did anyone have any willful intention that we would 
develop into a riot situation thomas 28 shouted through a 
makeshift bullhorn

various parts of the prison smashed fittings and hurled down 
slates from the roof 
the government said thursday it has ordered a major inquiry

pope john paul ii met with plo leader yasser 
arafat today and urged israelis and palestinians to negotiate a 
settlement allowing them both to live in peace 
the pope reaffirmed that palestinians as well as jews have a 
right to a homeland 
the two men met for 20 minutes in the papal library in an 
audience described by the vatican as private 
it was their third meeting in eight years john paul had 
previously received the palestine liberation organization chairman 
at the vatican in 1982 and 1988 drawing protests from israel and 
jewish groups 
during this visit the israeli embassy said it was mystified 
that arafat was being treated by italy and the vatican as a man 
of peace 
the papal meeting came on the second day of arafats twoday 
visit to italy he has met with italian government and political 
leaders seeking european support to force israel to the bargaining 
table 
israels coalition government collapsed march 15 in a dispute 
over a peace plan that called for preliminary meetings between 
israeli officials and palestinians to discuss proposed elections in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip where the palestinian 
uprising began 27 months ago 
arafats plo helps direct the uprising and israels government 
has banned talks with palestinians loyal to the plo 
in a statement after the talks vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro said the pope had agreed to meet arafat to encourage any 
positive attitude in the search for peace and especially to 
strengthen the will for dialogue as the only valid way to find 
adequate solutions for conflicts 
the statement noted that john paul had often spoken out against 
the recourse to arms and especially violence carried out by 
terroristic means and by reprisal 
navarro said the pope noted that this is the season of important 
religious holidays the christian easter the jewish passover and 
the moslem ramadan 
the pope expressed the strong hope that almighty god wishes to 
listen to the pleas of so many faithful and in particular of those 
people of the middle east and grants them the sodesired peace in 
justice and security navarro said 
the pope according to his spokesman stressed that israelis and 
palestinians must show a willingness for mutual understanding and 
the respect for the rights and fears of each other in order to open 
the way to negotiations 
he said this would lead to a path which brings an end to the 
sufferings and which allows each to live in peace freedom dignity 
and calm in a homeland of ones own open to collaboration with all 
peoples of the region 
navarro said the two also discussed the crisis in lebanon with 
the pope stressing that the use of arms would not succeed in 
bringing dignity and sovereignty to that country

china has agreed to resume the fulbright scholar 
exchange program with the united states but on a smaller scale a 
us embassy official said today 
china abruptly canceled the 198990 program in august in anger 
over us criticism of the military suppression of the studentled 
movement for democratic reform 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said a formal 
agreement was reached wednesday with the state education commission 
for the 199091 academic year starting in the fall 
sixteen american professors will come to china and 16 chinese 
scholars will do advanced research at us universities he said 
the 198990 program had called for an exchange of 24 scholars 
from each side with 12 graduate students and 12 research fellows 
representing china it had been one of the largest fulbright 
programs which exchange american and foreign scholars around the 
world 
the chinese government has sharply curtailed approval of 
overseas studies for undergraduates and most graduate students 
since its crackdown on political dissent last spring 
the government while insisting it will continue overseas study 
programs is now limiting scholarships mainly to older scholars in 
technical fields for shortterm programs 
the reasoning is that such scholars will be less likely to 
become involved in politics while abroad and will be less tempted 
to join the thousands of chinese students who have failed to return 
home after completing their programs 
the us embassy in a statement said the fulbright program 
fills a need not addressed in other exchange programs and the 
agreement was a positive step toward the resumption of this 
important program 
it added we hope the chinese will resume the participation of 
chinese graduate students in the near future and will take steps 
in other areas that will be conducive to reform and to chinas 
opening to the outside world 
the exchange of 16 scholars on each side roughly returns the 
program to its size during the 198485 academic year 
discussion on resuming the exchanges began after president bush 
dispatched national security adviser brent scowcroft to beijing in 
december for talks aimed at easing bilateral tensions 
no progress has been made in other areas deemed crucial to 
improved relations 
china is believed to still be holding without trial thousands of 
people who participated in last years democracy movement and it 
has taken a hardline position on the release of astrophysicist and 
political dissident fang lizhi 
fang and his wife li shuxian took refuge in the us embassy 
after the military crackdown in june and have since been charged as 
counterrevolutionaries 
negotiations on their safe passage out of the country have 
apparently stalled with china continuing to insist the two give 
themselves up to chinese authorities and admit their guilt 
the fulbright program was established in 1946 under legislation 
by former sen j william fulbright dark more than 167000 
people including 58000 from the united states and 109000 from 
abroad have participated

an animal rights activist turned down a 
plea bargain that would have allowed her to serve only one year in 
prison on an attempted murder charge because the agreement did not 
include visits with her dogs 
fran trutt who is charged with attempted murder possession of 
explosives and bomb manufacturing will go to trial for planting a 
bomb at a company that demonstrates surgical staples on dogs in 
1988 she faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted 
plea negotiations in which trutt would have pleaded no contest 
to at least one of the three charges broke down thursday when 
prison officials refused to grant her permission to see her pets 
said john williams trutts lawyer 
she was willing to allow herself to be incarcerated for a 
crime she did not commit in order to see her dogs immediately 
williams said she would do anything to see her dogs the only 
thing you could compare it with is a mother seeing a child 
michael donahue a spokesman for the state department of 
correction said our policy has been and remains that for 
safety health and security reasons canines are not allowed to the 
facilities to visit those who are incarcerated 
trutt is being held at connecticut correctional institution in 
niantic on 500000 bond and has not seen her dogs since her arrest 
in november 1988 
williams said trutt was distraught because she will have to wait 
months with no possibility of seeing the dogs her trial is 
expected to last into the fall 
trutt was arrested for allegedly planting a remotecontrolled 
pipe bomb near the corporate parking space of leon hirsch 
president of us surgical in norwalk 
trutt has said she planted the bomb to scare hirsch and protest 
the companys use of about 1000 anesthetized dogs annually in 
training physicians to use surgical staples in place of stitches 
the dogs are then destroyed 
williams last month filed a civil lawsuit against the state in 
us district court in new haven charging that trutts 
constitutional rights are being violated because she is not 
permitted to see her dogs 
the state has until monday to respond 
in january trutt was sentenced to 14 months in prison after 
pleading guilty to charges of illegally possessing two bombs in her 
new york city apartment she already has served that time

a young woman has been found strangled 
in the same area where six other bodies have been discovered since 
september fueling fears that the deaths are the work of a serial 
killer 
it was the seventh time in as many months that a black woman in 
her 20s or 30s has been found dead in or around gillham park said 
sgt greg mills of the kansas city police department 
all the women had been strangled mills said and none of the 
killings has been solved 
he would say only that police are investigating the possibility 
of a serial killer 
the latest victim was discovered thursday morning by a woman 
walking her dog mills said the victim was identified as michelle 
mitchell 22 of kansas city 
the jackson county medical examiners office determined she had 
been strangled and police said she had been dead four to six hours 
before her body was discovered 
the unexplained killings began in september when the bodies of 
three women were found over 10 days two more women were found dead 
the next month the latest victim before thursday was that of a 
23yearold woman found in gillham park on jan 18 
police began considering the possibility of a serial killer 
after the october deaths 
we are not in a position to say it is but the similarities 
have not escaped us mill said 
we dont have one definite thing that ties all of them 
together conclusively and until then it would be irresponsible to 
say they were all committed by one person he said 
gillham park is located in a residential neighborhood in the 
citys midtown area south of downtown

their voting districts in the provinces and on aegean islands to 
cast ballots in the countrys third national elections in 10 months 
police reported traffic delays at toll booths on the national 
highway leading out of the capital 
olympic airways the national carrier offered extra domestic 
flights and chartered planes from balkanbulgarian airlines to 
accommodate the expected travel overflow staterun buses and 
railways offered discounts on fares as an incentive to greeks to 
return to their hometowns to vote in sundays election 
many greeks who moved to big cities from the provinces over the 
years have never changed their voting districts in order to avoid 
the bureaucracy of reregistering and to maintain ties with their 
hometowns 
greece has 8050658 registered voters among its 10 million 
population over onethird of the population leaves in or near the 
capital about 600000 live in salonica the nations second 
largest city 
voting is compulsory for people between 18 and 70 
sundays general election is the third in 10 months two earlier 
polls ended inconclusively with no one party winning an absolute 
majority in the 300member singlechamber parliament two 
coalitions failed to resolve the countrys pressing social 
problems prompting another vote

ballots are counted after polls close sunday night 
the exodus to the provinces was expected to peak later today 
when shops and private businesses closed for the weekend 
most government agencies closed at noon today civil services 
were not expected to return to normal until tuesday because the law 
provides for three days travel time for voters who are registered

jurors in john poindexters irancontra trial 
resumed deliberations today for a fifth day with no indication they 
were approaching a verdict soon 
on thursday jurors sent out a note asking for a dictionary 
triggering a brief flurry of activity as us district court judge 
harold greene and lawyers in the case debated whether they should 
fill the request 
the judge and lawyers for both sides were against providing a 
dictionary and the jurors subsequently said they didnt need one 
anyway 
the next thing you know they will look up conspiracy and 
then they will know more about it than we do greene quipped 
poindexter former white house national security adviser is 
charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two 
counts of making false statements 
prosecutor dan webb said he has experience with dictionary 
requests from other trials he suggested the judge find out what 
word the jurors wanted to look up and then possibly send the 
definition to them 
if its a legal term it wouldnt be appropriate to give the 
definition since the judge already had instructed the jurors on 
the law webb suggested if its not a legal term it would be 
proper to illuminate the jurors he added 
greene agreed that a response of some kind should be sent the 
jurors saying i hate to tell them no go away dont 
bother me 
defense attorney richard beckler had no objection to the plan 
greene sent a note to the jurors asking them about the word 
ten minutes later laughter erupted in the courtroom as greene 
climbed to the bench and read the note from jurors which said 
thank you the definition we requested before is no longer 
needed 
poindexter who was national security adviser to former 
president reagan is accused of covering up oliver norths military 
assistance to the contra rebels in nicaragua and the us role in a 
november 1985 shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
the jurors were sequestered tuesday after news reporters 
contacted two jurors 
the eight women and four men are in the care of us marshals 
under a court order the marshals transport them between the 
federal courthouse and a hotel and provide them with meals and up 
to two alcoholic beverages a day

a college student was either out of her mind 
or lying attorneys told jurors who began deciding whether she 
should be imprisoned for life in the drowning of her newborn in a 
dormitory toilet 
if convicted of firstdegree murder 18yearold freshman claire 
moritt would be ineligible for parole until shes 43 under 
mandatory sentencing guidelines 
be certain you can live with it the rest of your life because 
claire moritt will defense attorney b anderson mitcham warned 
the jury before it began considering its 
the 12 jurors met for about three hours thursday and were 
sequestered for the night before resuming deliberations this 
morning 
a full day of closing arguments thursday focused on the defense 
argument that ms moritt was temporarily insane and had no memory 
of being pregnant or giving birth 
the excuse i dont remember may just be the biggest lie of 
all said assistant state attorney stephen crawford it keeps 
you from having to explain all the other inconsistencies in your 
story 
crawford recounted in detail the morning of oct 23 1989 when 
the hillsborough community college student from hollywood gave 
birth in her dorm room he claimed she made a conscious decision to 
kill her baby son 
using a chalkboard diagrams and a photograph of the dead 
6pound 9ounce infant crawford began by describing how a 
roommate awoke to the sounds of a baby crying 
its nothing im having my period go to bed was ms 
moritts explanation according to court testimony 
when ms moritt went into the bathroom and her roommate noticed 
blood on the floor and more crying sounds other friends gathered 
outside her door for nearly an hour asking her what was wrong 
her roommates were going to come in and find her she had to 
do something crawford told the jury 
when roommates finally did get inside the found ms moritt 
kneeling next to the toilet where later in the day they discovered 
the baby stuffed headfirst wrapped in bloody towels and sheets 
mitcham emphasized during his final arguments that nine 
psychiatrists and psychologists had testified ms moritt suffered 
from a dissociative disorder in which she mentally denied the 
existence of the pregnancy and the events surrounding it 
claire fits the dissociative disorder perfectly mitcham 
said noting that one expert even planned to use the case as an 
example in his medical school classes youre going to have to 
decide whether she knew what she was doing or not 
but prosecutor crawford blasted the defense psychiatrist and 
psychologist testimony as psychobabble saying that nobody can 
tell what was in a persons mind five or six months ago 
theres a difference between denying something and flatout 
lying crawford said adding that ms moritt variously explained 
her apparent pregnancy to her friends an ulcer tumor and ovarian 
cyst 
down through the ages criminals have tried to flee crawford 
said she attempted to flee not physically but mentally from 
the scene of the crime dont let her do it

an unemployed man described by 
police as confused sprayed rembrandts famous painting the night 
watch with an unidentified chemical today but museum officials 
said damage was minimal 
it was the second attack on the priceless art work in nearly 15 
years and the third this century 
dutch television said the spray was concentrated sulfuric acid 
but museum officials would not confirm the report 
immediately after the attack a museum guard applied a 
neutralizing agent and the damage to the 1642 masterpiece appeared 
limited to surface veneer rijksmuseum spokesman piet van thiel 
said 
museum guards seized the attacker and handed him over to police 
according to another museum spokesman frans van der avert the 
painting is guarded aroundtheclock by an unarmed security company 
worker 
police said they did not know what prompted the attack 
spokesman klaas wilting said the 31yearold suspect was a dutch 
national from the hague the capital of the netherlands the man 
was not identified by name in line with police policy and was being 
held on suspicion of vandalism 
he is confused and not telling us anything at the moment 
wilting said shortly after the attack 
barry olshen of toronto canada said he was standing among a 
group of museum visitors and right next to the man who was wearing 
a long hooded tan coat 
the vandal pushed his way through the crowd to a steel barrier 
about two yards in front of the painting 
suddenly he took a little spray pump he had been concealing in 
his hand and sprayed the painting olshen told the associated 
press 
the chemical dripped over an area of almost a square yard 
covering it in white splotches 
the damage doesnt seem to be too bad van thiel told 
reporters at the national museum he said the chemical failed to 
eat its way through the paintings veneer to the delicate paint 
layer 
immediately after the attack the guard slapped the bottle out 
of his hand and sprayed the painting with a benign chemical 
substance that is always there van thiel said 
he said the painting would be taken to a secret location for 
restoration but would probably be on display again in about two 
weeks 
van thiel said a new veneer layer would take several months to 
dry during which the painting would be kept behind glass to 
protect it from dust 
he said there were no plans to put the painting which yearly 
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world 
behind a protective shield 
the painting has been under permanent guard since 1979 when it 
was put back on diplay after a fouryear restoration period that 
followed a knife attack on sept 14 1975 
a dutch schoolmaster claiming to be on a divine mission made 
several deep slashes in the night watch he was never tried but 
committed to a mental asylum where he later committed suicide 
during world war i an unemployed shoemaker made several knife 
slashes in the art work to protest his inability to find work 
the night watch measures 12 feet by 145 feet and shows a

a north carolina woman told a senate panel 
today that her husband was so distraught from a lingering fight 
with the internal revenue service that he killed himself so she 
could use his insurance money to continue the battle 
the courts eventually ruled that kay council of high point 
nc owed nothing and ordered the irs to cancel a lien on her 
property however she told the senate finance oversight 
subcommittee she has spent 70000 in legal fees she had to sell 
her home her credit rating is stained and i was cheated of 
growing old with the man i love 
we just got caught up in the middle of a big irs screwup 
mrs council said and we couldnt get out of it 
mrs councils story highlighted a subcommittee hearing into how 
the irs is implementing the socalled taxpayer bill of rights a 
1988 law designed to protect taxpayers in disputes with the agency 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr who preceded mrs council 
to the witness stand was not asked about her story she has 
refused to sign a waiver of her privacy rights and the irs is thus 
prohibited from discussing the case 
on the whole goldberg said we are indeed making a great deal 
of progress in seeing that taxpayer rights are respected he 
acknowledged that mistakes are made and pleaded for tax 
simplification and a budget big enough to train the irss 120000 
employees 
what the american public resents is complexity uncertainty 
hassles with the irs that take month after month after month to 
resolve goldberg said 
questioned by sen david pryor dark the subcommittee 
chairman goldberg denied the irs has a quota system for rewarding 
collections officers or a bounty system for businesses that snitch 
on cheating competitors 
i think that is reprehensible goldberg said after pryor 
read a secondhand account from a businessman who reported 
attending a meeting in which an irs agent implied a lower tax bill 
for those who turned in cheats were not going to let it 
happen the commissioner said 
the councils problems with the irs began after their attempt to 
write off a 70000 taxshelter loss on their 1979 tax return was 
rejected mrs council said she and her husband had been prepared 
to pay the tax shortage resulting from that denial but that the 
irs never informed them of the deficiency 
in 1983 she said the irs sent a bill for 183021 taxes and 
interest but it was not until two years later that the notice of 
deficiency arrived four years late the agency was slow in 
admitting the mistake although it turned out that the original 
notice had been mailed to the wrong address 
after years of fighting in the courts mrs council said she 
came home one evening in june 1988 and found a note from her 
husband 
i have taken my life in order to provide capital for you 
its purely a business decision the note read you will find 
my body on the lot on the north side of the house 
mrs council pleaded with congress to control the irs to keep 
it from destroying peoples lives

the father of a 16yearold boy who died 
climbing mount hood says hell use part of a halfmilliondollar 
jury award to create a memorial fund for his son 
it isnt the money i wanted everyone to know those deaths 
were needless richard haeder said after a jury ruled the oregon 
episcopal school was negligent in his sons death 
but the same jury found no negligence by ralph summers the 
guide hired by the private school to help lead the illfated climb 
up oregons highest peak in may 1986 
haeders son richard was among nine who died on the climb 
including its leader the rev thomas goman summers was the only 
adult to survive along with three students 
neither summers nor oregon episcopal school officials would 
comment 
it was the first suit stemming from the tragedy to come to 
trial parents of at least five of the victims settled with the 
school out of court 
the multnomah county circuit court jury delivered the verdict 
shortly before 8 pm thursday following about 5 hours of 
deliberation 
haeder said that he and his wife judith hope the verdict will 
encourage safer climbing and prevent other parents from having to 
endure the anguish weve had to 
he declined to comment on the jurys decision not to find 
summers negligent 
his attorneys claimed during the trial that goman and summers 
forced the students up to near the summit of the 11235foot 
mountain despite bad weather and signs of hypothermia 
the party got lost in a blizzard as they retreated from the 
summit and were forced to dig a snow cave for shelter as the sun 
set 
the next morning summers and a student hiked to safety and 
notified authorities the snow cave wasnt marked however and it 
took two days of intensive searching to find the bodies of goman 
another adult and seven students 
two other students were found alive 
in closing arguments haeders attorney paul luvera reminded 
the jury that haeders son pleaded to return 
richie was crying he wanted to go back and they kept going 
luvera said and then he died a horrible painful death with 
people dying all around him in a tomb made of ice 
attorney mark wagner representing summers and the school said 
the storm that struck the mountain was three times stronger than 
had been predicted 
people died because a storm came in before our people got off 
the mountain he said in the real world accidents do happen 
and it doesnt mean people are negligent or at fault

communist party officials meeting in the troubled 
caucasus republic of armenia today replaced their party leader 
suren arutyunyan the tass news agency said 
arutyunyan was appointed in may 1988 after the first wave of 
ethnic violence between armenia and neighboring azerbaijan over 
control of the nagornokarabakh region 
but the violence only has gotten worse hundreds of people have 
been killed in the past two years and hundreds of thousands more 
have been forced to flee their homes 
tass said the central committee of the amenian communist party 
replaced arutyunyan at his own request so he could be transferred 
to other work it did not say what new job the former party leader 
would take up 
he was replaced by vm movsisyan a first deputy premier and 
head of the republics agriculturalindustrial complex 
arutyunyan was replaced a couple of months after the azerbaijan 
communist party chief abdulrakhman vezirov lost his job and was 
expelled from the party he was blamed for serious mistakes that 
led to bloodshed in the azerbaijan capital baku 
antiarmenian riots broke out in baku on jan 13 and soviet 
troops stormed into the city a week later by official count about 
200 people were killed 
vezirov and arutyunyan were picked to run their republics on the 
same day may 21 1988 but the party organizations in both 
republics have been criticized for failing to control the unrest 
and increasing calls for the two republics to gain more freedom or 
even leave the soviet union

about 1000 of the nations newspaper editors 
met here this week to talk shop and look over some political 
leaders footnotes from the meeting of the american society of 
newspaper editors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at a time of stagnant newspaper circulation editors worried 
about the challenge of producing a newspaper that simultaneously 
appeals to two groups loyal readers who like to read and are 
deeply interested in the world and the oftenyounger readers or 
nonreaders who grew up on television have little love of 
reading and chiefly want news that will affect their lives 
researcher kris mcgrath who helped write a report on how 
readers look at newspapers put the distinction this way 
in this nation of specialists the daily newspaper habit 
appears to be declining people speak of catching the news rather 
than keeping up with it the preferred way to catch the news 
often is while doing something else listening to the radio while 
driving or watching tv while exercising its hard to do something 
else while reading a newspaper other than drink a cup of coffee 
and coffee consumption is down too

housing secretary jack kemp former player for the professional 
buffalo bills football team former congressman and former 
candidate for the 1988 republican presidential nomination gave the 
editors a speech full of the usual kemp evangelism 
he was introduced as a bleedingheart conservative and in 
his speech used the term capitalism with a human face an 
editor accused kemp of benign plagiarism swiping the catchword of 
czechoslvakian communist reformers who were suppresed by soviet 
tanks in 1968 
said the editor you speak of capitalism with a human face 
that actually is a paraphrase of eurocommunism which was 
communism with a human face 
replied kemp im not troubled at all by phrases i can defend 
liberal democratic values in a republican convention so 
phrases dont bother me at all whether im a bleedingheart 
conservative or a progressive conservative or a jeffersonian 
democratic republican so im not afraid at all to say that i 
would support the idea of capitalism with a human face or a 
socially responsible capitalist economy

one of the meetings most dramatic moments occurred when leroy 
aarons senior vice president for news at the oakland calif 
tribune ended a report to the editors on the views of homosexual 
journalists by publicly revealing his own sexual orientation 
in a paragraph scribbled at the end of his typewritten text and 
read hurriedly in a choked voice aarons said 
i want you to know that the doing of this report has had 
tremendous impact on gay and lesbian journalists across the nation 
it has given them hope and new optimism it has enhanced their 
respect for this organization i as an editor and a gay man am 
proud of asne 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aarons reported that the 205 gay journalists who took part in a 
survey felt that coverage of gay and lesbian issues other than 
aids is at best mediocre 
he said newspapers failed to take advantage of the expertise 
that their homosexual staff members could provide 
we dont have to prime the supply pump to get gay and lesbian 
expertise on our staffs it is already there he said they 
may be hiding but they are there eager to be heard 
the point to emphasize here is the link between workplace 
issues and coverage a newsroom in which gay and lesbian staff 
people feel safe and accepted is one in which they will come 
forward and make their case on coverage a workplace is which gays 
and lesbians know they can aspire to management roles even though 
it is known they are gay will be one with enhanced sensitivity to 
these issues in our communities a newsroom where insulting remarks 
are forbidden also becomes a newsroom in which sensitive 
terminology is encoded and enforced

about 1500 gallons of a lightweight

and new jersey this morning closing it to traffic officials said 
the liquid naphtha has the consistency of lighter fluid and 
was expected to evaporate rapidly said lt cmdr paul milligan at 
coast guard headquarters on governors island ny 
it will probably dissipate quicker than we can get equipment 
to clean it up milligan said we may just let the environment 
handle itself just let it evaporate 
a threemile section of the arthur kill waterway was closed at 
645 am but reopened before noon 
reports indicated the spill was not harming two bird sanctuaries 
in the area milligan said 
the additive called naphtha spewed into the waterway when a 
gasket blew out as workers at the general american tank storage 
terminal in carteret pressurized pipelines in preparing to load a 
vessel 
apparently they had a bad seal and it blew out milligan 
said 
the waterway was hit jan 12 by a spill from a break in an 
exxon pipeline that leaked 567000 gallons of heating oil

families smoldered friday as rival christian forces battled for 
control of the district 
fighting in various sectors of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave killed 11 people and wounded 29 on friday police said 
the battle over the enclave a mere 10th of lebanon has killed 
866 people and wounded 2354 since it broke out jan 30 between 
army units under gen michel aoun and the lebanese forces militia 
run by samir geagea 
shells opened gaping holes in the residential buildings of 
ashrafiyeh a militia stronghold smoke billowed from apartments as 
explosions echoed across the city 
a 130mm howitzer shell fired by aouns gunners scored a direct 
hit on a militia ammunition depot in the karantina port district 
police said the area at the base of ashrafiyahs hills is near 
geageas shellshattered war council headquarters 
the hit ignited a huge fire and a chain of powerful explosions 
a cloud of smoke hung over the district 
thick smoke also billowed from the districts coastal strip 
controlled by geageas militiamen as well as from the wooded 
slopes of the aounheld metn province northeast of the capital 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with

a government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
stressed that the government will not send its troops into the 
enclave to become a party to the present conflict

carriage was stabbed in the back friday by an arab in jerusalems 
old city police said in the gaza strip soldiers shot to death a 
palestinian teenager hospital officials said

hospitalized in fair condition 
robbins told police he was walking to the grocery store when he 
was attacked the bearded robbins was wearing a jewish skullcap 
when attacked

pistol and fired three times in the air to summon police

assaulted police said the stroller overturned but the child was 
unhurt 
robbins is a seminary student who lives with a small community 
of jews in the moslem quarter jewish efforts to buy property and 
move into the quarter have created tensions in the area 
police at the scene said the attacker was a palestinian and the 
assault apparently was politically motivated 
police briefly closed the gates to the old city and israel army 
radio said more than 170 palestinians were detained for questioning 
robbins complained on israel radio that no one tried to stop the 
assailant 
they saw him they saw him very well but nobody tried to

soviet border guards today refused sen 
alfonse damato entry into lithuania which has been locked in a 
war of wills with the kremlin since the baltic republic declared 
independence 
after being turned away at the small border crossing in 
northeast poland damato denounced what he called the soviet 
unions psychological warfare on lithuania whose parliament 
approved the independence declaration march 11 
damato wanted to enter lithuania on a lithuanian visa to 
demonstrate what he called congresss solidarity with the republic 
instead the new york republican who was invited to the capital of 
vilnius by lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis was 
instructed to apply for a soviet visa at a consulate 
the sooner the united states wakes up to what is taking place 
and becomes realistic the better damato told reporters at the 
border crossing 
mr gorbachev says one thing and does another he talks about 
freedom and yet denies access to a free country that is wrong 
damato flew to poland on thursday planning to challenge the 
soviet land blockade of lithuania 
accompanied by lithuanias foreign minister algrinas saudragis 
damato and a half dozen aides traveled by chartered bus the 200 
miles from warsaw to ogrodniki lithuanias only direct border 
opening to the outside world 
they arrived at the crossing on a country road around 2 pm 
today and polish soldiers let them pass the first barrier on the 
polish side 
but another 100 yards down the road they came to a redandwhite 
barrier marking the lithuanian frontier and guarded by soviet kgb 
troops 
through an interpreter speaking lithuanian damato asked soviet 
maj vitas buchis for permission to enter the country buchis a 
native lithuanian serving in the soviet border force said he had 
to check by telephone with moscow 
after returning buchis told damato that passage was forbidden 
i am sorry but rules are rules i am just following orders he 
said 
saudragis then crossed into lithuania alone 
extending his arm to damatos across the frontier saudragis 
said we shake hands over this border that divides us but your 
support is strengthening our spirit 
he also thanked the united states for never recognizing the 
forced incorporation of lithuania into the soviet union in 1940 
the soviet government since tuesday has closed the ogrodniki 
crossing to most traffic permitting only polish and soviet 
citizens to use it to return home 
even in normal times citizens of other countries are not 
allowed to pass the pair of wooden gates on the narrow rural road 
the main international crossing between poland and the soviet union 
is about 95 miles to the south at brest in the soviet byelorussian 
republic 
on thursday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of 
damatos trip were always concerned about members of congress 
and others getting too involved in foreign policy but on the other 
hand he is a senator who has an important message to deliver he 
represents a broad constituency and has every right to make that 
trip and deliver his message 
congressmen including damato have been urging president bush 
to give lithuania more support some us politicians have 
suggested sanctions if force is used against the republic 
damato is the junior republican on the senate intelligence 
committee and also serves on the appropriations subcomittee on 
foreign operations he is not considered one of the senates 
leading voices on foreign relations 
before he left wednesday damato tried to deflect suggestions 
that the trip was designed to counteract problems at home 
damatos public opinion ratings have slipped dramatically since 
the senate ethics committee began looking into allegations he used 
his influence to steer federal housing and urban development money 
to friends and political supporters 
now if every time i do something thats not associated with 
hud youre going to say oh youre doing that because its not 
associated with hud thats silly he told reporters wednesday

sending scores of mostly elderly residents running into the street 
officials said 
fifteen people were unaccountedfor after the 3 am fire at the 
fontana hotel was brought under control in about five hours said 
assistant fire chief john reed the hotel is on famed collins 
avenue north of the beachs trendy art deco district 
it was incredible said one resident joe marcello who 
jumped to safety from a secondfloor window flames were shooting 
40 feet in the air 
mayor alex daoud said the intensity of the threealarm fire led 
investigators to suspect arson but fire officials said the report 
was speculative 
we have all the fire units of the city of miami beach working 
on the fire attempting to get it under control police detective 
jim hyde said earlier this is definitely the worst ive seen 
up to 200 residents of the threestory fontana hotel and 175 to 
200 in the adjacent prince michael hotel which was threatened for 
a time were evacuated police said 
by early afternoon authorities were conducting a roomtoroom 
search of the burned building and checking crowds outside the 
hotel hospitals and a community center to narrow the list of 
missing tenants 
residents said the fire broke out near the elevator shaft in the 
front of the fontana and hyde said the two bodies were found in 
the lobby area he put the number of people injured at 18 
theyre not able to get inside yet itll be all gone 
police sgt jim scarberry said three hours into the fire 
many of the residents were elderly and infirm according to 
myrtle jackson 35 a yearly tenant on the second floor of the 
fontana she said she escaped out the back door after the 
buildings managers ran through the hallways knocking on doors 
ms jackson said the smoke was too thick and there was no chance 
to help anyone else no time to be a hero tonight 
marcello her roommate said he heard his smoke alarm which was 
installed to comply with a city ordinance requiring an electronic 
alarm in every hotel room 
but he said he didnt realize the situation was serious until 
olimpia mihai one of the ownermanagers started knocking on 
doors by the time he gathered his passport and other papers he 
said the hallway was too smoky to risk escape down the stairs 
i started panicking i ran back to my room and knocked the 
window out and just jumped down said marcello 32 when i dove 
out the building there were four cars engulfed in flames 
he said another secondfloor resident broke her window dropped 
her baby to a man on the ground and jumped out herself 
about five hours after the blaze began the buildings roof had 
collapsed and burning cinders showered down from the remnants of 
the roof 
smoke arched hundreds of feet in the early morning sky 
partially obscuring oceanfront condominiums 
longtime residents said the hotel housed between 100 and 200 
residents most of whom rented by the week month or year a few 
vacationers also were believed in the building when the fire broke 
out the american red cross was busing scores of residents to a 
nearby shelter 
spokeswomen at st francis mount sinai and south shore 
hospitals said 18 people were taken to their emergency rooms and 
four were expected to be admitted many were suffering from burns 
and smoke inhalation 
i have all people who have lost everything in the fire 
including their medication so were treating them for whatever 
there individual needs are said south shore emergency room

attorney general jim mattox who has been 
harassing his democratic runoff opponent with claims she used 
drugs today flatly denied claims by two men that they saw him 
smoking marijuana in the 1970s 
mattox the attorney general vigorously denied reports today in 
dallas and houston newspapers 
ill tell them that they are liars to their faces he said 
at a news conference 
mattox has criticized election opponent ann richards for 
refusing to answer yes or no when asked if she ever used an illegal 
drug and has accused her of smoking marijuana in the 1970s he 
said he was willing to take a lie detector test to dispute the 
allegations about him 
i will he said and i want you to get ms richards 
strapped in beside me when we do it 
houston lawyer jim sharp and former dallas police officer edward 
h lowe signed affidavits that they saw mattox smoke marijuana on 
separate occasions 
lowe said he saw mattox smoke marijuana in a dallas apartment 
during an undercover investigation in the early 1970s when mattox 
was a dallas lawyer he said he didnt arrest mattox because he was 
investigating a separate matter 
sharp said mattox and he shared a marijuana cigarette in 1974 
while in a car after the democratic state convention in austin 
ive never used any marijuana or dangerous drugs period 
mattox said about the accusations which sharp and lowe made in the 
houston chronicle and the dallas morning news 
the incidents the two men described absolutely did not take 
place mattox said today 
ive never been in a car where there has ever been any 
marijuana smoked by me or anybody else mattox said 
the drug use issue first was presented at a debate before the 
march 13 primary mattox and former gov mark white denied ever 
using illegal drugs but ms richards the state treasurer refused 
to answer the question 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic later said she has not had 
an alcoholic drink or a moodaltering chemical since leaving an 
alcohol recovery program in 1980 
the issue has dominated the democratic campaign particularly 
since the primary that vaulted mattox and ms richards into the 
runoff mattox has said a former drug user could not effectively 
lead the states efforts to end illegal drug use 
ms richards has not accused mattox of drug use 
earlier this week mattox said he had affidavits signed by 
people who saw ms richards use drugs in the 1970s but he has 
refused to release the documents citing the confidentiality of the 
people who made the allegations 
on thursday the houston post quoted a woman it didnt identify 
as saying she had seen ms richards in a restroom with other women 
who appeared to be smoking marijuana at an austin convention in 
1979 
the dallas morning news in todays editions said the same 
woman confirmed her allegation in a polygraph examination paid for 
by the paper 
i have no idea what theyre talking about ms richards said

police opened fire on 200000 
prodemocracy demonstrators marching toward the royal palace today 
and at least 35 people were killed witnesses said 
at least nine more people were killed in clashes with police 
during similar demonstrations in other parts of the country 
witnesses said 
the violence occurred immediately after king birendra dismissed 
the government and promised talks with prodemocracy activists 
opposition leaders rejected the offer and vowed to continue 
their nearly 2monthold struggle for a multiparty political system 
in katmandu the capital bands of angry protesters calling for 
greater democracy in this himalayan monarchy tried to set fire to 
government buildings and the houses of politicians loyal to king 
birendra 
gunshots and automatic weapons fire echoed throughout the city 
at sundown the city was plunged into darkness as an 
oppositionplanned blackout took effect clouds of tear gas fogged 
the streets 
soldiers holding automatic weapons were seen patrolling in 
trucks and on foot 
the mostly deserted streets were littered with bricks shoes and 
slipper and there were piles of burning tires 
in washington the state department urged nepal to restore calm 
without further violence the us government deplores the deaths 
which have occurred and the violence which has taken place said 
spokesman mark dillon 
the united states urgently calls on the government of nepal to 
exercise restraint in restoring order dillon said as a step 
toward this goal we urge that a dialogue with opposition leaders 
begin immediately 
witnesses said police first shot tear gas and beat demonstrators 
with sticks when they came within 500 yards of the royal palace 
the protesters were waving flags and chanting antigovernment 
slogans 
when that failed to turn back the protesters police opened 
fire one witness said he saw at least 200 demonstrators fall to 
the ground but accounts of the number of casualties varied 
another witness speaking from a hotel in the citys center 
said he saw 35 corpses at bir hospital the citys largest 
there are hundreds more wounded its a bloody mess said 
the witness speaking on condition of anonymity 
a doctor at bir hospital who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a british man was among the dead he also said 
another british man and a dutch man were among the wounded their 
identities were not released pending notification of relatives 
there was no immediate word on american casualties 
doctors at bir hospital and at the teaching hospital said they 
had a total of 9 bodies and 150 wounded people but they charged 
that soldiers had been carting away corpses from the city 
bodies were in taken trucks for disposal by the army said 
the doctor at bir hospital at least 200 to 300 people must have 
died 
another witness contacted by telephone said that he saw 30 young 
men gunned down as he watched the demonstration from a hotel window 
the people were unarmed and the government just started 
shooting he said a whole line of demonstrators fell 
he said security forces carried away some of the wounded but 
others were left lying in the street 
a western diplomat contacted by phone from new delhi said 
exact casualty figures were difficult to confirm but theres 
been lots of bloodshed he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
in the town of butwal 120 miles west of katmandu witnesses 
said security forces killed seven people and wounded scores two 
others were killed in clashes in pokhara 160 miles northwest of 
the capital other witnesses said 
witnesses speaking from janakpur said police fired on crowds in 
that city but there were no reports of casualties 
king birendra said on staterun radio today that a new 
government will be formed by lokendra bahadur chand a former prime 
minister regarded as more moderate toward political opposition than 
former prime minister marich man singh shrestha 
prior to todays violence at least 16 people had been killed in 
clashes between demonstrators and the police since the banned 
nepali congress party and a coalition of leftwing groups began the 
protests on feb 18 
hundreds of people have been arrested and human rights 
activists have charged that many detainees have been tortured 
birenda said shresthas government had failed to maintain law 
and order during the 47dayold campaign for multiparty democracy 
and he promised that the new government would consult people 
holding different political views 
the king also said committees would be formed to make 
recommendations on constitutional reforms and investigate 
accusations of police abuses against the demonstrators 
major opposition leaders rejected the offer and vowed to 
intensify protests by the prodemocracy movement 
the royal proclamation has given a slap in the face to the 
countrywide call for democracy the leader of the nepali congress 
party ganesh man singh said in a statement from his hospital bed 
the peoples demands can only be reflected in a multiparty 
system singh said hollow consolations of reforms made in the 
royal proclamation can not deter the peoples aspirations 
therefore the peoples movement will be carried on with even 
greater intensity and even more extensively 
singh has been under house arrest since the prodemocracy 
campaign was launched by his nepali congress and a coalition of 
leftwing groups 
radha krishna mainali a leader of the united left front also 
said the kings response was inadequate 
the royal proclamation has not fulfilled the demands of the 
people mainali said in a written statement instead of 
preparing a new constitution to pave the way for a multiparty 
system there is talk including reforms within the previous 
constitution which is unacceptable 
the protesters are demanding the withdrawal of a 1961 royal 
decree banning political parties and separate platforms in the 
rashtriya panchayat or national assembly 
power in nepal is technically shared between the assembly and 
the king but the monarch nominates onefifth of the assemblys 140 
members and according to political observers approves the 
nominations of others standing for election 
nepals twoyear experiment with a westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra birendras father dismissed the 
government of the nepali congress party accusing it of corruption 
and inept administration

thousands of cambodian guerrillas 
launched major attacks friday in a bid to recapture territory 
seized by government forces in recent weeks senior guerrilla 
officials said 
a spokesman for the khmer peoples national liberation front 
said the guerrillas seized don noi late friday as the 
counteroffensive got under way 
we have launched a large scale counteroffensive involving all 
our forces said ok serei sopheak a senior official of the 
national liberation front he said the objective was not only to 
recapture lost territory but to take sisophon a major town in 
western cambodia 
the front is one of three guerrilla groups allied in a loose 
coalition to fight the vietnambacked government in cambodia 
others in the coalition are the communist khmer rouge and 
followers of the former cambodian head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk 
the noncommunist national liberation front is reeling from 
government attacks in which it lost much of 2000 square miles of 
territory it had held since last fall 
the embattled territory is in western cambodia near the thai 
frontier where the guerrilla coalition has most of its bases 
the latest blow to the guerrillas occurred tuesday when 
government troops retook the district capital of thmar puok this 
town along with kok mon sisophon and don noi appear to be the 
prime targets of the guerrilla counteroffensive 
we will show the world that we are still strong ok serei 
sopheak said he said new shipments of ammunition from china in 
recent days had given the guerrillas the means to retake the lost 
ground 
thousands of civilians have fled into forests and other areas in 
recent days to avoid the fighting 
the 11yearlong cambodian war has taken the lives of thousands 
of civilians 
western analysts at aranyaprathet a key thai border town said 
it appeared the guerrillas had bounced back from recent 
defeats but it remained to be seen whether they were disciplined 
and strong enough to hold territory 
the guerrillas claim vietnam has sent back several thousand 
troops to bolster the phnom penh side and that this had largely 
accounted for the guerrillas recent defeats 
vietnam claimed all its forces had withdrawn from cambodia in 
september and it denys any soldiers have returned 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to oust the khmer rouge 
and set up a prohanoi government in phnom penh 
the guerrillas and independent analysts say the monsoon season 
which gets under way at the end of april will probably give the 
guerrillas a major advantage the government employs tanks and 
large artillery pieces which will be difficult to move over 
rainsoaked areas

for the third time in less than a year 
greece is holding an election aimed at breaking a deadlock that 
left temporary coalitions running the country since the 
scandalridden socialists were thrown out 
opinion polls indicate sundays parliamentary election will fail 
to produce a oneparty government resulting in another coalition 
administration with small parties in a powerbrokers role 
frustration has led to violence leftist terrorists calling for 
an election boycott have set off scores of bombs and clashes have 
erupted between conservatives and socialists 
the leading conservative new democracy party led by constantine 
mitsotakis is hoping that this time around it will win an absolute 
majority in the 300member unicameral parliament it came close in 
june and november elections 
the conservatives won 146 seats in june and improved to 148 
places in november three short of a majority the panhellenic 
socialist movement pasok of former prime minister andreas 
papandreou was a close second

left and progress teamed up after the june vote which ousted 
papandreou after eight years in office 
the shortlived alliance with mitsotakis as prime minister 
presided over the indictment of papandreou and some of his 
ministers for alleged involvement in financial scandals and illegal 
wiretapping of political opponents no trial date has been set 
in november another alliance comprised of the conservatives 
socialists and communistdominated coalition collapsed in february 
after it was unable to confront growing economic problems or stem a 
resurgence of urban terrorism 
prime minister xenophon zolotas 86 a former governor of the 
bank of greece remains caretaker until a new government is chosen 
the country faces 17 percent inflation and a 15 billion budget 
deficit the european community has said greece is in danger of 
bankruptcy and the ec will not bail it out because greece violated 
austerity requirements of a 1985 loan 
papandreou 71 has failed to clarify his partys platform 
promising only stability and progress mitsotakis also 71 pledges 
private investment in the ailing economy which would create 100000 
new jobs 
conservatives and socialists disagree over us bases new 
democracy says the bases and nato membership are essential for 
defense while the socialists say any future bases agreement should 
be put to a referendum 
coalition leaders offered nothing new in their party platform 
renewing their often repeated pledge to protect workers rights 
in novembers election the conservatives got 4619 percent of 
the vote the socialists received 4068 percent for 128 seats and 
the coalition dropped to 1097 percent and 21 seats the

will more or less be the same as in the previous vote 
i see all parties falling slightly but the coalition could 
fall a little more because of protest votes that may go to the 
environmentalistalternative party or blank ballots said 
dimitras 
he said that if the environmentalistalternative party which 
won one seat in the last election gains one or two more seats 
they could also become the key to power 
the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe and social 
reforms in the soviet union could also have a negative effect on 
the left 
campaigning was lowkey with more debates and interviews on 
nationwide television than in past elections gone were the many 
colorful fiestas and fireworks where each major party drew tens of 
thousands of supporters at outdoor rallies 
urban terrorist groups claimed responsibility for scores of 
bombings in an attempt to intimidate the countrys 8 million voters 
the revolutionary popular struggle underground guerrilla 
organization called on voters to boycott the election describing 
it as a political farce 
some minor clashes occurred between conservative and socialist 
supporters in various parts of the country one clash in iraklion 
crete resulted in the shooting death of a socialist follower and 
the wounding of four other people including a journalist and 
member of the conservative party

you may not be able to get borscht as fast 
as you could a big mac at red square but some customers at the 
first sovietamerican fastfood eatery in this country just love 
the piroshkis 
others are wondering wheres the beef 
i had to come and try it said robert foxhall of chesapeake 
i always try to eat a different variety of food this is 
wonderful ethnic fare 
foxhall left the stand at the waterside festival marketplace 
with a dozen piroshkis which look like elongated egg rolls for 
coworkers at his office 
danny crocker of norfolk found the piroshkis a bit greasy but 
so are french fries and i love french fries 
in january mcdonalds opened its first franchise in the soviet 
union and is serving up to 50000 people a day the restaurant 
here named piroshkis a joint venture between soviet and american 
investors opened this week on the norfolk waterfront 
the soviet partner is tomakkiev mark aynbinder a soviet 
emigre and president of the american partners described the 
company as the largest soviet manufacturer of food processing 
equipment 
local officials and aynbinder say the jointventure is the first 
of its kind in the united states between investors from the two 
countries in recent memory the us department of commerce said 
they had no records to indicate otherwise 
the eatery was established in norfolk partly because sailors 
from soviet navy ships that visited last summer got a warm welcome 
from the community also aynbinder initiated contacts with friends 
in the ukrainian city of kiev that got the venture off the ground 
piroshkis takes its name from the staple finger food of the 
soviet union it is a pastry stuffed with potatoes and mushrooms 
or beef and rice or jam or beef and fish and deep fried 
the restaurant also offers russian pancakes russian donuts 
russian coffee and russian tea 
ellen landrum of norfolk said she came to try the fare out of 
curiosity 
well there wasnt enough beef in the piroshki but the 
pancakes are good and the tea is wonderful she said 
she said the service tended to follow a russian stereotype it 
was a little bit slow and i thought i had to wait longer than i 
ought she said 
the 600squarefoot stall is on one end of a food court where 
vendors also sell seafood gourmet coffee ice cream barbecue 
hamburgers and chinese filipino mexican and italian dishes 
piroshkis had more than its share of customers 
ew michaels of norfolk polished off four piroshkis and 
announced himself satisfied one of the nice things about this 
country is that we have a touch of everything he said ill 
never get to russia its nice to know about other things other 
people 
the russian accents behind the counter piqued the curiosity of 
many customers several russian technicians minded the piroshki 
pancake and donutmaking equipment the soviet investors provided 
the equipment the americans market the franchise and the 
equipment the technicians are here to train american employees 
luba and igor stefnek waited on customers and fielded as many 
questions about russian lifestyle as they did orders 
not all the customers gave glowing reviews fouryearold janae 
smith of portsmouth made a sour face after she ate a beef and rice 
piroshki her mother della smith said janae was not big on 
anything new 
asked to compare russian fast food to american customers at the 
new restaurant were divided 
ms landrum and foxhall said they stay away from american fast 
food but would return to piroshkis but janae was adamantly a 
mcdonalds fan 
crocker said he too would return but hamburgers are still 
number one when i visited friends in germany i had to go looking 
for a hamburger after three weeks a man has to have his 
hamburger

west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher called friday for a new atlantic partnership of north 
american and european democracies to forge one europe from the 
atlantic to the urals 
it would involve the united states in the building of the 
common european house genscher said in a speech to the american 
society of newspaper editors 
speaking in english genscher said we dont want germany to 
pursue unity alone we dont want the country to be neutralized but 
to be tied to europes fate 
in an interview conducted in german after the speech the 
foreign minister was asked about secretary of state james a baker 
iiis announcement that the soviet union is dropping its demand 
that a reunified germany be neutralized 
baker who has been meeting with soviet foreign minister 
shevardnadze said the soviets continue to resist the inclusion of 
a united germany in the north atlantic alliance 
genscher was asked whether bakers statement enhanced the 
likelihood of a single germany becoming a member of nato 
he said he thought it was premature to assess the ussoviet 
talks but that what he had heard so far confirms the impression 
he received last month when he met with shevardnadze in windhoek 
namibia 
he said his impression was that the soviet union is taking a 
constructive position or attitude both toward the building of a 
future europe and also to german reunificiation which they 
view as a lawabiding procedure 
in his speech genscher said i call upon the north american 
democracies and the members of the european community to issue a 
joint declaration heralding a new atlantic partnership a 
declaration encompassing all the political economic technological 
and cultural aspects of our relationship and capable of meeting the 
challenges confronting mankind 
that would not only be beneficial to the members of the 
european community and the north atlantic democracies it would 
also enhance world stability and be an asset to all nations in 
europe for such a futureoriented transatlantic partnership would 
help to overcome the division of europe and to create one europe 
from the atlantic to the urals he said 
genscher said it makes a lot of sense for president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to meet even if that 
happens before an arms control agreement is reached 
in a very rapidly changing world direct talks between the two 
superpowers are of decisive importance said genscher 
bush on thursday scheduled his second summit with gorbachev for 
may 30 to june 3 
genscher said the bushgorbachev summit in malta last year has 
greatly contributed to the improvement of eastwest relations and 
i am assuming that this will also be the case for the next summit 
conference 
he said such a meeting could help pave the way for a meeting of 
the 35 signatories of the helsinki pact which he hopes will be 
held in november and approve german reunification

defenseless for almost 18 months gen 
james e oglethorpe will soon get another sword this time city 
leaders want one that cant be easily stolen from the statue of 
georgias founding father 
vandals are believed responsible for the disappearance of the 
original sword from the statue in 1988 
the citys purchasing department is about to begin legal 
advertising for bids to cast a 3foot10inch replacement nearly 
6000 has been set aside for the project 
it will probably take 90 days to get the bid awarded said 
billy jones streets and drainage director for the city and 
supervisor of the replacement project 
to prevent another theft the bid specifications say the 
material attaching the sword to the statue should be stronger than 
the blade material meaning a vandal would have to break the sword 
to remove it 
the statue at chippewa square was sculpted in 1910 by daniel 
chester french who also did the lincoln statue in the lincoln 
memorial park and tree director don gardner said the city is 
looking at worldclass bronze casters including moreland studios 
of new jersey which handled the renovation of the statue of 
liberty 
if its good enough for the statue of liberty its good 
enough for us gardner said

seven members of a house armed services 
subcommittee will travel to east asia to consider alternatives to 
us military bases in the philippines the panel said friday 
the delegation from the subcommittee on military installations 
and facilities leaves saturday for hawaii guam thailand and 
indonesia for a 10day trip 
the trip also includes an examination of us security 
responsibilities in the region and the lawmakers plan to visit 
vietnam and cambodia to assess the extent to the which the soviet 
union has reduced its forces at cam rahn bay 
the united states and the philippines are scheduled to begin 
negotiations on two us facilities in the philippines clark air 
base and subic bay naval base 
philippine officials have criticized the current arrangement and 
urged president corazon aquino to end the us rights earlier this 
year mrs aquino refused to meet with defense secretary dick 
cheney who visited the philippines as part of an asian trip 
with reduced eastwest tensions and an increased american 
debt it may be time to pack up and leave the philippines said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the subcommittee 
on this mission we hope to find out whether the impact of 
such a departure can be minimized 
schroeder said that some in the philippines are demanding that 
the united states pay 2 billion a year in rent for the bases 
nearly the amount that the citizens of colorado pay in state 
taxes 
in addition to schroeder the delegation includes reps david

in one vision of 21stcentury detroit people 
would be able to ride cable cars across the detroit river to 
windsor ontario or stroll to work through enclosed skywalks 
the plan unveiled wednesday would turn empty shops to fancy 
apartments extend an elevated rail system and reclaim blighted 
neighborhoods 
weve got a lot of lofty ideas in there but how you carry 
them out is another question said city planner harold smith 
mayor coleman a youngs planning department and the city 
planning commission have traded drafts on a master plan since 1973 
only agreeing on the latest 
the plan would relocate residents of largely abandoned 
neighborhoods and raze buildings so the land could be offered to 
developers it also calls for creating jobs by helping steel 
industries and reestablishing detroit as a recording industry 
center 
planners also envision a fashion district much like new yorks 
seventh avenue along detroits seven mile road reviving of a 
former avenue of fashion 
smith said most of the ideas depend on finding developers and 
money

the soviet union today withdrew its demand 
that a reunified germany be neutral and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze predicted very important documents will be signed 
at next months superpower summit 
but shevardnadze and the white house acknowledged it may not be 
possible to resolve all major provisions of a new treaty to reduce 
longrange nuclear weapons before the arrival of president mikhail 
s gorbachev on may 30 
there are very technical issues that need to be resolved 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of the strategic arms 
reduction treaty that would cut the most dangerous us and soviet 
nuclear arms 
shevardnadze predicted a wide range of agreements at bushs 
washington summit with gorbachev but he too cautioned that it 
will take an additional effort to settle on ways to cut 
longrange nuclear missiles in time to be initialed by the two 
leaders at the summit 
also soviet actions in breakaway lithuania continued to mar the 
ussoviet relationship fitzwater said the superpower 
relationship is at stake in this matter 
shevardnadze took a conciliatory stance on issues surrounding 
the unification of east germany a soviet ally with west germany 
the linchpin in europe of the north atlantic treaty organization 
we have to look for a solution a solution that would be 
acceptable to both nato and the warsaw pact shevardnadze said 
he could not provide a specific blueprint he said but added it 
is possible we will be able to find a mutally acceptable solution 
earlier secretary of state james a baker iii said the soviets 
had eased off their demand that the merged germany be neutral but 
continued to object to its membership in nato 
this summit certainly will become a major event in world 
affairs shevardnadze told reporters the two presidents will 
sign very important documents 
fitzwater said bush had underscored to shevardnadze that the 
united states did not recognize the soviets incorporation of 
lithuania in 1940 and that the kremlin should not take actions to 
block the baltic republics assertion of independence 
the foreign minister delivered a letter to bush from gorbachev 
that dealt with arms control fitzwater said declining to provide 
any details 
he called the twohour session cordial and productive 
shevardnadze standing under an umbrella in a rainswept 
driveway told reporters agreements in preparation deal with arms 
control trade relations cooperation in science and space 
shevardnadze said we have a clear conscience on lithuania 
defending moscows tactics in dealing with the independence 
movement he said it was important to maintain order in the midst 
of possible interethnic clashes 
shevardnadze said the soviets were willing to implement an 
agreement for direct flights of jewish refugees to israel provided 
israel gave assurances they would not be settled in the occupied 
territories 
on thursday night a soviet official specified that means east 
jerusalem as well as the west bank and gaza 
shevardnadze also held out the prospect of resuming normal 
diplomatic ties with israel after a 23year lapse depending on 
the overall middle east situation 
the soviets have consistently demanded that israel hold 
negotiations to create a palestinian state and relinquish all the 
land the arabs lost in the 1967 sixday war that would include the 
west bank gaza east jerusalem and the golan heights 
shevardnadzes white house session with bush ran twice as long 
as initially planned this talk was not only rather lengthy but 
also rather substantive shevardnadze said 
baker said earlier that shevardnadze had not agreed to the 
proposal for direct emigre flights to israel but the soviet 
official did say that they would be willing to give it some 
consideration baker said 
on the subject of german reunification baker said he believes 
the soviets have concluded that a neutral country is not the best 
route to go 
a unified germany as part of nato presented a problem to 
them said baker who has been meeting with his soviet 
counterpart since wednesday 
we were equally firm in our view that the unified germany must 
remain a member of nato and that that would indeed provide 
stability which is after all one of the major results that we 
all seek from the unification of germany baker said 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has proposed 
keeping nato troops from entering what is now east germany even 
though the merged country is part of the western alliance 
genscher told reporters after an address to the american society 
of newspaper editors what i have heard so far confirms the 
impression of my talks with foreign minister shevardnadze in 
windhoek namely that the soviet union is taking a constructive 
position or attitude both toward the building of a future europe 
and also to german unification which they view as a 
lawabiding process genscher and sheverdnadaze met in windhoek 
namibia last month 
despite some tough soviet actions in the baltics bush on 
thursday scheduled his second summit with gorbachev for may 30 to 
june 3 fitzwater said the president would express his concerns 
forcefully and directly to the soviet leader 
baker said shevardnadze has been consistent throughout the talks 
in declaring that the preferred soviet approach to the independence 
crisis in lithuania is dialogue and that they would like to see 
this resolved through peaceful means and that they rejected the 
concept of use of force 
bush said thursday that the summit would provide time for a 
lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion 
officials acknowledged that in the weeks remaining until may 30 
it will be difficult to forge agreements across the board of 
ussoviet relations 
the bushgorbachev meeting had been expected to be held in late 
june the earlier date shortened the time left to find ways to 
assist the sluggish soviet economy 
the soviets must enact a law guaranteeing a right to emigrate 
and negotiators must complete a new trade agreement for moscow to 
qualify for us trade concessions us officials said this still 
could be done by the time gorbachev comes to washington

the chairman of the pepper commisssion 
defended on friday its refusal to include recommendations on how to 
pay the estimated 23 billion cost to provide health insurance for 
all americans 
we did not name taxes sen john d rockefeller iv told a 
hearing of the senate labor and human resources committee i 
think had we named taxes we would have come into the same 
criticism 
he said the commission had in fact accomplished a great deal 
by putting a total price tag on its proposals 666 billion 
rockefeller said the group had narrowed the range of taxes that 
could be used by establishing the financing would have to be 
progressive meaning the payment would grow with income and that 
all age groups would have to pay 
we think we bit the bullet said the west virginia democrat 
adding that congress and the white house can easily raise the taxes 
for the plan when they decide what they want to do 
committee chairman edward m kennedy said that the bipartisan 
commission formed in 1988 was only supposed to outline health 
policy and not substitute itself for the finance and ways and 
means committees 
rockefeller had said last month when the commissions report was 
released that the taxwriting committees would have to come up with 
the financing criticism of a lack of a financing plan came from 
within the commission as well as outside it 
fridays hearing held in cooperation with the senate finance 
committee dwelled on the health insurance component 
the other major component deals with longterm care for all 
americans 
rockefeller said the commission found that 32 million americans 
lack health insurance and that onequarter of the uninsured are 
children threequarters of the uninsured are workers and their 
families with the majority working in small firms rockefeller 
said 
the commission named after the late rep claude pepper of 
florida recommended a jobsbased universal health insurance plan 
because most insurance coverage already is provided through 
employers the plan calls for full coverage for everyone within 
five years 
employers would either have to provide insurance or contribute 
to a public plan 
fridays hearing was the first in a series of hearings on how to 
develop and speed up passage of legislation to provide 
comprehensive health care

the head of east germanys secondlargest 
party on friday said the dominant party has remained vague on 
policy jeopardizing hopes of forming the countrys first 
noncommunist government before easter 
markus meckel acting chairman of the social democratic party 
said the christian democratic union still had not presented a 
single position paper on unification with west germany 
the christian democratic union which heads the alliance for 
germany has been trying to form a government since elections march 
18 the alliance favors speedy unification while the social 
democrats want a more gradual process to ease the country out of 40 
years of communist rule 
meckel said the country needs a government as soon as 
possible but i doubt that it can really happen before easter 
when he agreed to formal talks tuesday he said a government could 
be formed before the april 15 holiday 
the top christian democrat responded by saying his party would 
be able to form a coalition government even without the social 
democrats 
we can also govern without the spd said party 
generalsecretary martin kirchner 
lothar de maiziere head of the christian democratic union was 
asked thursday during the inaugural session of the new parliament 
to try to form a government by next week 
the 400member parliament convenes again thursday if de 
maiziere is successful in his efforts by then the legislature will 
vote in the new government 
the alliance which also includes democratic awakening and the 
german social union needs the support of the social democrats for 
a twothirds parliamentary majority required to push through laws 
that would speed unification 
the alliance however can also form a government with the help 
of a liberal alliance which has given its tentative agreement to 
join in a broad coalition 
the social democrats have had serious ideological differences 
with the alliances german social union according to east 
germanys adn news agency those two parties were able to clear 
away some of their differences in a latenight meeting 
adn quoted meckel as saying there are still differing views 
between the two parties but no obstacles that cant be 
overcome 
in west germany on friday chancellor helmut kohl promised that 
his countrymen will not face a tax increase to finance the heavy 
costs of german unification 
a tax increase would unnecessarily brake the economic upswing 
and have a counterproductive effect kohl said in a speech in 
the west german city of ludwigshafen

a retailers group said friday it will fight key 
business reforms japan promised the united states to alter the 
nations trade imbalance and a consumer group disputed claims the 
changes would help them 
prime minister toshiki kaifu in a televised appearance asked 
japanese for understanding and cooperation he said the 
economic changes could in some cases be painful but he 
promised they would lead to a better quality of life for the 
japanese people 
under an agreement reached thursday in washington japan 
promised to address wideranging structural barriers to trade the 
most controversial point of the package would revise a japanese law 
that protects small retailers by restricting the opening of larger 
stores 
the federation of specialty stores associations reacted with 
anger this point 
the decision will do nothing but weaken minor retailers 
devastate shopping districts and slow down economic and cultural 
development of the community it said 
under current japanese law consent of small neighboring shops 
is needed before a big store can open the process can take 10 
years 
us officials say the law impedes entry of foreign stores they 
also note that larger japanese stores are more likely to sell 
imported products than small shops 
easing such barriers would help cut the united states 49 
billion trade deficit with japan they say 
the federation vowed to do our best to prevent the decisions 
from being enforced by keeping close ties with other groups and 
promoting consumer awareness and cooperation 
the association claims a membership of 50000 small retailers 
nationwide the trade ministry says japan has 16 million retail 
shops with fewer than 50 employees and 800000 tiny 
momandpop stores 
us officials also have argued that changes sought in japan 
would benefit japanese consumers who pay some of the worlds 
highest prices because of a complex distribution system and a web 
of government restrictions 
but some see advantages to the small stores 
it is not cheap pricing that we consumers want said naokazu 
takeuchi head of the japan consumers union one of the nations 
largest consumer groups he said large supermarkets charge 
relatively high prices for produce that is not necessarily fresh 
a mushrooming of large stores could destroy local shopping 
communities he added 
we have to take many elements cultural aspects community 
relationship into consideration before making decisions 
takeuchi said 
kabun muto minister of international trade and industry said 
it is necessary for us to create an environment that promotes 
sales of imported foreign goods in japan because we are living in 
the era of speed it is only natural to shorten the new store 
approval process 
for small retailers muto said we will never give them 100 
percent protection under our free economy system it is their own 
responsibility to make efforts to make their own business go well 
kaifu called the reforms a duty that japan must discharge as a 
responsible member of the international community 
kaiful said the implementation of the changes may be painful 
it is my conviction however that they are essential in 
furthering japans own national interest he said 
foreign minister taro nakayama said against the background of 
the serious largescale trade imbalance the present japanus 
economic relations unless managed properly is in the danger of 
suffering grave damage posing a threat of undermining the mutual 
trust which lies at the foundation of the overall relationship 
between the two nations 
japan argued in the talks that the united states contributed to 
the trade imbalance with its large budget deficit low savings 
rate shortterm corporate planning and relatively weak education 
system us negotiators promised efforts to remedy these problems

the state of nevada is going to war the 
enemy millions of crickets that will eat almost anything can grow 
as big as a mouse and have invaded nevada in the worst infestation 
since the 1930s 
theyre in the canyons right now and our goal is to kill them 
before they reach the valleys and the towns where they can do some 
real damage robert gronowski director of the nevada department 
of agricultures plant industry program said friday 
if we stop them in the mountains i think weve got the problem 
licked but we couldnt wipe out the entire population no matter 
what we did 
the insects known as mormon crickets are hatching across 
700000 acres in five rural counties the worst infestation of the 
brown juicespitting pests is near winnemucca 150 miles northeast 
of reno where 100 crickets have been counted per square foot 
once on the march the crickets will leave barren land in their 
wake even eating the bark off trees and devouring each other if 
food is scarce they can reach the size of a small mouse some 2 
inches long and will bite people if disturbed 
once they start marching it becomes much tougher to stop 
them gronowski said but right now theyre still young and 
arent really on the move so weve got an opportunity to do 
something to control them 
mormon crickets got their name from an infestation in utah in 
the 1800s that ended when sea gulls from salt lake city reportedly 
flew over the land and ate the insects 
the battle plan worked out by state and us agriculture 
officials includes spreading a poisonlaced bran and oil mixture on 
egg beds at the mouths of canyons where the insects are hatching 
a twoman crew is scheduled to begin the baiting program tuesday 
in the winnemucca area theyll continue through may 1 when 
surviving crickets are expected to begin their hungry march across 
the sagebrush and cheat grass desert lands toward crops and home 
gardens 
beginning may 1 an additional twoman crew will apply patches 
of the poisonous bait across areas where the crickets are traveling 
well apply an 8footwide band then go about 10 feet down the 
road and apply a second band if the first band doesnt kill them 
hopefully the second one will gronowski said 
the insecticide isnt harmful to larger animals or people 
according to gronowski someone would have to eat a lot of it to 
even get sick 
aerial spraying will begin april 23 in lander county and other 
infested rural areas where there arent any rivers to get polluted 
by the insecticide the spraying will be concentrated in the dry 
middle reese river area and the reno gund ranch which despite its 
name is halfway across the state from reno 
the program is expected to cost 25000 to 80000 which will 
be picked up by the federal government because the infestation is 
on bureau of land management property gronowski said 
well keep the baiting and spraying programs going until the 
crickets start laying eggs about july 15 he explained the 
insects die after laying their eggs 
that should be the end of the problem but theres no way to 
tell if theyll come back like this next year or in 10 years well 
just have to wait and see he said 
if the program doesnt keep the insects out of crops and towns 
gronowski said authorities might have to get private ranchers and 
farmers involved in killing them 
agricultural officials say they believe this years large 
infestation occurred because three years of drought allowed large 
egg beds to accumulate and there were no extremes of heat or cold 
to kill them

the beach and shell tell you its a new drink 
at least thats what she says she would pass along to rock lyric 
critics such as tipper gore 
branigan said friday that she would tell the wife of us sen 
albert gore jr dtenn that sex on the beach is a drink if 
she had to explain the lyrics of the title track from her new album 
moonlight on water 
the song includes these lyrics instead of dreamin about all 
the money we got much simpler things to do moonlight on water sex 
on the beach 
she said the lyrics represent more than sex 
sex on the beach is really i think more than the actual 
physical act its the feeling of being with someone you care about 
or a friend or just alone on the beach stripping off your clothes 
at night and going skinny dipping and you know just living for 
the moment

a distraught and unemployed man 
walked into a museum friday and sprayed a chemical on rembrandts 
the night watch but museum officials said damage to the 
nations most famous painting was slight 
it was the third attack this century on the huge rembrandt 
which hangs in the rijksmuseum the painting was slashed in the two 
other incidents 
a museum guard immediately sprayed a neutralizing agent saving 
the artworks delicate paint layer before the chemical could eat 
through the veneer said museum keeper piet van thiel 
by late friday afternoon most of the chemical had been removed 
from the 12by14 foot painting like all governmentowned 
artworks it is not insured its value has never been made public 
the attacker wore a hooded raincoat and was about six feet from 
the painting when he produced a little spray pump he had been 
concealing in his hand said witness barry olshen a professor 
from toronto 
dutch television described the chemical as concentrated sulfuric 
acid 
only a kneehigh steel barrier keeps visitors away from the work 
rembrandt painted in 1642 unarmed guards are near it at all times 
museum guards overpowered the suspect and handed him over to 
police who said they were unable to determine the mans motives 
the 31yearold man was not identified in line with dutch police 
practice he was held on suspicion of vandalism 
hes confused and not telling us anything at the moment 
police spokesman klaas wilting said 
restoration experts took the painting out of its plain wooden 
frame and stood it against the wall on the museums second floor 
where it shares a spacious gallery with three other 17thcentury 
paintings 
using delicate brushes they applied an agent that dried out the 
white blobs covering about a square yard of the work then wiped it 
clean 
van thiel told reporters the painting needs new veneer but will 
go on display in two weeks protected by a glass shield until the 
veneer is dry 
the attack was a reminder how vulnerable the netherlands 
artworks are said rob mulders of the sothebys auction firm 
in 1975 a dutch schoolteacher claiming to be on a divine 
mission slashed the night watch several times with a knife 
stolen from the restaurant where he had just eaten lunch he later 
committed suicide in a mental asylum 
during world war i a jobless shoemaker slashed the painting to 
protest his inability to find work 
the night watch portrays a group of 17thcentury militiamen 
characteristic of the period when such fraternal organizations 
patrolled dutch cities by night 
it is best known for rembrandts skillful handling of light and 
darkness and the beam of light that illuminates a richly dressed 
woman in the foreground 
the painting was believed to have been made on the occasion of a 
1638 visit to amsterdam by maria de medici queen of france

civilian unemployment dipped to 52 percent in 
march a slight improvement from february and the lowest rate in a 
year the government said friday 
but analysts attributed the good news more to a statistical 
quirk than to an economic upswing indeed the labor department 
report said the number of new jobs last month hit a fouryear low 
the economy is muddling along but its muddling along at a 
fullemployment level said robert dederick chief economist for 
the northern trust co of chicago its a stay as you are 
sir economy continuing along its path of steady but sluggish 
growth 
last months 52 percent jobless rate down from februarys 53 
percent was the lowest since march 1989 when the rate was at a 
15year low of 50 percent 
the next month joblessness hit 53 percent then eased down to 
52 percent in may but rose again in june to 53 percent where it 
held through february 
even with fridays report most analysts remained concerned that 
the slowdown in the economys overall growth would translate into 
higher jobless rates by years end 
the low unemployment rate is a surprise in an economy thats 
growing below its potential if we continue to have anemic 
growth its going up said allen sinai chief economist at the 
boston co 
by the end of the year some analysts predicted unemployment 
could reach 57 percent 
taking a more optimistic view michael boskin chairman of the 
presidential council of economic advisers said administration 
officials believe theres room for the economy to expand and for 
employment growth to continue and the economy to grow more strongly 
than its growing today 
as for last month most economists said the 01 percentage point 
drop in unemployment probably stemmed from a continued tight labor 
market and from the fact that the governments figures based on a 
survey of 60000 households conducted early in march reflected job 
activity in february more than in march 
over the first two months of the year economic growth created 
about 700000 jobs last month based on a separate survey of 
employers just 26000 jobs were added to nonfarm payrolls 
basically 1990 started off to a bang and it seems to have 
come to a screeching halt in march it is troubling but given the 
strength of the first two months im not inclined to panic said 
david wyss of drimcgraw hill 
janet norwood the commissioner of labor statistics said the 
unseasonably warm weather in january and february kept construction 
activity unusually high 
that resulted in fewer opportunities for additional hiring in 
march she said in explaining a 60000job loss in construction 
surging employment prospects in january and february helped 
reduce the number of discouraged workers to 747000 for the 
first three months of the year 
thats a level not seen since early 1979 for all of 1989 the 
number of discouraged workers had averaged 840000 
dederick saw this decline as another sign that were operating 
with an economy than can utilize nearly all of its workers 
discouraged workers are unemployed people who have given up 
looking for a job in the belief that the search will be fruitless 
at the same time the nations manufacturing slump continued 
with a loss of 30000 factory jobs in march that brought 
manufacturing job losses to 100000 since november and 250000 over 
the last year the department said 
theres no indication that manufacturing is going to turn 
around any time soon that sector of the economy is bleeding not 
profusely but its in a recession dederick said 
economists were concerned that average hourly earnings rose from 
988 to 992 a 04 percent change that would translate into a 
50 percent growth over a full year 
its a signal that inflation is not going to quickly fade 
sinai said 
the governments household survey said that total employment 
rose slightly in march to 1183 million and that the labor force 
those employed or actively looking for work edged up to about 
1248 million a growth of about 200000 
the losses in factory payrolls were more than offset by gains in 
the service industries which added 125000 jobs and the federal 
government which added 75000 census bureau workers and other 
employees 
since november the number of service jobs has grown by more 
than 400000 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the march 
jobless rate was 51 percent down from februarys 52 percent

security forces using automatic weapons 
tear gas and truncheons attacked about 200000 prodemocracy 
demonstrators near the royal palace friday killing and wounding 
scores of people 
one doctor said he saw soldiers carting 200 corpses from the 
center of the city a highranking western diplomat said witnesses 
provided him with a wild range of the number of dead from nine 
to 300 
staterun radio nepal reported friday night that only one person 
had been killed and eight injured one witness said he saw 35 
bodies at a hospital but doctors contradicted his report 
during almost five hours of protests mobs of angry 
demonstrators set fire to several government buildings including 
the city hall and ministry of commerce bands attacked houses of 
politicians loyal to king birendra who dominates the government 
and has rejected calls for a multiparty system 
late friday the army moved in cordoning off the palace with 
metal barricades and heavily armed squads soldiers clutching 
automatic weapons patrolled the deserted streets of the capital in 
trucks 
piles of tires smoldered at intersections littered with bricks 
shoes and slippers left behind by fleeing protesters tear gas 
fogged the air and gunshots echoed in the distance 
demonstrations also erupted in three other towns including the 
tourist haven of pokhara at least nine people died in clashes with 
police outside katmandu witnesses reported by telephone 
a doctor at bir hospital katmandus biggest said a british 
journalist was among the dead a british man and a dutchman also 
suffered bullet wounds the doctor said speaking on condition of 
anonymity their identities were not released pending notification 
of relatives 
the nepali congress party and a coalition of leftwing groups 
all banned by nepalese law have been fighting since feb 18 for 
democratic reforms in this himalayan nation wedged between china 
and india 
before friday at least 16 people had died in the protests 
which struck a popular chord among the countrys 17 million people 
a series of strikes in support of the movement had grounded 
airplanes closed shops shut off electricity and slowed work at 
hospitals 
on friday morning in his most conciliatory move yet the king 
dissolved the cabinet and replaced hardline prime minister marich 
man singh shrestha with a political moderate lokendra bahadur 
chand 
the king also established a committee to study changing the 
constitution which since 1961 has banned political parties and he 
set up a committee to access the damage and loss of life caused by 
the last seven weeks of protest 
the royal proclamation has given a slap in the face to the 
countrywide call for democracy nepali congress leader ganesh man 
singh said in a message from his hospital bed the peoples 
demands can only be reflected in a multiparty system 
singh was placed under house arrest shortly after the movement 
began and subsequently hospitalized for arthritis and a urinary 
infection he said the peoples movement will be carried on with 
even greater intensity 
protests began in at least four cities soon after the kings 
proclamation was broadcast on radio nepal 
in katmandu about 200000 people marched on the royal palace 
waving flags and chanting antigovernment slogans 
in midafternoon police attacked with sticks and tear gas when 
the crowd came within 500 yards of the palace witnesses said 
police then opened fire one witness said he saw at least 200 
demonstrators fall to the ground 
it was practically a massacre they fired into the crowd we 
saw it in front of the hospital said a doctor at bir hospital 
as he spoke a line of bleeding and bandaged demonstrators were 
rushed past on stretchers 
i lost consciousness during a baton charge said an 
18yearold man his head wrapped in a bloodsoaked bandage i 
fell to the ground then they started firing people were falling 
all around me 
another witness said he saw 30 young men gunned down as he 
watched the demonstration from a hotel window 
the people were unarmed and the government just started 
shooting he said 
he said security forces carried away some of the wounded but 
others were left lying in the street 
at sundown the city was blanketed in darkness as a blackout 
called by the opposition took effect 
doctors at bir hospital and at tribhuvan university teaching 
hospital said they had nine bodies and 150 wounded people 
including 30 in critical condition but they charged that soldiers 
were carting away corpses from the city 
bodies were taken in trucks for disposal by the army said 
one doctor at bir hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity 
at least 200 to 300 people must have died 
a lawyer said 40 people were killed 
in the staterun news report radio nepal said police were 
forced to shoot 
nepals only experiment with westernstyle democracy lasted two 
years and was halted in 1961 by king mahendra father of the 
present monarchy mahendra accused the nepali congress of corrupt 
and inefficient government 
today the king rules in conjunction with the rashtriya 
panchayat or national assembly the king selects onefifth of the 
assemblys 120 members the rest are elected on a nonparty basis 
but political observers say their candidacies must be approved by 
the palace 
most of the protests have focused on the ban on political 
parties rather than on the monarchy 
king birendra has been accorded godlike status by many of his 
subjects in this landlocked nation where the literacy rate is 25 
percent and the per capita annual income is 150

an atheist group is demanding that an 
underwater statue of jesus be removed from a federally protected 
coral reef angering those who say the bronze monument should stay 
cant these people find anything better to do with their 
time asked diver robert segueira of miami beach that christ 
is beautiful and its not like its in anybodys way except maybe 
for the fish 
brian gorman of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration in washington dc said the agency would decide 
whether the christ of the deep statue would remain in 25 feet of 
water in key largo national marine sanctuary 
although we view the statue as a historic artifact rather than 
a religious icon we do take the issue bought up by the atheists 
seriously gorman said we are researching whether or not it is 
proper for the statue to be in a federal park 
the statue is a duplicate of the christ of the abyss which 
stands in 50 feet of water off genoa italy the florida statue 
cast in italy and donated to the underwater society of america by 
italian industrialist egidi cressi was placed in a state park in 
1965 a boundary change later included the statute in the federal 
sanctuary 
american atheists says the statue violates the constitutional 
requirement for separation of church and state 
i find it incredible that someone had the brazen gall to 
install such a shrine on public property said american atheists 
member romulus roberts of wilton manors 
this is a public park funded by the publics money and there 
are other people in this world besides those who believe in christ 
i definitely want that statue removed he said 
the 2ton statue stands on a 7foot pedestal on a whitesand 
bottom in an amphitheater of corals and has served as the backdrop 
for underwater weddings 
like the christ of the abyss the christ of the deep statue was 
designed as a symbol of peace and as a memorial to people who have 
lost their lives at sea officials said

the supreme court on friday rejected a 
british request to extradite an ira supporter and former legislator 
on a firearms charge ruling he must be freed because the offense 
was politically inspired 
britains northern ireland secretary peter brooke who was in 
dublin for unrelated talks told reporters we are greatly 
disturbed 
the decision cast a new shadow over angloirish relations 
exacerbating a long dispute about extradition of irish republican 
army suspects 
owen carron 37 a former member of the british parliament for 
the outlawed iras political front sinn fein left the court 
surrounded by cheering supporters im delighted the former 
schoolteacher declared before being driven away in brilliant spring 
sunshine 
in belfast capital of northern ireland the british authorities 
said the unanimous ruling by the fivejudge court was most 
worrying 
we cannot accept that acts of terrorism which put peoples 
lives at risk are in any way political the northern ireland 
office added in a statement 
three weeks ago the irish supreme court freed two ira men who 
had escaped from jail in northern ireland saying there was a risk 
they would be beaten up by prison guards if they were extradited 
both men were serving 18year terms on terrorism convictions 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said the reason given 
by the court was grossly offensive she said the refusal to 
extradite the men dermot finucane and james pius clark would 
encourage terrorists to believe they would probably find a safe 
haven in the republic 
carron jumped bail in northern ireland in january 1986 while 
awaiting trial on charges of possessing an assault rifle 
he fled to the republic was arrested in 1988 and has since 
fought rulings by two lower courts ordering his extradition 
he was elected as a northern ireland member of the british 
parliament in 1981 on a wave of sympathy for bobby sands the first 
of 10 hunger strikers who died in jail during a political protest 
carron lost his seat two years later 
the british broadcasting corp in a report from belfast said 
the freeing of carron probably means britain will be unable to get 
any ira members extradited for offenses committed before 1987 
that was when ireland signed the european convention of 
terrorism which undermines the ability of terrorist suspects to 
avoid extradition by pleading political motivation 
the irish government counters british protests by pointing out 
that courts are independent of government control 
however the extradition dispute is straining the 1985 
angloirish accord which was intended to improve cooperation 
against the ira 
the mainly roman catholic ira banned on both sides of the 
border is fighting a guerrilla campaign to unite northern reland 
with the republic under a leftist administration 
the angloirish accord angered leaders of northern irelands 
protestant majority because it gave the roman catholic republic of 
ireland a consultative role in the running of the british 
administration of the province 
the northern ireland office says there have been a total of 154 
warrants since 1971 for extraditions from the republic and seven 
suspected terrorists have been returned

a mobilehome park for retirees is 
the unlikely setting for a case that could yield a landmark 
decision on the privileges of unmarried couples who live together 
the parks owner is asking the courts if an 1868 state law 
against lewd and lascivious cohabitation is grounds to evict 
unmarried elderly couples who stay in the same trailer 
william watson ii owner of romany mobile home park also wants 
a pinellas county circuit judge to decide if that law renders 
unconstitutional local fairhousing laws that prohibit 
discrimination based on marital status 
in a lawsuit filed last month watson asked the court to allow 
him to bar unmarried couples from his 91site park where 
homeowners say the minimum age of residents is 55 years 
depending on how far it gets it will probably have a bearing 
on all the fairhousing laws in florida said gloria williams 
president of the florida association of community relations 
professionals 
watson refused comment but his attorney peter hooper of st 
petersburg said lewd and lascivious is a general legal term 
that does not necessarily mean depravity and could apply to common 
sexual activity 
whats driving mr watson is personal conviction hes trying 
to do whats right he said 
hooper said the lawsuit is not against a specific individual 
and he does not want the issue to go to trial he would like a 
court decision by april 20 
the perception is its common for unmarried couples to live 
together he said most people dont realize its probably 
illegal 
robert herman a 65yearold retiree who shared a mobile home 
with his wife until she died three years ago is among residents 
bothered by watsons lawsuit 
he is passing moral judgment on me herman said its 
caused me a lot of heartaches 
herman who lives in new jersey and spends part of the year at 
the park said he has had a conflict with management because a 
woman he is dating has stayed in his mobile home herman said he 
was told by watsons son who helps manage the park that he must 
sell his home lease it or marry his girlfriend 
she started to cry she broke down hes assuming that things 
are happening here said herman who said another couple was 
staying with them in his home i figured i was doing nothing 
wrong 
assistant pinellas county attorney bill falkner said its 
unclear if unmarried men and women who live together are protected 
under the countys ordinance he said it wouldnt protect anyone 
who conducts lewd and lascivious behavior 
but he said watson assumes that people who are unrelated and 
living together are committing lewd and lascivious acts i dont 
know if we can make that assumption it certainly doesnt seem so 
to me 
according to the florida state archives the 122yearold law 
states that if any man and woman not being married to each 
other lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together 
they shall be guilty 
the legislature amended the law in 1971 and changed the maximum 
penalty from up to three years in prison to one year in prison and 
a 500 fine

state attorney general jim mattox denied 
allegations friday that he was seen using marijuana and challenged 
democratic gubernatorial rival ann richards to take a lie detector 
test with him 
ive not had an illegal drug period ever mattox said 
after the dallas morning news and houston chronicle reported 
accusations by a lawyer and a former policeman that they saw mattox 
smoke marijuana on separate occasions in the 1970s 
get those two folks sit them right here with me ill tell 
them they are liars to their faces mattox said he said the 
incidents they allege absolutely did not take place 
he said hed take a lie detector test and i want you to get 
ms richards strapped in beside me when we do it 
mattox and ms richards the state treasurer survived last 
months democratic primary to meet in tuesdays runoff the winner 
will take on republican oilman clayton williams a political 
newcomer who swept away his opponents in the primary 
drug questions have dominated the democratic race since ms 
richards refused to answer yes or no when asked during the primary 
if shed ever used illegal drugs mattox citing witnesses he wont 
identify accused her of drug use 10 years ago 
mattox said friday there was a real difference between the 
drug allegations in my case they are untrue in her case they 
are true he said 
at a campaign stop in denton ms richards had little to say 
about the allegations against mattox 
i really thought when mattox began all this drug stuff for 
the provocation of it the sort of witch hunt that he was on i 
just thought the whole thing was sick she said 
i still do regardless of who theyre talking about i feel 
badly for the electorate really that this campaign has taken this 
tone ms richards said 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic says she hasnt taken a 
moodaltering chemical in 10 years but refuses to answer other 
questions she says that could discourage others from seeking 
treatment she also refused to debate mattox before tuesdays 
runoff vote 
mattox said drug use isnt as big an issue as ms richards 
refusal to discuss it 
i told you exactly what took place in my circumstances you 
asked me questions and i gave you answers he told reporters 
friday im standing here the one that im running against is 
not here 
i notice that with the other campaign you only have an 
opportunity to visit with that individual when you kind of catch 
her on the run and shes bobbing and weaving and dodging 
the allegations against mattox were made in affidavits obtained 
by the morning news from houston lawyer jim sharp and former dallas 
policeman edward h lowe 
lowe said he saw mattox smoke marijuana in a dallas apartment 
during an undercover investigation lowe then a vice officer said 
he did not arrest mattox or others in the room because his 
assignment was to confirm a tip about a prostitution ring 
mattox said he had enemies in the dallas police department at 
the time and couldnt imagine that the officer wouldnt have jumped 
at the chance to arrest him on a drug charge 
sharp said mattox and he shared a marijuana cigarette in 1974 in 
a car after the democratic state convention in austin 
mattox said sharp had unsuccessfully sought a job from him in 
the past adding i have never been in any car anyplace anytime 
where marijuana has been smoked

fierce fighting has flared anew in 
this shellshocked border town which has little strategic 
significance but is symbolically important in the war between the 
government and moslem guerrillas 
there is normally little fighting in afghanistan during ramadan 
the moslem month of fasting that began march 27 khost near 
pakistans western border is the exception this year 
the pakistanbased mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors are 
firing artillery from key captured military outposts and pummeling 
the town and adjacent airport 
government forces respond with heavy aerial bombardment to try 
to suppress rebel fire and dislodge the mujahedeen from their 
positions around the mineladen perimeter 
the afghan government in kabul 100 miles to the northwest at 
one time landed three supply flights a night in khost but the 
airstrip is badly cratered and littered with damaged planes and 
supplies are now dropped by parachute 
we are closing in on the communists we have taken the war 
into the city and now we are tightening the circle said 
jalaludin haqqani the most powerful commander in the area 
on the ground we are in complete control in the air the 
communists can still fight and still deliver supplies haqqani 
said in an interview during a threeday trip to guerrilla positions 
both sides have suffered casualties since fighting erupted anew 
last month but exact figures are difficult to determine the 
government rarely releases the number of its dead and wounded 
while guerrilla groups have been feuding for years and dont talk 
to each other 
khost lies at the center of a high plateau in the safed kho or 
white mountains 18 miles from the pakistan border its 
strategic significance is limited but the guerrillas and the 
afghan government have placed enormous importance on the city in 
paktia province 
afghan president najib is from the province gen shah nawaz 
tanai the former defense minister and leader of last months coup 
attempt maintained a home in khost until he defected to the 
mujahedeen 
the town has been on the brink of falling to the mujahedeen 
several times in the past two years but troops loyal to najib have 
always managed to push back the guerrillas 
a week after the failed mutiny tanai boasted to reporters that 
government troops manning the khost garrison would surrender to the 
mujahedeen when he gave the order 
across the border in pakistan the headquarters of the 
ussupported resistance the hezbiislami group led by gulbuddin 
hekmatyar claimed the garrison wanted to surrender but was 
awaiting assurances of safety 
the only major obstacle standing in the way of a surrender is 
jalaludin haqqani said a spokesman for hekmatyar 
haqqani a traditionally proud pathan warrior with a flowing red 
beard is commander of rival hezbiislami faction led by yunis 
khalis 
haqqani has been fighting to take khost since the 1978 coup that 
installed a communist government in afghanistan he is considered 
the most powerful guerrilla commander in the area largely because 
of his wellsupplied fighters and close tribal ties rather than his 
fighting ability 
khalis guerrillas have been blamed for the massacre of some 70 
government soldiers who wanted to surrender to the mujahedeen in 
november 1988 near the eastern city of jalalabad 
their bodies were cut up and put on display and other guerrilla 
groups said that prevented soldiers from defecting once the soviet 
army ended direct military involvement in afghanistan in february 
1989 
on friday moslem guerrillas opened fire as more than 10000 
insurgents surrendered in northwestern afghanistans herat province 
radio kabul said an afghan general a deputy security minister 
and several civilians died in the battle that broke out during the 
surrender ceremony 
haqqanis fighters contend hekmatyars faction has no right to 
negotiate a surrender and say they want revenge for the thousands 
of guerrillas who have been killed during the war 
their stand has enabled hekmatyars guerrillas who have a 
reputation for ruthlessness to promote themselves as 
humanitarians 
the killing of prisoners is unislamic and the koran 
explicitly states that once your enemy lays down his weapons you 
are under obligation to protect him said the hekmatyar spokesman 
before the war khosts population was about 15000 now after 
nearly 12 years of fighting western diplomats in pakistan and 
mujahedeen leaders say that number has been drastically reduced 
they say the only residents are the 5000 to 8000 militia and 
government troops manning the garrison most belong to a civilian 
militia formed by local tribesmen that had supported gen tanai 
throughout the war 
the mud villages between khost and the pakistani border are 
freefire zones and anyone traveling in the area is subject to 
attack by bombing and strafing of afghan warplanes or mujahedeen 
firepower 
the guerrillas fire into the town with mortars recoilless 
rifles and howitzers the bodies of dead are left to rot 
government troops answer with frequent air raids forcing the 
mujahedeen to seek cover in underground bunkers once the planes 
are gone the guerrillas emerge and resume firing

a millionaire businessman who spent 50 
years in exile was picked as an opposition partys presidential 
candidate friday and is expected to present a tough challenge to 
the ruling national salvation front 
ion ratiu 72 was nominated as the candidate of the national 
peasants party it is one of two leading preworld war ii parties 
that have reemerged since the december revolt toppled nicolae 
ceaucescu and ended 45 years of communist rule 
interim president ion iliescu a former communist and member of 
the national salvation front is expected to declare his candidacy 
this weekend 
ratiu was one of four candidates for the nomination he won on 
the first round of voting during a meeting of partys 64member 
ruling body said party official victor isac 
isac said he believed ratiu was helped to victory by party 
elders belief that his international connections will serve the 
peasants party well in the may 20 elections 
for years ratiu campaigned against the communists from exile 
he returned to romania soon after the revolution 
ratiu said he would import a printing press next week to publish 
an opposition newspaper open to all political parties 
the opposition parties have frequently charged the national 
salvation front unfairly dominates radio television and the press 
isac said ratiu also was helped by being the nephew of his 
namesake ion ratiu who led the influential romanian national party 
in transylvania at the turn of the century 
no accurate opinion polls have been published in romania since 
the revolution making it hard to gauge the relative strength of 
the parties contesting the elections 
opinion samples and conversations with romanians suggest 
however that the national salvation front which took over after 
ceausescu was ousted will face its strongest challenge from the 
peasants party and the national liberal party 
the national liberals also a strong preworld war ii party are 
led by radu campeanu who last saturday declared he would run for 
the presidency 
campeanu also said the national liberals the peasants and the 
social democrats another group powerful before world war ii were 
forming an alliance for the may elections 
he said the three traditional parties would cooperate in order 
to win a majority in the parliamentary elections with a possible 
view to creating a coalition government 
however amalia radut a national liberal party official said 
in an interview friday that the agreement holds only for the 
parliamentary not the presidential race 
ratiu became a millionaire in shipbuilding and other enterprises 
in britain he described the threeparty cooperation as a kind of 
nonaggression pact but stressed we are not a coalition 
ratius wife elisabeth from liverpool said she would have 
to collect my breath to get used to the idea of campaigning as 
the potential first lady of romania 
married to ratiu for 45 years she said she had visited romania 
frequently in the late 1960s and 1970s to see her husbands 
relatives 
hes wanted to come back to romania all his life she said 
in an interview

for 50 years university of mississippi 
students who wanted to be editor of the campus newspaper had to be 
elected a procedure critics said picked the best politician not 
the best journalist 
following a spring protest that included publishing blank pages 
in the newspaper the process has been changed 
the next editor of the daily mississippian will be chosen by a 
selection committee instead of elected by the entire student body 
ending a campaign process in which candidates often spent hundreds 
of dollars on posters and fliers 
last month the student government voted 2921 after much debate 
to do away with elections and empower an 11member selection 
committee of faculty and students 
critics said fraternities and sororities controlled the annual 
elections and the votes were little more than popularity contests 
our image is that we are the greek white supremacists who 
dont want the state to be a good place to live for anyone but 
ourselves said journalism dean will norton who came to ole miss 
16 years ago 
ole miss is a school of deep tradition but i think this way 
they will pick the best candidate said lee eric smith a junior 
from holly springs who could be the schools first black editor 
the deadline for applying for the post is thursday norton said 
he knew of four students who were likely candidates 
about 10000 students are enrolled at the antebellum campus the 
site of race riots in 1962 after a court ordered that a black 
student be admitted about 20 students work on the editorial side 
of the 10000circulation paper 
before the student government vote last month the staff put out 
two protest editions one had several blank pages and the other 
contained the us constitution published three times in place of 
the usual news and sports to object to the election process 
we used that as a last resort to get the students attention 
to show them how seriously the student journalists feel about 
this said the current editor bill dabney 
some students upset by the protest responded by scrawling 
obscenities on copies and scattering hundreds of issues across 
campus 
samir husni chairman of the selections board said candidates 
will be given editing writing and spelling tests before being 
interviewed 
he said an exact timetable was still being worked out but that 
the new editor should be in place by the end of the month 
since its the first time ever we want to do it as perfect as 
possible so well set the stage for the future said husni 
when youre hiring someone after a big controversy its even 
more difficult 
norton said ole miss was one of the few remaining us schools 
that chose their editor by election 
whats encouraging about it is that the students brought the 
change said norton

a presidential candidate once considered a 
dark horse has made serious inroads into the lead held by 
celebrated novelist mario vargas llosa and may force a runoff 
pollsters said friday 
they said alberto fujimori a political independent like vargas 
llosa has a strong chance of capturing second place in sundays 
election with enough of a margin to force another round of 
balloting 
nine candidates are competing in the elections and a majority 
is required to prevent a runoff 
fujimori 51 is the son of japanese immigrants and commanded 
less than 1 percent of voter support in february surveys 
the apoyo polling agency and the peruvian company for market 
research said surveys taken over the last week indicate a sudden 
decline in support for vargas llosa his support level has dropped 
from around 45 percent in midmarch to 35 percent to 37 percent 
their surveys showed fujimori surging into second place with 21 
to 24 percent 
we have been observing a tendency first in lima and then in 
the provinces that is so strong that it has disconcerted 
pollsters said manuel saavedra director of the peruvian company 
for market research its a totally atypical phenomenon 
the pollsters attributed fujimoris rapid rise to peruvians 
distrust of established politicians 
representatives of apoyo the peruvian company for market 
research and datum three of perus leading public opinion survey 
firms met friday with foreign correspondents to release results of 
surveys taken in recent days 
the poll results are barred from publication in peru within 15 
days of the election 
the last survey results released in late march before the ban 
showed vargas llosa of the centerright democratic front coalition 
with 45 percent of the vote and fujimori with almost 12 percent 
more recent polls show fujimori nearly doubling his popularity 
i dont want to talk about the polls but apparently they give 
us an overwhelming force fujimori said in a friday news 
conference 
the pollsters said vargas llosa stood a strong chance of being 
defeated by what they called the fujimori phenomenon in a 
second round of balloting 
the polling firms said peruvians facing the worst economic 
crisis ever to hit their nation support fujimori because they see 
him as a political newcomer they said vargas llosa who has been 
campaigning two years has acquired the image of a professional 
politician 
manuel torrado president of datum said surveys also indicate 
perus poor are not confident that vargas llosa can keep his 
campaign pledge to lower inflation from current levels of 2000 
percent a year to 10 percent 
the pollsters all agreed that vargas llosas detailed plan for 
economic sacrifice has cost him dearly in the polls 
people have begun to fear vargas llosas program said 
alfredo torres media director for apoyo 
fujimoris campaign has emphasized general themes he has said 
no drastic economic measures are necessary 
peruvians are looking for a savior torrado said

new warnings will be required on 
overthecounter aspirin products advising women in the last three 
months of pregnancy not to use the products unless directed by a 
physician the food and drug administration said friday 
aspirin late in pregnancy can affect fetal circulation and 
uterine contractions and cause excessive bleeding during elivery 
an fda spokeswoman said 
a thirdtrimester pregnancy warning is already required on 
nonprescription ibuprofen products 
acting fda commissioner james benson detailed the agencys plans 
in a march 29 letter to thomas warriner under secretary of the 
california health and welfare agency 
benson said he was aware of the states interest in preparing a 
similar warning under proposition 65 californias antitoxics law 
and wanted officials there to know fdas plans 
benson said the wording of the warning had not been determined 
but would likely be similar to the ibuprofen warning 
that warning says it is especially important not to use 
ibuprofen during the last three months of pregnancy unless 
specifically directed to do so by your doctor because it may cause 
problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery 
the agency plans to publish a rule on the warning in the next 
several months benson said it would go into effect immediately 
and companies would have one year to make the label changes he 
said 
aspirin labels already advise pregnant women and nursing mothers 
to get the advice of a health professional before using the product

county commissioners meeting to discuss a 
noise ordinance found that they themselves violated the proposed 
decibel levels while they chatted during a recess 
outside in the hall it was 75 or 77 decibels while yall were 
on your break said sgt joe westbrook of glynn county police 
who brought a sound meter to the courthouse 
the ordinance would limit noise to 60 decibels in residential 
areas 
county police chief carl alexander said the proposal is 
unreasonable and he suggested thursday that commissioners raise 
the limit in a residential area to about 70 
interest in a noise ordinance apparently grew out of complaints 
last year from beverly shores subdivision residents who were 
bothered by music coming from a skating rink north of brunswick 
skateland owner bob hurst said he thinks he can operate within 
the proposals restrictions he said he already has a sound meter 
inside the rink and keeps the music at no more than 80 decibels at 
that level the music cannot be heard by his nearest neighbor 
hurst said

the republican national committee sent a 
membership card to the wrong guy rep frank annunzio said friday 
the illinois democrat said he had received a letter from 
president bush on behalf of the committee asking for a contribution 
that would make him a sustaining member of the republican party 
ironically annunzio who has represented a chicago district for 
26 years faces a tough challenge this fall from a republican state 
senator walter dudycz 
i have learned that the republican national committee has 
targeted me for defeat and has pledged to give my opponent 
400000 annunzio said in a reply letter 
since the republicans have that kind of money to spend why do 
you need a contribution from me annuzio inquired in the letter 
mistakes like the annuzio solicitation happen all the time 
said rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman 
weve had more than 200 elected officials switch parties she 
added if democrats dont want to switch maybe theyd be willing 
to contribute

soviet border guards friday barred sen 
alfonse damato from entering lithuania and damato later accused 
moscow of trying to strangle the baltic republics cry for 
freedom 
damato a new york republican had printed in his us 
diplomatic passport a stamp that read lithuanian republic visa 
no 3 and had been invited to visit vilnius by the president of 
the breakaway republic vytautus landsbergis 
the senator said the purpose of his trip was to show 
congressional support of lithuanias drive for independence from 
moscow 
but at the small country border crossing at ogrodniki in 
northeast poland a soviet major politely told him to go to a 
consulate and apply for a regular soviet visa 
the refusal came as little surprise the crossing is normally 
closed to all but polish and soviet citizens since the 
confrontation between the kremlin and lithuania began this month 
the soviets have limited even that traffic 
damato used the occasion to highlight what he called the soviet 
unions psychological warfare on lithuania whose parliament 
declared independence from the soviet union on march 11 
its nothing more than a stranglehold being placed on the cry 
for freedom by the lithuanian people damato said 
i think the soviets are making a mistake those artificial 
barriers will not keep the lithuanian people away from freedom 
he told reporters the united states should be more skeptical of 
the intentions of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the sooner the united states wakes up to what is taking place 
and becomes realistic the better he said 
mr gorbachev says one thing and does another he talks about 
freedom and yet denies access to a free country 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said regarding damatos 
trip were always concerned about members of congress and others 
getting too involved in foreign policy but on the other hand he 
is a senator who has an important message to deliver he represents 
a broad constituency and has every right to make that trip and 
deliver his message 
damato is on the senate appropriations subcomittee on foreign 
operations but is not viewed as a major senate spokesman on 
foreign relations 
he flew to poland thursday planning to challenge the soviet land 
blockade of lithuania the soviet union rejected any claim of 
lithuanian sovereignty and us diplomats and western journalists 
were ordered out of vilnius 
accompanied by lithuanias foreign minister algrinas saudragis 
damato and a halfdozen aides traveled by chartered bus the 200 
miles from warsaw to ogrodniki lithuanias only direct border 
opening to the outside world 
in sunny weather they arrived at the crossing at about 2 pm 
polish soldiers let them pass the first barrier on the polish side 
but 100 yards down the road they came to a redandwhite barrier 
marking the lithuanian frontier and guarded by soviet kgb troops 
through an interpreter speaking lithuanian damato asked soviet 
maj vitas buchis for permission to pass into the country buchis 
a native lithuanian serving in the soviet border force told 
damato he would check by telephone with moscow 
after returning from a phone call that he said was to moscow 
buchis told damato passage was forbidden i am sorry but rules 
are rules i am just following orders he said 
saudragis who was met on the lithuanian side by two 
subordinates then crossed into lithuania by himself 
extending his arm to damatos across the frontier saudragis 
said we shake hands over this border that divides us but your 
support is strengthening our spirit 
saudragis also thanked the united states for never recognizing 
the forced incorporation of lithuania into the soviet union in 1940 
we are optimistic that the borders now being guarded by the 
brutal military force will be replaced by bridges of good will and 
that we will be able to visit each other without any obstacles 
he said 
damato spent about one hour at the border before turning back 
the soviet government has closed the ogrodniki crossing for most 
traffic since tuesday it is permitting only polish and soviet 
citizens to use it to return home to their respective countries 
ogrodniki is lithuanias only direct border crossing to a 
nonsoviet country 
the main international crossing between poland and the soviet 
union is about 95 miles to the south at brest in the soviet 
byelorussian republic

the former bank manager who told of huge cash 
withdrawals for imelda marcos visits to new york was grilled 
friday by her attorney about the immunity given him by the us and 
philippine governments 
oscar oca carino who managed the philippine national banks 
new york branch from 1973 to 1984 also was questioned about his 
evasion of us taxes on interest he skimmed with the approval of 
mrs marcos personal secretary from two accounts set up for 
offshore investments 
isnt it true that you did some dishonest things while you 
were at that bank asked mrs marcos attorney gerald spence 
i did some wrongdoings there but they were pursuant to 
instructions to me carino said 
on thursday carino testified that mrs marcos visited new york 
two to three times annually during the years he ran the pnb office 
each time drawing an average of 100000 from his banks operating 
accounts for her personal use 
mrs marcos is accused of using more than 160 million stolen 
from the national treasury and millions more from defrauding 
several banks to finance a lavish lifestyle and the purchase of 
four new york buildings 
her husband former philippines president ferdinand e marcos 
was charged in the 1988 indictment but died in exile in hawaii last 
september 
a codefendant saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggi is 
charged with mail fraud and obstruction for allegedly backdating 
documents to help the marcoses conceal their ownership of the 
manhattan properties 
spence probed into carinos agreements with the two governments 
that granted him immunity from prosecution in exchange for truthful 
information about his dealings with the marcoses 
carino many times said he could not remember details of the 
agreements when pressed by spence one exchange about whether 
carino knew he wouldnt be arrested before he came to speak to us 
prosecutors in 1987 went on for about 20 minutes 
spence however could not shake carinos answer that he spoke 
to prosecutors on the advice of his lawyer and had no assurances 
from the us government that he would not be charged i took the 
risk he said 
carino said he set up two special accounts with the clear 
understanding of mrs marcos confidential secretary fe roa 
jimenez one called oemcee lasted from 1976 to 1981 when it was 
replaced by the second one called oscarman holdings ltd which 
was closed when he left the bank in 1984 
the accounts were designed for offshore investments that would 
not be noticed by pnb staffers or state bank examiners he said 
but the interest was credited to him and went undeclared on his 
us taxes 
the witness said he couldnt recall how much interest he took 
from the two accounts over the eight years his agreement with the 
us government includes a provision that he repay 123000 in back 
taxes and interest but carino said he had not yet made the payment 
to the internal revenue service 
you can remember a conversation with the first lady at the 
airport nine years ago but you cant remember the amount of money 
that you took from these accounts spence asked with an edge of 
sarcasm 
i never paid much attention i was not keeping track but on 
those instructions from the first lady if i dont remember them 
and execute them ill be done carino said

negotiations have stalled for 
disbanding the usbacked contra rebels because of disagreement 
over the size of security zones in nicaragua and over a verifiable 
ceasefire rebel leaders say 
one leader oscar sovalbarro known as commander ruben said in 
an interview thursday night it was impossible for his guerrillas to 
disarm before the leftist sandinista government leaves office on 
april 25 
a delegation from the united national opposition the 
proamerican 14party coalition newly elected to power in 
nicaragua is expected in tegucigalpa on saturday to try to break 
the deadlock 
contras and sandinistas have exchanged several proposals without 
results 
members of a un mission for central america will monitor the 
talks 
the contras accused the nicaraguan military and interior 
ministry security troops of bombing peasant communities and 
intimidating residents killing uno activists and ordering soldiers 
to shoot at helicopters from a un mission that is supervising the 
demobilization plan 
the sandinistas charged the contras with staging attacks against 
military installations and against prosandinista civilians to 
intimidate them 
honduran military authorities have barred journalists from 
visiting contra jungle camps at yamales near the nicaraguan 
border but journalists who went there before the clampdown said 
most contras have slipped into nicaragua 
a western diplomatic source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said only 2000 to 3000 combatants remain at contra 
camps of the 12000 fighters based there before the sandinistas 
lost in the elections on feb 25 
the number of contras in nicaraguan territory is easily 
9000 the source said sovalbarro the contra chief of 
psychological operations and its negotiator on disarmament claimed 
12000 rebels are now inside nicaragua 
an accord signed by the contras and uno in tegucigalpa on march 
23 calls for the rebels to start disarming no later than april 20 
five days before president daniel ortega hands over power to 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro but sets no deadline 
for completing the process 
nobody is saying that those inside nicaragua have to disarm 
before april 25 said sovalbarro for there to be confidence 
among the fighters and a national reconciliation there must be a 
total demilitarization 
sovalbarro said the contras and sandinistas agreed on the sites 
but not on the size of five security zones inside nicaragua where 
the rebels are to concentrate and surrender their weapons to 
international observers 
the sandinistas want a total area of less than 400 square miles 
the contras want 1200 square miles he said 
sovalbarro said the contras also want the nicaraguan army and 
security forces purged of sandinista officers saying the entire 
sandinista structure must disappear 
an agreement signed by uno and the sandinistas on march 25 
stipulates that the government of mrs chamorro will respect the 
professionalism of army and security forces but forbids officers 
from holding leadership posts in any party 
if she agrees that elements that are in high leadership levels 
of the sandinista party remain in place that would create much 
unhappiness among all the fighters and even the voters 
sovalbarro said 
some contra fighters interviewed inside nicaragua said they will 
not surrender their weapons while the sandinistas maintain control 
of the army 
but they know they must obey a top command said chief 
contra spokesman alejandro acevedo as people anybody has the 
right to express themselves but they are very disciplined 
elements and we keep in constant touch with them 
acevedo said negotiations were hindered by what he said were 
sandinista violations of a ceasefire as long as our people are 
persecuted and harassed they will keep thinking that way we must 
have a true ceasefire its a very important step he said 
contras remaining at camps in honduras are to surrender their 
weapons april 16 but military sources said only a bunch of old 
fal belgianmade automatic rifles remain there because the 
contras took all their newer weapons with them to nicaragua

nasa on friday cleaned discoverys 
engines and replaced a tv camera lens from the shuttle in 
preparation for next weeks mission to launch the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope 
the camera was removed from the shuttles robot arm after 
technicians found the spot on the lens said nasa spokesman bruce 
buckingham 
its not going to impact the schedule at all he said 
mission specialist steven a hawley will use the 50footlong 
arm to deploy the telescope during the fiveday mission a spot on 
the television camera lens might have hampered his view 
the launch countdown was to begin soon after hawley and the four 
other crew members arrived on saturday afternoon 
the shuttle is scheduled to blast off at 847 am tuesday 
things are coming on us in a rush right now said bill 
taylor the telescopes chief engineer its almost unbelievable 
to think that in a couple of days well be closing the payload 
doors and it will be the last time well see it until its in 
orbit 
tuesdays launch date was jeopardized earlier this week when a 
power outage interrupted testing of the telescope and orbiter the 
tests were completed thursday eliminating the last major prelaunch 
hurdle 
technicians on friday continued cleaning the shuttles rear 
engine compartment removing protective covers for flight and 
installing essential lastminute items 
everythings pretty well on target said george diller a 
spokesman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
diller said the only operation left that might pose a slight 
problem was disconnecting the telescopes nickelhydrogen battery 
chargers and removing the instruments dust and moisture 
protection the operation which nasa calls a payload closeout 
was expected to the completed by sunday 
once they get in to disconnecting the umbilicals thats when 
you get into the real serious hubble space telescope closeout 
diller said 
the telescope is the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever 
built by nasa 
hawley said he has practiced deploying the telescope dozens of 
times and is prepared for just about anything that might go wrong 
im confident we can do it under almost any circumstance he 
said nasas real good at whatifs and weve done a lot 
whatifs what if this part doesnt work what if the arm fails 
completely 
once deployed the telescope is to orbit 380 miles high for 15 
years enabling astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant 
that their light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years 
it will be capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and 
with 10 times greater clarity than the best groundbased 
observatory

flaws in the design of the armys ch47d 
helicopter have caused two accidents that killed 15 servicemen and 
injured six others a house subcommittee contends 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations found that in at least 25 instances potential 
disasters were avoided by the work of the aviator constraints on 
the aircraft or luck 
the report is nothing less than an indictment of the ch47d 
chinook helicopter as well as the failure of the army aviation 
systems command to seriously and effectively resolve safety of 
flight problems rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
subcommittee said in an april 4 letter 
dingell in the letter to army secretary michael pw stone 
questioned why the service continues to procure the helicopter 
despite the mechanical problems 
he also asked if the army would suspend its plans to buy 144 
helicopters at a cost of 900 million over three years until the 
problems are fixed 
the report said the ch47d a twinengine transport helicopter 
made by boeing helicopters of philadelphia has suffered numerous 
mechanical problems that have grounded the aircraft nine times 
including five last year 
in addition the army aviation systems command has issued no 
less than 84 flight safety directives to correct safety problems on 
the aircraft 
a 1988 accident in texas killed 10 soldiers and was blamed on 
design defects the report said fire triggered by flying metal 
fragments was the cause of another 1988 crash in honduras that 
killed five servicemen 
the army said it had not received a copy of the report but said 
its aviation systems command has taken steps to resolve the 
problems when identified in the ch47d 
soldiers safety is the armys primary concern and the army 
would not allow the ch47d to continue flight operations if it were 
not a safe aircraft army maj nancy burt said friday

the typical eighth grader is happy at home and 
doing well in school but an education department official said 
friday about 20 percent of middleschool students are at risk of 
failure 
emerson elliott acting commissioner of the departments 
national center for education statistics released the first 
results of a study that will follow todays eighth graders as they 
move through high school and beyond 
weve already identified a large number of students who are at 
risk of either school failure or dropping out before high school 
graduation elliott told an education writers association 
conference in chicago where the report was released 
we will continue to collect data on these same students for 
another dozen years whether they stay in school or drop out he 
added 
to examine factors that contribute to school success the 
national education longitudinal study of 1988 collected information 
on six commonly used indicators of at risk status 
overall 53 percent of the 24600 eighth graders in 1000 public 
and private schools nationwide in the spring of 1988 had none of 
the risk factors but 20 percent had two or more the study showed 
twentytwo percent were in singleparent families 21 percent 
lived in families with income of less than 15000 14 percent were 
home alone more than three hours a day 11 percent had parents with 
no high school diplomas 10 percent had siblings who dropped out 
and 2 percent had limited english proficiency 
the study found that students with several risk factors tended 
to have more educational problems including low grades and high 
absenteeism students with two or more risk factors were six times 
as likely as those with none to report that they did not expect to 
graduate from high school and were twice as likely to score in the 
lowest 25 percent on achievement tests and to receive the lowest 25 
percent of grades said the study 
twenty percent of all eighth graders were not proficient in the 
basic math skills addition subtraction multiplication and 
division considered necessary to perform everyday tasks thirty 
percent of hispanics blacks and american indians were not 
proficient at the basic level 
fourteen percent of eighth graders were unable to perform basic 
reading tasks such as finding information in a text or identifying 
the authors main thought about 30 percent of students who usually 
speak a language other than english failed to show basic reading 
skills 
the report a profile of the american eighth grader was 
conducted under an education department contract by the national 
opinion research center a notforprofit research center 
affiliated with the university of chicago other key findings were 
41 percent of females and 28 percent of males aspired to 
professional or managerial careers or careers in business science 
or engineering fields 
10 percent of students reported that someone has offered to 
sell them drugs at school with 16 percent of american indian 14 
percent of hispanics 10 percent of whites 8 percent of blacks and 
5 percent of asians reporting that experience 
blacks and american indians were nearly twice as likely as 
whites to report they did not feel safe at school 18 percent 
versus 99 percent 
the typical eighth grader spent almost four times more hours 
per week watching television 212 hours than doing homework 55 
hours

frantic tenants jumped from their 
windows or groped through smoky hallways as a predawn fire 
destroyed a threestory residential hotel friday killing at least 
three people and injuring 21 
at least 9 residents were unaccounted for hours after the 
threealarm blaze broke out at the fontana hotel on collins avenue 
north of miami beachs trendy art deco district fire chief 
branaird dorris said but officials had no evidence they were 
trapped inside 
many of the estimated 100 residents were retirees some of whom 
had to flee without their medications or hearing aids 
its a terrible fire i dont know how to describe this when 
you have multiple deaths and you have total destruction of a 
building said assistant fire chief john reed i cant even 
think of the proper word to describe it 
alfonso teixeira a 27yearold brazilian was awakened in his 
room by a frightened resident 
i saw this guy running in the hall shouting fire fire big 
big teixeira said 
the hotel had smoke alarms but no sprinklers authorities said 
two women and a man were killed and fire officials presumed 
they were on a list of 12 people still missing by late afternoon 
twentyone people were treated for smoke inhalation at various 
hospitals some were hospitalized and others were released the 
dead werent identified friday 
theres reason to believe that the number of dead may grow 
because many of the missing lived in the most heavily damaged front 
section of the hotel said assistant fire chief john reed 
after rescue efforts ended friday police and fire officials 
state fire marshals and a special federal fire investigation team 
planned to meet saturday to determine how to pursue the hotel 
search 
mayor alex daoud who opened his house to survivors said the 
intensity of the 3 am fire led investigators to suspect arson 
but detective jim hyde said no evidence of arson had been found in 
the early stages of the investigation 
tenants reported a water leak raising the possibility of an 
electrical short dorris said 
dorris said crews had entered the building six or eight times by 
early afternoon but about 30 percent of the building had collapsed 
and those areas hadnt been searched for the missing residents he 
said it might be saturday or later before the worst sections are 
examined 
residents said the fire started near an elevator shaft at the 
front of the 102room hotel and hyde said two of the bodies were 
found in the lobby area 
i felt i was choking said rose waller an elderly woman who 
made her way out with three neighors but lost her daily medication 
i couldnt see because already the smoke came into my room i 
really couldnt see anything it was blurred 
residents fled in nightclothes robes or whatever they could 
grab while members of a romanian immigrant family who have owned 
the white stucco hotel since may knocked on doors to alert everyone 
i ran upstairs and got people out i broke down a door with my 
shoulder to get somebody out said olimpia mihai a member of the 
family it happened so quick half a minute and i couldnt see 
anything im still in shock 
her brotherinlaw cosmin said i woke up in the nick of time 
when the highfrequency alarms went off i was screaming down the 
halls move it move it move it i stayed up in the halls no 
more than 1020 seconds before the smoke got too bad and i had to 
run 
ann karmiller 87 said she walked down from the third floor by 
hanging onto the bannister fleeing so quickly that she left with 
nothing but her nightgown forgetting her dentures hearing aid and 
cane 
she grabbed my hand and helped me out said jewel mirsky 
76 who escaped with ms karmiller it was all black we felt the 
steps very haltingly i heard the noise and the siren went off like 
mad the smoke was very bitter 
secondfloor resident joe marcello 32 who has limped since 
breaking his back two years ago tried to go down the hall but 
choked on the smoke 
i started to fear for my life i got scared he said i 
thought im going to die in here how am i going to get out im 
already crippled i just busted out the window and i hung from the 
second floor and i dropped down about 15 feet 
he said another secondfloor resident broke her window dropped 
her baby to a man on the ground and jumped out herself 
the fontana was built in 1951 and complied with a 3yearold 
ordinance requiring electric smoke alarms in each room said reed 
the assistant fire chief 
the only major violation in the most recent city fire inspection 
last september was batterypowered alarms which were replaced 
officials said 
the hotel was not equipped with sprinklers which wont be 
required by state law until october 1991 
the american red cross checked in 121 people from the fontana 
and the adjacent prince michael hotel at a shelter set up at a 
community center 
hotel capri owner barry appel opened about 30 rooms for elderly 
fontana residents and said 25 rooms were available to younger 
residents at a nearby apartment building 
the staff of fedco pharmacy called hotel residents doctors to 
get a list of their medication and fill prescriptions 
unlike other fires lots of these people need medical supplies 
right away said red cross spokesman chris chidley

if the administrations test battle in the 
war on drugs has failed in the nations capital its because 
federal authorities neglected to work with local officials 
washington mayor marion barry said friday 
barry facing drug and perjury charges in the district of 
columbia was in new orleans for the national conference of black 
mayors he briefly stole the show from jesse jackson when he walked 
into an antidrug meeting during a jackson speech and was given a 
standing ovation 
later in an impromptu news conference he discussed a story in 
thursdays new york times that said the bush administration would 
soon issue a report indicating its yearold pilot program in 
washington hasnt worked 
i have not seen the report said barry i think theyre 
going to release it next week but as jesse jackson indicated the 
initial approach was wrong it was like an exclusionary situation 
where you come down and you propose things for us without talking 
to us 
barry said he saw no irony in his attending an antidrug meeting 
at the mayors conference while facing cocaine charges he scoffed 
at a suggestion that the proliferation of drugs in washington could 
be related to his own admitted substance abuse problems 
its a red herring he said later adding america has a 
critical need to solve its problem im not going to be the focus 
of it 
barry has admitted dependency on alcohol and tranquilizers but 
has skirted the issue of cocaine abuse 
he was arrested jan 18 during an fbi sting operation and faces 
trial on five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and three 
counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug involvement he has 
pleaded innocent to the charges 
it would be nice if they would spend as much money for drug 
treatment and other kinds of facilities as they did in 
investigating my administration for the last 10 years barry said 
barry had slipped into the room during jacksons speech and was 
walking up an aisle when jackson stopped and said come on up 
mr mayor 
the 400 or so people in the audience stood and applauded as 
barry walked to the dais and sat next to the former democratic 
presidential candidate 
jackson had been delivering a scathing indictment of president 
bushs handling of the drug war 
he described william bennett bushs national drug policy 
adviser as a general without portfolio 
president bush jackson told the mayors will declare a war 
with the resources and have you fight the war without resources 
voodoo politics 
jackson also reiterated his call for state national and local 
officials to develop a plan to make public and private pension 
funds available for investment in lowincome housing and other 
programs aimed at eliminating poverty

a jury convicted 23 residents 
of a south pacific atoll who claimed they were swept up by demons 
or religious frenzy when they tortured to death six people during a 
witch hunt 
the sevenman twowoman jury at the tribunal of papeete handed 
down penalties late thursday that ranged from three to 14 years 
imprisonment for those who participated in the 1987 slayings 
i find these penalties very heavy said roman catholic 
archbishop michel coppenrath the highestranking church official 
in french polynesia the repentance of the accused is sincere 
the defendants mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of 
faaite showed no reaction when the sentences were read another 
suspect a minor will be judged in a separate proceeding 
the 14year sentence went to farmer francois mauti 25 on 
convictions of murder complicity in murder and inflicting mortal 
blows he led a band of disciples that organized the violence in 
sept 24 1987 
i had a spirit under the spell of the devil mauti told 
judge marcel bihl i lost my head but i believed i was on the 
holy path shunning the evil fighting within me 
during the nineday trial the court heard defendants speak of 
being swept away by evil spirits or religious enthusiasm as they 
hunted down and killed neighbors they thought were possessed 
the terror had roots in august 1987 visit by three women who 
arrived from tahiti 300 miles to the west the women claimed to 
represent the roman catholicaffiliated movement christian renewal 
a group founded in the united states church authorities deny they 
had any official role in the movement 
the group already had a strong following on faaite a sandy 
atoll where about 180 people live the women regarded as 
priestesses by the islanders took over the communitys 
whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the religious 
authority 
the trios leader alexandra silvia conducted services in a 
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that god would 
abandon faaite the defendants said 
miss silvia suggested demons were in their midst defendants 
said and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow 
islanders who failed to attend her daily services 
my words were misinterpreted testified silvia a 
55yearold dental secretary who was not charged i only gave 
prayers that cured those who were sick 
but the defendants said the mood of the onceplacid atoll swung 
between ecstasy and dread inspired by silvia and her assistants 
the trio left faaite in late august and anointed seven disciples to 
continue their work 
a few days later a 14yearold boy reported a vision that the 
devil had possessed his aunt the islanders gathered in nightlong 
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised 
they repeated the ritual with two other people but ioane 
harris the assistant mayor publicly denounced the women on sept 
2 maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck beat and 
drowned him and threw his body on a bonfire built before the 
church 
it was necessary to purify him one defendant said it was 
necessary to purify the village 
five more people were killed over the next two days 
most islanders took no part in the carnage but it was sept 4 
before anyone established contact with papeete the capital of 
french polynesia and reported trouble on the atoll 
the mayor who had been on vacation and a roman catholic priest 
arrived the next day with police 
psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic 
christianity mixed with ancient polynesian beliefs in the 
supernatural produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated 
island lacking institutional authority the three visitors were not 
put on trial because they left faaite before the murders

uals directors agreed friday to a 438 billion 
buyout by employees that would make united airlines parent company 
the worlds largest workerowned corporation but some analysts 
doubted whether the deal would fly 
union leaders said the agreement calls for the 71000 employees 
to give up 2 billion in concessions over five years including 
300 million in the first year and 500 million in the fifth year 
the three union groups that negotiated the 201ashare deal 
have not yet secured financing for the buyout according to a 
source involved in the talks the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
analysts said that weakness could prove fatal 
lenders also may frown on the possibility the unions will dump 
ual corp chairman stephen wolf who is perceived as a highly 
capable airline manager despite his difficult relations with the 
unions analysts said 
one union leader said wolf would be out but a spokesman for the 
union group said later that the issue had not been settled 
the stock market apparently reflected investor skepticism that 
the deal will be completed after a strong opening ual closed 2 a 
share lower at 16350 friday on the new york stock exchange 
the capitulation of the board has been significantly 
overshadowed by the continuing financing risks said airline 
analyst samuel buttrick of kidder peabody amp co 
those risks he said make it a very uphill battle from the 
financing side 
uals board announced the tentative agreement after meeting all 
night at company headquarters near chicago the leaders of unions 
representing uniteds pilots machinists and flight attendants gave 
some additional details at a news conference in new york 
under the agreement shareholders would receive 155 in cash 
35 in ual notes and an estimated 11 worth of securities in ual 
subsidiary covia corp for each ual share 
ual would spin off to shareholders its 50 percent stake in 
covia which is coowned by a consortium of five other airlines and 
operates an automated reservation system 
uals largest shareholder coniston partners immediately called 
off its threatened proxy fight to oust the board at the april 26 
annual shareholders meeting coniston has an 118 percent stake in 
ual and was pressuring the board to sell to the ual employees 
the company formed by the unions for the takeover is called 
united employee acquisition corp 
in terms of the number of workers the largest employeeowned 
company currently is publix inc a supermarket chain based in 
lakeland fla with 50000 employees said corey rosen executive 
director of the national center for employee ownership in oakland 
calif 
ual said it expected to conclude a final agreement promptly but 
the deal depends on the unions securing financing and machinists 
union vice president john peterpaul said the group had several 
months to put financing together 
were very optimistic about the financing he said 
under the plan the unions would sign fiveyear contracts with 
nostrike clauses other concessions include wage cuts of up to 
769 percent for flight attendants and machinists and as much as 11 
percent for pilots 
uals 25700 nonunion employees would negotiate their work 
conditions with the union group said their lawyer stephen fraidin 
the pilots would own 379 percent machinists 357 percent 
nonunion employees about 143 percent and the association of 
flight attendants about 12 percent the union leaders said 
wolf would be replaced said frederick dubinsky head of the air 
line pilots association union 
but later in the day union group spokesman hank krakowski said 
the unions had made no such decision 
our position is were not including or precluding anyone from 
any management team at this point he said 
one candidate previously contacted by the union group as the 
possible successor to wolf is richard ravitch onetime head of new 
yorks public transit system 
ravitch did not immediately return calls to his new york office 
friday and the union leaders would not comment on whether he would 
take over 
the question is who is going to manage this thing and take it 
to the banks said analyst jack hunter of howe barnes investments 
inc in chicago 
hunter said he believed the deal would ultimately go through 
doubts about the deal stem from the failure last october of a 
68 billion employee buyout of ual attempted by the pilots wolf 
and british airways plc 
that deal collapsed on oct 13 sparking a 190point plunge in 
the dow jones industrial average after banks refused to finance it 
due in part to opposition by the machinists 
peterpaul said this deal would be more attractive to lenders 
because it involves about 2 billion less debt and has the 
participation of all three unions which represent about twothirds 
of ual employees 
ual is the secondlargest us carrier after american airlines

sen edward m kennedy attacked the bush 
administration thursday for giving mere lip service to the fight 
to end bigotry while the white house renewed both support for 
civil rights and its threat to veto a bill the massachusetts 
democrat is sponsoring 
the administrations veto threat underscores the sharp 
contrast between its words and its deeds on civil rights said 
kennedy whose bill to combat job bias is a major goal of civil 
rights forces in congress this year 
kennedys comments came after presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters at the white house that the administration 
is for civil rights legislation but we are simply not for 
that bill 
the kennedy bill is aimed at restoring legal tools that civil 
rights forces say were taken away by six supreme court decisions 
last year provisions range from a ban on harassment of employees 
to expanding workers rights to challenge seniority systems based 
on discrimination 
the heart of the bill based on a case at a salmon cannery in 
alaska would force employers accused of discrimination to change 
their hiring practices or prove that the practices were based on 
business necessity 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in his letter to kennedy 
on tuesday that this provision aimed at overturning the supreme 
courts wards cove decision last year would in effect result 
in racial hiring quotas 
kennedy said in his statement that while giving lip service to 
the fight to end bigotry the administration is clinging to its 
doaslittleaspossible response to the supreme courts recent 
decisions which dramatically cut back on longaccepted protections 
for working men and women against discrimination on the job 
the administration is digging in its heels at a time when a 
bipartisan majority in the congress and the country want to see 
those decisions overturned and the gaps in our civil rights laws 
filled kennedy said 
the bush administration is calling for approval of a more modest 
jobdiscrimination bill which would address two of last years 
rulings 
we are interested in correcting problems which arose from last 
years supreme court cases fitzwater said 
kennedys senate labor and human resources committee on 
wednesday approved his measure 115 with support from sens david 
durenberger rminn and james jeffords rvt durenberger told 
the panel that the administration would not act on civil rights 
without pressure from the committee 
the measure now has 40 senate cosponsors and civil rights 
forces say they have enough votes for passage but conservative 
critics led by sen orrin hatch rutah say they hope to ease some 
of its provisions in floor action 
hatch told the committee that the measure would create a 
bonanza for lawyers while sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
declared that it would add litigation

moslem guerrillas fired on a 
surrender ceremony in afghanistan friday in which 10000 rebels 
were giving up to the sovietbacked government and more than 12 
people were killed kabul radio said the major rebel organization 
jamaitiislami said the surrender was a trick planned five months 
ago to trap government forces 
two afghan generals one of them a deputy security minister 
nine guerrillas and several civilians died in the closerange 
battle that broke out during the ceremony in northwestern herat 
province the official afghan broadcast said 
jamiatiislami islamic society is considered the most 
militarily efficient of the seven pakistanbased resistance groups 
and the dominant one in the herat area 
numerous diplomats based in the afghan capital of kabul and 
foreign journalists were flown especially to herat for the ceremony 
and witnessed the attack the radio said 
western diplomats in pakistan speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they had reports that up to five afghan generals 
were killed or wounded in the 15minute gunbattle and in 
handtohand combat with knives and pistols 
kabul radio made no mention of five generals 
the radio monitored in islamabad reported a small group of 
extremists attacked the welcome ceremony with heavy fire in the 
resulting battle between afghan troops and extremists numerous 
people were martyred 
the broadcast said guerrillas shot and killed lt gen jalal 
razaminda who was also a deputy security minister and wounded 
herat provincial gov fazle haq khaliq yaar as they embraced 
guerrilla leaders who vowed to give up their weapons and join 
president najibs national reconcilation policy 
a second general died later on a military plane to kabul it 
said his identity was not immediately released 
national reconcilation is a term used by the government in which 
local guerrilla groups agree to switch sides and either stop 
fighting or help the government fight the government says tens of 
thousands of rebels joined national reconcilation the past year 
but mujahedeen sources in quetta southeast pakistan said 
fridays attack was first planned five months ago and was 
apparently aimed to avenge a similar attack by government troops 11 
years ago 
according to the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the guerrillas slowly began infiltrating the area in november and 
then sent word recently that they wanted to surrender 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
have been fighting to overthrow the government that seized power in 
a 1978 coup and installed a marxist regime the mujahedeen are 
backed by the united states and saudi arabia and are based in 
neighboring pakistan 
according to radio kabul 2200 armed guerrillas and 8000 
unarmed rebels gathered on the plains about 25 miles from herat 
city for the surrender ceremony 
but instead of surrendering their weapons the guerrilla 
fighters turned them on government officials and army troops the 
mujahedeen sources said 
the guerrillas reportedly were armed with weapons ranging from 
side arms to recoilless cannons missiles and rocket launchers 
they fired the first shot as the governor embraced an 
unidentified rebel commander dressed in a white robe and turban 
according to western diplomats and mujahedeen leaders in pakistan 
the governors guards immediately fired back and the plain 
erupted in great volleys of gunfire from both sides they said 
several civilians including children were killed in the 
crossfire that was cut short when two afghan army tanks moved into 
the area and broke up the crowd with bursts of fire the diplomats 
said 
a photographer from afghan national television was reportedly 
shot in the head and seriously wounded 
herat district was the first region in afghanistan to rise 
against the soviet union in early 1979 before the red army 
intervened to prop up the marxist government 
that uprising cost at least 2000 afghan lives when government 
troops pretended to join the rebellion against widening soviet 
influence in the country 
the kremlin pulled out its troops in february 1989 but continues 
to pour an estimated 300 million a month in supplies and weapons 
into kabul 
the leading rebel commander in the district is jamiatiislamis 
ismail khan a former government officer 
herat has been fought over conquered and destroyed since it was 
founded by the persians more than 2500 years ago it was captured 
and destroyed by alexander the great in 330 bc by genghis khan 
in 1221 and by tamerlane a century later 
once famed as afghanistans most beautiful city much of it is 
deserted and in ruins lack of law and order has earned it the 
nickname of afghanistans wild west

coupon connie was sentenced friday to 27 
months in prison for her role in a 2 million scheme to swap and 
redeem hundreds of thousands of bogus coupons 
i can say a lot of nasty things but i wont a tearyeyed 
connie arvidson said after the sentence she intends to appeal 
mrs arvidson 34 of boca raton fla was convicted in federal 
court of two counts of mail fraud and one of conspiracy 
also known as the dumpster lady mrs arvidson was one of 10 
people indicted in a scheme that saw more than 600000 illegal 
copies of coupons distributed nationwide from texas the coupons 
for products from 47 companies were printed in san antonio 
prosecutors said mrs arvidson purchased the bogus coupons from 
san antonio counterfeiter david rackmill who pleaded guilty to 
mail fraud and conspiracy then acted as an informant in the case 
in the trial which began jan 8 federal prosecutors contended 
mrs arvidsons claims that she dug through the trash to find 
coupons to sell were false 
you know what trash looks like prosecutor paulina jacobo 
told jurors it doesnt come in nice bundles and get shipped by 
ups mrs arvidson knew what she was doing 
prosecutors said she made as much as 40000 in one year but 
mrs arvidson estimated the most she ever made was 200 a week from 
collecting and trading coupons 
in addition to the 27month prison term she was sentenced to 
three years of supervised release the maximum penalty under the 
sentencing formula the judge used the formula takes into account 
her lack of a criminal record 
before sentencing mrs arvidson told us district judge sidney 
fitzwater i would never do anything to break the law in any way 
i would never hurt anyone 
mrs arvidson called coupon clipping my american dream 
adding that when i saw so many coupons i guess i just let greed 
take over 
fitzwater said mrs arvidson was unrepentant and tried to cover 
up when she realized postal inspectors were investigating her and 
that she lied on the witness stand 
earlier friday fitzwater sentenced fellow coupon conspirator 
david reese of center point to 24 months in prison and two years 
supervised release 
a third defendant printer james floyd richards of san antonio 
was cleared of all three counts against him the seven others 
indicted in the case agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in 
exchange for leniency and several of them them testified against 
mrs arvidson

wrapping up a week of designer fashion shows in 
new york friday geoffrey beene presented sleek uniforminspired 
clothes and anchored his ensembles with insets in the shape of 
triangles 
i always try to keep the collection as contemporary as 
possible said beene who has opted for stark dramatic looks 
that establish his niche as an american designer 
control discipline fullness and sensuous severity are beenes 
own words for characterizing the collection which includes 
functional anklelength jersey tent dresses in dark tones such as 
black or gray with leather insets somber shades of loden taupe 
wine and chocolate contribute to the sense of austerity 
strapon accessories such as a strip of leather sweep over the 
shoulder militarystyle 
when you think of beene think of triangles which apper 
throughout the collection at the hipbone above the bust along 
the neck and within a fluttering hemline a black evening column 
dress showed off a gold triangle quilted onto the bodice and a 
black suit had triangles of red satin at the shoulder blade its 
all part of beenes love affair with geometric shapes 
beene continued his tradition of shunning traditional lines 
hell take a curve whenever he can he showed a wool fleece and 
quilted satin bolero with seams streaming from the bust down both 
sleeves and beene uses curved hems which move fashion from an 
applied art to a fine art says fashion arbiter eleanor lambert 
creator of the 50yearold international bestdressed list 
beene also showed jumpsuits another longtime favorite which he 
considers the most functional piece of clothing in the 
collection 
another trademark look is the short buoyant full evening skirt 
of silk combined with a fitted bodice sometimes with point 
desprit 
hes the quintessential american designer superb tops 
says ellin saltzman senior vice president and fashion director of 
rh macy amp co inc 
meanwhile donna karan introduced a collection dedicated to 
pure comfort luxury and sensuality chock full of shades of 
brown grays beiges and taupes in fabrics such as cashmere 
furry alpaca fleece wool crepe jersey lacquer sequins and 
velvet the collection exudes a sense of softness and ease 
monochromatic ensembles predominate with matching opaque hose 
and shoes 
emphasis is on the unconstructed jacket in an updated longer 
length worn over a narrow unitard for a neat linear look the 
unitard is often paired with a short circular skirt with lots of 
swing fairly buoyant with movement also capturing the wave of 
motion are circular coats over unitards 
for evening karan creates dramatic contrast by teaming black 
velvet with white lacquer sequins a black velvet circular 
wraparound coat with a matching stretch velvet dress was set off 
by an oyster lacquer sequin scarf creating a striking play of tone

blass and dellolio for anne klein who are knocking down 
distinctions between day and nighttime looks like blass who is 
showing strapless gray cashmere for evening karan offers an 
oversize gray cashmere offtheshoulder cowl sweater teamed with a 
platinum sequin draped skirt

authorities are investigating complaints that 
guards at a federal holding center for illegal aliens are 
physically and psychologically abusing inmates in some instances 
locking them in portable bathrooms 
us rep dante fascell dfla and a panel of dade county 
officials said they have received complaints that guards at the 
krome detention center conducted routine strip searches and beat 
inmates taunting them with comments like go back home because 
you have no right to be here 
other complaints included locking the inmates in portable 
bathrooms and forcing them to kneel and raise their hands while 
being ridiculed 
fascell said he has asked attorney general richard thornburgh to 
investigate 
richard smith the ins district director in miami said he sent 
documents alleging abuse to the us justice department three weeks 
ago and supports an investigation george waldroup a spokesman for 
ins in miami refused to comment on the investigation friday 
the krome detention center is a converted nike missile base on 
the edge of the everglades south of miami that serves as a 
holding area for illegal aliens mostly haitians 
it was built in the early 1980s at the height of the mariel 
boatlift to house the flood of exiles from cuba the facility 
generally houses about 450 but that number can double at times 
the us immigration and naturalization service says it is 
required by law to hold illegal aliens there pending expulsion 
proceedings 
we haitians are especially mad because we always get the worst 
treatment here said one haitian quoted in an affidavit he like 
other detainees quoted in the documents wasnt named for fear of 
reprisal 
cheryl little an attorney for the haitian refugee center in 
miami said there are alleged acts of physical abuse mental 
abuse lack of proper medical care improper access to baths and 
showers not enough time to finish meals lack of access to 
telephones 
we were told that one haitian had his head smashed on a metal 
banister and he was carried away on a stretcher she said 
little said she has more than 100 affidavits that allege 
incidents and name guards involved she said many of the same names 
keep arising in the affidavits 
im not suggesting that everyone there is abusive she said 
there are employees there who may not have engaged in abuse but 
who condoned it 
the us attorneys office in miami refused to discuss the 
investigation saying through a spokeswoman we do not have any 
charges filed against krome detention center at this time but the 
us attorneys office would be interested in violation of federal 
law at krome or any other federal facility

the united states and soviet union scaled back 
expectations friday for reaching a major missilereduction 
agreement at next months superpower summit but narrowed 
differences over german unification and the flight of soviet jews 
to israel 
secretary of state james a baker iii said moscow had dropped 
its insistence that a reunified germany be neutral there was a 
recognition that perhaps neutrality is perhaps not the best route 
to go he said 
baker also said the two sides had failed to resolve differences 
over airlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles two obstacles 
for agreement on a strategic arms reduction treaty start that 
is a disappointment baker said 
baker will go to the soviet union to hold another round of talks 
may 1619 on the weapons issues its still our hope that major 
issues will be resolved by the summit but thats got to take a lot 
of work he said at a news conference 
in the windup of three days of highlevel ussoviet talks 
president bush cautioned soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze that a crackdown against the breakaway republic of 
lithuania would be a setback to superpower relations 
i dont think we are telling them what to do were telling 
them what not to do and that is dont use force bush said 
later 
we have an awful lot at stake in the ussoviet relationship 
an enormous amount at stake bush said at an appearance before 
the convention of the american society of newspaper editors it 
gets into arms control it gets into human rights the exit of 
soviet jews it gets into regional questions 
separately shevardnadze told reporters we have a clear 
conscience on lithuania renewing a pledge to work out a peaceful 
settlement shevardnadze said i dont think there is a basis for 
a deterioration in ussoviet relations 
and baker at the end of three days of talks with the soviet 
diplomat credited moscow with trying to resolve the situation 
peaceably of course he added i would be disturbed if i 
thought conflict might erupt he said 
the president and the foreign minister met at the white house 
for 2 hours and 20 minutes more than twice as long as scheduled 
in preliminary discussions for bushs fiveday summit with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev beginning may 30 
this summit will certainly become a major event in world 
affairs shevardnadze said afterward standing under an umbrella 
in a cold rain outside the white house 
similarly bush said later this is an important time for 
discussion and dialogue 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush viewed 
fridays meeting as extensive cordial and productive 
i dont think there have been any breakthroughs fitzwater 
said adding that much of the meeting had been focused on setting 
the agenda for the summit 
both the united states and soviet union expressed reservations 
about being able to resolve the major issues for a new treaty to 
reduce longrange nuclear weapons before the summit a goal they 
set for themselves when bush met gorbachev last year in malta 
shevardnadze said i would not hide from you the fact that 
we have encountered certain difficulties certain problems in 
washington for a strategic arms reduction treaty 
this is a time of hard choices the hard choices that one has 
to make in the concluding stages of the talks the foreign 
minister said he said the problem was compounded by the need to 
write a treaty that would be approved by a newly independent soviet 
parliament 
nevertheless he predicted in the end there will be real 
certainty that we will have a solid agreement a durable 
agreement 
fitzwater said both sides still hope for agreement on major 
provisions of the treaty by the summit however he said the 
nature of some of these issues is difficult enough that theres 
certainly no guarantee at this time that well have a final treaty 
ready to sign 
he said that is our hope and that is our goal but im not 
sure at this point in time we can say that we can expect it 
shevardnadze gave bush a letter from gorbachev on the subject of 
arms control but both sides declined to disclose its contents 
shevardnadze said that at the summit bush and gorbachev would be 
able to sign a draft agreement on trade cooperation in science and 
technology arms control and bilateral relations 
the foreign minister took a conciliatory stance on the 
unification of east germany a soviet ally with west germany the 
linchpin of nato 
we have to look for a solution a solution that would be 
acceptable to both nato and the warsaw pact shevardnadze said 
he did not offer any specifics beyond a suggestion that perhaps 
the merged country could be part both of nato and the warsaw pact 
and said it is possible that we will be able to find a mutually 
acceptable way a way that will make sure that a unified germany is 
a factor for stability in europe and that it never threatens 
anyone 
baker said that while the soviets had eased their demand that a 
unified germany be neutral they continued to object to its 
membership in nato he said the idea of germany being in both 
alliances was not attractive 
we were equally firm in our view that the unified germany must 
remain a member of nato baker said 
in another area shevardnadze said the soviets were willing to 
implement an agreement for direct flights of jewish refugees to 
israel provided israel gave assurances they would not be settled 
in the occupied territories 
he said he included east jerusalem as part of the occupied 
territories as well as the west bank and gaza 
shevardnadze also held out the prospect of resuming normal 
diplomatic ties with israel after a 23year lapse depending on 
the overall middle east situation 
on the thorny issue of lithuania there was little indication of 
any movement it was primarily for both sides to repeat their 
positions he said 
bush said he told gorbachev the united states supports the right 
of lithuania to selfdetermination and never recognized its 
incorporation into the soviet union 
and i told minister shevardnadze that this is an issue that 
could adversely affect the prospects for progress in these 
important ussoviet relations bush told the newspaper editors 
and i urged the soviet union to begin a good faith dialogue 
with lithuania we want and we believe the soviets want to make 
further progress in ussoviet relations

a teenager was sentenced to six months in 
jail as a result of a neighbor taking photographs of him beating 
his family dog authorities said 
animal rights advocates said it was the first time in at least 
20 years that anyone in massachusetts had been imprisoned for 
abusing an animal 
this shows that something can be done in cases like these and 
it certainly sends a message to people that animal cruelty will not 
be tolerated said allan davidson director of the lowell humane 
society where champ is in protective custody 
kevin deschene 19 of lowell was sentenced thursday on a 
conviction for a misdemeanor complaint of cruelty to animals 
deschenes neighbor jim molloy said he had seen deschene on 
several occasions beating and kicking the german shepherd while it 
was chained to a post 
molloy took pictures of deschene kicking and beating deschenes 
familys dog named champ with a plank last fall 
i had no idea that beating the dog was a crime when i took the 
pictures said molloy i just hoped they would take the dog 
away and save the poor thing 
deschene and his family have contended the teenager was 
disciplining the dog for tearing up garbage 
deschenes attorney argued in court that as in domestic 
disputes involving people there should be no conviction because 
the victim was not seriously injured 
judge james killam said champ was helpless and was without the 
option of leaving or obtaining a restraining order as do people in 
abusive situations 
in addition to the jail term killam fined deschene 500 and 
ordered him to perform one day of community service per month for 
two years 
champs fate will be decided at a custody hearing may 3 when 
duschenes family will attempt to retrieve the dog from the custody 
of the humane society

president bush said friday he would issue the 
executive order he promised last fall to guarantee that chinese 
students who fear for their safety if they return home may remain 
in the united states 
i did say i was going to have an executive order what we had 
was an executive directive from the president bush said 
in a written statement later the president said he had 
recognized that his directive had not addressed two important 
issues extending deportation action against chinese nationals 
until jan 1 1994 and taking steps to alleviate concerns about 
china revoking passports 
the comments came in the wake of news stories that bush failed 
to issue the executive order to assure no chinese students would be 
returned to their homeland against their will 
he told newspaper editors that the executive order will protect 
students from deportation beyond the current deferral of enforced 
departure that is scheduled to expire june 5 
bushs previous directive said students in this country as of 
june 5 last year would be protected from deportation students who 
arrived after that date which is when beijing began its violent 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators are not specifically 
covered in bushs executive order 
but an administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonmyity said the later arrivals will be given the same 
consideration on visa waivers as those here as of june 5 1989 
who are specifically written into the order 
answering questions at a gathering of the american society of 
newspaper editors bush also said he soon will announce an offshore 
oil drilling policy that will include banning drilling in some 
environmentally sensitive areas and will redfine sea lanes for 
tankers in other regions 
bush last year ordered a task force to study offshore drilling 
with an eye to environmental protection he has yet to announce the 
findings of the study or any policy moves 
bush a former texas oil man said there should not be a 
permanent ban on offshore drilling because then i would be 
compelled to ask the question where do we get the energy to keep 
this country going i dont think there should be a ban 
however he added there will definitely be bans on certain 
environmentally sensitive areas 
he said he would push for tanker sea lanes to be rerouted in the 
florida everglades hinting at the same prospect for californias 
coast 
on the china matter bush said he would issue an executive order 
incorporating all the provisions in his november presidential 
directive telling the justice department how to deal with chinese 
students in the united states 
we dont want to take a chance on people being mistreated 
brutalized bush said 
the promise came a day after his press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters that an executive order was not the 
right tool to accomplish what the president had done by directive 
however bush was criticized by congressional sponsors of 
legislation he vetoed nov 30 that would have put into law 
assurances the chinese nationals could remain here when their visas 
expire 
on other matters bush told the editors 
former president carter was not acting with the blessing of 
nor disapproval of or anything else of the administration during 
his trip this week to the middle east where he met with palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat 
he was acting in this meeting on his own i knew nothing about 
that and certainly a former president should be free to do his 
thing 
he is not linking aid to israel to us hopes that israel works 
out a negotiating format for peace with palestinians 
he hoped a compromise budget plan to reduce the huge federal 
deficit could be forced but he noted that one congressional 
deadline had already been missed and another was fast approaching

i am also pleased to declare that the contacts and 
arrangements under way now include mrs jacqueline valente her

halt as staff protested the odious act and the prolonged 
anxiety caused by the kidnappers continuing silence an icrc

a kidnapped senator released by the 
medellin cocaine cartel said friday the group is preparing a new 
peace proposal in its war with the government 
the announcement came two days after president virgilio barco 
indicated the government might be easing off its policy of 
extraditing drug suspects to the united states 
also friday a presidential candidate called for legalizing 
drugs in colombia saying the government has lost its war against 
the drug traffickers 
authorities meanwhile announced traffickers were responsible for 
placing a huge truck bomb thursday morning in a wealthy bogota 
neighborhood they said it was safely deactivated 
the truck loaded with 1650 pounds of dynamite was capable of 
killing 5000 people had it exploded in the suburb where it was 
placed secret police chief gen miguel maza marquez said at a news 
conference friday 
mazas own apartment is just off the avenue where the truck was 
abandoned 
sen federico estrada was kidnapped by the cartel in medellin on 
tuesday and released thursday drug traffickers told him that they 
were readying a new peace plan to present to the government 
estrada said at a news conference friday 
however he said he did not know the details of the proposal 
on jan 17 the cartels leaders offered to surrender themselves 
and their illicit business in exchange for an end to extradition of 
suspects to the united states the government said the extradiction 
of suspects was not negotiable 
however that position seemed to change wednesday when barco 
said medellin cartel leader pablo escobar would be tried in 
colombia if he turned himself in the president made the statement 
while on a state visit to france 
a cartel communique last week pledged new terrorist attacks in 
retaliation for the governments refusal to end its policy of 
extraditing traffickers 
barcos government has sent 15 trafficking suspects to the 
united states for trial since intensifying its crackdown in august 
when traffickers killed a leading presidential candidate 
since then more than 200 people have been killed by terrorist 
attacks blamed on traffickers 
the cartel had threatened to bomb a bogota neighborhood and to 
kill police as part of the renewed offensive gunmen working for 
the traffickers shot 16 police officers and a soldier this week in 
the northwestern city of medellin authorities said 
at his news conference estrada indicated that barcos latest 
statement may have dissuaded the traffickers from carrying out more 
attacks 
in a television broadcast friday night on programa 
conservative presidential candidate alvaro gomez hurdado a 
70yearold lawyer and journalist conducting his third race for the 
presidency said the government had lost its war with the 
traffickers

minnesota democrats are formally asking the 
house to investigate allegations that rep arlan stangeland 
rminn improperly charged congress for hundreds of phone calls to 
and from the home of a woman lobbyist 
the complaint being filed with the house committee on standards 
of official conduct also accuses stangeland of exchanging favors 
with a former congressman who now works as a lobbyist 
the allegations were made public in newspaper articles last 
january stangeland who is seeking reelection has denied any 
impropriety 
i dont think the questions have been answered ruth 
stanoch chairwoman of the minnesota democratic party said friday 
theyre still lingering right now 
stangeland has said he welcomed the ethics investigation even 
though he believed it was unnecessary 
stangeland says that his relationship with eve jarvis who now 
works for the house of representatives was professional although 
he acknowledged making 341 calls to or from her home during five 
months in 1986 and 1987 
stangeland said initially that some of the phone calls might 
have been personal but has since insisted that they were all made 
for business purposes ms jarvis has refused to talk to reporters 
stangeland also denied he did anything wrong in using a car 
owned by former rep gene snyder rky and in letting the 
lobbyist use his capitol parking space 
ms stanoch said the complaint was filed with the committee but 
returned to the state party for democratic leaders to verify that 
they could not get a member of congress to request the 
investigation

the armys deputy chief of staff said friday 
that a combined syrian jordanian and iraqi force could threaten 
israels borders in the years ahead but played down iraqs present 
capability to destroy israel 
the comments over israel television by gen enud barak came in 
reponse to threats this week by president saddam hussein of iraq 
who said his country had chemical weapons and would destroy half 
of israel if attacked 
i think saddam will weigh a decision more than twice before 
he even thinks about attacking israel with chemical weapons 
barak said in the interview a rare tv appearance by a highranking 
military officer 
barak said in talking of a possible combined arab push against 
israel we must prepare ourselves for it as if it will come to 
pass however we should not see in these preparations a certainty 
that this will happen 
barak called saddam a sane and experienced leader who knew how 
to size up the jewish states military capabilities with those of 
iraq better than any israeli citizen 
however barak emphasized the need to stop iraqs attempts to 
build nuclear capability before it was too late 
he praised a joint usbritish operation that resulted in five 
arrests in a purported plot to smuggle detonators for nuclear 
weapons to baghdad 
there is no doubt that iraq has not ceased its attempt to 
reach nuclear capability actions like that of the americans and 
british are important and proper the general said 
on tuesday government officials called for a special program to 
distribute gas masks to every israeli citizen in preparation for a 
surprise attack 
the friday newscast repeated instructions on use of gas masks 
after baraks interview

parliament voted friday to eliminate the 
dreaded sb secret police the old uniformed interior ministry and 
the citizens militia in a dramatic assertion of civilian control 
by the solidarityled government 
the interior ministry is to become a smaller civilianrun 
office it had been staffed by uniformed functionaries along 
military lines and was considered part of the national defense 
system 
the new ministry will oversee the newly created police and 
office of state protection firefighters and a border guard that 
will be separated from the army 
members of the citizens militia the paramilitary force 
previously charged with fighting crime and enforcing the law can 
automatically become police officers similar to those in western 
countries 
secret police officers hired before august 1989 when poland got 
its first noncommunist prime minister in four decades will be 
dismissed only those officers who pass a review process proving 
they are innocent of past abuses will be rehired into the new 
smaller office of state protection 
the sb monitored and harassed dissidents and even ordinary 
citizens to maintain the communist partys grip on power in poland 
the office of state protection is to limit its activities to 
fighting espionage and authentic threats to national security 
the changes were adopted in three separate bills 
sb officers murdered the prosolidarity priest the rev jerzy 
popieluszko in 1984 and were suspected in scores of political 
killings a parliamentary commission is working to uncover past sb 
abuses 
as a safeguard the new interior ministry is to include a 
civilian advisory commission 
local governments for the first time will be permitted to 
establish their own police force 
the secret police force was pared from 24000 officers last june 
to 3100 this year the government has said some reportedly took 
early retirement and some were permitted to transfer to the 
citizens militia after retraining 
the citizens militia has an estimated 80000 officers 
nationwide

killings 
attorney frank sinclair said two inmates told him they saw two 
men hanged and three thrown off balconies enraged prisoners then

being hung and killed said sinclair 
prisoner derek white 46 died in north manchester hospital on 
tuesday of injuries he received at the hands of other inmates when 
the riot began he was in the prison awaiting trial on charges of

a preview exhibit of robert mapplethorpes 
sexually explicit photographs opened friday night just hours after 
a judges ruling gave prosecutors a free hand to act against the 
show 
the photos once denounced by us sen jesse helms and the 
target of a large local protest drew an overflow crowd for a 
preview open only to members of the contemporary arts center it 
was to open to the public saturday 
an hour after the show opened a museum attendant estimated 
1000 people had already seen the photos and a blocklong line 
formed outside there was no protest at the preview began though 
several hundred demonstrators showed up earlier friday for a court 
hearing more than 3000 tickets were sold 
at the hearing hamilton county municipal judge edward donnellon 
dismissed a lawsuit by the arts center seeking a ruling on whether 
the show was obscene the suit was seen as an attempt to preempt 
any effort by local authorities to close the show donnellon 
dismissed the suit for lack of legal standing 
after the ruling prosecutors declined to say whether they would 
press obscenity charges 
we can do a lot of things im not going to tell you what 
were going to do hamilton county prosecutor arthur ney jr 
said i cant discuss anything that i may could should or might 
do 
arts center lawyer marc mezibov said the exhibit will open to 
the public as scheduled 
the show will go on mezibov said i would assume as 
public officials if they intend to bring criminal charges they 
would have brought that to the attention of the court 
however another lawyer representing the arts center said he 
feared authorities will move against the exhibit 
in this county you always live with a certain degree of 
fear said the lawyer h louis sirkin 
hamilton county is a hub for antipornography activities a 
citizens group has dubbed nine of mapplethorpes works obscene and 
demanded that they be banned from the 175photograph exhibit 
last month sheriff simon leis jr declared that the photographs 
were criminally obscene that was one reason the art center went to 
court expecting charges 
in june the mapplethorpe exhibit was canceled at the corcoran 
gallery of art in washington dc 
the exhibit of the work by mapplethorpe who died of aids in 
march 1989 prompted congress to limit funding to the arts after 
helms rnc declared the photographs obscene 
it has been shown in philadelphia chicago hartford conn 
berkeley calif and boston 
the exhibit includes photographs of homosexual and 
sadomasochistic sex acts 
several hundred supporters and opponents of the mapplethorpe 
exhibit gathered in front of the courthouse friday afternoon during 
the hearing police kept the two sides separate 
supporters carried banners that said if you give artists 
freedom of expression soon every american will want it 
opponents signs said we want decency in cincinnati and god 
is against pornography so are we 
the show is scheduled to run through may 26 warning signs about 
the photos content are posted at the center door and no one under 
age 18 will be admitted 
during the hearing assistant city solicitor karl kadon accused 
the arts center of making the photographic exhibit a public issue 
he said he also objected to the top law enforcement officials of 
the city and county being painted as neanderthal barbarians of 
some sort 
assistant prosecuting attorney robert taylor representing the 
county also took umbrage at the art centers lawsuit 
were not going to let the cac or anybody from new york come 
into hamilton county and dictate to our elected officials what we 
will and will not do taylor said

a judge on friday ordered 25 newspapers and 
television stations to give police all film and photographs of last 
weekends antitax riot in london 
a dozen organizations immediately opposed the order two said 
they were willing to hand over what they published and the 
remaining 11 neither opposed nor consented 
judge neil denison issued the order after a day of legal 
argument ruling the film would help police and that it was in 
the overriding public interest 
however he said in other cases the public interest may be 
better served by allowing the news media to report events freely 
and each case should be decided on its merits 
it is right as has been argued that the court should not 
automatically or routinely grant such orders denison said it 
should not be seen to be rubberstamping such applications 
the new organizations reacted angrily 
if we are seen to be a potential arm of the state journalists 
are going to be targets of the rioters said tvam news director 
jeff berliner 
geoffrey shaw lawyer for the bbc and tvam argued there had 
been 2750 police officers at the poll tax demonstration 
they should not require the media to be their eyes and ears 
if they want film it is reasonable to expect them to take it 
themselves shaw said 
shaw said the news media would face increased dangers if all 
reporting material could eventually become available to police 
the riot broke out last saturday after 40000 had gathered for a 
peaceful demonstration to protest the new poll tax by prime 
minister margaret thatchers government 
police were attacked automobiles burned and overturned shop 
windows smashed and shops looted 
police said 339 of the 3000 people who took part in the 
sixhour street battles were arrested police also said 374 
officers and 86 civilians were injured 
scotland yard detective chief superintendent roy ramm who is in 
charge investigating the riot testified that access to all 
published and unpublished film and photographs would help him get a 
clearer picture of the event 
ramm said the photographs taken by police and videotape taken 
from traffic cameras and a helicopter were insufficient 
he said the investigation needed as much material as possible to 
identify people and to follow from pictures their activities during 
the demonstration people pictured in a nonviolent photograph might 
be identified committing acts of violence or damage in another 
ramm said 
the newspapers and television companies ordered to submit film 
include all the major british daily and sunday newspapers and the 
major television companies 
editors have seven days to comply with the orders expected to 
be signed by denison on monday

majority leader george mitchell played the

of nevada las vegas for its 10373 mens basketball championship 
victory over duke 
the resolution which passed by a voice vote would have been 
routine except that sen terry sanford dnc was presiding over 
the senate at the time 
sanford was president of duke from 1969 to 1985 
sanford had to listen to a description of the bill praising the 
runnin rebels for their ncaa championship then decree that the 
resolution was passed 
if there is no objection the preamble and the resolution are 
agreed too he said 
mitchell then got up and said 
although there is no resolution to that effect in view of the 
resolution just adopted and the presiding officers former role as 
president of duke university i think we ought to also take a 
moment to commend the blue devils of duke for a great season and a 
valiant effort in getting to the final four although they lost to 
the university of nevada at los vegas and i know my distinguished 
colleagues will join me in paying tribute to them

he grabbed a flight attendant announced he had a bomb and demanded 
that the houstontolas vegas flight go to cuba instead

737 at austins robert mueller municipal airport and a police 
officer climbed up an emergency chute and overpowered him 
no bomb was discovered but a device made of a toothpaste 
container and a flashlighttype article was found on the 
airliner authorities said 
he is charged with air piracy and assault 
its his position at this point that he will proceed that he 
was not sane at the time of the event and therefore that will be 
his defense said gonzalezgonzalezs attorney benny ray 
prosecutor kelly loving said i dont think its appropriate 
for me to comment on the evidence itself until we go to trial 
anyone could deduce that if youre competent now it sheds some 
question on the person being insane at the time of the offense 
if convicted of air piracy he faces 20 years to life in prison 
the assault charge carries a maximum 10year sentence

ethiopian air force jets killed 46 and 
wounded 82 in raids on the red sea port of massawa and the northern 
town of afabet eritrean rebels said thursday 
in separate reports the eritrean peoples liberation front said 
planes dropped cluster bombs on both towns in raids tuesday and 
wednesday 
israel has been accused of supplying cluster bombs to ethiopia 
a charge denied by both governments 
cluster bombs typically explode above ground level hurling 
shards of metal over a wide area they are particularly effective 
against massed troop formations 
the report of the air raid could not be independently confirmed 
and the government made no mention of it however a handful of 
reporters allowed into eritrea in recent weeks have confirmed past 
air raids on the port 
the united nations had hoped to use massawa as the port of entry 
for some 1 million tons of emergency food needed to relieve an 
estimated 4 to 5 million famine victims in northern ethiopia this 
year 
in a radio broadcast monitored in nairobi the rebels said 30 
people were killed and 58 injured in wednesdays raid on massawa 
the broadcast said most of the victims were women and children 
in a later report telexed to the associated press in nairobi 
from their london office the rebels said 16 were killed and 24 
injured on tuesday in afabet 60 miles northwest of massawa 
the rebels said the afabet strike was carried out by two 
sovietbuilt mig fighters and was concentrated on the center of the 
town near its main mosque 
the rebels captured massawa one of only two ethiopian ports on 
the red sea on feb 11 three days after launching a massive new 
offensive in the countrys northernmost province 
the rebels have been fighting for autonomy for ethiopias 
northern province since 1962

the finnish consulate in leningrad has 
issued visas to about 100 soviet jews the foreign ministry 
reported opening a new transit route from the soviet union to 
israel 
the visas allow the emigrants to stay in finland for up to five 
days they may also apply for asylum in finland the ministry said 
jaakko blomberg chief of the foreign ministrys political 
department said in a statement the decision was in line with the 
human right of free travel 
but in apparent response to protests by the palestine liberation 
organization blomberg said finland asked israel not to move the

israel says only a small fraction of newly arrived soviet 
immigrants settle in the occupied west bank or gaza strip 
some palestinians want the occupied lands to become a separate

a farreaching clean air bill goes to the 
house floor after clearing a committee by a 421 vote moving 
congress a step closer to enacting tougher air pollution controls 
the energy and commerce committee approved the complex and 
costly clean air package late thursday after resolving the thorny 
issue of helping midwest utilities cope with tougher acid rain 
controls 
the acid rain compromise approved 394 aims to help midwest 
states pay for cleaning up pollution caused by utility plants by 
providing a pollution allowance system and a oneyear extension 
for initial compliance in some cases 
critics of the measure have said it would cause electric rates 
to jump legislation passed by the senate earlier this week 
includes a similar provision

congressional auditors warned today that last

billion short and called on the bush administration to come up with 
a plan to raise the money 
the general accounting office in its highestyet estimate said 
it will cost the government 325 billion to close or sell failed 
thrift institutions thats greater than the annual budget of the 
defense department 
the new projection is up a sharp 26 percent from a 257 billion 
estimate the gao offered only five months ago and it is based on 
admittedly optimistic assumptions about interest rates rescue 
costs and the number of sampl failures comptroller general charles 
a bowsher who heads the gao told the senate banking committee 
in his prepared testimony bowsher called on treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady and federal deposit insurance corp chairman l 
william seidman who is administering the bailout to develop

labors traditional allies in congress are 
steering clear of the greyhound strike because bus passengers dont 
carry political clout and lawmakers are skittish about taking sides 
in the violent dispute legislators and others say 
members of congress fly in airplanes they dont ride buses 
these passengers tend to be poor folks who are not active 
politically said rep tom downey dny 
democrats who sometimes take the lead on labor issues also said 
president bushs handsoff approach to such disputes he vetoed a 
unionbacked plan to help settle the eastern airlines strike has 
inhibited lawmakers from jumping into the fray 
congress historically has sat on the sidelines for months before 
injecting itself in labormanagement disputes and neither 
greyhound nor striking drivers who walked out five weeks ago has 
asked congress to intervene

democratic gov robert p casey is an unyielding foe of 
abortion contrary to his national party platform caseys chief 
republican challenger state auditor general barbara hafer is 
firmly prochoice a position that puts her at odds with the gop 
national platform 
while leaders of both parties say they can accommodate people on 
both sides of the issue a caseyhafer contest could test the 
loyalties of many rankandfile members in both parties 
caseys and hafers views on abortion also have attracted two 
more candidates to the gubernatorial race an antiabortion 
republican and a prochoice democrat campaigning almost exclusively 
on the abortion issue

newspaper life has fallen on hard times no 
smoking in the city room computers instead of typewriters phones 
that chirp reporters who go straight home after work columnists 
who regularly appear on tv 
abcs capital news about the inmates of the mythical 
powerful washington capital of washington dc faithfully 
reproduces all these modern ills it has a firstrate cast there 
even are some funny lines 
alas its script also has more familiar feats of fourth estate 
than you can shake an editor at why the troops even expose a 
rotten slumlord in only a few hours and some of the cityroom 
dialogue has to be heard to be disbelieved 
it includes i want to document what cracks doing to that 
neighborhood and im way behind on a frontpage story and 
this paper does not conduct vendettas 
even reporters will long remember the angry warning of the 
papers handsome young metropolitan editor to a management 
colleague an oily national editor who is trying to steal one of 
the metro sections best scribes 
lets get something straight edison metros not your farm 
club my people go into the real world and it stinks sometimes 
in short news bowing tonight with a bloated twohour 
edition may make one think its authors saw a lou grant rerun 
then leaped up and said hey kids lets put on a newspaper 
funny thing though there are bits and pieces of good in this 
show it actually has promise even though the first round 
basically seems a series of variations on cliches it has two major 
things going for it 
a excellent cast the bestknown of them lloyd bridges who 
plays the papers avuncular toughwhenheneedstobe veteran 
editor the actors often make the spoken cliches tolerable major 
credit is due michael woods who as the handsome young metro editor 
has to deliver most of them 
characters that stick in your mind like the smarmy snippy 
syndicated gossip columnist with his own tv show kurt fuller who 
is very funny mark blums nasty national editor and the 
streetwise fire and police reporter jenny wright 
wright who seems to get the best oneliners has a wellhoned 
sense of timing shes fun to watch even in a quick bit when she 
asks a tightmouthed fire department official about a nursing home 
fire 
i just need a hint of the approximate cause of the fire was 
it a meteor from outer space or was one it of the older men smoking 
in bed 
one nice aspect of the show is that its makebelieve scribes 
arent terminally earnest as often is the case in newspaper shows 
on the glum side the dramatic old reliables of tv newspaperdom are 
lurking here 
theres the eager lovely young newcomer helen slater who 
teaming up on an unusual bank robbery story with a rumpled hotshot 
william russ proves incredibly good on her first day she gets 
a frontpage byline 
theres the elegant fastfading old foreign correspondent 
beautifully played by lee richardson resting on his reputation 
and hip flask bridges wants him to retire unbeknownst to him the 
oldtimer takes one last shot on a local story about a drugridden 
housing project 
and theres the old problem of a reporters sex life 
specifically that of its basic beautiful ace investigative reporter 
kathryn harrold 
she has written an explosive expose about a defective missile 
system but with deadline approaching shes under pressure to 
print the name of her source you only need one in tv for the 
story 
this is because word gets out shes been sleeping with a 
handsome senate aide and he is suspected of being her source 
hes not the source she tells editor bridges the agreement 
was we dont talk about our work if there might be a conflict 
the editors snappy comeback whatd that leave you the 
weather 
later shifting to a fatherly role as a man of washington 
wisdom he urges her if she really loves the guy to go public 
with it in this town nobody minds you having a private life as 
long as they know all about it 
that intelligence comes near the finale as the show shifts to 
postdeadline glimpses of the scribes private lives including the 
fact that three of the staff share an old house in washington and 
invite the rookie to join them 
the postdeadline puttering around seems tacked on and only 
gives the impression that false endings are now in vogue 
all this doesnt make for the best possible premiere for a tv 
newspaper series even when the creator is david milch who had a 
hand in a pretty good cop show called hill street blues 
but as we say the acting is fine and many of the characters 
wellsketched if the writers of future capital news episodes 
have paid more attention to journalistic detail and less to cliche 
the series may have a chance 
if not everyone should write abc and demand that it revive 
kolchak the night stalker now that was a nifty newshawk 
series even if it was set in only a wire service

union leaders whove watched the strike lose 
part of its firepower as a bargaining weapon in recent years are 
turning to new strategies for winning better wages and benefits 
the notion that the first thing you do is go stage a strike 
that cry that slogan is dead in the labor movement says bob 
harman of the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees 
the strike used to be almost automatic just part of the 
industrial landscape says john duray of the united mine workers 
now you have unions picking their targets much more carefully 
exhausting all their options first 
the strike has become more of a gamble over the past decade as 
the hiring of permanent replacement workers a practice once 
considered taboo becomes more widespread 
in the ongoing eastern air lines strike for instance the 
company has replaced most of the machinists who walked out more 
than a year ago flight attendants and pilots who conducted 
temporary sympathy strikes also have permanently lost their jobs 
greyhound drivers now face the same prospect in their monthlong 
strike because the company has pledged to give permanent jobs to 
the drivers who join up as replacements 
many labor leaders blame the trend toward replacement hiring on 
former president reagan who fired striking air traffic controllers 
in 1981 the practice has forced unions to look increasingly at 
inside strategies or tactics that workers can use on the job 
to exert economic pressure on employers to win a new contract yet 
also avoid a strike 
tactics include worktorule where employees strictly 
follow work manuals rather than taking their normal shortcuts that 
speed up productivity rolling strikes where workers hold spot 
oneday noshows boycotts of a companys products newspaper and 
billboard advertisements to win the publics support and personal 
approaches to a companys board of directors and shareholders 
all these things can have a tremendous impact on mobilizing 
workers and help increase a unions presence on the shop floor 
says jim green a labor historian at the university of 
massachusetts 
energizing workers keeps them from crossing picket lines once a 
strike starts and can dissaude people from taking replacement jobs 
green says thats what unions did in two of the most recent strike 
success stories pulled off by appalachian coal miners and nynex 
telephone workers in the northeast 
that shows you what it takes to win a strike under current 
circumstances but to say that this is going to be the norm is 
probably expecting too much of the unions green says 
many unions are also devoting more energy to negotiations before 
a contract expires in an effort to head off a strike st paul 
minn county workers for instance called in a mediator to help 
them bargain and as a result were on strike only six days harman 
says 
the communications workers of america is drafting a manual that 
will list 40 tactics organized labor can use to build worker and 
community support and avoid a strike 
in the 1970s nearly 300 strikes involving 1000 or more workers 
occurred each year that average dropped to about 50 per year over 
the past five years federal figures show 
companies have had the legal right to hire replacement workers 
for decades but it was rarely used largely because employers 
feared a public backlash 
reagans firing of air traffic controllers put starch in the 
spine of employers says aflcio spokesman rex hardesty 
twa boise cascade international paper colt firearms and the 
chicago tribune lined up replacement workers before a strike 
occurred hardesty says 
i think it represents the atmosphere that reagan set 
employers are saying well the name of the game is greed and 
weve got the green light its get as much as you can get it as 
fast you can and no matter if it hurts a lot of people says 
afscme president gerald mcentee 
duray says the new age of replacement hiring is disturbing 
from the point of view of what it says about a companys concern 
for longterm productivity and its commitment to its workers 
legislation is pending in congress to ban companies from hiring 
permanent replacement workers in labor disputes 
union officials acknowledge that employers feel more comfortable 
hiring replacement workers because organized labor lost clout in 
the 1980s with a decline in membership 
weve probably been victims of our own success our workers 
may have reached the point where they were making pretty good 
wages had two cars in the garage and they lost that knot in the 
belly a desire to stick together mcentee says 
green says americans also have shifted their thinking on the 
ethics of being a strikebreaker 
it used to be that the worst thing somebody could possibly 
call you in bluecollar neighborhoods was a scab now a lot of 
people think its alright to take someone elses job

there is a recession in corporate profits but 
you would hardly know it from the rate at which companies are 
paying dividends compared with other periods its sky high 
good reasons for the situation are hard to find but no harder 
than several other mysteries about the profits recession many 
stock prices seem to have ignored the evidence for instance and a 
lot of forecasters too 
a good many of the published economic forecasts tend to make 
little of the decline choosing to stress instead what they see as 
an improving situation as the year goes on 
a plausible explanation is offered by economist edward yardeni 
when he suggests that if profits fall but the economy continues to 
grow then company managers presumably have a good chance of 
reviving profits 
in contrast says yardeni who does his analyses for 
prudentialbache securities if the economy is in a recession 
the situation is out of their control 
but what about now the decline in profits already is greater 
than that which occurred in the deep recessions of a decade ago 
and officially at least there isnt even a recession under way 
now 
throughout the decline which has lasted four straight quarters 
or since the end of 1988 very few companies have tampered with 
their dividend payout and some of have raised it 
as a result dividends as a percentage of aftertax profits 
following a 16 percent profits decline last year are about 80 
percent whereas a more normal figure would be around 50 percent 
the current percentage says economist h erich heinemann is 
near a record high in the postwar period surpassed only by the 
second quarter of 1986 when the economy skirted the edge of 
recession 
in times gone by the ratio of dividends to aftertax profits 
usually peaked at the end of a recession then fell as profits 
improved but if you can believe uncle sam there is no general 
recession now and none since 1982 
but there is that profits recession and there is no denying 
that a logical tie exists between profits and dividends simply 
stated if you dont make the profits you cant pay the dividends 
however based on experience of the past year that logic seems 
suspended during the 1989 final quarter pretax operating profits 
were running at an annual rate of 2857 billion compared with a 
rate of 3402 billion one year before 
could it be that big bad ugly bear markets in stocks only 
happen if the economy and corporate profits are in a recession 
asks yardeni who believes the economy will continue to grow all 
year long 
in that outlook he has plenty of company among his fellow 
forecasters many of whom see a bigger and better economic picture 
including corporate profits as the year wears on 
it seems therefore that faith in higher future profits is 
having more of an impact on dividends than the current lowprofit 
profits 
what if profits dont rise well it seems that logic eventually 
must prevail that if the money isnt coming in it cant be paid 
out as dividends should the profits fail to recover can dividends 
not fall

when gary hart descends deep into the 
darkness of the coalrich soil each day he fears the future as a 
miner he could lose his job as mayor he could lose his town 
the double threat comes from hundreds of miles away where 
congress is rewriting the nations clean air laws setting new 
pollution standards that could crush this tiny town that lives and 
thrives on coal 
to combat acid rain the local mines neighbor and only customer 
one of the nations dirtiest coalfired power plants will 
likely have to reduce the sulfur dioxide spewing from its stacks 
how it does that has put kincaid on edge hoping for a reprieve 
but leery of a death sentence 
if they shut down completely im not going to have a 
community to lead hart said itll sit there and die people 
will have to move to get jobs its just a sad thing people want 
to work they want their jobs but how do they keep them 
across the midwest and northern appalachia highsulfur coal 
country kincaid and other mining towns are in a quandary 
wondering whether new clean air laws will pit health against 
wealth reducing prosperity with pollution 
there is a need for clean air hart said but completely 
wiping out an industry is not the solution to the problem it just 
creates a bigger problem 
in ohio one congressman recently said acid rain controls could 
cost the state up to 2 billion a year and raise some commercial 
electric rates as much as 40 percent in kentucky officials say 
half the coal mining jobs in the western part of the state could be 
lost 
and in illinois which already lost 30 percent of its coal 
mining jobs in the 1980s a worstcase scenario estimates up to 
4500 more could vanish 
the government says up to 5000 highsulfur coal jobs likely 
will be lost nationally by 1995 but the united mine workers 
predicts that will grow to about 20000 by the end of the decade 
inflicting more pain on an industry that has shrunk by 44 percent 
in the last decade and crushed main streets dependent on miners 
dollars 
commonwealth edison the utility that owns the plant wont 
decide how it will reduce sulfur fumes in kincaid until the clean 
air measure becomes law on tuesday the senate passed its bill 
which sen alan dixon dill one of 11 opponents said would 
decimate his state a house version was approved thursday in 
committee 
edison can install scrubbers which would cost about 350 
million and cut emissions by about 90 percent or take two other 
devastating steps switch to cleaner lowsulfur coal from the west 
or shut down which would almost certainly trigger the mine closing 
were doing everything possible to try avoid closing the 
plant said john maxson edisons governmental affairs director 
the stakes are enormous the plant and peabody coal cos mine 
no 10 acrosstheroad neighbors have nearly 900 workers and an 
annual payroll of about 25 million maxson said 
meanwhile in this town of 1500 where mining is a tradition 
with sons and fathers working sidebyside the uncertainty has 
folks fretting 
youre hanging by a thread said miner butch spinner are 
you going to fall on the good side of the lake or on the side with 
the alligators 
were pawns in a big political game said ron phares 33 a 
husky 12year mine veteran you feel powerless pushed aside 
neglected id hate to be 55 56 57 looking this in the eye 
where are you going to go 
miners also say that while theyre all for reducing pollution 
having fought for cleaner air underground this isnt a simple case 
of good vs evil 
i hope environmentalists have some sympathy with me said 
tim drea a secondgeneration miner many of my coworkers 
fathers were miners they went to high school got a job married 
their prom dates now their kids are 10 11 12 all they know is 
coal mining 
if the mines close because of emotional legislation these 
people are left with nothing i cant agree with that any more than 
i can agree with dirty air 
in fact many environmentalists support subsidies to cut cleanup 
costs and protect jobs but others say utilities and miners adopted 
a headinthesand policy too long 
they played this denial game for 10 years said clark 
bullard an environmentalist and university of illinois mechanical 
engineering professor they denied acid rain was a serious 
problem now theyre looking for sympathy and bailouts 
bullard said there was little support several years ago for a 
proposed national utility surcharge to help pay for scrubbers 
the time for getting a good deal has passed he said the 
deal were going to get is going to hurt the midwest 
too much so say miners and utilities who argue that experts 
dont have conclusive proof heavy damage is caused by acid rain 
created when sulfur and nitrogen oxides mix with water in the 
atmosphere it is blamed for damaging forests and killing fish in 
the northeast and canada 
the senate bill calls for a 10 million ton reduction in annual 
emissions of sulfur dioxide by the year 2000 
miners say if that takes jobs away the government should help 
if president bush can bail out the savings and loans he can 
help the coal miners said paul wagahoft a kincaid miner 
last week however sen robert byrd dw va lost his bid to 
amend the clean air bill to provide 500 million in aid to miners 
who would lose their jobs 
coal miners cant walk across the street and find another 
job said gerald hawkins legislative director of illinois 
district 12 of the umw there is none 
its a bitter reality in kincaid and neighboring central 
illinois towns 
what are they going to retrain you for around here phares 
asked this is a farming area theres not much industry to go 
into id have to relocate youre not going to make 15 an 
hour and have good insurance 
youre not going to step out tomorrow and find a 
30000ayear job wagahoft said youre going to have to 
start over 
hart also worries about the impact on kincaid which he says 
supplies about 25 percent of the work force at the mine and plant 
you take 100 miners in the community they get paid 1000 
every two weeks he said that would be lost 
some miners are bracing for the worst taking accounting 
classes attending truck driving school putting off home repairs 
and purchases 
whatever happens theyll adjust 
its something i feel i cant change phares said i cant 
tell george bush ive got three kids ive got a house payment 
ive got a truck payment whatever comes ive just got to 
accept it ive just got to live with the consequences

the action may be dull and dispirited most 
places on wall street right now but there is a hot new game in 
progress at the american stock exchange 
the excitement centers on a new breed of security scarcely 
three months old that provides investors with a way to play the 
ups and downs of foreign markets most notably the one in tokyo 
these vehicles take the form of warrants which give their 
holders the right to buy or sell another security or group of 
securities at a stated price within a specified period of time 
through their long history in this country warrants have been 
best known as an adjunct to individual common stocks with issuers 
ranging from legions of small companies to such bluechip names as 
american telephone amp telegraph 
starting in january of this year the idea was adapted to 
embrace a stock index in a foreign market specifically japans 
nikkei stock average as the underlying security 
by the end of march amex trading had begun in four different 
put warrants on the nikkei index 
these warrants which constitute rights to sell a cash 
equivalent of a basket of japanese stocks at a set price naturally 
tend to increase in value whenever the going prices of those stocks 
fall 
they have been hailed by some observers as a valuable tool for 
managing and hedging risks that come with the increasingly 
international approach many investors have taken in recent years 
some skeptics by contrast call them a gimmick 
whether for good or ill they appeared on the scene at an 
opportune time as the lofty japanese market ran into a turbulent 
period of selling that drove the nikkei index down more than 25 
percent 
before long the nikkei warrants and a couple of similar ones 
based on the financial timesstock exchange index in britain 
seized a prominent place on the daily lists of the most active amex 
issues 
last week the wall street firm of salomon brothers stirred the 
pot anew with the first of an expected series of call warrants 
on the nikkei for buyers seeking a way to profit from rising stock 
prices in japan 
thanks to that and to rumors of further volatile times ahead in 
tokyo nearly 9 million of the various foreignindex warrants were 
traded on the amex last wednesday accounting for 43 percent of 
the exchanges overall stock volume for the day 
so far this year the warrants have been responsible for nearly 
15 percent of what the amex counts as equity volume 
the speculative allure of this product isnt hard to see the 
first of the nikkei put warrants for instance tripled in price as 
the japanese market tumbled 
among the many risks that also come with these investments some 
are more obvious than others for any speculators venturing into 
this game it is plain that wrong guesses are very likely to mean 
large losses 
in addition it takes market savvy to gauge when a warrant is 
trading at an advantageous price in relation to its underlying 
index on top of that commissions and other trading costs may 
stack the odds heavily against the small investor 
drawbacks like those havent stopped the foreign index warrants 
from attracting a substantial following to date whether they will 
keep growing as rapidly in the future depends partly on what 
happens in the japanese and other overseas stock markets 
should they continue to flourish all sorts of possibilities 
arise for instance could an index warrant or something closely 
resembling it some day provide the springboard to largescale 
index arbitrage and other computerprogram trading on an 
international scale 
if such activity ever came to stir up problems and controversy 
who or what would regulate it

without a doubt cyrano de bergerac is frances 
most famous fictional character with his long nose and gift of 
poetic gab 
painfully shy and downright ugly cyrano was a master swordsman 
with verve and panache who breathed his poetry and passion into the 
tonguetied head of a handsome soldier to win the lovely roxanne 
hes so popular this season that hes currently being portrayed 
on the stage and in movie houses by frances top two leading actors 
nearly 100 years after he was created for theater cyrano is 
once again tugging at the heart jeanpaul belmondo is dazzling 
audiences at the soldout marigny theater while gerard depardieu 
is inducing tears and laughs in frances most expensive 
cinematic production ever 
cyrano de bergerac produced at a cost of 17 million 
opened march 28 to critical praise 
the classic tale of unrequited love got a modern face lift in 
1987 in the movie roxanne starring steve martin and darryl 
hannah martin played a longnosed fire chief in a contemporary 
american small town 
the newest versions are faithful to edmond rostands play set in 
17thcentury france against a background of war between kings a 
war fought by such swashbuckling gascons as dartagnan of the three 
musketeers 
both depardieu and belmondo have received rave reviews from 
critics in their portrayals of cyrano considered one of the most 
difficult roles ever written 
for depardieu 41 frances biggest boxoffice attraction with 
60 films under his belt cyrano is his most brilliant 
performance ever he gives an eloquent delivery and sublime 
dramatic portrayal of cyrano he is comic and poignant at the same 
time and with magnificent period costumes and sets the film is 
215 minutes of sheer poetry and pleasure 
belmondo portrays cyrano in an athletic swashbuckling way 
there tends to be a bit more shouting by belmondo in the play 
depardieu on the other hand literally whispers into the camera 
the movie which will open in the united states in december was 
filmed on location in hungary with 2000 actors and extras in 
period costumes 40 studio sets and 1000 pikes and muskets an 
entire forest was cleared to film the siege of arras a town in 
northern france where the french succeeded in ousting the spaniards 
in the mid1600s 
studio magazine frances leading film monthly devoted 20 pages 
to the film and described depardieu as an actor in a state of 
grace 
everything in cyranos character fits him like a glove marc 
esposito wrote the power the sensitivity the arrogance the 
complexes the fragility we sense under his imposing physique 
belongs as much to cyrano as to depardieu 
jacques weber who triumphed in his portrayal of de guiche the 
haughty count also enamored of roxanne called depardieu a bomb 
fallen from the moon 
written by rostand in 1897 cyrano is as french as the 
national anthem children study it in school and audiences know the 
nose and no thank you tirades by heart 
yet it has defied filmmakers until now because of its 
alexandrines iambic lines with six feet that rhyme rappeneau and 
veteran screenwriter jeanclaude carriere streamlined the original 
text but critics say they sacrificed neither the poetry nor its 
romantic soul 
cyrano has also endured because its story is timeless who 
has never felt despair looking in the mirror or pain upon 
discovering that the one you love loves another 
a little cyrano sleeps in the heart of all of us depardieu 
says 
for belmondo 56 bestknown for his toughguy roles in 
fastpaced thrillers cyrano marks a longawaited return to his 
roots as a dramatic actor and only his second stage appearance in 
25 years 
director robert hossein said playing cyrano had long been a 
secret goal of belmondo because the actors father paul used to 
say the role was the ultimate test for an actor 
when will you go back to your real profession i will die 
without seeing you as cyrano belmondo senior would say as his 
son posted one boxoffice smash after another hossein recalled 
paul belmondo died several years ago 
belmondo is paying off a personal debt to his father 
wrote jeanpierre thibaudat in liberation if the movies hadnt 
been invented he would have been the coquelin of our times and 
coquelin invented cyrano

on a treeshaded street of 500000 
homes burlap sacks bulging with empty cans and neatly tied stacks 
of newspapers lie waiting for the weekly recycling truck in front 
of environmentally landscaped yards 
recycling has been going strong here for almost 20 years but 
xeriscaping using droughttolerant plants so yards need less 
watering is all the rage these dry days 
in palo alto birthplace of the silicon valleys computer 
industry and home of earth day headquarters the fascination with 
high tech is matched by a commitment to high quality of life and 
devotion to the environment 
businessmen and women pedal to work on a 30mile network of bike 
lanes cruising past houses topped by solar energy panels 
snowy egrets and great blue herons soar above marshes and ducks 
splash in a pond in the citys cherished baylands 
hundreds of deer graze the hillside meadows of the citys 
1500acre private foothills park mountain lions bobcats and 11 
species of snakes roam freely in the hills and 150 kinds of birds 
delight hikers and picnickers 
frank zinn takes a break every day around noon to feed bread to 
ground squirrels in the baylands the normally skittish creatures 
who live in 8foot deep burrows let zinn pet them 
theyre kind of like my family zinn said i was a still 
photographer in hollywood and when i came back to this area i was 
worried that this whole place would be condominiums i sure am glad 
they preserved all this 
while 75 percent of the wetlands around san francisco bay have 
been filled in over the years palo altans have worked to preserve 
their edge of the bay since the 1920s and have spent hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to maintain its natural beauty 
wetlands are one of the most productive land forms in terms of 
wildlife said emily renzel a city council member who has led 
protection efforts many animal species depend on them to the 
extent that we are crowding out major segments of the animal 
population were just setting ourselves up for disaster someday 
slowly but surely were creating a world in which we may be 
the only ones existing and it may not be a very pretty world i 
dont think we want to be in a world without birds singing 
palo alto is not without problems of course hightech 
companies sometimes leak toxic chemicals and older buildings waste 
too much energy 
but it is a small city with a big reputation a pioneer in 
recycling since 1971 a center for solar energy research and a 
model of environmental responsibility for cities of any size 
it has won national awards for its bicycling and recycling 
programs waste water treatment and hazardous waste disposal 
halfway between the gray fog of san francisco and the brown smog 
of san jose palo alto is seen in aerial photographs as a patch of 
green a thick canopy of trees enriches the air with oxygen 
the redwood el palo alto the tall tree used as a landmark 
by spanish explorers in 1769 still stands nobly though thin on 
top and slightly stooped 
the city of 56000 that grew up around that tree and bucolic 
stanford university has developed a passion for trees especially 
after watching apricot and cherry orchards give way to aerospace 
communications and electronic companies in the 1940s and 50s 
according to the citys computerized tree inventory 32089 
cityowned trees the most popular are magnolias with big white 
blossoms line the streets perhaps 10 to 15 times as many are 
privately owned including birches eucalyptuses and orange lemon 
plum pear and almond trees that flourish in the mediterranean 
climate of mild moist winters and warm dry summers 
in the magic forest a small stand of redwoods in one of the 
citys more than 50 parks the air is as cool and refreshing as in 
the wilds of yosemite 
for many palo altans though their view of the environment 
extends beyond the beauty of the land and the quality of the air 
and water said denis hayes earth day founder and a resident of 
palo alto off and on for more than 20 years 
when a bunch of us were involved in trying to build a new 
environmental movement in the late 60s and early 70s he said 
the search was really for an allencompassing set of values a 
new ideology relevant to the 20th century 
a top priority he said was a desire to stop deterioration of 
the planet and encourage peace justice and education 
in that broad context he said palo alto is in many ways an 
idyllic kind of community it aspires to become a new athens it 
really does promote that vision in the sense of having large 
democratic involvements in national and international statecraft 
and doing what it can to encourage art and athletics 
no environmental danger escapes notice and no waste is tolerated 
in this city where more than 70 percent of residents and 24 of the 
30 leading generators of commercial waste participate regularly in 
recycling 
newspapers glass aluminum cans plastic bottles corrugated 
cardboard used motor oil scrap metal highgrade paper 
mattresses yard debris and used car batteries are collected either 
curbside or at dropoff centers 
this month the city council is expected to pass the nations 
first toxic gas ordinance drafted by the santa clara county fire 
departments with help from silicon valley computer chip companies 
environmentalists and lawmakers 
it is designed to control releases of poisonous gases and add 
enough safeguards to prevent a bhopal india type of disaster 
said fire marshal phil constantino the model ordinance under 
study by dozens of other cities is a followup to a hazardous 
materials storage law also the first in the nation adopted by 
palo alto and neighboring cities in 1982 
last year the council prohibited all places that serve food 
from using containers made with ozonedepleting 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs downtown coffee shops offer coffee at 
20 cents off for patrons who bring their own mugs instead of using 
styrofoam cups 
another ordinance banning all nonrecyclable disposable 
polystyrene and rigid plastic food service items is to go into 
effect july 1 
by the same date auto service shops will be required to have 
equipment to capture the cfcladen freon that escapes during air 
conditioning repairs 
on january 1 retail stores were required to offer a choice of 
paper or plastic bags 
houses are expensive in palo alto threebedroom homes range 
from 300000 to 1 million but gas and electricity rates are 
generally at least 30 percent lower than the rest of the bay area 
thanks to a cityowned utilities system 
palo alto utilities the only municipal agency in the state that 
provides gas electricity and water offers customers free analyses 
of energy and water use as well as lowinterest loans to install 
solar systems

according to the 1980 census 14 percent of palo altans working 
there rode bicycles to their jobs the current census is expected 
to show a big increase 
the more bicyclists you have the fewer cars you have said 
ellen fletcher a former council member and longtime bicycling 
advocate that reduces the pollutants in the air the traffic and 
the need for more parking lots 
fletcher helped push through laws requiring companies with more 
than 50 employees to provide showers and bicycle parking spaces 
she is now urging the city to create a network of bicycle 
boulevards to make it easier to ride around town 
its still a tough competition with the automobile she 
said the ultimate goal should be to make it as convenient to 
bicycle as it is to drive and we havent quite gotten to that 
stage 
one progressive palo alto drug research company alza corp 
pays employees up to 60 a month for using public transportation or 
1 a day if they bike jog walk or ride in carpools to work 
our primary concern as a company is an environmental one 
said alza executive peter carpenter paying people not to drive 
and providing them with bike lockers and showers is also cheaper 
than building more parking spaces for cars 
instead of subsidizing cars were subsidizing alternatives 
its the free market approach were giving people an incentive to 
leave their cars home 
yet carpenter admits somewhat sheepishly i still drive 90 
percent of the time myself which is horrible thats the acid 
test when you can get people like me to stop talking about getting 
out of their cars and start doing it

pablo escobar leader of the medellin 
drug cartel grew up here residents say his money turned envigado 
into a utopia by day but made the city police a squad of butchers 
by night 
a former police official put it this way to a local newspaper 
if envigado is colombias first city in quality of life it is 
also the first in the quality of death 
on march 28 president virgilio barcos government ordered the 
civilian police force disbanded the army has detained 19 of the 27 
former city officers ten are charged with torturing and murdering 
people for the medellin cartel 
one of those under arrest is marlon perez who is accused of 
organizing death squads for the drug gang 
envigado population 80000 is is northwestern colombia four 
miles south of medellin the city from which the largest cocaine 
gang takes its name 
escobars hometown is under martial law and the army colonel in 
charge is empowered to arrest any official who tries to impede 
investigations of the local police force known as the department 
of security and control 
after the army took over people started making their way to 
brigade headquarters to report the killings of family members 
lately police had begun killing wealthy townspeople who somehow 
angered the drug traffickers residents said in the beginning the 
department of security and control had concentrated on cleaning 
envigados streets of beggars thieves and people who smoked 
basuko a cocaine base 
they focused on murdering and torturing street people 
miguel moreno unemployed told the associated press two days after 
the police force was disbanded they took me into the 
headquarters and beat me up many times just because my clothes were 
dirty 
during the interview moreno waved cars into parking spaces next 
to envigados main plaza and tried to hustle the drivers for change 
army motorcycle patrols rumbled past the white church that 
towers over the plaza 
i would rather have a million soldiers in this town than those 
damn security agents said leo gomez also unemployed 
sergio jesus jimenez 23 sat in his wheelchair at a sidewalk 
cafe and told how the police shot him in the back eight months 
earlier crippling him for life 
jimenez said he and some friends were watching a soccer game on 
a storewindow television when a police patrol four men and a 
woman came around the corner 
when we saw them we began to run he said thats when 
they shot me they put me in the hospital for six days and then 
threw me in jail even though i couldnt walk 
he said police released him when they found he had no record 
jimenez an orphan who lives with his four brothers in the poor 
sebastiana neighborhood admitted to smoking basuko from time to 
time 
the same traffickers who export tons of cocaine to the united 
states and other countries dont want to see a poor person even 
thinking about smoking basuko on the street in envigado he said 
envigado appears to have fewer homeless people than other 
colombian towns although residents call it the nations monaco 
however the business district remains a typical crowded jumble of 
shops and restaurants 
most of the money escobar put into his birthplace seems to have 
financed condominium construction in wealthy neighborhoods 
it is said the drug traffickers have invested in envigado and 
made life better for the people here but at the same time they 
send the police out to kill the poorest jimenez said i was in 
the army and even in the army we didnt shoot people for no 
reason 
octavio arturo gonzalito william jairo the young man 
said reciting a litany of names of friends he said were victims of 
the police 
edwin arredondo galvis a 15yearold half brother said bodies 
would show up under a bridge leading to their neighborhood i 
would see six or seven at a time he said 
mayorelect jose mario rodriguez said the army had overreacted 
we cannot see the justification of the military presence but 
we will cooperate with the officials he said 
rodriguez takes office aug 1 but will have no power if martial 
law still is in effect 
the mayorelect said he was certain the army would realize 
envigado was a peaceful place and leave soon 
we continue in peace as we always have he said we invite 
people to come and see how tranquil life here really is 
jimenez in his wheelchair said silence does not necessarily 
mean peace he said families of victims had been afraid to speak up 
about police links to the drug cartel but now that the killers 
are in jail people are getting up the courage to talk 
he would go to army headquarters himself to report his injury if 
he had the money for a taxi but how am i suppose to get to the 
brigade in this jimenez said pointing to his wheelchair 
a former city policeman who would identify himself only as 
freddy said envigado had no problems except crimes committed by 
people like jimenez who smoked basuko 
the department has done a good job here said the officer 
who was playing cards with several men in a cafe in 1989 we 
detained 900 people the national police didnt take in 5 percent 
of that figure 
freddy weighs about 120 pounds has a thin face and shows 
rotting teeth when he smiles his friends called him freddy the 
mouse 
rodriguez the mayorelect said envigados problems had been 
blown out of proportion 
i think people are exaggerating because they envy envigados 
wealth and its excellent administration he said and declared 
his municipality to be the only one in colombia with unemployment 
benefits 
a high tax base and such thriving industries as textiles and 
chemicals paid for that not money from cocaine traffickers he 
said 
people associate the town with pablo escobar because he was 
born here but i for one have never met the man rodriguez said 
freddy the mouse predicted the department of security and 
control would be back in business soon 
the government needs us he said they just dont realize 
how badly

after seven years of frustrating 
delay the hubble space telescope is finally tucked away aboard the 
shuttle discovery ready to embark on its mission to scour the 
outermost depths of space 
the 15 billion observatory represents an astronomical advance 
of astronomical proportions the greatest in fact since the 
first use of a telescope by galileo in 1609 
we know a lot now we think perhaps we dont know anything 
perhaps well learn that said astronautastronomer steven a 
hawley part of the fivemember crew that is set to launch 
discovery on tuesday 
among the mysteries that hubble might help explain are quasars 
pulsars and black holes as well as the precise origin of the 
universe and the possible existence of other solar systems and life 
forms 
but the telescopes most extraordinary find during its 15year 
odyssey likely will be one not yet envisioned said eric chaisson 
senior scientist at the space telescope science institute at johns 
hopkins university 
the history of science has shown the greatest discoveries are 
those the human imagination has not even conceived he said we 
are going to demand that the hubble look into regions of total 
darkness to look where nobody has ever looked hoping by design to 
discover the unexpected 
from its perch 380 miles high the hubble will be free of 
atmospheric distortion and therefore able to detect light of all 
wavelengths including ultraviolet the telescope will be capable 
of discerning objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater 
clarity than the best observatory on earth 
astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their 
light has been traveling toward earth for 14 billion years 
the universe is believed to have been created 15 billion or so 
years ago by a terrific explosion known as the big bang that 
theory is based on the discovery by the late american astronomer 
edwin p hubble that the universe constantly is expanding 
the shuttle mission that will put the observatory named for that 
pioneer into orbit has been eagerly awaited by nasa and scientists 
around the world for more than a decade 
the hubble space telescope originally was scheduled for launch 
in 1983 five years after receiving government funding technical 
problems postponed liftoff for several years and the mission was 
delayed to 1989 by the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 
concern over discoverys solid rocket boosters pushed the 
mission back yet again to midapril so the boosters lower right 
segment could be replaced 
minor problems continued to crop up such as the discovery that 
several dozen midges tiny mosquitolike insects had invaded a 
payload preparation room at the launch pad engineers feared the 
bugs might damage the 24250pound 43footlong telescope and 
installation was postponed while the midges were rounded up 
later a broken pipe sprayed water on electrical equipment and 
knocked out air conditioning some heatsensitive computers were 
shut down temporarily interrupting testing of the telescopes 
scientific instruments 
every new problem makes you a little uptight but weve 
survived said bill taylor the telescopes chief engineer 
until the telescope arrived at kennedy space center last 
october engineers had taken advantage of the numerous delays to 
upgrade the instrument and make it easier to care for in space 
the telescope at 15 billion is the most expensive unmanned 
spacecraft ever built by nasa an additional 500 million has been 
spent to stockpile spare parts train astronauts and develop 
computer software to operate the instrument the european space 
agency is paying 15 percent of the costs 
discoverys five astronauts say they wont breathe easy until 
the hubble is safe in space for scientists the nerveracking wait 
will be longer 
their hearts are going to be beating theyre going to have 
butterflies and theyre not going to be happy until several weeks 
after we release it and they start getting data said marine col 
charles f bolden jr discoverys pilot 
hawley will use the shuttles 50footlong robot arm to remove 
the hubble from discovery on the second day of the fiveday 
mission nasa wants to deploy the telescope as soon as possible 
into the flight to minimize the risk of contaminating its 8foot 
primary optical mirror 
were taking every possible precaution to be able to back up 
any potential problem that we have in deploying the telescope 
said william reeves nasas lead flight director for the mission 
mission specialists bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan 
veteran spacewalkers will go out to help extricate adjust or 
repair the telescope if necessary the cabins pressure will be 
lowered three hours into the flight and remain low for several days 
to shorten the fourhour response time normally required for a 
spacewalk 
it is estimated the hubble will cost 200 million a year to 
operate and maintain in orbit 
within a month or two data for test images will be sent via 
satellite to the space telescope operations control center at 
nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt md and the space 
telescope science institute in baltimore 
six scientific committees chose 160 proposals from the worlds 
astronomers including five amateurs for the instruments first 
year of observation starting in december ten times more observing 
time was requested than the institute was able to grant every 
year new proposals will be accepted 
in 1993 a shuttle is scheduled to go up to service the 
telescope and since its orbit inevitably will decay over time 
boost it back up to a proper altitude further maintenance missions 
will be scheduled every three years any emergency work would have 
to be squeezed into the shuttles already crowded flight agenda 
said discoverys commander air force col loren j shriver 
more than likely you would have to dedicate a mission because 
the altitudes are so high shriver said 
discoverys ascent to 380 miles will be the highest a shuttle 
has ever gone the astronauts will bring the telescope back if it 
cannot be deployed safely but that would be a last resort hawley 
said 
were going to do anything we can do to leave the telescope in 
orbit so that it has a chance for a mission hawley said

retailers reported encouraging results for march despite a later 
easter shopping season and appear set to record strong sales growth 
this month as the important promotional period gets into full swing 
thomas h tashjian an analyst at seidler amdec securities inc 
said april could be a robust month particularly for retailers 
specializing in apparel he said the investment firm might raise 
its financial forecasts for the firstquarter performances of 
several shoppingmallbased clothing chains 
reports from some of the countrys big store chains released 
thursday showed little or no sales growth in march largely because 
easter falls in april this year three weeks later than in 1989 
nevertheless demand for spring fashions and a temporary spell 
of warm weather boosted business at appareloriented retailers 
executives of a few major general merchandise and department 
store chains said they were satisfied with their results in a 
small number of cases march sales surpassed the weak levels 
retailers had projected privately in advance 
on balance they are slightly better than expected said 
wayne hood an analyst at prudentialbache securities inc we can 
look forward to a continuing good trend in april 
the results overall were decent given that holiday promotions 
timed to capitalize on the easter season had not begun sales of 
easter baskets candy and decorations items important especially 
to discounters normally begin in earnest 10 days before the 
holiday 
last months tallies were measured against a year earlier when 
retailers benefited from a traditional pickup in shopping ahead of 
palm and easter sundays a time that brings extra customers into 
stores hunting for new outfits 
apparel sales outpaced other types of merchandise in march 
continuing a pattern that has prevailed for more than a year sales 
of hard goods such as expensive household appliances were softer 
mediocre economic growth has kept consumers cautious about 
spending heavily or going deeper into debt to finance costly 
purchases car buying for instance has been very sluggish 
walmart stores inc stood out from the rest of the pack the 
bentonville arkbased discounter posted a 27 percent march sales 
spurt over a year earlier sales excluding the take t stores opened 
within the year rose 12 percent 
results at stores open a year or longer called same or 
comparablestore sales give the best indication of a retailers 
performance 
jc penney co based in dallas said its store and catalog 
sales rose 97 percent in the five weeks ended march 31 on a 
comparable store basis sales gained 87 percent much of penneys 
business is in apparel 
two big mass merchandisers sears roebuck and co and 
montgomery ward amp co posted sales growth of under 2 percent 
analysts said the two chicagobased chains did reasonably well 
possibly better than their executives thought they would 
considering the tough comparison against last march 
sears the nations biggest retailer said march sales rose 13 
percent and were up 16 percent on a samestore basis 
montgomery wards sales grew 18 percent it did not report 
results for comparable stores chairman and chief executive officer 
bernard f brennan said the performance indicates a continuing 
growth trend when viewed against an 85 percent jump in march 
1989 sales 
a retailer that apparently didnt fare as poorly as it expected 
was woolworth corp the new yorkbased parent of numerous 
specialty stores including foot locker athletic shoe shops 
domestic sales edged down 1 percent in the five weeks ended 
march 31 from march 1989 samestore sales were off a steeper 37 
percent including foreign sales woolworth had a 25 percent 
increase in total march sales 
harold e sells woolworths chairman and chief executive 
officer said the domestic results exceeded our plan and while 
total sales for the period showed only a small gain over the 
prioryear period they were satisfactory considering the fact that 
last years march results included the important easter selling 
season 
by contrast ames department stores inc said its march sales 
slumped 12 percent from a year earlier while its samestore sales 
were off 135 percent the rocky hill connbased discounter 
blamed the later easter season 
additional reports from retailers are due next week k mart

a new washington state lottery named wall 
street has irked the securities industry by implying that 
stockpicking is more risky than a crap shoot but gaming experts 
say its a clever idea 
players can experience the exciting world of wall street 
investing without the risks says a press release by the 
washington state lottery which starts the game monday prizes for 
a 1 ticket range as high as 10000 and buyers have better than a 
1in5 chance of winning something it said 
the wall street game offers advantages not found in trading 
on that new york city street the lotterys director evelyn sun 
said in the press release wall street is just the ticket for 
the player who wants to experience the thrill of highstakes 
investing and wall street players cannot lose more than they 
invested 
on the reallife wall street professional strategists were 
insulted when told about the game thursday some said it was unfair 
to equate serious investing with gambling others said the 
washington game would only reinforce a prejudice that the stock 
market is no better than a casino 
its only people who speculate and dont know what theyre 
doing who get killed or get sucked in by the market said yale 
hirsch a prominent investment adviser who publishes the stock 
traders almanac 
the washington game should be called atlantic city or las 
vegas its really a punch in the nose to wall street 
edward i obrien chairman of the securities industry 
association wall streets national trade group said he wished 
washington would find another name for the game 
of all the states that have lotteries this is the state that 
gave us wppss obrien said referring to the washington public 
power supply system biggest municipal bond defaulter in history 
whoops there they go again 
washington is one of 32 states that run officially sanctioned 
gaming operations its lottery is about 7 years old 
the wall street game works much like lottery scratch games in 
other states players scratch across rows of boxes to reveal 
amounts under buy sell and profit if a sell number is 
higher than a buy number in the same row the player wins the price 
revealed in the profit box on the right 
richard paulson a spokesman for the washington state lottery 
said the wall street theme was devised about six months ago the 
50th scratch game offered by the states lottery since it began 
paulson said he saw no reason for the securities industry to be 
insulted 
obviously were trying to build a sense of excitement into 
our game he said we think this is an innovative name it 
certainly conjures up the idea of riches and money except its 
fun 
saul f leonard national partner and head of the gaming 
industries division of laventhol amp horwath an accounting and 
lottery consulting firm in los angeles said he thought the real 
wall street had little to gripe about 
theyre part of the public domain he said i think they 
should be flattered the name wall street would attract people to 
play 
most state lotteries that sell scratch games concoct new themes 
every few months to stimulate sales but most focus on other games 
such as cards horse racing baseball and bowling 
some professional stock pickers found the wall street theme 
amusing 
im ready to play said stan weinstein a widely followed 
strategist who publishes the newsletter professional tape reader 
i think we all take ourselves too seriously its a cute concept 
but obviously i think real life investing is a bit less risky 
william knowlton a spokesman for the lottery in new york wall 
streets own home state also called washington states idea a 
creative innovation he said many reallife wall streeters are 
lottery fans themselves 
we always have good lines down there when our jackpot gets 
big he said

the agency that regulates the futures markets 
is moving closer to correcting problems uncovered in the scandals 
on the chicago exchanges 
the commodity futures trading commission voted unanimously 
thursday to submit for public comment a proposed rule that would 
provide a legal definition of broker associations and require them 
to register with the exchange at which they do business 
broker associations have been loosely defined as formal or 
informal groups of futures traders formed to provide more capital 
to finance trades and more people to handle them 
but the cftcs division of trading and markets concluded in a 
study reported on last january that broker associations may 
increase the potential for certain types of trading abuses 
the study was an outgrowth of last years undercover 
investigation of trading at the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange the nations two largest futures 
exchanges which resulted in the indictment of more than 40 
traders 
only five of the 13 futures exchanges have rules defining broker 
associations of those only the chicago mercantile exchange new 
yorks commodity exchange and the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
require broker associations to register 
cftc staffers believe that keeping tabs on broker associations 
will help deter abuses in the trading pits commission members 
agreed by a 50 vote 
i believe very strongly that we identify and register these 
groups and i also agree that it gives a big assist and augmentation 
to our surveillance program to have this information said 
commissioner kalo a hineman 
as defined in the cftcs proposed rules broker association 
refers to two or more exchange members who share responsibility for 
executing customer orders profits or losses from trading 
activities or access to each others unfilled customer orders 
the rule would bar participation in the trading activities of a 
broker association unless the association is registered with the 
market or exchange 
interested parties have 60 days to comment on the proposed rule 
before the cftc takes a final vote on it

salomon brothers inc had a strong first quarter 
despite the continued slump across much of wall street the 
securities firms parent company said 
salomon inc said thursday it would post a firstquarter profit 
because a strong performance by its securities unit offset a slump 
at its oil trading subsidiary 
chairman john h gutfreund said the company will show good 
quarterly earnings when results are announced april 24 in the 
first quarter of 1989 the company lost 28 million or 35 cents a 
share 
gutfreund said profits at the brokerage arm were broadly based 
in the latest quarter 
salomon recently has been driven by its phibro energy oil 
refining and trading unit phibro was largely responsible for the 
firms 470 million 1989 profit that confounded a major wall street 
slump 
but gutfreund said phibro was expected to post only a modest 
profit in the januarymarch quarter while the companys philipp 
brothers commodities trading unit would continue to be a drag on 
the firm the two together would show a small loss analysts said 
lawrence eckenfelder an industry analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said salomons securities arm made a ton of 
money in march following a slow period in the first two months of 
the year 
it indicates while its generally been a bleak quarter there 
have been a few lines of business that have done ok eckenfelder 
said citing corporate and government securities trading as two 
improving areas 
salomon officials also indicated that unspecified trading 
strategies implemented in recent months had paid off 
analysts said the weaker quarter at phibro was due to eroding 
oil prices and narrowing refining margins analysts remain hesitant 
to project higher earnings in coming quarters because salomon 
relies heavily on the upanddown nature of trading 
their earnings are very volatile eckenfelder said 
theyre very trading dependent and they have relatively high 
fixed costs right now 
in light of gutfreunds announcement eckenfelder said he would 
raise his quarterly pershare earnings estimate for salomon to 85 
cents from 30 cents for the full year the analyst said he would 
increase the estimate to 320 from 265 
phibro claims to be the worlds largest trader of oil and the 
fourthlargest independent refiner in the united states it made 
367 million before taxes last year while salomon brothers which 
is supposed to be the companys main business made 490 million

a modest sales upturn in late march has boosted 
prospects that the slump in the us auto industry is ending but 
the rebound isnt being shared by everyone 
chrysler corp was the most notable exception as its car sales 
fell behind those of japanese rivals honda and toyota last month 
we think the industry bottomed in sales in november of 1989 
and that production bottomed in january of 90 analyst doug 
laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york said thursday 
laughlin said sales bottomed out in november and have improved 
since then with a few minor setbacks 
in sales figures reported wednesday domestic automakers said 
they sold 29 percent more cars and trucks in late march than in 
the corresponding period last year 
analysts and others are quick to point out that drawing a 
conclusion from a 10day reporting period can be dangerous because 
it is such a tiny sample of a huge industry 
however laughlin and others say they are beginning to wonder if 
the industry is rebounding especially with other economic factors 
figured in 
the strong income growth and job creation and a stable prime 
rate has created a nice underpinning for sales said scott merlis 
of morgan stanley amp co of new york 
but that underlying demand apparently hasnt reached chryslers 
cars partly because of hondas and toyotas us assembly plants 
with imports counted in chrysler dealers sold 70849 cars last 
month just less than the 71086 sold by honda toyota sold 79320 
cars or about nine for every eight sold by chrysler 
they have conceded some market share in cars laughlin said 
of the nations no 3 auto maker they are the most 
truckoriented company in the business 
chrysler sold 73665 trucks last month 4 percent more than its 
cars 
i dont see much reason for that to change in the next few 
months said auto analyst david healy of the brokerage 
barclaysbzw in new york chrysler has been slipping in retail 
passenger car market share recently 
for all of march chrysler held 76 percent of the market for 
north american built cars down from 94 percent during march 1989 
general motors corp held 332 percent of the market last month and 
ford motor co had 204 percent each down 03 percentage points 
chrysler and ford reported declines in their late march car 
sales of 237 percent and 81 percent respectively while gm posted 
a 39 percent increase 
sales have been slumping since last october and executives of 
the big three have forecast that the first half of this year would 
remain soft before sales pick up in the second half 
in january assembly lines nationwide ground to a halt 
temporarily as automakers took drastic steps to shrink newcar 
inventories estimated to be more than 90 selling days by shutting 
off the flow of vehicles at the source 
the strategy appears to have worked 
at the end of february according to the weekly industry journal 
wards automotive reports newcar inventories stood at 66 days 
considered good for early spring 
that level when combined with what some analysts say is a 
strengthening demand and a stable economy could indicate a rebound 
is on the way 
i think fingers are crossed that the worst is behind us 
laughlin said 
other analysts including healy were more cautious 
i think the best way to look at it is the sales numbers for 
the full month he said if you do that not a great deal is 
happening

phillips petroleum co has joined the growing 
number of oil companies to introduce a reformulated gasoline 
designed to be less harmful to the environment than existing grades 
phillips reformulated fuel blended to reduce certain 
hydrocarbon emissions will be tested in st louis one of more 
than 100 cities that fall below the environmental protection 
agencys minimum standards for air quality the company said 
thursday 
the rush by americas oil companies to make gasoline less toxic 
comes in response to stepped up government efforts to reduce air 
emissions from the tailpipes of cars and trucks 
george gaspar a stock analyst for robert w baird amp co in 
milwaukee said oil companies are trying to protect their markets 
by developing cleaner gasoline that will help auto companies 
meet tougher air emission standards 
if the auto companies dont get any help they may have to take 
some major actions that could hurt the petroleum industry said 
gaspar were going to hear a lot about how great reformulated 
gasoline is 
phillips based in bartlesville okla sells gasoline in the 
midwest it selected st louis for the test because of the 
companys strong selling base in the area 
the reformulated gasoline is blended to reduce the amounts of 
certain hydrocarbons such as aromatics benzene and olefins that 
react with the atmosphere and produce ozone a main component of 
smog 
charles bowerman a phillips senior vice president said the 
midgrade gasoline superclean unleaded plus contains 20 to 30 
percent less olefins and aromatics and 35 percent less benzene than 
the average gasoline sold in the st louis area the company did 
not make a comparison with the average gasoline sold nationally 
the new gasoline is made by removing the more toxic compounds 
and replacing them with methyltertiarybutylether a blending 
component with a high oxygen content 
other oil companies that have introduced reformulated gasolines 
include arco marathon exxon amoco mobil citgo and sun oil 
while the new gasolines are slightly better for the environment 
theyre only a small step in attempts to end smog and other 
pollution in americas cities said scott denman director of the 
safe energy communication council 
theyre missing the forest for the trees said denman 
these new gasolines are a little more benign on the environment 
but they are not the best way for us to reduce pollution 
the safe energy communication council based in washington is a 
national coalition of environmental groups working to promote 
alternate energy sources and better use of current ones 
denman said that while phillips and other of the nations oil 
companies tout their efforts to devise environmentally improved 
gasoline theyre also fighting tooth and nail against 
establishing higher fuel efficiency standards 
making cars more fuel efficient and reducing the amount of 
gasoline burned in engines is the best way to clean up the 
environment denman said 
auto companies could use more efficient fuelinjection systems 
build lighter motors design more aerodynamic bodies use lighter 
materials and equip cars with fuelsmart tires that deflate and 
inflate to improve gas mileage he said 
im not saying we shouldnt improve the gasoline but i think 
we should recognize it for what it is a small step and ask why 
were not taking some of the much bigger steps denman said

dawn steel the tough former columbia 
pictures movie chief has agreed to produce movies and tv 
exclusively for walt disney co 
ms steels move to disney as an independent producer had been 
rumored since sony corp bought columbia for 34 billion last 
september sony immediately brought in superproducers peter guber 
and jon peters batman rain man to head columbia and ms 
steel quit in january 
there just wasnt room for all three big egos over there 
said alex ben block the editor of the hollywood newsletter show 
biz news 
ms steel is known as an aggressive fighter for her projects 
she also is known as difficult to work for so tough that 
california magazine ran her picture on the cover when it did a 
story on the states worst bosses calling her the queen of 
mean and hell on heels 
but as rough as she may be on secretaries she is praised widely 
for her knack of luring top filmmakers and actors into movies that 
suit their talents 
i have known dawn for over 12 years and based on our close 
working relationship i have only the greatest respect for her 
abilities and accomplishments disney chairman michael eisner 
said thursday as the deal was announced 
she was out of town and unavailable for interviews thursday the 
studio said 
before joining columbia ms steel was president of production 
for paramount pictures where she was involved with hits such as 
flashdance top gun beverly hills cop ii the 
accused and fatal attraction 
in november 1987 she was hired as columbias president the 
highest position ever held by a woman in hollywood she replaced 
david puttnam a british filmmaker who alienated many powerful 
people in hollywood with his attempts to buck the star system of 
inflated egos and salaries 
ms steel is generally regarded as having stayed at columbia for 
too short a time to prove herself as a studio chief 
i dont think anyone gets a fair chance to do anything in a 
studio unless they are there 2 to three years said david 
hoberman the president of disneys touchstone pictures 
hoberman said ms steel will develop familyoriented movies to 
be released by the disney studio as well as pictures for touchstone 
aimed at adult audiences 
she will not produce any movies for disneys recently launched 
third studio hollywood pictures he said 
a disney statement said that in addition to movies and tv ms 
steel will develop other projects for the company but provided 
no details 
terms of her contract were not revealed but hoberman said i 
think it is about as strong a producing deal as is out there with 
one or two exceptions 
the comment referred to deals such as the one paramount has made 
with star producers jerry bruckheimer and don simpson allowing 
them to make movies without approval from the studios head of 
production ms steel apparently will have to get such approval 
during ms steels tenure columbia released casualties of 
war a sean pennmichael j fox movie that died at the box 
office and ghostbusters ii which made money but failed to 
become the hopedfor blockbuster 
other successful releases were when harry met sally and 
look whos talking but those films were already under way when 
she was hired 
yetunreleased films she initiated include postcards from the 
edge directed by mike nichols and starring meryl streep shirley 
maclaine dennis quaid gene hackman and richard dreyfuss 
awakenings directed by penny marshall with robert deniro and 
robin williams and flatliners produced by michael douglas and 
starring kiefer sutherland and julia roberts

currencies in quiet trading in europe this morning gold prices 
advanced

uals stock closed at 16550 thursday on the new york stock 
exchange ual has more than 218 million shares outstanding 
in a statement today the board said it had agreed in principle 
with united employee acquisition corp the company representing 
the unions to the sale 
the board said both sides expect to conclude a final agreement 
promptly 
the directors had negotiated with the unions which represent 
uniteds pilots machinists and flight attendants in the two weeks 
since the board rejected a 185ashare or 4 billion offer 
the employee bid was supported by uals largest shareholder 
coniston partners which holds an 118 percent stake coniston has 
said it would wage a proxy fight to oust uals board at the 
companys april 26 shareholders meeting if a deal wasnt reached 
the earlier bid was reportedly opposed strongly by ual chairman 
stephen wolf 
a proposed 675 billion employeeled buyout of ual collapsed 
last october after the wouldbe purchasers were unable to line up 
enough financing the failure of that deal contributed to a 
190point plunge in the dow jones industrial average on oct 13

ford motor co said friday it is holding talks on 
possibly selling its farm equipment operations to italys fiat 
group 
separately the two automakers are discussing altering their 
current heavy truck agreement which covers the making and 
marketing of trucks in europe 
it is not clear whether the discussions involve just a sale or 
swapping the farm machinery business for the truck operations 
ford which sold its rouge steel operation late last year and 
has its ford aerospace corp subsidiary up for sale apparently is 
interested in divesting all or part of ford new holland inc its 
farm implement making subsidiary 
ford officials have said recently that the company is interested 
in focusing on its auto and truckrelated businesses 
in a joint statement the automakers said any worldwide 
agreements would preserve their respective brands and markets ford 
and fiat officials said there would be no further comment until a 
definitive agreement is reached 
in 1985 ford and fiat held discussions about a wide range of 
worldwide associations a year later the two companies heavy 
truck operations joined forces in europe through ivecoford ford 
and fiat each owns 48 percent of ivecoford the rest is held by a 
frenchus investment banking concern 
ford spokesman bert serre declined to give earnings figures for 
the european truck operations but said ford was pleased with its 
performance 
ford bought the new holland pabased farm machinery builder in 
1986 for 330 million from sperry corp ford does not report 
financial data on new holland but the subsidiary is estimated to 
have annual sales of about 3 billion

browningferris industries inc a waste disposal 
giant announced it is getting out of the hazardous waste business 
and taking a 295 million charge against earnings in the second 
quarter 
hazardous waste business added 2 percent to the houstonbased 
companys business but reduced earnings by 10 percent and 
accounted for 75 percent of our headaches john stanton 
browningferris chief financial officer said thursday 
the hazardous waste collection treatment and disposal 
businesses which the company operated under its bfi environmental 
systems inc and cecos international inc subsidiaries have lost 
money for a year and a half 
bfi environmental and cecos lost 266 million last year and 
52 million in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended dec 31 
total revenue last year was 60 million 
its a significant event said jerald cobbs analyst for 
rauscher pierce refsnes inc of houston it says how difficult a 
business it is to operate in 
stanton said regulatory problems at two of its four waste 
facilities figured heavily into bfis decision 
cecos has agreed to plead guilty to one violation of ohio 
environmental law in connection with activities at its williamsburg 
facility and to pay a 25000 fine 
separately under a consent decree cecos has agreed to pay the 
state of ohio a civil penalty of 15 million establish a 1 
million environmental trust fund for the state and pay 1 million 
to clermont county cecos also will be required to close the 
facility 
the company also was turned down for a permit to continue adding 
waste to its niagara falls ny facility although it is being 
used as a nonhazardous industrial waste other cecos land disposal 
sites are in louisiana and colorado 
bfi said it will operate the hazardous waste business until it 
is sold or converted to nonhazardous uses or until the hazardous 
waste assets are otherwise disposed of that could take about two 
and a half years 
about 800 employees will be affected many of whom bfi expects 
to stay with operations as they are sold

the nations unemployment rate edged down to 
52 percent last month despite the smallest increase in new jobs in 
four years the government said today 
the jobless rate had held steady at 53 percent for the previous 
nine months 
the nations manufacturing slump continued with a loss of 
30000 factory jobs in march the labor department said in 
releasing the unemployment report the first comprehensive look at 
economic activity for the month 
that brought manufacturing job losses to 100000 since november 
and 250000 over the past year the department said 
the jobless rate dropped even though only 26000 new jobs were 
created in march most analysts had been predicting that the 
economy would produce around 170000 new jobs last month the 
26000 new jobs was the fewest produced since june 1986 when 
110000 jobs were lost the government said 
more than 350000 new jobs were produced in both january and 
february 
the governments household survey said total employment rose 
slightly in march to 1183 million and that the labor force edged 
up to about 1248 million 
the labor department surveys businesses for statistics on job 
gains and losses 
the losses were offset by gains in the services industries 
which added 125000 jobs and the federal government which added 
75000 census bureau workers and other employees 
since november the number of jobs in the services sector of the 
economy has grown by more than 400000 
the government said that for the first quarter there were about 
750000 socalled discouraged workers or people who have given up 
looking for jobs that was the lowest level since the first quarter 
of 1979 
michael evans who heads an economics firm in washington said 
unemployment fell despite the weakerthanexpected increase in jobs 
because the governments figures typically lag and reflect a 
previous months activity that means the fewer jobless americans 
in march benefited from the healthy gains earlier in the year 
i dont think its a negative report even though job gains 
were kind of puny evans said 
he noted that for the januarytomarch period jobs gained an 
average of 250000 a month 
the average manufacturing work week held steady in march at 407 
percent while overtime increased from 36 hours to 37 hours 
average hourly earnings increased from 988 to 992 for a 04 
percent change the government said 
over the past year many economists have predicted a slight rise 
in unemployment this year federal reserve policymakers have 
forecast a rate between 55 percent and 575 percent 
the unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month 
were 
adult white men 40 percent up from 41 percent in february 
adult white women 39 percent down from 41 percent 
white teenagers 127 percent down from 132 percent 
all blacks 106 percent up from 105 percent 
adult black men 96 percent up from 92 percent 
adult black women 90 percent down from 94 percent 
black teenagers 262 percent down from 275 percent 
hispanics 77 percent down from 78 percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the march 
jobless rate was 51 percent down from februarys 52 percent

grain and soybean futures prices turned lower 
after a mixed opening today on the chicago board of trade 
the corn and soybean markets opened with solid gains supported 
by indications the soviet union bought as much a million metric 
tons of us corn 
but the soviets also were said to have purchased large amounts 
of corn and other grains from argentina which dampened buying 
enthusiasm 
i think when everybody figured it all out it looks like the 
argentinians are going to get all the business said john 
frazier director of agricultural futures trading for gerald inc 
in chicago 
i think were going to have a big washout he said 
analysts also attributed some early selling to preweekend 
profittaking after three strong days especially in the soybean 
market 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 to 2 cents lower with may 
at 368 a bushel corn was unchanged to 1 cents lower with may at 
270 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent lower with may at 
152 a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents lower with may 
at 596 a bushel

never mind trade tensions at sam kusumotos 
company a recent office party was enough to put a crimp in 
usjapan relations 
there wasnt an argument or even a minor contretemps at the 
affair many of the american employees just didnt show up it 
seems they didnt know about it in time explains kusumoto 
president of minolta usa in suburban ramsey nj 
at japanese companies we have very nice horizontal 
communication he says everybody listens to what the other guy 
is talking about over the phone after office hours we associate 
so plans for just about everything spread chattily through the 
ranks in japanese of course formal notice americanstyle is 
almost an afterthought 
the americans didnt hear about the party kusumoto says 
and when they discovered the date was decided months ago they got 
upset 
a simple miscue but behind it lay a gulf of misunderstanding 
that somehow has defied nearly 50 years of usjapan amity and 
more than a century of cultural exchange since 19th century japan 
under american prodding cast off its feudal kosode robes 
today more than ever the worlds two most powerful economies 
have become inextricably wedded but too often the relationship 
seems like a bad marriage characterized by frequent squabbles and 
little in common apart from money 
the tensions have appeared in numerous forms despite the best 
efforts of both sides to avoid them in charges of discrimination 
by american employees of japanese companies in a hardhearted new 
appraisal by washington of its onetime protege and vice versa 
and not least in an undercurrent of racism 
the racism often surfaces subtly when japanese companies 
purchased such american corporate icons as columbia pictures and 
new yorks rockefeller center last year the headlines often read 
the japanese buy as if the entire nation were bent 
samurailike on the takeover 
in contrast other major foreign purchasers british canadian 
dutch have been described more accurately as individual companies 
part of it is the sheer cultural impact of japans new wealth 
an economic sea change that made japan the worlds largest creditor 
by the end of the 1980s and its former patron the united states 
the largest debtor 
its the japanese rate of buying thats frightening says 
marlene rossman a new yorkbased consultant to new york companies 
japan is now second only to great britain in us investments 
from may 1987 to last may the number of us factories with at 
least partial japanese ownership nearly doubled from 550 to 1043 
according to the japan external trade organization 
japans total investment in us real estate corporations and 
subsidiaries soared from 47 billion in 1980 to 534 billion in 
1988 according to the most recent commerce department figures 
japanese companies now hold about 50 percent of the commercial real 
estate in downtown los angeles more than 20 prime properties in 
manhattan including tiffanys and substantial holdings in 
washington 
it is not over the issue of washington real estate however but 
closer to the heart of the nations capital that usjapanese 
tensions have perhaps cut deepest 
particularly irksome were the 1989 trade figures released in 
february the united states enjoyed a 15 billion surplus with the 
12nation european community a sharp turnaround from a 92 
billion deficit in 1988 but with japan despite a sharp decline in 
the dollar engineered to help us exports the deficit was a 
stubborn 49 billion 
that was no appreciable improvement from the previous years 
518 billion deficit with japan even with an 18 percent increase 
in us export sales says j michael farren undersecretary for 
international trade in the commerce department 
the trade frictions are aggravated by what many in congress and 
the bush administration see as the japanese governments xenophobic 
resistance to open markets and cultural disposition to treat trade 
as economic warfare 
the fallacy in asking the japanese to open their markets is 
they havent got the foggiest idea what an open market is says 
clyde prestowitz a former commerce department negotiator whose 
influential 1988 book trading places portrayed japan as 
having carefully planned its exportfueled ascendancy 
in tokyo foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said us 
analysts were wrong in arguing that japans culture was an 
unchangeable barrier to concepts like an open market last week 
under growing threat of trade sanctions from the bush 
administration japanese and us negotiators put the finishing 
touches on an unprecedented agreement to liberalize japans market 
including its tightly controlled goods distribution system 
in addition experts point out japan has been gradually moving 
from an exportbased to a domestic marketbased economy 
japan has a long history of adapting foreign ideas watanabe 
said and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so 
one reason however is that the japanese are not as keen on 
foreign ideas these days an attitude born of japans pride in its 
postwar miracle and a growing contempt for the united states 
persistent problems

investigators are poring through records 
seized from escort services they say catered to businessmen 
athletes entertainers and politicians who paid up to 1000 a 
night for a prostitute and charged it 
this hits the highestpriced call girls in prostitution 
said maury dettmer chief of criminal investigations for the 
internal revenue service these are not streetlevel hookers the 
average receipts were for 800 to 1000 an evening 
by thursday six people three in california and one each in 
fort lauderdale dallas and atlanta were in custody charged with 
prostitution weapons or drug offenses uncovered during the 
investigation 
other arrests on money laundering tax evasion racketeering and 
organized crime charges are planned dettmer said 
undercover agents working out of a storefront in tampa posed 
as launderers able to disguise charge card payments so customers 
could bill the services on company cards officials said 
during a twoyear sting tampabased agents said they laundered 
25 million in charge payments from escort services in major 
cities 
since business executives dont want a charge from an escort 
service on their card escort services would pay to hide the 
charge showing it for something such as a copying service said an 
agent who worked undercover on the operation in savannah 
authorities called a news conference at the tampa storefront 
thursday to announce raids on more than 40 escort services 
overnight wednesday and early thursday 
we processed 25 million in creditcard receipts or about 20 
percent of their total gross receipts which we estimate to be 
about 12 million annually dettmer said 
we targeted escort services who advertised in the yellow pages 
that accept credit cards he said adding the reason they take 
credit cards is because businessmen traveling have company credit 
cards companies then deduct it as a business expense 
so not only do we have unreported income from the escort 
services but we have false tax deductions by the businesses who 
used credit cards 
the sting began small in tampa said steve cole spokesman for 
the tampa police department but as word spread among escort 
services business boomed more than 25000 creditcard receipts 
for escort services from 23 cities in 15 states were processed 
officials said 
it just kept getting bigger and bigger cole said 
local police contacted the irs after they were bombarded with 
laundering requests from as many as 100 companies 
agents sent out letters soliciting business cole said they

of sunset enterprises and sent them to the bank then the bank sent 
the money to sunset and the agents in turn paid the escort

the bush administration today hailed the 
usjapan trade agreement as marking a new era in relations but 
cautioned that the accord must be followed by concrete action on 
the part of japan 
we think we have a good blueprint for action and we got a good 
downpayment said us trade representative carla hills 
obviously we want results and if they dont occur we would be 
disappointed 
hills remarks to reporters at a briefing session was in 
response to skeptical comments which greeted the document in 
congress many members said japan had made broad promises before to 
open its markets to foreign products but had failed to live up to 
the agreements 
hills said the administration would be pushing for significant 
followup to thursdays accord in which japan promised to take a 
series of measures to make it easier for foreigners to invest and 
do business in japan 
she said both nations still had to come to terms on a final 
report due in july and that even after that document was finished 
she would consult frequently with the japanese to monitor their 
progress in implementing the commitments 
in tokyo today prime minister toshiki kaifu warned his nation 
that the coming economic changes could in some cases be 
painful but he promised they would lead to an improved quality 
of life for the japanese people 
i ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of 
my country kaifu said in a televised appearance 
the unprecedented agreement followed four days of marathon 
bargaining in washington the talks known as the structural 
impediments initiative were devised by the administration last 
july as a way to attack the underlying cultural reasons for 
americas 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
for the first time representatives of sovereign states set 
about reviewing each others economic failings and making 
suggestions for changes 
from the lengthy lists supplied bot governments drafted a set 
of commitments that they would be willing to make 
the japanese proposals if implemented would be much more 
farreaching in their impact than the us proposals which 
essentially recycled past administrative initiatives including the 
bush plan to cut the capital gains tax as a way of boosting 
investment 
but members of congress said they remained to be convinced that 
the japanese were serious about making the changes needed to open 
their markets to more foreign goods 
put me down as a skeptic who has seen too many japanese 
agreements in which the results didnt match the rhetoric said 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
in any commercial agreement with japan seeing is believing 
said sen john danforth rmo 
in its 22page list of promises the administration said it 
would work to balance the federal budget improve the us 
educational system and boost incentives for personal savings all 
in the name of bolstering americas international competitiveness 
tokyos 32page list of promises which turned out to be more 
comprehensive than many critics had expected pledged to alter the 
closeddoor policies japanese businesses have long employed to keep 
out foreign competition 
kaifus government promised to 
stiffen penalties for antitrust violations by japanese 
companies including higher jail terms for bidrigging and other 
collusive practices which hamper the ability of foreign companies 
to compete in japans market 
reregulate japans complex distribution system which makes it 
difficult for foreigners to get products into the country as part 
of that process the government promised to step up spending for 
construction and expansion of airports and harbors where foreign 
goods arrive 
it also said it would shorten from as much as 10 years down to 
15 years the time needed to get approval to open large retail 
stores restrictions that have blocked american and other foreign 
companies from setting up shop in japanese markets 
pass new legislation designed to alter tax laws in an effort to 
expand the amount of land available for residential construction 
and to boost government spending for housing and related areas such 
as sewer systems 
promote reducing the work week for japanese government and 
privatesector workers to 40 hours and five days and examine ways 
to expand consumer credit 
in many ways the japanese list of proposals sounds like a 
blueprint for transforming a workobsessed thrifty country into a 
nation more like america with more leisure time expanded options 
to buy consumer goods at lower prices and more access to charge 
cards 
administration officials said that while americans have 
developed an inferiority complex over japans economic prowess 
they too often forget the high price japanese consumers have had to 
pay for their nations trade superiority 
it has resulted in a standard of living that the american 
people wouldnt trade for said undersecretary of state richard 
mccormack the head of the us delegation we live far better 
we have far better houses we have far better access to products 
that are much cheaper 
the agreement on reducing structural barriers was the latest in 
a string of trade concessions the japanese government has made 
since kaifu and bush met in california in early march 
in the past two weeks negotiators have reached agreements to 
expand markets for americanmade telecommunications equipment 
satellites and supercomputers 
the flurry of agreements was seen by some as a lastminute 
effort by the japanese to avoid being targeted again this year as 
unfair traders that designation means the administration could 
retaliate by doubling the tariffs on selected japanese goods sold 
in the united states 
the administration must decide by april 30 on its new 
unfairtrade list

congressional staffers say they are getting 
several letters a day supporting calls for a federal probe of the 
firing of a securities analyst who questioned the prospects for a 
donald trump casino 
we are getting a fair amount of mail about five to 10 letters 
a day said dennis fitzgibbons an aide to rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
fitzgibbons said thursday that the mail was from executives and 
citizens from around the country applauding dingells call for 
a securities and exchange commission investigation of the firing of 
gaming industry analyst marvin roffman 
roffman was fired by his firm philadelphiabased janney 
montgomery scott inc on march 23 after he made negative comments 
published in the wall street journal about the longterm prospects 
for trumps new atlantic city nj casino the taj mahal 
trump threatened to sue the firm and roffman was fired after he 
rescinded his initial written apology to the real estate developer 
janney montgomery said it did not fire roffman for his negative 
analysis but for violating firm policies about dealing with the 
news media 
last week dingell wrote sec chairman richard c breeden asking 
the agency which dingells committee oversees to look into firing 
this scenario raises serious questions about the honesty and 
integrity of wall street research as well as conflict of interest 
problems between firms and analysts and their clients dingells 
letter said in part 
dingell also stated that if selfregulation cannot effectively 
deal with these matters we need to be looking at legislative 
remedies 
dingell also asked janney president norman t wilde jr to 
provide the house panel with complete reports on this matter

the bad news keeps coming in the junk bond 
market but that isnt stopping new players from seeking a piece of 
the action 
swelled by the bankruptcy woes of campeau corps us retailing 
arms the amount of corporate bonds defaulting in the first quarter 
of this year quadrupled the bond investors association says 
thirteen companies defaulted on 38 bond issues totaling 569 
billion in the period compared with nine companies and 133 
billion a year earlier the miamibased nonprofit group reported 
the quarters toll surpassed the total for all of 1988 when 497 
billion in defaults were recorded 
the burgeoning growth of defaults is the inevitable consequence 
of the explosive growth of junk bond borrowings in the mid 1980s 
says c richard lehmann president of the association 
were getting that higher fallout because theres more debt 
eligible for fallout lehmann says 
defaults tend to occur four or five years after bonds are issued 
as borrowers problems come home to roost he says those problems 
are plentiful he adds because credit quality deteriorated in the 
80s as companies replaced equity with junk debt via leveraged 
buyouts and recapitalizations 
campeau is a prime example having issued billions in junk bonds 
to acquire allied stores corp and federated department stores inc 
those subsidiaries filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
january and accounted for 35 billion of the first quarters 
defaults but even without campeau defaults rose 64 percent in the 
period 
lehmann says he conservatively estimates defaults will hit a 
record 15 billion this year exceeding last years 117 billion 
over the next three years he forecasts a staggering 40 billion in 
defaults 
those numbers may mean bad news for some investors but they 
spell opportunity for fitch investors service inc 
the rating agency has been moving aggressively to compete with 
its bigger rivals moodys investors service and standard amp poors 
and it hopes to make a mark with a new service that evaluates 
socalled distressed credits 
we believe the markets ripe for it says b daniel evans 
chief operating officer at fitch 
in contrast to the traditional rating game which ranks 
borrowers according to their perceived ability to repay fitchs 
recovery analysis aims to tell bondholders how much they are likely 
to get back on investments in companies that are in bankruptcy or 
facing severe distress 
first the service tries to determine the value of a borrowers 
assets then it examines the covenants of the companys bond issues 
to determine what leverage bondholders might have over management 
simple stuff for a rating agency but it gets more problematic 
next fitch estimates how long it will take to work out the 
companys problems and realize values for bondholders then it 
tries to determine how proceeds will be allocated among individual 
bond issues and discounts those proceeds back to the present 
with federated for example fitch estimates holders of the 
retailers senior classes of bonds can expect to receive 78 cents 
on the dollar in about three years time assuming that holds true 
an investor who pays 42 cents for the bonds now would get an 
effective return of 25 percent a year 
fitch is selling its service to institutional investors as part 
of a broad package of highyield research for 10000 a year it 
could be a fertile market judging by the growing number of 
investors poking around the wreckage of the junk market evans says 
oppenheimer high yield fund for example now has 5 percent to 6 
percent of its assets invested in distressed credits compared with 
perhaps 2 percent six months ago portfolio manager ralph 
stellmacher says 
we have gravitated toward that sector because that is where 
were finding the most values he says 
the boom in defaults has been good business for rd smith amp co 
the new york broker specializes in distressed credits and workout 
situations and its staff has grown to nearly 100 from only 30 
three years ago president mike singer says 
it takes a lot of legal expertise to assess the value of a 
bankrupt companys securities because there are no strict rules 
as to how an estate gets allocated singer cautions but for 
those who can do the job theres no end of work in sight 
the supply of distressed securities still far outpaces the new 
funds coming into the market singer says

a record 30year sentence given to a former 
savings and loan executive convicted of fraud won applause from 
regulators who said it showed authorities were dead serious about 
cracking down on thrift fraud 
the sentence for woody f lemons former chairman of vernon 
savings amp loan was the stiffest ever given to a thrift executive 
in a fraud case regulators said us district judge robert b 
maloney said it was well deserved 
lemons was a thief in every sense of the word the judge 
said 
the sentence was praised by l william seidman chairman of the 
federal deposit insurance corp and the resolution trust corp 
which is overseeing the thrift industry bailout 
i think it says these kinds of crimes are very serious 
seidman said they are very harmful to the people of the united 
states and they are going to be punished severely 
lemons was convicted in december on 13 charges including 
misapplication of funds conspiracy and bank fraud for soliciting 
a 9000 kickback from a loan broker in january 1986 and receiving 
212000 from the broker in april 1986 
seidman had written maloney urging him to send a message to 
the banking and thrift community and to other who would commit such 
egregious acts as did mr lemons 
us attorney general dick thornburg called the sentence fair 
and just punishment for one whose criminal misconduct resulted in a 
multimillion dollar fraud in the texas savings and loan industry 
vernon sampl was shut down in 1987 as part of a thenrecord 13 
billion federal bailout and has been cited as an example of some 
of the worst abuses in the savings and loan industry six other 
vernon officials a consultant and two borrowers have been 
convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes 
when regulators seized vernon they found it owned 17th century 
castle doors and expensive art objects including a baccarat eagle 
and a silverstudded saddle the thrift also owned a yacht in 
washington dc 
prosecutors said lemon spent some of his money on a west coast 
home and on travel 
maloney levied no fine against lemons but he still faces an 
april 19 hearing on restitution the government is seeking as much 
as 18 million in repayment 
the judge said he had received more than 100 letters on lemons 
behalf praising his church and community activities but he wasnt 
persuaded 
your friends are wrong maloney said you are not a 
religious man even though you are present in church you are 
not listening 
you have no real moral values the judge said if you had 
the opportunity you would steal again you are a thief in every 
sense of the word 
elated government attorneys would say little about the sentence 
but were heard shouting hot dog as they disappeared into their 
offices 
they hit a home run said defense attorney michael gibson 
who promised to appeal the sentence 
gibson accused the government of having another agenda in 
prosecuting lemons 
hes going to be the trophy that the federal agencies bag 
gibson told maloney later the attorney predicted you will see 
mr lemons and the sentence used to enhance the agencies 
position in congress 
the sentencing of lemons sets the stage for an expected 
indictment of another former vernon chairman don r dixon who is 
painted by government officials as the main culprit behind the 
abuses at the thrift 
dixon has been notified he is the target of a federal 
investigation according to his attorney he also is the lead 
defendant in a 540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in 1987 
gibson would not say if prosecutors had sought lemons 
cooperation against dixon but dixons attorney william m 
ravkind said anybody facing 30 years would turn in their 
mother 
five other vernon officials and two vernon borrowers and a 
consultant also have pleaded guilty in thriftconnected cases in 
addition former president patrick g king was convicted of fraud 
and sentenced by maloney to five years in jail and fined 55000

ual corp directors announced today they have 
agreed to sell the parent of united airlines to its employees for 
201 a share or 438 billion 
the move heads off a threatened proxy fight with the companys 
largest shareholder but puts ual back in a familiar position 
floating a deal with uncertain financing 
under the agreement employees will exchange 155 in cash 35 
in ual notes and an estimated 11 worth of securities in ual 
subsidiary covia corp for each ual share 
there was no immediate word on how the deal was to be financed 
but a source close to the negotiations told the associated press 
the parties had no firm financing for the deal 
ual parent of united airlines said it expects to conclude a 
final agreement promptly with united employee acquisition corp a 
new company organized by uniteds pilots flight attendants and 
machinists 
at a news conference today in new york representatives of the 
unions said the agreement calls for employees to give up 2 billion 
in concessions over five years including 300 million in the first 
year and 500 million in the fifth year 
the breakdown of ownership in the new company would be as 
follows pilots owning about 379 percent machinists owning about 
357 percent nonunion employees about 143 percent and flight 
attendants about 12 percent the unions said 
machinists union vice president john peterpaul predicted banks 
would look favorably on the deal 
were very optimistic about the financing he said 
uals largest shareholder coniston partners immediately called 
off its threatened proxy fight to oust the companys board at the 
april 26 annual shareholder meeting coniston holds an 118 percent 
stake 
we think its a fair deal said coniston general partner 
paul tierney adding that employees and stockholders alike will 
gain from the agreement 
the announcement met with a lukewarm reaction however from 
some analysts who questioned how the deal would be financed and 
whether banks would be willing to back the bid without a strong 
management group behind it 
the fate of ual chairman stephen wolf has been in doubt because 
of union indications made before today that they would dump wolf in 
the event of an employee buyout 
pilots union head frederick dubinsky said in new york today that 
wolf would be replaced 
its our intention to put together a topnotch senior 
management team and that will include a new chief executive 
officer he said 
theres not a financed bid and theres a lot of skepticism 
said edward starkman an airline analyst for painewebber inc in 
new york 
uals stock opened up 350 a share at 169 on the new york 
stock exchange but by midday had slid back to 16550 unchanged 
from thursday 
the agreement marks another chapter in a takeover saga that 
began in august when los angeles investor marvin davis made a 54 
billion offer for the company davis said earlier this week he 
would not make another bid 
but his initial offer sent uniteds pilots and management 
scrambling to come up with their own bid in september ual 
directors accepted a 675 billion offer from the pilots 
management and british airways plc that also included labor and 
wage concessions 
the proposal was killed after the wouldbe purchasers were 
unable to line up enough financing failure of that deal 
contributed to a 190point plunge in the dow jones industrial 
average on oct 13 and was seen as the end of the takeover boom of 
the 1980s 
the stakes were raised again in november when coniston announced 
it had amassed a large block of ual stock and wanted to reduce the 
number of directors on the companys board 
after ual directors told financial advisers to consider a 
recapitalization plan in january uniteds three labor unions 
proposed buying 75 percent of the stock 
that proposal resulted in a 185ashare 38 billion buyout 
offer from the unions that the ual board rejected two weeks ago 
the bid was reportedly opposed strongly by ual chairman stephen 
wolf 
earlier this week the board met at least twice by telephone 
presumably on the buyout scenario 
united is the nations largest carrier behind american airlines

miller brewing co said friday that the company 
has expanded production of sharps its new nonalcoholic brew 
because demand in some areas has left it short of supply 
milwaukeebased miller introduced the alcoholfree beer in 
december producing it at its breweries in albany ga and eden 
nc 
but firstquarter sales in 1990 were so strong miller is 
expanding production to a third brewery in fulton ny said tony 
sciolla new products manager the company declined to release the 
exact sales figures 
we didnt expect it to do as well as it has miller 
spokesman ron richards said we hope the expansion that weve 
done will solve the spot shortages 
the immediate success of sharps did not surprise some beer 
industry analysts who predicted it could soon bump g heileman 
brewing cos kingsberry label as the top selling nonalcoholic 
beer 
frank walters vice president of research for impact a 
bimonthly newsletter for the alcoholic beverage industry said he 
expects growth in the nonalcoholic segment of the market to 
continue 
in 1989 sales of nonalcoholic drinks was up 14 percent he 
said it was one of the fastergrowing segments of the beverage 
market behind imported vodkas up 24 percent and california 
varietal wines up 16 percent 
walters said he expects sales of sharps and odouls the 
nonalcoholic brand anhueserbusch introduced this year to grow 
fastest and put a lot of pressure on la crosse wisbased 
heilemans kingsberry brand 
i think theyll do very well because of the clout that both 
companies have he said 
richards said the overwhelming consumer response to sharps 
was due in part to a brewing process that allows miller to brew at 
lower temperatures minimizing alcohol production 
the process produces a nonalcohol beer that tastes the same as 
regular beer he said 
most other brewers that have nonalcohol or lowalcohol beer 
first brew regular beer and then remove the alcohol along with 
the real beer flavor he said 
richards also cited a trend toward drinking moderation he said 
the product was selling best in the northeast the midwest and the 
west 
the trend toward tougher enforcement of drunken driving laws is 
also a factor walters added 
police arent playing around he said i would suspect 
that onpremise is a big share of the business someone who wants 
to go out and visit a bar they can have two or three and not have 
any problems

natural gas field 
mesa t boone pickens jrs energy company said in december it 
would package its hugoton holdings into a separate trust and sell 
shares to raise money to help pay down some of the partnerships 
15 billion in longterm debt much of it left over from the 715 
million purchase of natural gas properties from tenneco inc in 
1988 
at the right price the hugoton offering made sense for mesa 
unitholders pickens said were simply not going to sell a 
portion of our premier properties at an inferior price 
the decision was based on unusual delays experienced in 
bringing the transaction to market and pricing indications which 
did not reflect the value of mesas hugoton reserves the 
company said 
w mark womble mesas vice president of finance said the 
partnership had hoped to raise about 400 million through the sale 
but indications were the offering would only bring in about 320 
million 
plans were to sell about 16 million units at about 25 per unit 
womble said indications were the units would bring no more than 20 
each 
its just not something we had to do womble said were 
not to the point that we have to sell anything to pay debt 
mesa had about 350 million in cash investments at the end of 
1989 womble said adding that the properties may never be sold 
we have not said that we would ever come back to the market 
with this particular deal he said 
the field has been producing a long time and will produce a 
long time into the future and its not going anywhere he said by 
telephone from mesas offices in amarillo 
between 12 percent and 15 percent of mesas natural gas holdings 
are in the hugoton field in kansas womble said

financial market turmoil stemming from the japanese 
yens sharp decline provided the backdrop for key talks by us 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and the economics chiefs of other 
major industrial nations who gathered friday 
the ministers from the socalled group of seven nations holding 
their first formal discussions of 1990 also were expected on 
saturday to examine west germanys plans to forge a monetary union 
with east germany as well as the political upheavals in other east 
european countries 
in advance of the meeting at the french finance ministry 
analysts were doubtful the group of seven britain canada 
france west germany italy japan and the united states would 
change course dramatically 
the nations generally work together to achieve broad economic 
goals often through currency exchange rates and rely at times on 
coordinated market intervention as a tool 
i dont expect any major policy conclusions said david 
wyss chief financial economist at the consulting firm of 
drimcgraw hill in lexington mass 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy and his german 
counterpart theo waigel held bilateral talks friday but said 
their discussions did not extend to the international financial 
scene 
the japanese worried about the weakness of their currency 
against the dollar over recent months were expected to appeal to 
their economic partners for help in boosting the yens value 
the yens slump has rattled the tokyo stock market because of 
speculation about its negative implications for the japanese 
economy and stocks have tumbled by more than 25 percent so far in 
1990 
earlier in the week the dollar skyrocketed to a threeyear high 
of more than 160 yen before retreating a bit the yen closed at 
about 1575 yen to the dollar friday in tokyo reflecting 
uncertainty in the currency markets about the outcome of the group 
of seven meeting 
a stronger dollar also is worrisome for the united states 
because it threatens to aggravate the already large american trade 
deficit with japan it makes japanese imports less expensive for 
us consumers and american goods costlier for foreign buyers 
many analysts predicted the united states would be wary of 
promising to do much to prop up the yen some said american 
officials may agree to intervene more in the currency markets by 
selling dollars to try to strengthen the japanese currency 
the japanese would like to see the americans lower their 
interest rates which would in turn help lift the yen but the us 
federal reserve has been hesitant to knock down those rates for 
fear of igniting domestic inflationary pressures at home 
while the financial markets were most interested in the outcome 
of the yen talks the officials could spend more time considering 
the events unfolding in east germany and its eastbloc neighbors 
it will be the first time the finance ministers and the central 
bank presidents have met since the political shakeups in the east 
at the end of last year 
waigel and karl otto poehl the president of the west german 
bundesbank the central bank were expected to give details on 
their plans for creating an economic and monetary union this summer 
with east germany 
the bonn government has become embroiled in a controversy over 
the conversion rate for exchange of the east german currency to the 
west german mark 
the bundesbank has recommended a rate of one west german mark 
for each east german mark with a higher rate for small savings 
accounts 
east germans have complained that the proposed rate would 
effectively cut in half their wages pensions and other savings 
no final decision has been announced on the conversion rate 
the finance chiefs agenda also included plans for the new 
european bank for reconstruction and development designed to 
funnel aid into eastern europe and proposals for increased lending 
by the international monetary fund to poor nations

grain and soybean futures closed lower friday on 
the chicago board of trade as profittaking set in following a 
strong opening on rumors of a major grain purchase by the soviet 
union 
the rumors of a soviet grain purchase were never confirmed 
during the day and traders took the opportunity to cash in on the 
surge in the market 
corn and wheat had been rallying for past two weeks on 
expectations of a major purchase by the soviets said joel 
karlin an analyst with research department inc in chicago but 
they sold off with no word of a purchase 
wheat prices was getting support from expectations of a weekend 
freeze in winter wheat crop areas however that concern was eased 
as forecasts indicated the drop in temperatures would not be so 
severe 
slack export demand for soybeans also weighed on futures 
however concern over the availability of soybeans and soymeal out 
of brazil provided some support to prices karlin said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 365 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents lower with may at 269 a bushel oats were cent to 1 
cents lower with may at 151 a bushel soybeans were a cent to 
3 cents lower with may at 595 cents a bushel

importer ronald v davis has adopted the market 
revival of perrier sparkling water as a personal mission 
i feel like my family has been attacked said the 
43yearold father of two teenagers in describing his emotional 
reaction to the worst problem hes faced in two decades in the 
beverage business 
davis president and chief executive of perrier group of america 
inc in greenwich conn felt a misstep in handling perriers 
contamination crisis could damage the french brands image for 
decades 
but he relied on instinct and the advice of longtime colleagues 
in ordering the recall feb 9 of every perrier bottle in the united 
states the government had alerted the company that several bottles 
of perrier in north carolina were found to have trace amounts of 
benzene a dangerous chemical 
you cant be trained for an event like this he said 
when specially marked perrier is returned to american stores 
bars and restaurants in a few weeks davis hopes customers will 
respond by restoring perrier to its former stature as the nations 
bestselling imported water 
the big red flag that seemed about to go up and wave and kill 
the cachet of the brand never went up and davis is responsible for 
that said tom pirko president of the beverage consultant 
bevmark inc of los angeles 
pirko initially expected perriers share of the 22 billion 
us bottled water market would drop 10 to 15 percent in the 
aftermath of the contamination and recall but he says now the 
damage is going to be very minor and pentup demand could make 
the brand stronger than ever 
critics said davis was not quick enough in explaining to 
consumers directly through advertising rather than through news 
media briefings how the perrier bottles became contaminated a 
halfdozen lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging 
that the product has been misrepresented as pure 
davis said the company acted responsibly in reaction to the 
crisis and that the lawsuits are groundless he said he ordered the 
recall voluntarily after independent laboratory analyses indicated 
the contamination was not confined to a single batch of perrier or 
a single part of the country 
source perrier sa the french bottler which owns 53 percent of 
privately held perrier group initially blamed a workers improper 
use of a cleaning solvent containing benzene for the contamination 
but the contamination was later traced to the gas reservoir that 
lies beneath the spring from which perrier is drawn in vergezes 
while the water was pure source perrier discovered benzene occurs 
in small amounts in the gas and a filter failed to screen it out 
before bottling 
the company said it took steps to monitor and replace filters 
more often so the contamination will not happen again 
in a recent interview davis was unable to cite anything in his 
professional career that includes nearly 10 years in general foods 
beverage division that compared with the stresses of the 
contamination incident 
davis lives with his wife son and daughter in greenwich an 
affluent new york suburb he was born jan 26 1947 and grew up 
near los angeles where a dispenser of arrowhead bottled water now 
one of perrier groups brands was a fixture in his house 
after college davis joined general foods and worked on the 
country time lemonade brand he moved to perrier group in 1979 
intent on expanding its business which amounted to 20 million in 
annual sales and one brand perrier 
davis became president and chief executive the next year and 
the company has grown to 640 million in annual sales and nine 
brands 
a marathon runner and an avid golfer who regularly shoots in the 
70s davis is described as competitive he hates to lose whether 
we are playing gin rummy or are on the golf course even if its only 
1 at stake said louis a matagrano head of a beverage 
distributorship that has handled perrier for 10 years in san mateo 
county south of san francisco 
davis said he became aware of reports from north carolina that a 
private laboratory had discovered bottles of perrier were 
contaminated on feb 6 the company gets calls 15 to 18 times a 
year from someone saying they have found something that usually 
prove groundless he said 
but over the next three days both the federal government and 
the companys independent tests disclosed trace amounts of benzene 
in perrier bottles selected randomly in various regions 
davis said he was assured the benzene levels posed no safety or 
health hazard and the government was not demanding any action but 
he said it was clear on friday feb 9 what should be done 
after all the products ad theme was its perfect its 
perrier 
kim jeffery the former pepsicola co executive who is davis 
top marketing ally suggested the recall in a conference call that 
friday as he and davis talked to frederik zimmer managing director 
of source perrier in france 
davis said they instantly agreed we could have sat there and 
agonized but that didnt happen it was like all three of us were 
together he said 
he said expense was not an issue reclaiming the 70 million 
bottles cost about 30 million alone when a products whole 
reason for being is quality and purity the costs of not doing what 
we did would have been borne for the next 100 years davis said 
the recall was announced friday afternoon perriers 178 
distributors were told by telephone and fax they were not to load 
the trucks on monday 
on saturday packages were sent to distributors by courier 
telling them to collect all the bottles and outlining reimbursement 
procedures davis held a news conference a tollfree telephone 
line for consumers was activated sunday 
on monday davis went to france where it took three days to 
pinpoint the cause he talked by phone with james burke who guided 
johnson amp johnson through two tylenol poisonings in the 1980s 
burkes advice be straight 
the next week perrier hired bursonmarsteller the 
communications company they worked on the tylenol case by march 6 
the recall was virtually complete and davis announced plans to 
relaunch ther brand by summer 
it ran a fullpage ad in 22 major newspapers admitting a 
mistake that it said was identified and corrected 
bevmarks pirko said perrier evidently will not suffer from the 
disclosure that benzene is present in the gas reservoir used to 
make the water fizzy the harpoon that could have stuck went 
whizzing by he said 
industry executives applaud davis i have enormous respect for 
what he did considering what little he knew about it when he made 
his decision said jack west owner of puro corp a water 
company serving offices in metropolitan new york

fisherprice on friday announced that 
20000 of its child car seats made since feb 1 could break during 
a crash and offered free repair kits so consumers can fix the 
problem 
a faulty die that weakened a metal part was discovered during 
tests said company spokeswoman carol blackley the repair kit 
includes a new part and tools with which to install it 
the problem affects at most onefifth of the child seats made 
between feb 1 and april 1 blackley said she said consumers 
should call fisherprice to inquire whether their seat is one of 
the defective ones and to order a repair kit if so 
seats should not be returned to the store blackley said 
the seat can be used before the repair kit arrives if it is used 
in the rearfacing position for infants weighing less than 20 
pounds but should not be used for larger children until it is 
fixed she said 
blackley refused to say how much the repair kits would cost 
fisherprice but said it would have a minimal financial effect on 
the company 
last year fisherprice sent out repair kits for 15 million of 
the child safety seats because they did not meet federal 
flammability standards

attention among stock and bond traders the department said nonfarm 
payroll employment increased by 26000 last month well below 
advance estimates and the smallest gain in more than 3 years 
that latter figure prompted a brief rise in treasury bond 
prices but those gains quickly dissipated as the morning passed 
and if stock investors were at all encouraged about prospects 
for lower interest rates brokers said the data also raised 
questions about whether the corporate earnings outlook would 
improve any time soon

champion spark plug co said friday it would 
consolidate its us operations by closing two plants because of 
less demand for spark plugs 
the move will affect 675 salaried and hourly workers 245 in 
detroit and 430 in toledo 
the two plants will be phased out over the next two years 
production will be integrated into the companys burlington iowa 
and cambridge ohio operations champion employs 10000 people 
worldwide 
judging from the factors that exist today its not only 
inevitable its the right thing to do william basedow director 
of employee relations said at a news conference 
company officials and representatives of the united auto workers 
union are to meet regarding how the timing of the consolidation 
will affect production and maintenance employees 
company officials said new jobs in burlington and cambridge 
would be created 
champion has been struggling for several years with an 
overcapacity of production facilities while at the same time 
selling a product spark plugs whose overall market has 
declined said jerry godwin champion president 
champion plants in toledo produce spark plug shells and assemble 
the final spark plugs the detroit plant manufactures ceramic 
insulation used in the plug 
champion is a division of houstonbased cooper industries inc 
which bought the company last year for 707 million 
basedow said champions plans have nothing to do with the sale 
saying the company had to streamline to remain competitive 
the prior management had a similar study and came to much the 
same conclusions that we have had these factors been in place 
in 1988 1989 they would have done the same thing he said 
basedow said the declining spark plug market was caused by a 
reduction in the number of cylinders in automobiles because of 
smaller engines improvements in the ignition systems on most 
vehicles and in the spark plugs themselves resulting in longer 
life and unleaded fuel which does not damage spark plugs as does 
leaded fuel 
foreign spark plugs entering the country as original equipment 
in imported cars also contributed to falling demand

the price tag on the savings and loan bailout 
could hit a mindboggling 500 billion if the economy falters 
congressional auditors said friday in their bleakest assessment of 
the thrift crisis yet 
the general accounting office said it would cost the government 
at least 325 billion to close or sell failed savings institutions 
thats greater than the pentagons annual budget 
but even the new projection a sharp 26 percent higher than the 
257 billion estimate offered by the gao only five months ago is 
optimistic said comptroller general charles a bowsher who heads 
the gao 
it could easily become a 400 billion problem and it might 
even hit as high as 500 billion or half a trillion dollars if 
you get the economy working against you bowsher told the senate 
banking committee 
his testimony at a sparsely attended hearing challenged the bush 
administrations contention that regulators have enough money for 
now and a reassessment can wait until after this years 
congressional elections 
bowsher called on treasury secretary nicholas f brady and 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman who is 
administering the bailout to develop proposals to provide the 
additional funds 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich the committee chairman said 
he would ask the administration to respond at a hearing next month 
this devastating statement from the gao should be a call 
to arms for all people involved from the administration to 
congress to the industry said sen bob graham dfla 
in past appearances before congressional committees seidman has 
conceded that last years bailout probably is underfunded the 
administration however has suggested it could get by through 
early appropriation of about 30 billion intended for sampl failures 
after 1992 
michael boskin chairman of the white house council of economic 
advisers declined to comment on the report but promised well 
analyze it in detail 
the gaos new estimate includes interest payments spread over 40 
years but the bulk of the 325 billion will be needed during the 
1990s taxpayers will have to pick up most of the 68 billion 
increase bowsher said that likely would push their share of the 
total above 200 billion with the sampl industry paying the rest 
we are looking here at a huge huge number as far as what the 
american taxpayer is going to have to pay he said 
the administration had planned to spend 50 billion to cover 
losses in sampls that fail through 1992 but bowsher said it would 
need at least 13 billion more 
the gao chief said the government also will have to spend 5 
billion more than anticipated on interest to borrow the 50 
billion 10 billion more for administrative expenses at the 
bailout agency the resolution trust corp and 28 billion more 
for interest on money the rtc is borrowing temporarily until it can 
sell the assets from failed thrifts 
additionally bowsher said the government will need 12 billion 
more than earlier projections to meet its obligations through 1999 
under the more than 200 sampl rescue deals concluded in 1988 that 
will cost 68 billion rather than 56 billion he said 
bowsher blamed the overall shortfall in part on the governments 
slow start in closing and selling failed sampls over the past 14 
months regulators have seized 403 institutions but disposed of 
only 52 
stillopen failed sampls under government control or targeted for 
takeover are losing 29 million a day on their operations 
it is imperative that rtc begin to quickly resolve troubled 
institutions to minimize the ultimate costs bowsher said 
seidman who also serves as chairman of the rtc has announced 
plans to sharply accelerate the bailout pace closing or rescuing 
140 institutions by the end of june 
riegle graham and pressler were the only senators on the 
21member committee who showed up to hear the bad news many of the 
others had already left washington to start the easter recess in 
their home states 
on another matter gao officials said it was too soon to say if 
the insurance fund backing commercial bank deposits was in trouble 
but robert gramling gao director of accounting and financial 
management said auditors were very concerned about banks 
struggling with a real estate slowdown in the northeast 
i dont see the fdic fund in a growth pattern he said a 
gao audit of the fund which has lost money in the last two years 
will be issued in june

the widow of a businessman who killed himself 
so his insurance money could finance a battle with the internal 
revenue service pleaded with congress friday to control the irs 
to keep it from destroying peoples lives 
this kind of thing should never have happened to me and 
alex kay m council of high point nc told the senate finance 
oversight subcommittee we didnt do anything wrong we just got 
caught up in the middle of a big irs screwup and we couldnt get 
out of it 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr who preceded mrs council 
on the witness stand was not asked about her case but said his 
agency in general is making a great deal of progress implementing 
the 1988 law known as the taxpayer bill of rights 
citizens of this country have more rights today in proceeding 
against the irs than against any other agency and i think that 
is good goldberg said he said employees have been put on notice 
that we need to be attentive to attitudes 
nine years after the councils got into trouble with the irs by 
writing off a 70000 taxshelter loss mrs council returned home 
one night in june 1988 to find a note from her husband 
my dearest kay i have taken my life in order to provide 
capital for you the irs and its liens which have been taken 
against our property illegally by a runaway agency of our 
government have dried up all sources of credit for us so i have 
made the only decision i can its purely a business decision 
you will find my body on the lot on the north side of the house 
mrs council 48 eventually won a federal court ruling that she 
and her husband owed the irs nothing not the 300000 in taxes 
interest and penalties the irs claimed 
the court held the irs deficiency notice was sent four months 
after the statute of limitations had expired 
the irs apparently had misaddressed an earlier notice by the 
time the dispute was decided by the courts mrs council had sold 
her home and paid 70000 in legal fees her credit rating was 
ruined and as she put it i was cheated of growing old with the 
man i love 
she said the poor have little chance of fighting the bureaucracy 
i dont think i would have ever gotten into a courtroom if my 
attorneys hadnt known that i had 250000 from alexs life 
insurance she said 
mrs councils story highlighted a hearing on how the irs has 
responded to the 1988 law aimed at protecting rights of citizens 
involved in disputes with the tax agency 
she has refused to waive her privacy rights blocking the irs 
from commenting on any part of her tax history 
irs commissioner goldberg said the tax agency is doing well in 
implementing the law that requires that taxpayers be notified of 
their rights requires the agency to give earlier notice before 
imposing a lien on property and demands that notices of additional 
taxes owed spell out such claims in clear language 
what the american public resents is complexity uncertainty 
hassles with the irs that take month after month after month to 
resolve goldberg said 
goldberg adamantly denied that the irs has a quota system for 
rewarding employees on the basis of how much they collect he 
called reprehensible a snitch scheme reported to the 
subcommittee in which the irs supposedly would reduce the taxes of 
any business that turned in competitors who were cheating 
it shouldnt be happening goldberg said if it is wed 
like to know about it and will put a stop to it today 
david keating executive vice president of the national 
taxpayers union said that in the fight for taxpayer rights much 
progress has been made but more legal protections are necessary 
he said that even if the new law had been in effect for the 
councils to use it probably would not have helped the provision 
allows a taxpayer to sue for damages if the irs has recklessly or 
intentionally disregarded any tax law but congress dropped from 
the original draft similar recourse in case of careless action by 
the irs 
reckless and intentional treatment is a very difficult 
standard to prove he said 
mrs council said she had thought that beating the irs in court 
would give some meaning to alexs death but it hasnt there 
has to be something done to control the irs to keep it from 
destroying peoples lives

copper futures rallied sharply friday on new yorks commodity 
exchange on concerns over the continued strike at mines in peru and 
declining supplies but profittaking trimmed prices near the close 
of trading 
on other markets precious metals were higher grain and 
soybeans declined livestock surged and pork prices declined and 
oil prices were mixed 
copper settled 160 cents to 255 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in april at 1245 a pound 
copper prices surged 420 points in early trading on the comex 
before gains were trimmed by half to settle 255 to 160 points 
higher 
analyst jim steel of refco inc in new york said the rally 
stemmed from short covering the buying of contracts to fulfill 
obligations made by selling borrowed contracts earlier by traders 
following thursdays selloff he said the selloff was prompted by 
reports the strike was over but the fresh indications that the 
mines were still shut alarmed the market 
however steel said belief the strike was winding down caused 
prices to retreat near the close of trading 
steel said the price surge also was helped by feelings that 
copper stocks in london metal exchange warehouses had declined 
precious metals futures rose in trading on the comex 
gold prices surged following the release of employment figures 
by the us bureau of labor statistics that showed a minor increase 
in the number of jobs created and a decline of jobs in the 
manufacturing sector 
steel called the employment figures disappointing and said they 
could result in lower interest rates and weakening of the dollar 
which he says would be good for gold 
gold was 590 higher with april at 38075 a troy ounce silver 
was 21 cents to 21 cents higher with may at 519 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures closed lower on the chicago board of 
trade as profittaking set in following a strong opening on rumors 
of a major grain purchase by the soviet union 
the rumors of a soviet grain purchase never were confirmed 
during the day and traders took the opportunity to cash in on the 
markets surge 
after the close of trading the us agriculture department 
reported the sale of 750000 metric tons of corn to the ussr 
wheat prices was getting support from expectations of a weekend 
freeze in winter wheat crop areas however that concern was eased 
as forecasts indicated the drop in temperatures would not be as 
severe as previously expected 
slack export demand for soybeans also weighed on futures 
however concern over the availability of soybeans and soymeal out 
of brazil provided some support to prices said joel karlin an 
analyst with research department inc in chicago 
wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with may at 365 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 269 a 
bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with may at 151 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with may at 595

increased demand 
live cattle were 20 cent to 80 cent higher with april at 7975

in 1977 a secondtier wall street firm named 
drexel burnham lambert inc issued 30 million in curious ious 
called highyield bonds to help finance the growth of an oil 
company texas international co 
the deal marked the start of the drexel era a corporate cattle 
rush that raised billions of dollars for american businesses 
through risky paper that earned the nickname junk 
investigators say drexels brash behavior also helped spawn 
criminal dealings that sullied wall street in the 1980s 
thirteen years after the tiny junkbond deal drexel is going 
out of business texas international emerges from bankruptcy court 
monday after plunging to a disaster fueled by heavy debts and an 
oil bust 
the relationship between the giant new york investment house and 
the oklahoma city oil driller in many ways tells drexels story 
drexel provided the means to grow temporarily saved the company 
when times soured and now is accused of ripping it off along the 
way 
a report in federal bankruptcy court alleges that drexel sapped 
texas international by trading on inside information secretly 
parking bonds with a scandalous thrift and charging 3 million 
to create a tax shelter for its own holdings 
the 53page report by a lawyer for texas internationals 
stockholders committee unsealed following a request by the 
associated press portrays drexel as hellbent to make as much money 
as possible at its clients expense while serving as financial 
adviser from 1985 to 1987 
while drexel legitimately raised capital for scores of companies 
seeking to grow many of whom still sing drexels praises the 
texas international report supports a darker view of the investment 
firms legacy to the takeoverfrenzied 80s 
there will be the continuing perception that in the pursuit of 
a brilliant idea drexel went too far said samuel l hayes iii 
an investment banking professor at harvard business school 
they were streetsmart people he said they smelled an 
opportunity and moved very aggressively to exploit it they may 
have carried it to the nth degree but thats certainly not out of 
character for an investment bank 
drexel last year admitted to running an illicit trading network 
prosecutors say was directed by junkbond innovator michael milken 
the firm pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay 650 
million in fines and restitution milken who says hes innocent 
has been indicted but no trial date is set 
drexel was accused of lawbreaking in about 20 deals texas 
international was not one of them and federal law enforcers 
decline to say whether they even investigated it 
the report unsealed by the bankruptcy court nevertheless alleges 
a variety of improprieties and blames drexel for making texas 
internationals problems worse seeking to invalidate drexels 14 
million claim as a creditor the shareholders committee says drexel 
deliberately structured deals to fail so it could generate more 
business 
from 1978 to 1983 drexel issued about 150 million in 
highyield bonds for texas international which used the money to 
expand operations by drilling for deep natural gas in texas and 
louisiana 
in taking on the debt which wasnt limited to financing by 
drexel the company counted on rising oil prices but they 
collapsed in 1986 texas internationals stock fell from 27 to 1 
on the brink of default the company hired drexel to restructure 
its debt by lowering payments delaying due dates and substituting 
stock for some of its bonds 
in three deals drexel refinanced 389 million of texas 
international debt the investment firm pioneered socalled debt 
exchange offers and texas international acknowledges the 
arrangements staved off a bankruptcy filing 
but only temporarily crushed by the burden texas international 
in 1987 sold key oil fields in texas louisiana and oklahomafor 
120 million to make interest payments laying off hundreds of 
workers still failing the company sought bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors in april 1988 
the shareholders report was written by benjamin waisbren a 
milwaukee attorney based on drexel trading records and other 
company documents a federal judge ordered drexel to surrender 
waisbren filed the report last november but asked the court not 
to make it public apparently to try to pressure drexel to drop its 
claim as a creditor drexel whose parent sought bankruptcy court 
protection in february did not contest unsealing the report nor 
has it dropped its claim against texas international 
the report says that because drexel bought so much of the 
companys stock and bonds it blurred the line between paid adviser 
and interested party 
the committee alleges possibly illegal parking with lincoln 
savings and loan association of california a collapsed thrift now 
under federal investigation that bought hundreds of millions of 
drexelissued bonds parking refers to placing securities in 
another partys name to avoid disclosing ownership to the 
government 
the report also claims drexel used inside information about the 
debt exchanges to profit by trading texas international stock 
billed the company 32 million to set up a tax shelter for 
interest income from drexel junkbond holdings and charged nearly 
4 million for financial advice it never gave 
drexel denies the claims 
on each occasion where we acted as financial adviser on 
exchange offers for texas international strong economic benefits 
were produced for the company drexel said in a statement 
based on everything we know the allegations of the equity 
committee are groundless 
the claims were not made by a federal law enforcement agency and 
carry no more weight than a civil lawsuit but they mirror the 
kinds of allegations that have dogged drexel for years 
the common defense among former drexel employees is that wall 
street resented the upstart investment house for creating a wildly 
successful product and siphoning business from established 
whiteshoe firms 
people that couldnt compete just couldnt take it said a 
longtime executive in drexels junkbond department based in 
beverly hills calif 
to be sure drexels crimes and reputation dont tell the whole 
story drexel lent money to chrysler corp when no one else would 
helped mattel corp avert bankruptcy gave mci communications corp 
the power to become a telephone giant 
the people we dealt with at drexel were very creative very 
bright extremely diligent said robert herndon chief financial 
officer of pier 1 imports inc which hired drexel for debt 
offerings in 1987 and 1988 
i think the country has lost something he said drexel 
had a great idea in assisting low investmentgrade companies to 
have access to money that was otherwise not available 
but the texas international report details a different drexel 
similar to the one depicted by federal prosecutors a firm that 
abused securities laws armtwisted clients and manipulated a 
network of junkbond buyers 
the governments investigation showed there wasnt anybody 
they wouldnt cheat if the occasion called for it said bruce 
baird who ran the us attorneys office securities fraud division 
during the drexel case and now is in private practice 
it was sort of the excesses of the 80s personified he said

most energy futures weakened again friday 
finishing the week on a negative note amid concerns about abundant 
supplies 
gasoline futures posted the sharpest declines on the new york 
mercantile exchange as they did on thursday but wholesale home 
heating oil bucked the trend and regained some ground 
the contract for may delivery of unleaded gasoline settled 118 
cents lower at 6211 cents a gallon after thursdays drop of 157 
cents the june contract also shed more than a penny a gallon while 
more distant months ended with lesser losses 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil settled at 1915 per 42gallon barrel 
down 28 cents later contracts finished with similar losses 
among other refined petroleum products traded on the new york 
merc may home heating oil added 040 cent to 5371 cents a gallon 
erasing a portion of thursdays loss of 071 cent later contracts 
also settled higher 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery closed at 1625 per 
million british thermal units up from 1615 on thursday 
contracts for delivery further in the future were mixed natural 
gas futures made their merc debut earlier this week 
analysts said a bearish attitude developed in the energy market 
late tuesday after the american petroleum institute issued a weekly 
report showing large crude stocks 
madison galbraith an oil specialist at merrill lynch energy 
futures said the selling sparked by the api figures pushed prices 
below thresholds considered technically significant 
the tuesday night announcement by the api set a bearish tone 
that led to a technical breakdown he said 
the drop below 20 a barrel for the nearby crude contract 
earlier in the week helped cause the markets overall slump

lotus development corp and novell inc agreed to 
merge their computer software companies friday a move that could 
give lotus a leading edge in the software industry 
the companies signed a letter of intent under which novell would 
become a subsidiary of lotus after the stockswap merger no cash 
would change hands 
the primary reason for the merger is we were two companies 
both leading in our prospective markets and we figured we could do 
better things for our customers if we got together said jim 
manzi chairman chief executive officer and president of lotus 
were sort of perfectly complementary 
the agreement is subject to the approval of the boards of 
directors and stockholders of both companies in addition to 
standard regulatory approvals the companies said the merger is 
expected to be completed by july 
under the agreement lotus would swap 191931 shares of lotus 
common stock for each share of novell common stock lotus would 
issue about 416 million new shares to carry out the transaction 
novell was worth a total of about 13 billion at end of trading 
friday while lotus was worth 15 billion making the merger worth 
28 billion said david bayer an analyst at montgomery securities 
in san francisco 
investors did not cheer the announcement lotus shares closed 
friday at 3425 down 2 a share in national overthecounter 
trading novell closed at 3875 down 412 on the same market 
both lotus and novell said the merger would provide benefits to 
both companies and their customers 
the synergy from a customer standpoint a sales and 
distribution standpoint and in terms of future product offerings in 
tremendous said novell chairman president and chief executive 
ray noorda in a statement 
manzi said in a telephone interview that the merger would give 
lotus better positioning in the software market 
i think well be a stronger competitor their leadership in 
network and our leadership in organization is a real strong 
combination he said 
lotus had 556 million in revenue for fiscal year 1989 while 
novell posted 422 million in revenue 
cambridgebased lotus is a leading producer of business 
software based primarily on its popular 123 spreadsheet program 
it recently expanded 123 from its original version for 
international business machine corps personal computers to 
versions for computers made by other manufacturers 
lotus was ranked no 3 in revenue of software companies last 
year behind no 2 microsoft corp and computer associates 
international inc according to software magazine 
novell based in provo utah makes software used to link 
computers in networks for businessrelated tasks 
noorda would keep his positions with novell and also become the 
vice chairman of lotus under the plan 
we view this as a marriage or merger of equals manzi said 
nancy mcsharry an analyst who follows lotus for international 
data corp said the merger would shake up the industry power 
structure 
before on the top was microsoft then there were others now 
with the merger it really puts lotus and microsoft on the first 
tier in the industry she said and the first tier is now a far 
more balanced tier 
if the new association works lotus could assume the no 1 spot 
in the industry mcsharry said 
novell stands to gain from access to lotus established 
worldwide market 
we get about 45 percent of our business offshore and last 
year novell had 38 or 40 percent offshore were a little bit 
stronger offshore particularly in japan and theyre just getting 
started there manzi said 
manzi said customers also will benefit from the merger 
novell is most successful in their field and we are leaders 
in ours so if you can bring them together in the fold of things 
its better for the customers manzi said 
mcsharry agreed with manzi 
in the shortterm it wont change the service provided to the 
customers but in the longterm it significantly changes the 
offerings mcsharry said youll see more industrywide 
software therell be more emphasis on group networked software

a gerber products co research plant is 
retooling to resume production for a market of one a profoundly 
allergic 15yearold boy who cannot live without a special baby 
formula the company stopped making five years ago 
for a few days this month one quarter of the production space 
at the gerber research center in fremont mich will be devoted to 
making mbf a formula only raymond dunn jr wants or needs and 
which gerber is providing free of charge 
people here are working on this on their own time george 
purvis gerber research director said thursday we all have our 
own jobs and this is one we added on 
i dont want to talk too much about it he added its 
just something we can do so were doing it its a volunteer 
project the dunns have nowhere else to turn 
raymond who lives with his parents in the catskills town of 
yankee lake weighs only 31 pounds he was born with an abnormally 
small head and brain he is severely physically and mentally 
retarded and cannot speak or see he cannot move his thin arms or 
tiny legs without help his warped little spine has worn a dent in 
the pad of his wheelchair 
and since the age of 5 raymond has been allergic to almost 
every form of nourishment all that kept him alive was gerbers 
mbf an expensive meatbased formula for allergic infants 
but in 1985 faced with declining sales gerber stopped making 
the brown liquid formula the dunns tried dozens of alternatives 
but they all made raymond sick 
gerber agreed to reveal its formula and process for making mbf 
to any manufacturer who would supply raymond but none was willing 
or able 
so purvis said we scrounged around for every can of the 
stuff that was in existence including many whose expiration date 
had passed after obtaining a food and drug administration waiver 
gerber began delivering them to the dunns 
the unsold backlog prolonged raymonds life but didnt make it 
easier asthma kept him inside the house almost all the time his 
mother and her helpers had to brush his teeth bathe and dress him 
to maintain his sense of touch they ran his fingers through dry 
rice and beans he slept in a small bed in his parents room but 
rarely for more than a few hours at a time 
the little guys been a 24houraday thing for the past 16 
years said his father raymond sr a car salesman the dunns 
have no other children 
it seemed life couldnt get any more difficult until the day in 
july 1988 when dunns wife carol got a letter from gerber the 
company said its mbf was all gone leaving raymond with less than a 
two years supply 
his mother whose life already was totally consumed by his care 
sought help in dozens of letters to political and business leaders 
including president bush donald trump and the princess of wales 
but gerber seemed her only hope 
i believed they wouldnt let me down because theres human 
beings in that corporation she said i felt that somehow 
that gerber would not let raymond die 
apparently she was right gerber employees who had been working 
with mrs dunn told their bosses they could assemble the equipment 
and special ingredients including beef hearts to make a limited 
amount of mbf 
soon the project will fill about 6000 of the plants 25000 
square feet of production space other projects will be delayed 
and the production run will cost gerber about 15000 
due to a lack of storage space gerber plans to produce only a 
two years supply after that said purvis if push comes to 
shove well do it again 
mrs dunn meanwhile says she understands why gerber responded 
to her appeal im just a mother trying to feed her son

the bethlehem steel corp has been fined 
1 million for the continuing discharge of benzene from its coke 
oven operation near buffalo state officials said thursday 
state environmental conservation commissioner thomas jorling 
said the penalty is the largest new york has ever levied for a 
violation of state airpollution laws 
the magnitude of the penalty is justified by the nature and 
duration of the violations jorling said 
state officials said the bethlehem process in lackawanna 
represents the largest single industrial source of emissions of 
cancerlinked benzene in new york state with thursdays fine the 
company has been assessed 133 million in civil penalties since a 
state crackdown on emissions there began in 1984 
we believe that the company acted improperly in allowing such 
emissions to continue in spite of state laws designed to protect 
the air new yorkers breathe said jorling 
the company discharged 15 million pounds of benzene a year 
since the early 1970s state officials said but it was only when a 
team of buffalobased department of environmental conservation 
investigators suspected the discharge and ran tests in 1987 that 
the state first uncovered the problem 
jorling said bethlehem steel knew that its processes emitted 
significant amounts of benzene releases that were subjct to

bond prices finished unchanged to slightly 
higher friday after a volatile session racked by 
worsethanexpected employment figures for march and concern over 
german currencyswap plans 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond closed unchanged from late 
thursday at 9925 while its yield remained at 851 percent 
bond prices shot up after the government reported that the 
growth in nonfarm jobs last month was 26000 far lower than 
estimates of about 175000 the figures implied that the economy 
really isnt doing as well as we thought said mike geraty a 
bond trader with clayton brown amp associates in chicago 
signs of economic weakness usually boost bond prices since they 
imply the federal reserve may act to ease interest rates lower 
rates boost the value of existing bonds 
but bond prices dropped as several news reports reached the 
market said wayne lyski portfolio manager for alliance capital 
management 
one report said two unidentified federal reserve governors 
believed economic growth was exceeding target figures implying 
they did not believe there was a need to move interest rates lower 
lyski said 
then news reached the market that the west german central bank 
expressed concern that a proposed 1for1 exchange rate between the 
west german and east german marks would be inflationary and require 
higher interest rates 
higher interest rates in germany would make investments there 
more attractive making it likely that us interest rates would 
have to follow suit 
the bond market also was jittery over concern about the weekend 
meeting of leaders from the seven leading industrialized nations 
traders said lyski said concern centered around whether the 
officials would move to increase the value of the japanese yen 
against the dollar 
a strengthened yen would make yendenominated investments more 
attractive putting upward pressure on us interest rates 
but after the morning turmoil the market eased to a near 
standstill traders said and prices returned to levels near 
thursdays close 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose from 132 to 116 point intermediate 
maturities rose 116 point and longterm issues ranged from 
unchanged to up 132 point according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 021 to 115354 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 91 1532 the average yield 
to maturity remained at 751 percent 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 801 percent as the 
discount rose 2 basis points to 776 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills were unchanged at 816 percent as the discount remained at 
774 percent yields on oneyear bills which were issued 
yesterday fell to 825 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points 
from the auction discount to 767 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 down from 8 
percent late thursday

small investors and the media could face higher 
costs for their daily diet of stock prices under a proposal by the 
nations stock exchanges that could lead to new fees for market 
data 
a group of news organizations discount stock brokerages and 
database services is challenging the request for a contractual 
change that could open the door to charges on 15minuteold stock 
quotes 
delayed last sale information as it is called is now free to 
vendors except for transmission costs 
the debate on wall street and in washington centers on the 
ownership of data vital to the functioning of the nations 
financial markets it also raises a first amendment question are 
stock prices news or just another commodity for sale 
under the present system charges are applied only to 
realtime quotes which are uptothesecond prices individual 
investors pay about 13 a month for realtime quotations from the 
new york stock exchange institutions can pay up to 120 a month 
the stock exchanges say they own the data real or delayed and 
need to recover the costs of compiling and distributing it 
opponents of the proposal by the nyse and seven other exchanges 
pending before the securities and exchange commission said friday 
that delayedprice fees would drive investors who cant afford to 
pay for realtime data from the markets they said the 
15minuteold numbers are public property 
its like charging for the wrapper on the candy after its 
been eaten said hugo quackenbush spokesman for discount broker 
charles schwab amp co 
the exchanges are in the business of making the financial 
markets accessible to everybody said john foley director of 
online stock trading for discount broker quick amp reilly 
information dissemination is part of that 
as opponents read it the proposed contractual change would 
eliminate the distinction between realtime and delayed data 
allowing the stock exchanges to charge for all numbers 
but thomas haley the nyses vice president for market data 
said the exchanges already have the right to charge for delayed 
data and to alter the definition of delayed data he called the 
dispute a tempest in a teapot 
haley chairman of the consolidated tape association which made 
the proposal said charging some users for stockprice quotations 
and giving it away free to others is unfair and should be 
reconsidered 
the exchange and the cta receives nothing zero from those 
organizations for the use of that data he said that operation 
is being subsidized by all the others who are paying 
how long before you have the folks that are paying say im 
paying too much he said youre letting the other group off 
the hook there has to be balance here 
haley indicated the nyse and other exchanges would consider 
various billing schemes that could lead to charging for delayed 
data or encouraging all users to buy realtime data 
delayed stock prices reach the public in various ways 
individuals with personal computers pay database services for 
access to quotes newspaper stock tables and some television 
services such as financial news network run delayed prices 
discount brokers use 15minuteold quotes to cut down costs of 
servicing individual investors brokers said they would be forced 
to pass on a charge for delayed quotes to customers 
with the development of lightningquick transmission capability 
and competing computer databases in the last decade more and more 
businesses are using the stock exchanges free data to make a buck 
if the nyse continues to give away price dissemination 
they will at some point enable an electronic competitor to eat 
their lunch said eric k clemons a professor at the university 
of pennsylvanias wharton school theres a very substantial cost 
in providing that service 
haley said the nyse has 134 contracts to provide delayed data to 
vendors who in turn make it available to an estimated 15 million 
personal users he said about 200000 display units have access to 
realtime data 
the associated press is one of a dozen groups that have objected 
to the exchanges proposal in additiion to schwab and quick amp 
reilly others include financial news network dow jones amp co 
fidelity investments and instinet corp 
for the ap and other media the debate raises the first 
amendment question of whether stock quotations are news or products 
its always been our position that all stock information is 
news that under the first amendment we have a right to report ap 
business news editor james m kennedy said 
we feel its in the public domain said roger may a 
spokesman for dow jones which publishes the wall street journal 
its in the national interest to put this out to increase the 
availability of stockmarket information

general electric co has filed a 115 
billion lawsuit against daimlerbenz of west germany claiming that 
daimlers new alliance with united technologies corp breached an 
agreement it already had with ge to develop jet engines 
the suit was filed tuesday in us district court in new york 
just one week after daimlerbenz announced it had signed a 
preliminary agreement with utc to allow their jet engine divisions 
to operate as a single company on certain ventures 
ge claims that daimlerbenz because of its strengthened ties 
to utcs pratt amp whitney division could give away ges jet engine 
trade secrets to utc 
pratt amp whitney and ge are fierce competitors in the jet engine 
business 
a utc spokesman on friday dismissed assertions that ge trade 
secrets were jeopardized by the collaboration between daimlers jet 
engine division motorenund turbinenunion and pratt amp whitney 
neither utc nor pratt amp whitney needs wants or would accept 
confidential ge information said utc spokesman dan harrison 
we have complete confidence in the integrity of daimlerbenz mtu 
and its people 
daimlerbenz an aerospace electronics and auto giant said it 
was studying the suit but at this time saw no grounds for the 
action 
the lawsuit alleges that ge claims that daimlerbenz and its jet 
engine division already had a series of binding agreements to work 
exclusively with ge in developing a new generation of highthrust 
commercial jet engines 
the suit seeks damages of 115 billion and court injunctions to 
bar daimlerbenz from using trade secrets or working with any 
company including utc and pratt amp whitney to develop jet 
engines that compete directly with engines covered under 
gedaimlerbenz agreements 
ge refused to comment on specifics in the lawsuit or on its 
longstanding business relationship with the daimlerbenz jet engine 
division 
were letting the lawsuit filing stand on its own and speak 
for itself ge spokesman george jamison said friday 
harrison defended the new agreement reached between 
hartfordbased utc and daimlerbenz calling it a logical 
outgrowth of a 20year association between the two companies 
mtu is now participating in three jet engine programs with pratt 
amp whitney and plans additional partnerships under the new 
alliance although the strengthened relationship is not a merger 
the agreement means the two companies will act as one in designing 
engineering and marketing new engines 
in its suit ge says it has had contracts with mtu for more than 
25 years covering the sharing of confidential technological 
information revenues and costs for the development and sale of 
commercial jet engines 
the company estimates that the market for the classes of 
commercial jet engines named in the suit is between 50 billion and 
100 billion

usx corp said it wont pay carl icahn a

we do not pay greenmail and we wont ever pay greenmail usx 
chairman charles a corry said thursday we do occasionally buy 
stock back through third parties although we dont always know who 
we are buying it from 
usx would be willing to buy some or all of icahns 34 million 
shares at market value or below spokesman william keslar said 
usx shares closed at 3637 thursday on the new york stock 
exchange down 12 cents 
corry said icahn purchased about 30 million of his shares for 
somewhere between 22 and 23 starting in 1986 he bought about 
4 million more shares last fall at about 36 a share corry 
said 
telephone calls to icahns mount kisco ny office were not 
answered late thursday 
in a letter to usx stockholders earlier this week icahn said 
his plan to break up usx would be worth 48 a share to stockholders 
his plan calls for spinning off the companys us steel 
division giving current usx holders 80 percent of the shares and 
selling the remaining 20 percent to new investors usx would retain 
its energy assets primarily marathon oil co 
icahn estimated the value of marathon at 39 a share and the 
value of the steel operations at 9 a share 
keslar said icahns estimate doesnt account for current cash 
flow or earnings potential 
its an arbitrary figure made up of two arbitrary figures 
keslar said 
corry said about 65 percent of usxs revenue comes from energy 
and 31 percent comes from steel 
usx has opposed icahns proposal saying it would cause tax 
difficulties and make the separate divisions more vulnerable to 
slumps in either the energy or steel markets 
usx shareholders will vote on icahns propsal in a nonbinding 
ballot may 7 at marathons headquarters in findlay ohio

a federal jury on friday awarded about 100 million 
to windmere corp in an antitrust suit charging that the dutch 
company nv philips had monopolized the rotary shaver market 
the verdict came in a counterclaim by windmere against philips 
and its subsidiary north american philips co makers of the 
norelco shaver philips had initially filed suit in the case 
against windmere charging unfair competition 
the jury cleared windmere on that charge accepting the miami 
lakes companys contention that philips had attempted to monopolize 
the market through predatory pricing in violation of the sherman 
act 
were very pleased with the jurys verdict said david 
friedson president and chief executive officer of windmere 
were going to have a good party 
the jury awarded windmere 298 million which is trebled 
automatically under the sherman act to 896 million the jury also 
awarded reasonable attorneys fees interests and costs bringing 
the estimated total to more than 100 million according to 
windmere attorneys 
the rotary shaver war was started by philips in 1984 as part 
of an attempt to drive windmere out of the rotary business said 
gary hoffman an attorney for windmere 
the 87 million verdict gives windmere the funds that it needs 
to reenter the markets and provide effective competition against 
the philips companies 
hoffman said philips controls about 95 percent of the 165 
million rotary shaver market 
windmere attorney gary jones said the appeals process would 
likely hold up payment of the award until mid1991 but he said the 
company is confident the jurys verdict would be upheld 
the case was first filed in washington dc in 1984 and a 
jury found in favor of windmere on the monopolization issue while a 
judge directed a guilty verdict against windmere in the unfair 
competition provision 
the verdicts were overturned on appeal however and retried in 
miami the decision friday capped a fourweek trial before us 
district judge stanley marcus 
hoffman who also represents sears roebuck amp co in a similar 
suit filed by philips said he will ask for a summary judgment 
against philips in that case based on fridays verdict 
windmere employs about 300 people in miami lakes and has 50 to 
100 other employees around the country said friedson the 
companys manufacturing plants are in china and hong kong

general development corp filed for federal 
bankruptcy protection friday less than a week after revealing a 
severe cash shortage and agreeing to a 100 million repayment 
program for victims of a scheme to sell overpriced homes 
but it was not immediately known how the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing in miami will affect the restitution plan the plan is part 
of a plea agreement to settle a 16count federal indictment 
alleging that nearly 10000 home buyers were deceived into 
purchasing homes at inflated prices 
the 35yearold company will retain present management but the 
bankruptcy court will have control over efforts to borrow money or 
sell assets 
earlier this week miamibased general development said it was 
considering a bankruptcy filing after negotiations for 60 million 
in shortterm credit fell apart 
the companys financial problems have caused delays in paying up 
to 10 million in property taxes and have cut back improvements and 
development at its communities 
on tuesday general development closed 24 sales offices in the 
united states and broker bureaus overseas and laid off about 1100 
workers 
while we deeply regret having to take the step of filing 
for bankruptcy relief our board determined that this action was 
necessary in light of the companys inability to secure additional 
financing to meet its shortterm cash needs said general 
development president charles simons 
the bankruptcy filing does not affect general developments 
vistana resort and glen ivy subsidiaries which operate timeshare 
resorts near disney world and the west 
a statement from general development said the company may 
present a financial restructuring plan within several months 
general development stock closed 37 cents a share lower at 
250 friday in new york stock exchange trading 
a master was appointed by the court tuesday to review the 
restitution program before final approval the victims of the 
overpricing scheme most from the midwest and northeast were 
charged an average of 40 percent above market value for homes at 
general developments nine florida communities said prosecutors 
thomas wood a mortgage banker and attorney assigned to review 
the plan said he has asked general development to provide 
financial data by april 16 
the bankruptcy court has its jurisdiction and the us 
district court has its own jurisdiction said wood right now 
we are proceeding ahead with looking at the plan 
earlier this month the company pleaded guilty to one fraud 
count that could bring a maximum 500000 fine 
also general developments former president robert ehrling and 
former chairman david brown pleaded guilty to one fraud count each
