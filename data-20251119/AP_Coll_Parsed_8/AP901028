marvin leath came to congress from the heart 
of texas with a country musicians soul and a bankers sense 
but after a dozen years in the house leath is calling it quits 
frustrated by the ability of an individual congressman to make a 
difference 
you see so much written in the media and so forth about 
people incumbents who get these jobs and they never leave and 
theyre an institution said the waco democrat 
people say nobody walks away from that job well somebody 
did he said and maybe that gives a little bit of faith to 
people who think the system is so totally corrupt and bad it 
really isnt 
in the early 1980s leath was a part of the group of 
conservative democrats called the boll weevils that supported a 
stronger defense and tax reform 
but he said defense spending ran amuck under president reagan 
and the deficits growth from 40 billion to more than 300 billion 
deeply distresses him 
most of the things i hoped to do the big issues we did 
something about but we did in excess leath said 
i really thought the 80s was going to be the decade that was 
the most critical in the countrys history he said perhaps it 
was but i think if you look back on that i have to think that as 
a government we blew it 
reagan didnt exert the leadership to make hard choices leath 
said noting the government wasnt designed for congress to make 
laws alone the hundreds of interests reflected by congress also 
frustrate its power he said 
you cant expect congress to develop national policy 
leath said youve got to have a strong president willing to 
take the political risks to solve the problems bush is much more 
prone to do that than reagan 
leath who made his fortune as a banker in marlin and waco is 
known as a pretty fair country music crooner and host of a popular 
annual barbecue 
you dont see a whole lot of those kinds of parties around 
here said rep charles stenholm dtexas who was elected in 
1978 from a neighboring district and was also a boll weevil 
this guy has star potential congressional scholar norm 
ornstein said of leaths singing 
leaths friend willie nelson has encouraged him to cut an album 
but leath said im a little bit old to go on the country music 
circuit at 59 leath is only two years older than nelson 
in congress leath closely followed the problems of the budget 
and financial industry from a seat on the house budget committee 
he voted against thrift deregulation in 1980 and argued that 
crisis in thrifts banks and insurance companies was caused by 
lawmakers foolish mistakes 
those of us who understood what the banking system was 
understood why we had some of the rules we had for 50 years we 
felt very reasonably assured when you destroyed those things that 
were necessary foundations this would happen leath said but 
you couldnt get anybody to listen to you 
leath will take about 484000 in leftover campaign funds with 
him when he leaves hell keep some for himself to repay expenses 
from that first campaign he said the rest will go to charity and 
political candidates i think that gives me a good way to stay 
involved in the system leath said 
he worried some about leaving constituents in the lurch 
particularly while fighting the armys decision to deactivate one 
of two armored divisions at fort hood in his district 
you can always say ive just got to do another term first 
thing you know youre a doddering old man leath said

star trek the next generation this week 
boldly goes where the original series never went 
its 80th episode airs this week the original star trek ran 
79 episodes before it was canceled in 1969 after three seasons 
the new version which premiered in 1987 ranks among the 
toprated syndicated series nationwide like the original it was 
created by gene roddenberry 
cast members paid little attention when the momentous 80th 
episode was filmed in september but they are aware of the original 
shows cult status and the burden they carry 
the star trek saga seems to have affected peoples lives 
over decades said british actor patrick stewart who plays capt 
jeanluc picard on the new series 
stewart whose children watched the old show thinks the new one 
has accomplished something akin to what the original did 
it has its own mythology it has already a whole series of 
legends attached to it he said 
its a landmark show in that so very few have achieved in a 
recreation or a reincarnation the kind of success and 
independent success that this show has achieved 
the original series starring william shatner as capt james 
kirk and leonard nimoy as the halfvulcan mr spock has survived 
two decades in reruns and most of its cast has reunited for five 
movies it endures in the hearts of thousands of trekkies many 
of whom also have warmed to the new show 
at 1 million or more per episode the paramount television 
production is light years ahead of the old show in cost and special 
effects the updated enterprise has recessed lighting comfy 
quarters and even a bar 
but the basic formula remains intrepid spacefarers dealing with 
moral and political issues that mimic those of our own time 
the 80th episode for example deals with two cultures locked in 
a war like the one in beirut it airs on various days this week 
depending on the market 
stewarts 25 years in shakespearean theater are put to good use 
when he walks the bridge of the 24thcentury starship he said 
our show is of an epic nature its telling grand stories its 
classical in its structure he said 
rumors persist that the cast of the syndicated series will make 
a movie or that the casts of the old and new series will do an 
episode together 
stewart said he knows none of that but likes the idea of 
blending the crews not to would be a little cowardly he said

a county commissioner was more than a little embarrassed when 
williston nd showed up on a list of 10 western cities 
threatened with extinction but officials in some of the other 
cities reluctantly agreed the description fits 
marlene eide helped get williston a town of 13000 on the list 
of cities with economic problems related to federal policies when 
the national association of counties recently issued the list it 
said the cities are in danger of becoming extinct because of 
restrictions on the use of public lands 
i saw that and i about died said eide a williams county 
commissioner im going to have to leave town everybody will be 
so mad at me but i didnt even do anything 
willistons tourism industry has been hurt during recent 
droughts by falling water levels on lake sakakawea part of the 
missouri river reservoir system managed by the army corps of 
engineers but extinction never crossed eides mind 
others acknowledged their towns belonged on the list 
we are in trouble said audrie clifford mayor of reserve 
nm the traditional means of livelihood in catron county are 
cattle and timber and both are severely threatened 
the county association said limitations on public land uses in 
recent years have hurt the communities economies and severely 
strained their ability to provide needed services 
these communities and there may be hundreds of others like 
them are suffering said michael stewart president of the 
washingtonbased group and a commissioner in salt lake county 
utah 
also on the list are weed and cima calif jarbridge nev 
escalante utah walden colo horseshoe bend idaho columbia 
falls mont and mill city ore 
larry naake executive director of the county supervisors 
association of california said the list is meant to get the 
attention of the bush administration and congress 
there needs to be more balance between state and federal 
policies between environmental and human concerns he said 
like many of the cities weed a town of 3000 on the slopes of 
mount shasta volcano in northern california depends on the timber 
industry 
no one wants to come to the city if they have no guarantee 
they will make a living there we are just trying to make it hold 
on to our city in a beautiful area said mayor kalvin vanderhoof 
mill city was established in 1947 when the timber industry 
began expanding rapidly in oregon to build houses for the postwar 
baby boom about 50 miles southeast of portland mill city has 
1500 residents 
people here are frightened said mayor mary smith who is a 
secretary for frank lumber co there are more and more reports of 
mills cutting back laying people off if it continues theyre 
going to panic 
were a timber town she said theres nothing else here 
for us 
two environmental groups took issue with the inclusion of 
horseshoe bend on the list the wilderness society and idaho 
conservation league officials deny that environmental restrictions 
on timber cutting in idaho have hurt the logging town 30 miles 
north of boise 
in 1989 the timber harvested in idaho was at the highest level 
in the past 10 years said mike medberry of the idaho 
conservation league if horseshoe bend is an endangered town 
its not due to lack of timber 
in reserve with fewer than 400 residents the mayor said the 
city wont dry up and blow away 
i feel the people of reserve will find a way to exist 
somehow clifford said were tough and stubborn people 
survivors

mexico is building seven border bridges 
and thousands of miles of highway to handle the boom in traffic 
from an expected freetrade agreement with the united states 
with help from private investors president carlos salinas de 
gortari set a plan in motion last year to improve mexicos 
inadequate roads and customs system 
solidarity bridge and border crossing at colombia now a 
cinderblock town of only 350 people is the largest project 
a 66mile highway linking colombia to an improved road between 
laredo texas and monterrey will cut the driving distance between 
the border and monterrey to 140 miles from 180 
more than 2480 miles of highways are to be built before the 
presidents sixyear term ends in 1994 half will be financed 
through private investment 
the other bridges under construction or planned will be in 
matamoros nuevo laredo and valle hermosa all in tamaulipas state 
piedras negras and ciudad acuna in coahuila and ciudad juarez in 
chihuahua state 
mexican officials say the improvements are needed to strengthen 
trade links with the united states and compete with the economic 
blocs of europe and asia 
trucks crossing into mexico often must wait for hours then 
negotiate undivided twolane highways riddled with potholes 
we dont need to be a rich country to have good roads but we 
need good roads to become a rich country said carlos joaquin 
vallejo rivero he directs the state highway office in nuevo leon 
the northeastern border state where the colombia project is being 
built 
it costs more and takes more time to transport things via bad 
roads because of higher insurance and loss of goods he said 
trade with the united states took off in 1986 when mexico joined 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade lowering import duties 
on hundreds of foreign products and making exports of mexican 
manufactured goods a priority 
from less than 30 billion in 1986 twoway trade rose to 52 
billion in 1989 mexico is the thirdlargest us trading partner 
after canada and japan 
a usmexican trade agreement that would remove tariffs and 
other barriers is under discussion it may be linked with the 
similar uscanadian pact of 1988 to create a single north 
american trade zone of 335 million people 
salinas and president bush are to discuss the proposal at a 
meeting nov 2627 in monterrey 
all indications are that we are going to have even more 
intensive trade with the united states and we are just not 
prepared said antonio fuentes flores director of the trust for 
the development of nuevo leon 
fuentes whose organization is overseeing construction said the 
820acre solidarity site will include an eightlane bridge storage 
terminals refrigerated warehouses and hotel 
it will more than triple the size of colombia a town 10 blocks 
square populated mostly by farmers 
many people didnt think a new bridge was justified because we 
already had a crossing at laredo fuentes said laredo is the 
united states biggest inland port of entry with 1600 trucks 
crossing daily 
but we looked at projections of how much traffic would 
increase in the next few years he said and concluded that we 
didnt need to just build a bridge but we needed to build a new 
concept of border crossings 
nuevo leon was an ideal site fuentes said because more than 
half the merchandise moving south through laredo goes to monterrey 
the state capital and mexicos leading industrial city 
monterrey businessmen wanted a border crossing in nuevo leon so 
they would not have to send products through nuevo laredo in 
tamaulipas state they claim customs officials and corrupt unions 
in nuevo laredo inflate the cost 
the mexican side of the bridge and its support facilities is to 
cost 49 million split between the federal government and private 
investors 
laredo texas is financing the us side at 62 million with 
help from the state government and washington the site is dolores 
a town 18 miles from laredo 
four new highways in nuevo leon totaling 350 miles are being 
built with 584 million in private funds 
vallejo of the state highway office said the concessionaire 
viaductos de peaje would charge tolls for 8 to 14 years before 
turning the roads over to the state 
he said the highways would be divided with at least two lanes 
in each direction speed limits of 75 mph lights in urban areas 
rest stops and the concession companys own roadside mechanics and 
patrolmen

at 1252 pm on friday sept 14 doctors at 
the national institutes of health began transfusing white blood 
cells into the tiny arm of a 4yearold girl with a rare inherited 
ailment 
for 28 minutes she played with her doctors and put stickers on 
their lab coats as she helped them launch a new era in medical 
treatment 
she became the first person to receive gene therapy a treatment 
intended to compensate for the genetic defect she was born with by 
giving her normal copies of the defective genes 
news of the experiment had special interest for suzanne 
tomlinson a 27yearold woman from alexandria va 
the idea of gene therapy was always sort of far off and maybe 
a little idealistic she said it has been in the back of my 
mind that theoretically gene therapy would be the key that would 
really cure the disease 
the disease is cystic fibrosis she was diagnosed with it when 
she was 7 months old 
the 4yearold gene therapy pioneer whose name has been 
withheld has a rare immune system disorder but gene therapy holds 
promise for people with many inherited diseases including cystic 
fibrosis 
indeed recent discoveries about cystic fibrosis have made it 
one of the leading candidates for gene therapy perhaps within the 
next five years said robert beall executive vice president for 
medical affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation in bethesda md 
what we thought to be decades away is now years away said 
beall 
other potential candidates for gene therapy within the next few 
years are certain forms of anemia hemophilia and muscular 
dystrophy 
it will be at least several months before researchers know 
whether gene therapy is succeeding in the 4yearold girl many 
researchers poised to expand the applications of gene therapy say 
the experiment represents the historic opening of a new era in 
medicine 
when the experiment was approved in july gerard mcgarrity 
chairman of the national institutes of health approval panel said 
what were doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines 
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal medicine has been 
waiting thousands of years for this 
tomlinson too has been waiting her parents have long been 
active with the cystic fibrosis foundation and she works there as 
consumer affairs coordinator 
she was married earlier this year and attends law school at 
night but she still makes time to follow cystic fibrosis research 
including the severalyearlong debate over the ethics and risks of 
gene therapy 
the decision to proceed shows that society is willing to 
accept this she said criticism of the experiment was important 
because it makes people think about the seriousness of this 
work tomlinson said 
scientists worry that putting new genes into the body could 
trigger cancer or other problems and some worry about the ethics 
of altering human genetic makeup 
but i dont want to see them the critics stop it 
tomlinson said i dont want their fear of the unknown to hold us 
back 
last summer researchers found the gene that is defective in 
people with cystic fibrosis and this year they showed that the 
defect could be corrected in the test tube 
the next experiment will be to try to insert the normal cystic 
fibrosis gene into mice and then try again in larger animals such 
as sheep beall said 
then human experimentation could begin because the most 
important symptom of cystic fibrosis is the accumulation of mucus 
in the lungs an aerosol spray that delivered genetically 
engineered cells to the lungs might be all that is required for 
most patients 
tomlinson has a mild case of cystic fibrosis she follows a 
physical therapy regimen every morning to dislodge mucus in her 
lungs and she takes enzyme pills with every meal to help digest 
her food 
several times a year she is treated for lung infections usually 
managing to avoid the hospitalizations that many people with cystic 
fibrosis undergo 
ive really been able to lead a full life she said 
as researchers scramble to finish the preliminary experiments to 
pave the way for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis tomlinson is 
uncertain what that means to her 
despite her enthusiasm she isnt sure shell volunteer to be 
one of the first to try the new treatment 
i want to be sure it works she said i used to do more 
research but now because theres so much going on in my life and 
im healthy i guess im more skeptical

congress late saturday gave final passage to a 
strippeddown anticrime bill avoiding certain fights over such 
contentious issues as the death penalty and a ban on assault 
weapons 
the house approved the measure 3131 and sent it to the white 
house where it awaited an uncertain fate 
the action came after a joint housesenate conference committee 
on friday cut major provisions from the legislation that president 
bush had sought the cutting was aimed at making the measure more 
acceptable 
among the bills provisions however was one that would toughen 
penalties for certain white collar crimes including a possible life 
prison term in some cases involving fraud by savings and loan 
kingpins 
it also calls for increased penalties for offenses committed 
against children including for the first time making possession of 
child pornography a federal offense 
attorney general dick thornburgh assailed lawmakers for dropping 
a provision that would have permitted use of the death penalty for 
new categories of federal crimes 
he said the decision of the conferees to drop the death penalty 
is an enormous step backwards in the fight against violent 
crime and welcome news only to violent criminals 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
said he was pleased that a crime bill was passed but said i am 
disappointed that we were unable to agree on a truly comprehensive 
bill that contains a massive expansion of the death penalty 
the bill also 
enacts new procedures to make it easier for child abuse victims 
to testify in federal courts 
authorizes a doubling of federal aid to local law enforcement 
up to 900 million 
authorizes a 20 million rural drug initiative to finance 
increased efforts by local police and prosecutors in rural areas to 
combat drugs

congress adjourned for the year early sunday 
without providing any additional funding for the agency charged 
with bailing out failed savings and loan associations 
the senate early sunday adopted a measure that would have 
provided 10 billion to the resolution trust corp but the house 
did not act on it the bush administration had sought as much as 
57 billion 
senate banking committee chairman donald riegle said that while 
the rtc should be kept on a very tight leash he believed the 
congress should not leave without providing money to carry the 
agency through the next 90 days 
sen jake garn of utah ranking republican on the banking 
committee called the sum inadequate and said it was the absolute 
minimum necessary to keep the bailout agency in business both 
riegle and garn said that dealing with the savings and loan 
collapse would have to occupy lawmakers attention as soon as they 
return in january 
sen bob graham dfla said it would cost taxpayers more money 
if the bailout agency had to close for lack of funds 
the senateapproved measure an amendment to the federal home 
loan bank board act also contains provisions requiring the rtc to 
submit detailed justification to the congress for future 
requests for funds 
it also expresses the sense of congress that the resolution 
trust corp should not use taxpayers money to pay off uninsured 
depositors in failed savings and loans 
several senators voiced misgivings about the move and sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio complained that treasury secretary 
nicholas brady has refused to appear before congressional panels 
recently to argue for the money 
metzenbaum said the thrift scandal happened because during the 
reagan administration they literally said to the savings and loan 
executives do what you want 
the american people are eventually going to be called upon 
to spend something like 500 or 600 billion to pay for the 
rescue he said what a shameful tragedy 
the measure passed the senate by voice vote sen robert kerrey 
dneb said at one point that the rescue operation was very 
unpopular with the american people adding that it might not have 
a majority if put to a roll call vote

the congress that adjourned sunday stumbled 
stalled and scandalized but then passed dramatic national policy 
changes for taxes the environment military spending foreign 
policy and child care 
a congress of significant accomplishment bragged senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
the history books making a cold hard assessment may agree 
but that wouldnt do justice to the raucous and ugly path this 
congress took to get there 
the latest twoyear lawmaking conclave was americas 101st at 
the end lawmakers were referring to it as the one hundred and 
worst 
so many of us wasted so much time house republican leader 
robert h michel rill said what a horribly poor example of 
congress at its best 
it started with senate rejection of president bushs nomination 
of john tower for secretary of defense because of his reputation 
as a boozer and womanizer 
the house then weighed in with its own ethics scandal which 
culminated in the resignations of speaker jim wright dtexas and 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
an attempt at a meaningful bipartisan budget deal in the first 
year collapsed into a nasty partisan fight over bushs proposed 
cut in the capital gains tax rate 
the new house speaker thomas s foley dwash received a 
black eye when his conservative democrats sided with the 
republicans and passed the plan outvoted mitchell was able to 
stop it in the senate only through a parliamentary blockade 
the first session passed a publicly supported federal minimum 
wage increase and bush and the democrats agreed to end aid to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua 
but those and other efforts were overshadowed by the pay raise 
early in the year wright tried and failed amid a storm of 
public outrage to protect former president ronald reagans proposed 
50 percent boost in congressional pay but it wouldnt die 
after taking over as speaker at midyear foley engineered a 
compromise a big salary boost in exchange for no more 
specialinterest money for making speeches 
the house approved it the senate didnt bite house salaries 
which were 89500 last year will soar to roughly 125000 next 
january with only costofliving increases the senators will make 
just over 100000 
congress returned this year to resume a slow legislative pace 
with only mixed results 
a new law designed to reduce chances of major oil spills was 
enacted the americans with disabilities act giving new rights to 
people with impairments became law 
democrats succeeded in defeating bushs proposed constitutional 
amendment to ban flag burning 
but the democratic congress couldnt override the presidents 
veto of legislation guaranteeing workers six weeks of paid leave 
for childbirth or family medical emergencies 
the 101st congress never overrode any of 16 bush vetoes 
and the ethics scandals continued one house member was 
disciplined and another quit following sexrelated charges 
in the senate a group of lawmakers became known as the keating 
five all under investigation for their ties to the head of a 
failed california savings and loan institution 
meanwhile all efforts to contain the costs of the sampl bailout 
were proving fruitless in may with the estimates of the federal 
deficit heading for the stratosphere bush decided it was time for 
a budget summit with congress 
spring turned to summer and then summer to fall without an 
agreement the legislative logjam grew as lawmakers awaited the 
summit results mitchell compared the budget to a whale in a 
bathtub crowding out everything else 
major legislation including a historic revision of the nations 
clean air laws federal aid for child care civil rights the farm 
bill housing and anticrime proposals languished 
as the leaves began to turn pollsters noticed that the public 
was beginning to turn surly at the apparent ineptness of their 
congress and their president public confidence in the governments 
institutions plummeted and some lawmakers reported nasty receptions 
from voters back home 
finally at the end of september the white house and 
congressional leaders signed a budget pact calling for a 500 
billion reduction in federal deficits over the next five years 
rankandfile lawmakers however rebelled at the 12cent gasoline 
tax hike deep cuts in medicare subsidies and dozens of other new 
fees or service reductions 
on oct 5 the day congress had been scheduled to adjourn the 
house killed the deal in a painful defeat for bush and the 
democratic leadership hoping to put the onus on congress for the 
failure bush let the government shut down for the weekend 
from the wreckage a new package emerged one less to bushs 
liking but still acceptable to him it had higher taxes on the 
wealthy only a nickel in new gas taxes and a lighter hit on 
medicare the senate gave it final congressional approval on 
saturday 
and the budget wasnt the only thing to fall into place at a 
time in the year when most previous congresses had already gone 
home the 101st congress began to click 
among the hundreds of bills passed in the final three weeks 
were 
a new grant program for child care and increases tax credits 
for lowincome families with children in the name of childcare 
assistance 
the first overhaul of the federal clean air law in 13 years 
requiring new pollution controls on automobiles factories and 
utilities 
the first major revision of the nations legal immigration 
system in 25 years providing more visas for families and those 
with special job skills 
all 13 of the annual spending bills for federal agencies none 
of which were completed by the oct 1 deadline the net effect 
defense spending goes down while domestic spending increases 
a phasedown of us support for proxy wars in cambodia 
angola and afghanistan and a 50 percent cut in military aid for el 
salvador all designed to steer away from armed conflict and 
toward diplomacy 
a fiveyear farm bill designed to contain costs and address 
environmental concerns 
efforts at passing campaign reform collapsed as did a vetoed 
civil rights bill a hopedfor major crime package crumbled into a 
washedout facsimile 
but at the end congressional democrats declared victory and 
took umbrage when asked about bushs campaign to paint congress as 
slow and inept 
we have persevered on a hard unpleasant difficult process up 
to the very week before election and were told its disorderly 
complained foley its courageous its heroic in some ways

dozens of letters are missing from the special 
file of correspondence from members of congress to savings and loan 
regulators according to the office of thrift supervision 
most of the letters were written by lawmakers on behalf of 
constituents who complained about problems in their dealings with 
sampls such as accounts that were transferred from one thrift to 
another as the result of mergers 
but some letters provide evidence of members of congress 
pressing regulators on behalf of sampl operators some of whom 
contributed to the lawmakers political campaigns 
there are thousands of letters all maintained by the ots and 
filed alphabetically under the names of the senators and 
representatives who sent them the thrift supervision office the 
federal agency created by last years sampl bailout legislation 
keeps the letters for its own use and opens them to members of the 
public by appointment 
there is no supervision of people perusing the letters which 
are kept in an area of ots washington headquarters that is out of 
view of agency employees 
nancy cohen ots director of congressional correspondence said 
she is aware of at least one entire file that is missing each file 
contains dozens of letters written by a member of congress arranged 
in chronological order 
ms cohen declined to say what file is missing or who may be 
suspected of taking it 
the agency has only one copy of each letter in the centralized 
archives although individual regulators may have kept their own 
copies ms cohen said 
i know somethings missing and it really bothers me she 
said i think its real important to the agency to make the 
files secure she added saying she has complained about the 
situation to highlevel ots officials 
there is a problem were trying to address the problem 
said robert schmermund director of public affairs for ots 
sampl contributions and the role of some lawmakers has become a 
hot issue in this election year the escalating savings and loan 
crisis has made the letter file a soughtafter source of 
information 
reporters have been the most frequent users of the files but in 
recent months congressional aides political consultants and law 
firms also have looked at them ms cohen said 
its an election year everyone wants to see their own file 
she said 
people wishing to examine the files are asked to make an 
appointment and bring with them a letter to ots making a freedom of 
information act request for access to files of specific members of 
congress once there they are left alone with the files in an area 
separated by partitions from ots employees users are allowed to 
photocopy the letters 
there is no inspection of bags and cases of people leaving the 
ots office 
schmermund said the agency is concerned about the vulnerability 
of the current system but also wants to continue to give the public 
quick access to the files ots director timothy ryan wants the 
agency to be as open as possible schmermund said 
to obtain other ots documents outsiders must use them in the 
agencys supervised reading room or submit formal freedom of 
information requests that can take weeks to be answered

chinas aging marxist ideologues are organizing a 
renewed attack on reformers in the guise of a campaign against the 
countrys tiny pornography industry 
the communist party newspaper the peoples daily made the 
connection explicitly saturday at the end of a fiveday 
antipornography meeting called by the party propaganda department 
spreading pornography the paper said was one method used by 
hostile foreign forces to undermine chinas socialist system and 
foster capitalism 
the struggle against pornography is not just a matter of 
banning a few bad books and tapes it wrote in a frontpage 
editorial 
it is an ideological struggle between socialist and capitalist 
ideas an expression of the class struggle between the proletariat 
and the bourgeoisie this struggle is linked to the success or 
failure of chinas socialist cause 
anyone reading the peoples daily would think that dirty books 
and videotapes are hawked on every corner of beijing in reality 
one has to hunt these days to find anything more titilating than 
the collected speeches of 86yearold senior leader deng xiaoping 
but political debate has taken on strange forms ever since the 
june 4 1989 army attack on prodemocracy protesters in which 
hundreds and perhaps thousands died 
the real issues too sensitive to be debated directly are 
these has the communist party lost its moral right to rule what 
system can make china peaceful and prosperous if socialism cant 
economics has been the main forum for political struggle 
chinese and foreign sources say debate over the next fiveyear plan 
for the economy is so heated they cannot convene a longexpected 
party central committee meeting 
at stake is whether china will resume reforms that reduced 
central planning in favor of free market forces but one european 
diplomat said the bottom line is power who will exercise top 
authority after the death of deng now rarely seen in public 
from that viewpoint attacking pornography makes sense for the 
conservatives led by aging revolutionaries wang zhen bo yibo 
chen yun and deng yingchao it enables them to stay on the 
offensive and fill large portions of the official press with 
speeches representing their views 
even more liberalminded party leaders such as culture czar li 
ruihuan can hardly oppose a crackdown on pornography although in 
a speech applauding the campaign he cautioned against arbitrarily 
interfering in legitimate aesthetic pursuits 
the campaign also provides a pretext for raiding book stalls and 
investigating publishing houses during a similar antipornography 
drive shortly after the protests were crushed 32 million 
publications were burned many for political reasons 
officials say 12 percent of the nations newspapers and 13 
percent of its social science periodicals were closed 
if the campaigns really antipornography it will have no 
affect on us a beijing intellectual said on condition of 
anonymity 
but if they are raising the banner of pornography to increase 
repression then it will stifle all intellectual inquiry already 
writers arent writing anything theyve all shut up there are no 
new movies or plays or works of any kind 
theaters have been reduced to reviving plays from the 1930s by 
eminent playwright cao yu now 90 in what passes for innovation 
one of caos plays a gloomy melodrama about a shanghai prostitute 
is being turned into a musical it opens next month 
equals 
editors note kathy wilhelm associated press chief of bureau 
in beijing has reported from that city for three years

both candidates in the nov 6 runoff 
election to replace mayor lionel wilson are liberal democrats both 
are 43 and their campaigns emphasize the same issues drugs 
crime education 
the major difference is where they have worked state 
assemblyman elihu harris has represented oakland in the legislature 
in sacramento for a dozen years while his opponent wilson riles 
jr is an 11year member of the city council 
i have been in this community working each day to improve 
things riles said i know the people i know the issues up 
close 
where has harris been thats the difference between us ive 
been here he hasnt 
harris counters that his legislative work has brought change to 
the city 
when i saw the oakland school system was in trouble i 
sponsored legislation to put an advisory trustee in there to clean 
up he said some schools were guilty of mismanagement 
nepotism and in some cases outright crime 
the voters so far have found harris distance from city 
government more attractive he got 457 percent of the votes in the 
june nonpartisan primary more than runnerup riles and the 
thirdplace wilson combined riles has narrowed the gap but the 
most recent poll about a month before the election showed harris 
still leading 43 percent to 35 percent 
wilson was undone in his bid for a fourth term by his support 
for a failed 602 million deal to lure pro footballs los angeles 
raiders back to oakland as well as voter discontent over a 
community battered by crime and last years earthquake 
a city manager administers the daytoday functions of city 
government so the mayors fouryear term is primarily a platform 
for leadership 
harris plays up that aspect saying he knows how to get things 
done and arguing that riles doesnt follow through on ideas 
this job is one where you can make a lot of difference 
harris said i think i can make a difference oakland can do 
better 
riles says the city has been making progress 
people have already got together to run drugs out of their 
neighborhoods he said it takes community action to pressure 
landlords and hold antidrug rallies there are many successes 
but riles who has been endorsed by wilson concedes his chances 
could be hurt by his ties to old city hall 
theres no question that were going through a tough time 
right now and people are looking for change he said 
both candidates pledge to revive oakland by pushing for 
outpatient drug treatment programs an increase in police officers 
better school and community antidrug programs and economic 
development 
oakland is known more for bad neighborhoods crack houses and 
prostitution than its developing shopping areas beautiful salty 
lake merritt and championship oakland athletics baseball team 
the city of 360000 people sits across the bay from san 
francisco which has twice as many people but about half the 
violent crime so far this year 134 people have been murdered in 
oakland compared with 85 in san francisco last year oakland had 
a record 148 murders and san francisco had 73

the parkview hilton a modernstyle 
glasswalled hotel that was just 36 years old was demolished 
sunday after its owners were unable to find a buyer for the vacant 
building 
a festive crowd estimated at 10000 watched the explosion from 
bushnell park a sloping green that stands between the hotel and 
the state capitol and gave the hotel its name 
the 16story building was imploded exploded from within so 
that it would fall on itself by demolition workers who used 60 
pounds of carefully placed dynamite the first blasts rang out at 
about 730 am and the building was gone within seconds bringing 
a rowdy cheer from the crowd 
the parkview had been vacant since dec 31 when it closed its 
doors a victim of the sagging demand for hotel space in hartford 
the owners of the building chase enterprises could not find a 
buyer for the property and decided to destroy it to make way for 
something new 
the demolition was the second this year in downtown hartford 
where the booming economy of the mid1980s has given way to a deep 
economic slump that has halted development 
there are no firm plans to develop the hilton site but it is 
one of several hartford sites under consideration for the new 
corporate headquarters of united technologies corp 
you hate to see something like that go down its still a fine 
building said helmut garbemann a retired construction worker 
from newington who watched the building fall its a shame its 
too bad the city is dying out like this 
but most in the crowd seemed drawn by curiosity rather than 
nostalgia and the mood was similar to those watching a fireworks 
display scores of people recorded the event on video cameras 
waiting patiently in 34degree weather 
ive always watched on tv but this is the first time ive 
ever seen one of these up close said edward danoff of west 
springfield mass who took his three grandchildren on the 30mile 
trip to hartford to watch the event 
the hotel built in 1954 was one of hartfords first 
modernlooking skyscrapers although it was supported inside by 
concrete pillars it appeared all steel and glass from the outside 
it had been a hilton hotel since 1966 when the chain assumed 
full ownership after hilton sold the building in the mid1970s 
the hotel retained the name 
james manafort president of manafort brothers inc the company 
that destroyed the building said it collapsed just as planned 
with no complications 
weve very pleased he said it was a 100 percent shot 
the same company demolished the hartfordaetna building on april 
1 that building was destroyed to make room for new development 
despite the objections of local preservationists who said it was 
one of the citys oldest skyscrapers

if you make big money heres good news 
opens a fasttalking political commercial from northcentral 
indiana candidate john johnson is for lower tax rates for 
the wealthy 
and thats not all 
as a millionaire himself maybe john johnson doesnt know how 
middleincome families are struggling these days the ad 
continues but congressman jim jontz does he wants to stop tax 
breaks for the wealthy and give middleincome families some help 
for a change 
welcome to class warfare 1990style at least thats what 
republicans are calling it democrats prefer to characterize their 
latest campaign theme as a quest for fairness for the poor 
and middleclass americans they say have suffered from a decade of 
greed and negligence fostered by the republicans 
ever since the savings and loan scandal broke democrats have 
been putting new emphasis on the theme that they are the party of 
ordinary people while claiming the gop cares more about the 
wealthy 
their job has been eased considerably by the prolonged budget 
battle and president bushs public wavering over whether to raise 
taxes on the rich polls show him and many of his partys 
candidates on a downward slide and some democrats already are 
declaring victory 
the democrats have won the fairness issue it is driving the 
polls and it will drive the elections said rep beryl anthony 
dark chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee the president has very clearly staked out territory 
that his own candidates cant defend 
republicans traditionally have an advantage when the political 
debate is over whether or not to raise taxes as bush demonstrated 
in 1988 but when the issue becomes whose taxes to raise the edge 
goes to the democrats 
the gop position is based on the theory that welloff people if 
allowed to keep their money will invest it and fuel the economy 
the democratic line is epitomized in a commercial made by the 
national party 
in the 80s tax breaks for the rich drove up the deficit 
while middleincome working families got squeezed democrats dont 
want you to get stuck with the bill again were fighting for 
fairness isnt that what americas all about 
numerous democrats are taking their cues from the ad some even 
going so far as to borrow its contrasting images of limousines and 
partygoers vs farmers and factory workers 
the populist refrain has helped revive the democratic 
gubernatorial campaigns of ann richards in texas and tony 
celebrezze in ohio and its giving fresh ammunition to embattled 
incumbents and longshot challengers in new hampshire and kentucky 
iowa and colorado alabama and washington state 
will the election really come down to a question of fat cats 
versus working stiffs rick shelby political director of the 
national republican senatorial committee says thats an 
oversimplification of the true facts but nevertheless something we 
have to deal with 
his advice to gop candidates is to oppose taxes and support 
the elderly 
many republican candidates are in fact holding fast to the 
nonewtaxes position that bush embraced and then abandoned even 
as they try to portray themselves as friends of senior citizens and 
the disadvantaged others are sounding more and more like populist 
democrats 
unlike some folks around here i think everyone should pay 
their fair share including the rich sen mitch mcconnell 
rky says in a campaign ad 
two republican senate candidates are criticizing the latest 
federal budget agreement in the same terms 
it does not hit the mark of fairness and equity said sen 
william cohen rmaine 
the vast majority of the money is coming out of the middle 
class objected rep tom tauke riowa 
tauke is facing a fullscale populist assault by democratic sen 
tom harkin when harkin ran a richpoor ad featuring a pyramid of 
collapsing champagne glasses tauke countered with a spot 
highlighting harkins vacation home in the bahamas 
tauke said he had to do it because harkins classwarfare 
ads were working 
josie heath the democratic senate candidate in colorado ran 
into some backlash after running a fairness ad 
heaths ad said a lot of wealthy people got wealthier in the 
last 10 years and theyre paying less taxes and we had the 
middle class and working people earning less and paying more 
thats wrong 
what heath didnt mention analysts noted was that she and her 
husband are millionaires said one heaths reference to the 
wealthy as they is dubious

upset about the 700amonth alimony schultz had to pay the victim 
robins said he has collected more than 10000 pages of documents 
and has interviewed several witnesses who claim the evidence used 
by prosecutors was faulty 
the more i got going on it the more i was convinced there was 
something wrong he said 
some supporters claim ms bembenek who was fired from the 
police department in 1980 for lying about a friends marijuana 
arrest was framed by police because she had knowledge about 
alleged police corruption 
they also note that during her trial one of ms schultzs young 
sons testified that the person seen in the house the night of the 
killing was not ms bembenek 
the evidence robins has released includes an affidavit from a 
neighbor of ms bembenek that suggest prosecutors key evidence 
the wig believed to have been worn by the killer and then flushed 
down ms bembeneks toilet may actually have been flushed by 
another woman 
but police prosecutors and the courts repeatedly have ruled 
that robins hasnt found anything to warrant reopening the case 
and some are aggravated with his incessant charges of a coverup 
police chief philip arreola says the portly bespectacled robins 
has acted out of an infatuation with ms bembenek who also has 
been a model and calendar pinup 
milwaukees chief prosecutor says robins is seeking to profit 
from a murder case that has gained international attention and 
become a favorite of tabloid television 
robins denies both contentions saying his motivation is to seek 
the justice he believes has been denied he particularly bristles 
at the suggestion hes infatuated with ms bembenek 
im not in love with her he said he said he didnt even 
meet ms bembenek until eight months after he began his 
investigation 
he said the tens of thousands of dollars hes spent on the 
investigation was his own money except for 9000 he borrowed from 
friends and 1800 in donations from ms bembeneks supporters 
a police union threatened recently to sue robins for slander for 
his remarks to news media which sometimes have named specific 
officers involved in the alleged coverup 
robins said he welcomes any lawsuits and will use the absolute 
truth as his defense 
his critics also have accused him of stirring the debate for his 
own profit citing an agreement with ms bembenek entitling robins 
to a 25 percent cut on the sale of movie and book rights 
robins acknowledges such an agreement exists and also noted the 
recent exposure of her case had landed him appearances on several 
television talk and news shows executives at most of the shows 
said robins was not paid for his appearances except for money to 
cover transportation 
but robins said he hasnt discussed any book or movie deals 
although dozens of agents have contacted him about selling his 
rights or representing him in future sales he said he will one day 
deserve the proceeds from books or movies but only after ms 
bembenek is freed 
i cant spend the time right now to set up a deal because i 
have a case to win and i cant stop until justice is served he 
said

we have to beat a legend the 
candidate lamented a legend that lied 
the topic was taxes the complaint a broken campaign promise 
not to increase them in this case the promise came from a 
democrat who couldnt keep it and republicans were making the most 
of it ignoring the parallel to president bushs own tax reversal 
in the wrapup phase of the offyear election campaign theres a 
battle raging for control of the tax issue 
bush and vice president dan quayle the highprofile republican 
campaigners are trying to fix blame for the coming tax increases 
on the democrats even though the administration signed on to the 
budget deal to raise them 
the democrats contend that the issue was fairness that they had 
to fight the administration to make sure the wealthiest americans 
would pay the biggest share in deficitcurbing taxes 
bushs ritual campaign promise of 1988 read my lips no new 
taxes is long gone a casualty of his decision last spring to 
negotiate a deficit deal with the democratic congress 
the president said he had to compromise havent liked that a 
bit but ive done it because the president must at certain times 
put the overall good of the country first he said campaigning 
in irvine calif on friday 
he said the tax medicine had to be taken because the 
democratically controlled congress simply has been on an 
uncontrolled spending binge for years 
quayle pressed the argument in a television interview sunday 
saying democrats got taxes we got spending cuts 
on the nbc program meet the press quayle discounted 
pollsters and analysts who say theres a democratic surge saying 
that ratings always fluctuate in the political silly season 
he said its the democrats who have the problem because the 
american people have had it and theyre fed up with incumbents 
at some campaign stops the republican rhetoric sounds as though 
bush had never uttered his no new taxes promise in the first 
place 
that heightened the irony the other day when quayle campaigned 
for daniel mangini the republican candidate for congress in new 
jersey gov jim florios old district mangini promises to vote 
against any federal tax increases the democratic nominee robert 
andrews says he would oppose higher taxes for at least two years 
democrat florio held the seat for 15 years before he was elected 
governor in 1989 pledging that he wouldnt raise state taxes he 
pushed 28 billion in increases through the legislature this year 
so the 250 or so people at the holiday inn waved scores of 
bright red signs that read florio lied as quayle urged votes 
for mangini 
the democrats theyll raise your taxes whenever they get a 
chance the vice president said just look whats going on in 
trenton your governors taken a page right out of the book written 
by michael dukakis and mario cuomo 
your hightaxing governor has had the best training in the 
world for raising taxes years and years of loyal and devoted 
service to the democrat majority in the congress quayle said 
long before the budget negotiations the republican theme was 
that democrats were the party of taxing and spending ronald reagan 
pushed it after muscling through the massive federal tax cut of 
1981 that was supposed to spur the economy and lead to a balanced 
budget it didnt work the deficit soared despite economic 
expansion the government reported friday that it hit a nearrecord 
2204 billion during the year ended sept 30 
the republicans argue that is because of excessive spending the 
democrats counter that revenues are out of whack too and have 
been since the big reagan tax reduction despite tax increases 
since 
quayle said taxes were part of the budget deal only because the 
democrats were adamant and insisted that youve got to put taxes 
on the table so the question shifted from no taxes to which 
taxes 
the wealthy are going to be paying more taxes everyone can be 
assured of that quayle said on the political point that worries 
republicans most the wealthy are going to be paying their fair 
share despite what the perception is or is not 
were the party that is trying to keep the taxes down bush 
said last week when they talk about taxing the rich theyre 
talking about taxing the working men and women of this country 
i believe the american people know whos responsible for 
increased taxes quayle said 
but he acknowledged that the whole budget flap had been 
politically painful for the administration and therefore for 
republicans 
weve had a couple rough weeks he said but he added that 
election campaigns go in cycles i think well start to turn it 
around he said

lawyers and human rights activists say the 
prosecution of three alleged nazi collaborators has been stalled or 
dragged out because of a reluctance to expose french complicity in 
the holocaust 
war crimes charges against one of the men maurice papon have 
been pending for seven years another rene bousquet was 
implicated in 1949 for his activities as police chief in the vichy 
regime but only now faces the possibility of a trial 
the third alleged war criminal paul touvier is on trial for 
his activities as a pronazi militia chief in lyon 
representatives of the international federation of human rights 
say authorities have failed to relieve the judge of other cases to 
make the trial move more swiftly 
we believe it is no accident that these three men have not 
been tried said yves jouffa president of the french league of 
human rights at a recent news conference 
it is because they are part of what the english call the 
establishment whether it be in politics business industry or 
high society this milieu does not want to see its dirty laundry 
washed in public 
bousquet 81 headed the national police during the nazi 
occupation state prosecutors last month asked that he be 
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 jewish 
children during the war 
a paris criminal court court ruled oct 19 that bousquet could 
only be tried by the high court of the liberation formed in 1944 
to prosecute officials of the vichy regime the liberation court 
has been defunct for decades and the ruling by the paris judges 
indicated bousquet would escape prosecution 
however at the request of state prosecutors an appeals court 
plans to make a final ruling on the jurisdiction issue nov 19 
serge klarsfeld a lawyer and prominent nazi hunter said senior 
government officials including president francois mitterrand 
appear reluctant to pursue the case 
i think mitterrand doesnt want this trial to open 
klarsfeld said i can only hypothesize that there is a certain 
indulgence toward vichy 
should the case go to trial bousquet would be the highest 
ranking french official in the vichy government to be tried for 
crimes against humanity 
bousquet was condemned in 1949 for his activities under nazi 
occupation but the decision was reversed for acts accomplished 
in favor of the resistance namely his decision to free some 
jailed resistance fighters 
jouffa who spent part of world war ii in a french internment 
camp said none of the highranking french political figures with 
direct roles in deporting and arresting 100000 jews during the war 
have been brought to justice 
he said the recent trial of the gestapo chief in lyon klaus 
barbie was the trial of nazi germany not collaborationist 
france 
the human rights federation said it had organized an inquiry 
commission to determine why the cases were taking so long their 
report is being submitted to the united nations and the council of 
europe 
we hope that the very fact that we have carried out this 
mission will be enough to create movement in high places and allow 
these proceedings to be accelerated jouffa said 
papon a former budget minister has been accused of 
responsibility for the arrests and deportations of 1700 jews while 
an administrator in bordeaux during the war now 81 he served in 
many highprofile positions after the war including a stint as 
paris police chief 
touvier 75 worked with barbie in lyon he went into hiding in 
1973 and was arrested in may 1989 at a priory in nice run by 
followers of archbishop marcel lefevbre the fundamentalist roman 
catholic leader

the race for massachusetts governor hardly has 
been marked by the gentility one might expect from a contest 
between a university president and an uppercrust harvardeducated 
lawyer 
republican william weld has pulled few punches in his fight with 
democrat john silber the president of boston university a 
philosopher and immanuel kant scholar weld refers to silber as 
dr know it all 
and despite the fact that silber called for a cleanedup 
campaign he was forced to apologize last week for calling weld a 
backstabbing son of a bitch that was a reference to welds 
resignation from the justice department in 1988 because of concerns 
with the ethics of thenattorney general edwin meese 
weld accused silber of harboring crazy ideas when the 
democrat suggested some women have neglected their children by 
deciding to work outside the home 
silber retaliated by criticizing welds mother who died in 
1986 silber said he did not need to be lectured by a 
multimillionaire whose mother never worked a day in her life 
welds mother taught drama and worked as a volunteer for a 
nonprofit company that helped place handicapped people in jobs 
protested a weld spokesman 
for all their bickering weld and silber do agree on one thing 
their criticism of how gov michael s dukakis has handled the job 
dukakis whose popularity plummeted when the state hit the 
economic skids after his unsuccessful 1988 presidential run 
decided not to seek reelection 
both silber and weld have promised to overhaul state government 
and cut state spending to accommodate state tax collections that 
have been in a nose dive 
with polls showing silber slightly ahead the dogfight is likely 
to come down to the wire the uncertainty is reinforced by polls 
before the primary election that failed to anticipate silbers win 
and understated welds margin of support 
weld served as a us attorney in massachusetts gaining a 
reputation as an aggressive prosecutor of whitecollar crime 
before joining the justice department where he was an assistant 
us attorney general 
the political outsider image cultivated by both candidates has 
served them well in a state where angry primary voters kicked out 
the incumbent attorney general denied the house speaker the 
nomination for treasurer and knocked out several incumbent state 
legislators 
republicans see the nov 6 election as their best chance to 
capture the governors office since 1974 but silbers criticism of 
dukakis has made it more difficult for weld to run against the lame 
duck 
dukakis has said hell vote for silber despite their cool 
relationship 
people even if they dont love him are beginning to see that 
this guy stands for something and that the other guy doesnt 
dukakis said 
but senate president william bulger one of silbers earliest 
supporters said he didnt want to presume silber will be 
elected governor hes in a very difficult political race 
the major issue dividing the two men is an initiative that if 
passed would roll back most state taxes and fees to 1988 levels 
the state has had several major tax and fee increases in the last 
two years 
weld supports the initiative while silber has endorsed its 
motives he has said the initiative itself will force the 
collapse of the state government and our economy by rigid 
formula 
despite tax increases and recent sharp spending cuts 
massachusetts still faces a precariously balanced budget 
both candidates acknowledge spending will have to be cut further 
with or without the initiative which would trim 12 billion from 
state tax collections this fiscal year and about double that in 
fiscal 1992 
the silberweld race is one of 14 tight campaigns for governor 
around the country with just over a week to go until election day 
the others are in california texas florida alabama nebraska 
kansas maine illinois vermont alaska oregon ohio and 
oklahoma

when the congressional session and the hour 
grow late the strain takes its toll on lawmakers and each 
reflects it in different ways here are some vignettes from 
congress closing hours last week 
 
rep henry hyde rill was upset 
one of congress most conservative lawmakers hyde thought the 
house had passed a tough anticrime bill earlier this year but 
saturday night when the adjournmentbound house debated the 
compromise version of the bill reached between the house and 
senate he was no longer pleased 
it left here as arnold schwarzenegger he lamented and 
came back as woody allen 
 
the house rules committee met at 10 pm friday to decide the 
procedure for the debate on the deficitreduction bill a measure 
on which a final vote was not taken until seven the next morning 
rep lynn martin rill didnt like the idea of a debate that 
seemed likely to not even begin until 2 am she suspected that 
legislative leaders trying to ram the deficitreduction bill 
through the house were hoping to bring the bill to the floor when 
lawmakers were too weary to resist 
is that part of the deal you dont want them alive and 
awake she asked house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif 
some would argue that at 9 am theyre not alive and 
awake panetta responded 
 
martin also was disconcerted because the rules committee was 
being asked to make a decision about a complicated crucial bill 
that none of the panels members had even seen thats life on the 
rules panel which is dominated by democrats 
are we going to get to see the bill she asked 
not until we do responded rep anthony bielenson dcalif 
you mean were not going to see the bill she said 
its easier that way he answered 
 
much consternation was caused by the revelation that a provision 
was slipped into the deficitreduction bill giving a tax break to 
an insurance company in portland maine the home state of senate 
democratic leader george mitchell 
the 1600page measure was so complex that few lawmakers had 
much information about what it actually contained the maine tax 
break was eventually removed from the bill but for some reason it 
put a sour taste in the mouths of many legislators 
id really hate it to find out after we voted it that the 
state of maine was forgiven all taxation until the next 
generation worried rep louise slaughter dny 
 
the ranking republican on the house budget committee rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota is one of capitol hills most accomplished 
budget quotemeisters here are his explanations of why a pair of 
provisions were in the bill 
a series of taxes on luxury items such as fancy cars and yachts 
to satisfy the democratic blood lust to get at rich people 
a seemingly nonbudgetary section that dealt with noise at 
airports to quiet down four committees in the house and to keep 
the secretary of transportation from going ballistic 
 
the houses democratic leaders spent much of friday lining up 
votes for the budget because they were only counting on about 40 
votes from the republican minority democrats figured that they 
needed 180 of their 258 members to assure house passage 
one problem they faced was with the congressional black caucus 
many of the groups 24 members all democrats said they would 
oppose the deficitreduction bill as a protest against the senates 
failure earlier in the week to override president bushs veto of 
the civil rights bill 
rep charles rangel dny said leaders were trying to coax 
him into voting for the bill what could they offer him to get his 
vote he was asked 
its going to have to be the top of the presidential ticket 
he joked 
rangel ended up voting against the budget

success surgery for executives organic coffee 
and gourmet ice yes ice not ice cream will be all the 
rage next year a forecaster predicts who says america is quickly 
approaching a time when baby boomers just want to have fun 
other trends to expect in 1991 retrochic appliances with a 
postworld war ii look revived interest in station wagons 
libraries the 1960s look in clothes and italian fastfood 
franchises according to the american forecaster 1991 
on the homefront the santa fe home interior look will be out 
as will be japanbashing and baseball doubleheaders will go the 
way of shoeless joe 
author kim long says desktop lunches and executive facelifts 
will be symptomatic of americans intensified interest in their 
work but 1991 will not be the dawn of an age of workaholism 
i think the 90s is going to be a fun decade said long 
most people in the big baby boom age group will be in their 40s 
and 50s they will have earned a living and raised families i 
think that equates to a potential situation where people will look 
to do fun things to worry less about what the neighbors think or 
families think 
they may drop out of careers to do what they always wanted to 
do to be what they always wanted to be when they grew up he 
said 
but corporate america wont turn on and drop out altogether 
companies in 1991 will be streamlining their operations to remain 
competitive long looks for more workers to eat lunch at their 
desks so they can become more productive 
along the same line executives will turn more often to cosmetic 
surgery as a way to prop up their corporate image long said the 
soughtafter look will be relatively small noses not a prominent 
chin but a chinless looks is unacceptable and wrinkles would be 
out he said 
long 41 of denver began writing the forecaster in 1983 and 
his book sells about 10000 copies a year this years edition 
which will be released in november has a new look to it it is 
pocketsize and its cover is illustrated by a human head with 
lightning bolts shooting from it 
long said he researches trends by reading numerous newspapers 
and magazines keeping files on particular topics and monitors 
computer data bases 
in it long predicts that organic coffee grown without 
pesticides will hit big in 1991 
that has all the makings of a major food fad he said 
people are becoming a lot more literate about what they put into 
their mouths theyre willing to spend more money for the 
details 
another trend that has hit japan and soon will arrive in the 
united states is gourmet ice ice up to 10000 years old that 
is chipped from alaskan ice floes and is valued for its purity 
clothing fashions will continue their tilt toward 1960s styles 
hot pants minikirts and baggy jeans for women and garish ties and 
baggy pants for men long says shoulder pads in womens clothing 
will become just another old trend as designers focus their 
attention on emphasizing womens busts 
the boxy appliances that marked the dawn of the postworld war 
ii era will make a reappearance in 1991 long said its the 
visual appeal so solid and heavy the beginning of the atomic 
era it looks appropriate to certain people now he said 
people also are rediscovering libraries and the number of 
libraries is on the rise said long the new buzzword is 
information literacy teaching people about how to be more 
capable of finding their own answers 
besides writing the forecaster long is a newspaper columnist 
and is author of a soontobepublished directory called 
educational destinations and field trips

a 15yearold who was staging a haunted house 
hangman gag accidentally hanged himself at a private halloween 
party authorities said 
the death of william anthony odom a ninthgrader from 
charlotte nc was similar to that of a 17yearold who staged a 
halloween hangman stunt in lakewood nj a week ago 
odom was pronounced dead friday night by york county coroner jim 
chapman in the basement of the home of his aunt diane boyd which 
odom and several of his friends had decorated as a haunted house 
odom was inside a freestanding wooden cupboard intending to 
fake a hangman scene said his grandmother hattie carpenter who 
was at the party 
he was dressed as a pirate and around his neck was a 3foot 
length of nylon rope tied into a hangmans knot hanging from a bar 
it was a slipknottype noose the more pressure you apply 
the tighter it gets chapman said evidently it was tight 
enough to cause some problems with his breathing and he either 
passed out or panicked 
chapman said odom was tall enough to stand up in the cabinet 
but a group of children found him sitting down in the closet with 
the noose around his neck and his neck to the side 
chapman said hes unsure how the rope tightened possibly he 
said odom slipped and lost his balance or was playing with the 
knot 
he said its possible that the knot gradually tightened and 
reduced the amount of blood to odoms brain causing him to faint 
and then suffocate 
xrays saturday showed no serious injury to the neck indicating 
that the neck wasnt snapped by a sudden action such as tripping 
odoms grandfather harvey carpenter said he and ms boyd tried 
to revive him but the boy was dead by the time an emergency 
medical team arrived 
on oct 20 a 17yearold new jersey youth accidentally hanged 
himself at a halloween haunted hayride brian jewell had pretended 
to hang from a gallows but his body was found hanging from the 
gallows with his feet on the ground

donald and daffy werent there but there 
were plenty of quacks made by everyone from the pros to the hacks 
dressed in hunting jackets and caps 20 competitors from five 
states gathered saturday in the parking lot of a portage plumbing 
company for the indiana duck calling championship 
topping everyone taking a quack at the state title was kyle 
fleming 33 a steel mill supervisor from valparaiso he came in 
first with the five judges with his 90second routine of duck 
calls and will advance to the world championships in stuttgart 
ark 
duck calling judges rely on keen ears because they arent 
allowed to see the callers perform that keeps the judges from 
favoring contestants they know or have competed against 
were imagining that were in a duck blind with the caller as 
he simulates certain duck calls said jerry trueblood a judge 
from detroit were looking for a smooth flow and an even 
sequence of calls 
trueblood a defending regional champion said the callers are 
required to perform a call to feed a highball or call to a 
distant duck a greeting and a call back 
once you learn competitive duck calling you can really call

new grant programs for child care and higher 
tax credits for lowincome families with children are part of the 
mammoth budget agreement congress approved before it left town for 
the year early sunday 
the move marked the first time since world war ii that the 
federal government has supported child care for working parents 
outside of welfare and employment programs said sen christopher 
dodd dconn one of its authors 
sponsors said the 750000 children will receive aid in the 
initial year of the program which also will require states to 
establish health safety registration and quality requirements 
while president bush had supported the concept of childcare 
assistance during his 1988 campaign he opposed elements of the 
house and senate packages until two weeks ago when white house 
officials reached agreement with dodd on the block grant program 
under the bill churchrun day care centers will be eligible for 
the federal subsidies a recognition that churches play an 
important role in child care in many areas overriding concerns 
about separation of church and state 
the package also includes a grant program providing money to the 
states they in turn are to pass on a portion directly to 
lowincome families to cover part of childcare expenses or to the 
childcare centers as subsidies for individual children 
the program will receive 25 billion for the first three years 
with the total expected to reach 5 billion by the fifth year 
a separate smaller grant program also will provide money to the 
states to be passed along to poor families for childcare 
assistance unlike the other program it will become a new 
entitlement program under title 4 of the social security act 
as an entitlement it will automatically be included in the 
federal budget annually and will not have to compete for yearly 
appropriations the package anticipates a cost of 700 million over 
five years for this program 
in addition the earned income tax credit now available to 
lowincome working families with children would be expanded the 
bill adjusts the credit based on family size and provides a 
supplemental 500 credit for eligible families with children under 
the age of 1 
the bill estimates the credit expansion will cost 124 billion 
over five years 
the credit is refundable meaning that taxpayers whose credits 
exceed their income tax liability are paid the difference by the 
government 
it is not directly tied to childcare expenses families with a 
stayathome parent providing care for their own children would 
receive the credit as well 
the maximum credit in 1990 is 14 percent of the first 6810 of 
earned income or 953 it is reduced as the adjusted gross income 
reaches 10743 and is totally eliminated at an income level of 
20270 the bill increases the credit gradually so that by 1994 
the credit would be 23 percent for a onechild family and 25 
percent for the twochild family income eligibility levels rise 
with inflation 
threequarters of the 25 billion childcare block grant 
program must be used by the states to provide direct child care 
services including improvements in quality and availability the 
remaining portion would be devoted to early childhood development 
or beforeand afterschool child care services

police checking a report of a prowler 
entered an apartment at 330 am and shot a 24yearold 
stockbroker to death when he got out of bed in his nightclothes to 
see what was wrong 
the officer who shot the man was placed on paid leave pending an 
investigation police said the police department already 
struggling with allegations of police brutality and racism said it 
was an accidental shooting of an innocent person 
it is believed to be the sixth shooting death committed by 
kansas city police officers this year in one four officers fired 
19 times at a man brandishing a barbecue fork in another an 
officer killed a man who was spraying him with a fire extinguisher 
none of the officers involved in those two killings was indicted 
terry d barnes 24 was shot once between the eyes saturday in 
his apartment 
i just hope that this case will draw the line on where the 
police can kill an innocent man where do you draw the line said 
andy brez 23 barnes roommate he was sleeping in another bedroom 
when police entered the apartment 
i woke up to the word police he said i was scared to 
death 
brez said he stayed in his bedroom until an officer opened his 
door and told him to stay inside he said barnes was engaged to be 
married next june 
police spokesman sgt greg mills said barnes made a kind of 
lunging motion when the officer opened his bedroom door 
this is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for mr 
barnes family and for this officer police chief steven bishop 
said the officers were reacting appropriately to a number of 
circumstances which together led them to that apartment 
residents of an apartment complex adjacent to barnes building 
had called police to report that someone kicked in their front 
door when officers arrived other residents of the complex said 
they saw a man run toward barnes building some residents thought 
they heard the prowler run to the third floor where barnes lived 
two officers whose names were not disclosed noticed the door 
to barnes apartment was not tightly shut and entered the 
apartment 
one officer opened a bedroom door and encountered barnes 
unarmed dressed in a tshirt and boxer shorts standing near a bed 
5 to 8 feet from the doorway mills said 
barnes ran at the officer and the officer fired mills said 
mills told the kansas city star the officers acted responsibly 
by going into the apartment because they had good reason to 
believe the suspect might be in there 
but the department stopped short of defending the action taken 
by the officer who fired the shot 
we are defending the officers being in that apartment mills 
said as for the shooting itself we will make no assessment of 
the propriety of that until after the investigation 
i think its accurate to say the officer did feel 
threatened 
the officer a twoyear veteran of the force was placed on paid 
administrative leave pending an internal investigation and an 
investigation by a clay county grand jury 
some of the previous police shootings have prompted calls for 
the department to reevaluate officers conduct and training 
in previous interviews chief bishop said only a few of his 
1200 officers violate citizens rights 
were part of the problem out there on the street and weve 
got to get back to good basic police work said bishop a 
20year veteran of the force who became chief in june 
police officials have said they are developing a behavior 
modification program for offending officers

buffalo ny ap hundreds of mice rats and hamsters used 
for research were released from their cages at the state university 
of new york at buffalo medical school but no animal rights group 
claimed responsibility 
the animals were found scampering around five rooms saturday 
morning by a technician arriving for work said school spokeswoman 
linda gracekobas 
they opened the cages and the mice and the rats and 
hamsters got out of the cages but they did not escape from the 
rooms she said 
there were no signs of a breakin or indication why the animals 
were released 
usually animal rights people leave a message she said 
there were no notes no save the animals this was strange it 
seemed random it seemed pointless 
university officials were trying to determine what effect the 
animals release will have on research projects in which they were 
used she said 
by letting them out it disrupts the experiments she said 
adding that some of the experiments are based on the animals being 
in a closed enviroment 
also since not all the animals were tagged researchers may not 
be able to determine which animals belonged to what experiments

police arrested thousands more hindu 
pilgrims sunday including a member of a hindu royal family in an 
attempt to avoid more bloodshed in a dispute over a moslem shrine 
in this town 
the hindumoslem conflict over the shrine claimed at least 96 
lives in rioting last week and has jeopardized prime minister vp 
singhs government 
more than 60000 people were arrested by saturday as troops 
sealed off ayodhya and the borders of uttar pradesh state from a 
swarm of hindu pilgrims 
police gave no figure for the number of arrests sunday but 
press trust of india and united news of india said 15000 were 
detained at one southern border crossing 
among them was vijaya raje scindia vice president of the 
rightwing hindu party bharatiya janata she was the maharani or 
princess of gwalior before india abolished princely states 20 
years ago 
mrs scindia was arrested on charges of violating a 
prohibitory order united news reported the state government had 
banned the leaders of several hindu fundamentalist groups from the 
state 
the news agencies said 300 truckloads of hindu pilgrims 
accompanying mrs scindia were driven to temporary jails in schools 
and public areas around the state twelve members of parliament 
also were detained by police forming a security net around the 
shrine 
its like a war zone not even an ant can get past us said 
one police officer protecting the shrine 
the controversy is centered on a 16th century mosque the babri 
masjid in this town of 40000 people about 300 miles southeast of 
new delhi 
hindu fundamentalists say the mosque stands on the birthplace of 
the god rama they say they will replace the structure with a 
temple and have set wednesday for beginning construction 
the government saying it is obliged to defend minority 
interests has pledged not to allow the mosque to be displaced 
until the courts decide the issue 
the bharatiya janata party withdrew support from singhs 
national front coalition tuesday singhs minority government 
depended on the hindu party and the communistled left front for 
its survival 
a united news report quoted singh as saying sunday that the 
hindu party was trying to usurp power even at the cost of 
communal conflagration and the countrys unity 
singh must face a vote of confidence in parliament on nov 7 
the bharatiya janata and the opposition congress party have said 
they will vote against singh which virtually assures his defeat 
elections are likely early next year 
the political matter is closed it is with the security 
forces now and they will do their duty said the police official 
at a barricade on the road to aydohya heavily armed policemen 
manned the barrier 
all entry points to ayodhya in a 60mile radius are blocked by 
barricades he said the national railway suspended service through 
the state 
about 200000 policemen and paramilitary forces have fanned 
across the state in ayodya an indefinite curfew imposed friday 
was lifted for just two hours sunday afternoon 
officials refuse to say how many policemen are deployed around 
the shrine but some officers said the figure was about 20000 
policemen lounged in the shade of narrow lanes leading to the 
shrine playing with monkeys who inhabit the area 
moslems comprise 30 percent of the 120 million people in uttar 
pradesh 
though moslems are only 12 percent of indias 880 million 
people they live in almost every indian state hindus are 82 
percent of the population 
religious tensions between hindus and moslems erupt 
periodically and dozens of people are killed in clashes every 
year

iraq fired its oil minister sunday and 
canceled a fuel rationing program saying it was imposed by 
mistake an official report said the minister was replaced by 
saddam husseins soninlaw 
it was not immediately clear why the rationing which began 
tuesday was stopped the report by the official iraqi news agency 
said the oil ministry had miscalculated the amount of chemical 
additives necessary to refine crude oil into gasoline and other 
products such as lubricants 
it was evident that they chemicals were enough for double 
the period estimated by the oil ministry the agency said it 
said the ministry of industry was capable of manufacturing the 
needed solutions 
the report did not specify the amount of the needed chemicals 
iraq had 
a wellplaced oil industry source said there indeed was an 
imminent shortage of the chemicals which had been imported before 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
un trade sanctions apparently have severely curtailed imports 
of the chemicals but iraq may have taken whatever supplies were in 
kuwait when it invaded 
the source said saddam may have fired the official issam 
chalabi to blame him for the imminent shortage of chemicals 
the iraqi agency said a republican decree relieved chalabi 
of his post it said another decree appointed hussein kamel 
minister of industry and military industrialization as acting oil 
minister 
chalabi has been oil minister since 1986 before that he had a 
long career as an oil administrator including a stint as head of 
iraqs national oil company 
kamel is a soninlaw of saddam in addition to his ministerial 
duties he reportedly runs one of the five secret police 
organizations through which saddam keeps a tight rein on iraq 
the wellinformed oil industry source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that for more than a year there have been signs 
that kamel has been attempting to expand his authority into oil 
production 
the source said that despite the cancellation of rationing 
recent travelers from iraq have said that the shortage is really 
biting and that iraqis are asking why they have such shortages 
when there is still plenty of crude oil for local consumption 
despite the international embargo on iraq

president bush said sunday he will sign a 155 
billion foreign aid spending bill despite his concerns about its 50 
percent cut in military aid to el salvador 
bush at first was unresponsive when asked about the bills fate 
as he played a midday round of golf here but as he left the links 
later he said he had spoken to his national security adviser brent 
scowcroft about the matter and told reporters he would sign the 
bill 
asked about the provision that would halve el salvadors 85 
million in military aid bush said yes were very much concerned 
about it 
but the bill approved late saturday in the waning hours of the 
101st congress also has something bush badly wants forgiveness 
of 67 billion in past military debt egypt owes the united states 
the administration sought the debt relief as a gesture of thanks 
to egyptian president hosni mubarak who has taken a leading role 
in marshaling arab opposition to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the rest of the bill provides economic military and development 
aid for us friends and allies around the globe including 3 
billion for israel and 21 billion for egypt the two primary aid 
recipients 
the el salvador provision was pushed through by congressional 
democrats whose outrage was heightened by the killing nearly a 
year ago of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
in san salvador eight military officials since have been charged 
in the crime but none has come to trial 
the cut represents a sharp departure from 10 years of us 
policy which has maintained that military aid was important to 
bolster the san salvador government in the face of attacks from 
leftist guerillas administration lobbyists fought hard against the 
provision on capitol hill 
under the bill the military aid would be cut to 425 million 
in the year that began oct 1 supporters say the cut will put 
pressure on both sides the government and the leftist fmln rebels 
to bring their decadelong war to a negotiated diplomatic end 
if the rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
mount a major offensive that threatens the government or walk away 
from united nationssponsored peace talks the aid cut could be 
restored bringing military support back to its old level of 85 
million 
but if the government should fail to bargain in good faith with 
the rebels toward reforms and a ceasefire it could lose the rest 
of its military aid 
the provisions would leave intact the nearly 300 million in 
economic food and development aid that flows to el salvador

the government backed away from a 70 
percent gasoline price increase sunday after two days of crippling 
nationwide road and bridge blockades by protesting taxi and truck 
drivers 
industry and trade minister peter akos bod told drivers the 
government was prepared to accept a 50 percent increase pending 
passage of a law that allows the market to set the price of 
gasoline 
bod said that if the legislation was not adopted the original 
higher price increase would again take effect the centerright 
government coalition has a parliamentary majority and passage of 
the law was a near certainty 
unions representing the truck and taxi drivers and their 
employers accepted the main points of the government offer 
taxi and truck drivers on friday and saturday used their 
vehicles to block streets and bridges nationwide crippling hungary 
for two days the blockade was eased sunday as negotiations with 
the government progressed 
while negotiators met in the labor ministry on sunday an angry 
progovernment crowd of about 10000 led by members of prime 
minister jozsef antalls hungarian democratic forum gathered 
outside 
some demonstrators carried placards reading fascism marxism 
taxiism and no to proletarian dictatorship 
one huge placard alluded to the street terror of 1956 when 
soviet tanks crushed an anticommunist revolution saying in 
1956 tanks in 1990 taxis 
the crowd chanted long live the government and communist 
cabbies 
defense minister lajos fuer warned the governments patience was 
growing short 
democracy cannot accept illegal acts fuer told the crowd 
the government is willing to negotiate but we wont tolerate 
anarchy 
the crowd chanted punish the offenders 
budapests mayorelect gabor demszky went on state television 
sunday to appeal for calm 
the government rollback followed two days of tense negotiations 
with protesters on saturday state media briefly reported that the 
government had proposed acrosstheboard cuts but these reports 
were subsequently described as false by government officials 
the talks had foundered for most of sunday on government 
reluctance to agree to an overall price reduction 
buses and street cars moved relatively freely in budapest and 
other cities for the first time since friday when the higher 
prices went into effect 
the government increased gasoline to about 380 a gallon from 
230 a gallon that is far higher than the american price even 
though the average hungarian earns about 150 a month at current 
exchange rates 
the government said the price increases were needed because of 
reductions in soviet shipments and higher oil prices following 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the protests represented the most serious sign of discontent 
with the worsening economic situation as hungary tries to move 
toward a freemarket system elections last spring ended four 
decades of oneparty communist rule 
hungarys more than 20 billion foreign debt is the highest per 
capita in the former soviet bloc unemployment and a housing crisis 
are growing and inflation is high 
the mood of the people in budapest and elsewhere appeared to 
back the protesters shoppers lining up for bread and milk in 
anticipation of shortages joked with some of the protesting 
truckers brewing coffee over field stoves 
the blockages were virtually cleared sunday in the capital 
danube bridges were cleared of parked vehicles as were most main 
thoroughfares highways leading to the city also were generally 
free for traffic 
state television reported similar conditions in regional centers 
jammed with parked trucks and taxis for the previous two days most 
border crossing points were relatively accessible for the first 
time in two days 
the only exception was gyoer near main border crossing points 
with austria and czechoslovakia abandoned tractor trailers on the 
main road leading through town continued to block access to the 
borders

bishops who opposed changing the requirement 
that priests be celibate ended a meeting sunday admitting it will 
not be easy to attract candidates with the needed heroism for 
the priesthood 
pope john paul ii had summoned the bishops from around the world 
for a monthlong synod on how to bring in good committed priests 
to a church that has suffered defections from the priesthood and 
seen a drop in seminary enrollments in affluent parts of the world 
it is clear that many young people find it hard to commit 
themselves to lifelong priesthood to give up the possibility of 
marriage and setting up a family and to choose a life in the 
spirit of poverty chastity and obedience the bishops said 
in a statement read during a final mass led sunday by the pope in 
st peters basilica 
this is a high ideal yet in every age including our own we 
have seen marvelous examples of this heroism with some even 
suffering martyrdom for their vocation the bishops said 
throughout his 12yearold papacy john paul consistently has 
defended the celibacy requirement which the church sees as a means 
to give priests more time to devote to their mission and less 
opportunity for distractions 
the requirement has been blamed as one of the reasons for the 
decline in the number of priests around the world 
the pope buoyed by the bishops affirmation of celibacy sought 
to dispel any speculation that ordination of married men might be 
permitted in the future 
this isnt a solution to be taken under consideration john 
paul told them in his final speech without any possibility of 
doubt the synod has confirmed the choice of celibacy which is 
proper to the latin rite 
the vatican has excluded from the celibacy requirement priests 
who converted to roman catholism after having married in addition 
several eastern rite churches which accept the popes authority are 
allowed to ordain married men 
at the start of the synod on sept 30 vatican officials 
indicated that the gathering was not seen as an occasion to debate 
celibacy 
nevertheless bishops raised the question while the synod was 
going on it was disclosed that the vatican had questioned a 
meeting that a us bishop donald wuerl of pittsburgh held in 
june with a group of married expriests in california 
the bishop denied reports that the vaticans letter was meant as 
a rebuke and said discussion about celibacy would continue 
among the synods suggestions were the use of better trained 
seminary teachers and the hiring of lay people including women to 
instruct seminarians women are already teaching in some 
seminaries but observers said the synod recommendation could make 
their use more widespread

when a 10yearold bronx girl was found 
asphyxiated her body dumped near a highway the slaying raised new 
fears that a serial killer was on the loose 
but even though one man has a link of some kind to her and five 
other people killed in similar circumstances since 1986 police say 
that he is not a suspect in fact they say there is no serial 
killer at work 
theres only one word to describe this case bizarre said 
inspector donald e moss who supervises 20 investigators trying to 
determine whether the links between the deaths are coincidence or 
follow a pattern 
in the latest case jessica guzman was found dead oct 17 a 
week after she disappeared a few blocks from her home the childs 
body was found about five miles away in a wooded area near the 
bronx river parkway 
her death prompted a review of dozens of unsolved killings of 
young hispanics in the bronx borough over the past five years 
among them are the slayings of two teenagers who were found in 
1989 also asphyxiated also dumped along a bronx parkway and 
three young hispanic women whose bodies were found in wooded areas 
near bronx highways over the last four years 
each of the victims had a link to a 29yearold bronx livery cab 
driver he faces trial on unrelated charges of scalding and 
assaulting a girlfriends 3yearold son but police say he is not 
a suspect in the six killings 
jessica was seen playing in the mans car hours before she 
vanished another of the victims killed last year along with a 
15yearold boy was the drivers niece one victim was said to 
have dated the driver once another dated a relative of his the 
daily news reported the sixth was a friend of one of the other 
victims 
the cab driver denies any involvement police said he has a 
strong alibi for the night jessica disappeared and is not a suspect 
in any of the cases 
for that reason they have asked that his name not be published 
hes the obvious link but it may be nothing but a 
coincidence said moss its not uncommon for people in the 
bronx to know more than one homicide victim unfortunately 
police reject assertions that one person is responsible for the 
slayings 
there is no serial killer and there is no linkage between 
these cases said deputy chief michael philbin head of bronx 
detectives we dont have a suspect at this time 
there are significant differences among the cases normally 
when youre dealing with a serial killer its ritualistic 
some of the bodies were badly decomposed making it difficult to 
pinpoint a cause of death which in turn makes the cases hard to 
link police said 
before jessicas funeral last monday two days after she would 
have turned 11 150 people staged a 15block barefoot march 
protesting the killings more than 2000 attended her funeral 
its like living the same thing all over again there are too 
many coincidences said ana rosa she is the grandmother of 
heriberto marrero 15 the only male among the six victims his 
body was found with that of 13yearold nilda cartagena the 
drivers niece in june 1989 both were asphyxiated 
annette rosario disappeared in june 1986 on the way home from 
her 17th birthday party she was last seen telephoning for a livery 
cab an autopsy found her skull had been shattered 
lisa rodriguez 21 one of ms rosarios best friends had one 
date with the cab driver before she disappeared last june 14 the 
daily news reported her body was so decomposed the cause of death 
could not be determined 
shamira bello 14 was found strangled in july 1988 her 
halfnaked body dumped in a park not far from where annette was 
found the daily news said ms bello had been dating a nephew of 
the driver

former prime minister benazir bhutto 
said sunday her populist party may launch nationwide demonstrations 
to protest what she called massive election fraud by her 
opponents 
a rightwing coalition opposing her easily won wednesdays 
national elections and saturdays provincial legislative balloting 
dashing ms bhuttos hopes for a comeback following her ouster two 
months ago 
at the moment the people are angry ms bhutto said in an 
interview this is all very distressing what do you tell 
people 
in elections wednesday for the national assembly the 
policymaking lower house of parliament that chooses the prime 
minster the islamic alliance defeated ms bhutto by a 2to1 
margin 
saturdays elections were the bloodiest in pakistans 43year 
history at least 33 people were killed and up to 50 others injured 
in violent clashes 
voting ended after only three hours in at least one constituency 
in southern sindh ms bhuttos power base gunmen sprayed a rural 
voting booth killing three people and injuring several more said 
election commissioner naeemuddin who uses only one name 
the results of at least nine other constituencies were delayed 
because violence had stalled either voting or counting naeemuddin 
said 
unidentified gunmen ambushed a car taking the son of caretaker 
prime minister ghulam mustafa jatoi to vote but he escaped by 
running into the polling station election officials said 
ms bhutto has refused to accept results of either wednesdays 
or saturdays voting alleging sophisticated and systematic 
voterigging by the islamic democratic alliance known by its 
urdulanguage initials iji 
the alliance denied the allegations and the charges were not 
supported by international election observers 
it has become a habit with the peoples party to allege 
rigging when they lose said hussain haqqani an alliance 
spokesman 
ms bhutto called on candidates from her party in both contests 
fo come to islamabad on saturday to map out a strategy 
we will decide then whether to launch a movement against the 
massive rigging or to play it cool and accept the opposition role 
in the national assembly khurshid kasuri secretarygeneral of 
ms bhuttos party told a news conference sunday 
the elections were scheduled after pakistans president 
dismissed ms bhutto on aug 6 accusing her 20monthold 
government of corruption and incompetence 
the former prime minister said she offered to resign the 
leadership of her party because pakistans establishment is 
determined to force her out 
im willing to step aside why should people suffer all for 
being in the ppp she asked 
with 463 of saturdays 483 races decided ms bhuttos party was 
virtually wiped out in eastern punjab the largest and wealthiest 
province and the alliances stronghold it was effectively 
sidelined in the northwest frontier province where it had ruled 
before her government was dismissed 
ms bhutto and her party also appeared in danger of losing their 
overwhelming majority in her home province of sindh but it was 
unlikely that sindh would be decided before next week

former president reagans new memoir calls the 
failed 1986 arms control summit in iceland one of the most 
disappointing and ultimately angriest days of his presidency 
but says it still was a turning point in nuclear arms reduction 
in ronald reagan an american life the former president 
writes that the summit at reykjavik iceland where he rejected 
the soviets demand to link arms control with reduced us research 
on the strategic defense initiative was major step in eventually 
convincing the soviets to move forward on arms control 
reagans memoir coauthored by journalist robert lindsey is 
being published by simon and schuster time magazine is publishing 
the first of two excerpts in its nov 5 issue 
reagan said the bullet wound he suffered in the march 30 1981 
assassination attempt by john hinckley jr was the most 
excruciating pain i had ever felt at first he wrote he thought 
his injury was a broken rib caused when secret service agent jerry 
parr shoved him into the presidential limousine and jumped on top 
of him 
the former president said he didnt wear a bulletproof vest that 
day as he sometimes did noting that the bullet stopped less than 
an inch from his heart he said someone was looking out for 
me 
reagan also told of his days as a radio sports announcer and 
said that when he was first elected governor of california in 1966 
his then 14yearold daughter patti cried because she didnt like 
having a member of the establishment in the family 
at the reykjavik summit reagan wrote my hopes for a 
nuclearfree world soared briefly then fell during one the 
longest most disappointing and ultimately angriest days of my 
presidency 
reagan and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had made 
progress on nuclear arms reduction that even now seems 
breathtaking reagan said when gorbachev threw us a curve by 
insisting that it must be linked to reductions in sdi the summit 
collapsed 
despite a perception by some that the reykjavik summit was a 
failure i think history will show it was a major turning point in 
the quest for a safe and secure world reagan wrote i think 
gorbachev was ready to talk the next time we met because we had 
walked out on him at reykjavik and gone ahead with the sdi 
reagan speculated on why gorbachev decided to allow the major 
changes that have swept the soviet union and eastern europe 
gorbachev must have realized his country could no longer 
support or control stalins totalitarian colonial empire the 
survival of the soviet union was more important to him 
i might have helped him see that the soviet union had less to 
fear from the west than he thought and that the soviet empire in 
eastern europe wasnt needed for the security of the soviet 
union the former president wrote

the first presidential race in 17 years 
could bring down the government and give ireland its first woman 
president in large part because one candidate cant decide 
whether he made a telephone call eight years ago 
because of the controversy the government faces a vote of 
confidence on wednesday one week before the presidential election 
defense minister brian lenihan the early frontrunner in the 
campaign has stumbled on his varying recollections of a telephone 
call to president patrick hillery in 1982 
in the alleged phone call which followed a noconfidence vote 
in parliament lenihan reportedly improperly pressured the 
president to ask the opposition party to form a government 
instead of calling national elections 
in may lenihan who is also deputy prime minister said he 
distinctly remembered the call 
but when the issue came up last week lenihan denied making the 
call he kept denying it even after the whole country heard a tape 
recording of him discussing the call in detail with a political 
science student 
on mature recollection and full reflection i did not ring 
president hillery on that night lenihan said thursday night 
after the tape was broadcast 
the irish times on friday carried a cartoon of a tape cassette 
with the caption sure werent we told all along that brian was 
a sound man 
overnight irelands bookies named mary robinson the favorite to 
win the presidential election 
the people of ireland will be surprised and dismayed that a 
person can deny so emphatically what he said last may said mrs 
robinson who had been 17 points behind lenihan in an irish times 
poll published on oct 10 
a poll published sunday by the sunday independent based on 500 
voters in the dublin area showed mrs robinson with 51 percent 
support to lenihans 32 percent 
that poll gave no indication however of how opinion was moving 
in the rural bases of fianna fail lenihans party 
following the broadcast of the tape opposition parties filed 
motions of no confidence in the government of prime minister 
charles haughey the fate of the coalition government which has a 
onevote majority hinges on the six members of the junior partner 
the progressive democrats 
the presidential election is a rarity in ireland hillery 
nearing the end of his second sevenyear term was simply nominated 
by agreement of the major parties 
mrs robinson who has the support of the labor party and the 
socialist workers party but belongs to neither is a former senator 
who in the past has taken controversial positions in favor of 
legalizing divorce and contraception 
the third candidate austin currie made his reputation in the 
roman catholic civil rights movement in britishruled northern 
ireland he was elected to the dail irelands parliament last 
year 
appearing on a broadcast with lenihan on monday former prime 
minister garret fitzgerald said lenihan haughey and other fianna 
fail leaders put improper pressure on hillery in 1982 after 
fitzgeralds government lost the vote of confidence 
haughey according to fitzgerald wanted the president to ask 
fianna fail to form a government without having a national 
election haughey has denied approaching hillery 
the alleged calls raise a fine point of law and custom whether 
the opposition may advise the president in exercising his one real 
power the right to dissolve parliament 
in an interview in may with jim duffy a graduate student in 
political science at university college dublin lenihan said he 
clearly remembered telephoning hillery 
i remember talking to him and he wanted to lay off there was 
no doubt about it in his mind in fact looking back on it it was 
a mistake on our part said lenihan who also holds the title 
of tanaiste or deputy prime minister 
he said that hillery a fianna fail man himself was annoyed 
with the whole bloody lot of us

a military tribunal sentenced five israeli 
soldiers to jail sunday and stripped them of their rank for abusing 
an arab detainee and threatening to execute him israel radio 
reported 
israeli security forces have come under close scrutiny amid 
international criticism of israel over the oct 8 killings of 20 
palestinians on the temple mount 
the highestranking officer sentenced sunday was sgt menachem 
zemach who was ordered jailed for two months the radio said 
the judges reportedly ruled that zemach and his troops of the 
armored corps pretended to execute a blindfolded and bound 
19yearold detainee in july 
they put the detainee anis zaidan of beitin village in the 
occupied west bank through a fake lie detector test and smoothed 
a knife over his cheek and forehead saying he was to be 
executed the radio said 
one of the troopers later kicked zaidan in the back so hard that 
he fainted the radio said it said zaidan was released when he 
awoke 
zaidan was detained when the soldierssearching his home found 
proplo slogans daubed on the roof the radio said 
the other four soldiers received sentences of 14 days to three 
months and all were demoted from the ranks of sgt or corpl to 
private the radio said the military command declined comment 
in another trial a commander stationed in nablus in the early 
days of the 34monthold palestinian uprising reportedly said that 
thendefense minister yitzhak rabin had ordered troops to break the 
bones of arab stonethrowers 
rabin has repeatedly denied giving such orders and has said he 
permitted soldiers to beat palestinians only during a riot or if a 
suspect resisted arrest 
but a border police comander moshe viltzig gave a different 
version before a tribunal in tel aviv israel radio said 
viltzig testified at the trial of yehuda meir a former 
commander in nablus indicted for ordering soldiers to break the 
bones of rioters in january 1988 
viltzig said he heard rabin tell a closed meeting of commanders 
that palestinians detained in stonethrowing riots should be beaten 
as punishment the radio said

communist insurgents have met with 
dissident military officers to discuss an alliance against the 
government of president corazon aquino the rebel leaders said 
in an interview with the associated press a group of communist 
officials confirmed newspaper reports that they had met members of 
the clandestine young officers union which helped stage a coup 
attempt in december 
in saturdays interview the officials said the essentially 
exploratory talks were held twice last week before a 
leftistcalled general strike but they denied claims by the 
military that leftist and rightist extremists had cooperated in 
violence during the strike called to force the government to 
increase the minimum wage 
the talks were initiated by the leaders of the young officers 
union said sergio romero chief of the alex boncayao brigade the 
manila wing of the communist new peoples army the name is an 
alias 
maj abraham purugganan a leader of the young officers claimed 
in reports monday his group was joining the rebels for a 
nationalist revolution to oust mrs aquino and establish a 
federal system of government with a onehouse legislature 
on our part we are always open to alliances but the basis of 
unity should always be clear said martin serrano manila area 
communist party secretary what we want is for them to declare 
their program or what they are fighting for not to us but to the 
people 
if this program approximates our own antiimperialist 
antifeudal and antifascist national democratic program we dont 
see any reason why there should be no unity serrano said 
juan liwanag a leader of the national democratic front an 
umbrella group headed by communists said the dissident officers 
would have to clarify their goals before the leftist groups trusted 
them enough to form an alliance 
while some of the rebellious officers in the country proclaim 
democratic goals others are seen as favoring military 
dictatorship 
the communist party and its new peoples army have been waging 
an insurgency for 21 years to establish a marxist government in the

a soviet envoy to iraq appears to have failed in 
his effort to find a peaceful way out of the persian gulf crisis 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said sunday night 
for the moment there are not many reasons for optimism 
coming from yevgeny primakovs talks with iraqi president saddam 
hussein shevardnadze said during his visit to paris with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
shevardnadze did not elaborate but said he was still hopeful 
for a peaceful resolution of the crisis that began when iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
soviet diplomats saturday postponed a un security council 
resolution because they said its harsh condemnation of iraq could 
tie primakovs hands as he entered the talks sunday with saddam 
gorbachev had said saddam seemed to be softening his stance on 
kuwait 
shevardnadze made his brief comments while attending a signing 
ceremony for five scientific and economic agreements between french 
and soviet officials and academics 
during an visit earlier to spain gorbachev and shevardnadze 
suggested there were still ways to achieve a peaceful resolution to 
the gulf crisis 
it is necessary to find such a path to a political solution 
but it is difficult to know what it is shevardnadze said in 
barcelona on sunday 
gorbachev and french president francois mitterrand met over 
dinner sunday and discussed the gulf crisis and next months 
conference on european security a french spokesman said 
the two leaders said the conference on security and cooperation 
in europe which opens in paris on nov 19 presents a unique 
occasion to bring together all the countries concerned to crown 
this year of change in europe spokesman hubert vedrine said 
gorbachev arrived in paris on sunday evening for an overnight 
visit on his way home from the threeday trip to spain he was met 
at the airport by mitterrand who just arrived from a summit of 
european leaders in rome 
france and the soviet union are set to sign a treaty of 
understanding and cooperation that will increase cooperation 
between the two states in energy nonmilitary nuclear science 
transportation highdefinition television and telecommunications 
vedrine last week called the pact very ambitious and 
unprecedented in francosoviet relations 
the visit to spain was packed with ceremonies honoring the 
gorbachev on his first trip abroad since winning the nobel peace 
prize earlier this month both gorbachev and his wife raisa took 
advantage of opportunities to plunge into the crowds that came to 
see them 
the architect of perestroika or openness also found time to 
win 15 billion in spanish guaranteed loans to help ease his 
countrys painful transition to a market economy 
among the agreements signed in france on sunday was one 
providing 1 billion in loans and credits to the soviet union

norways yearold coalition government will 
resign monday after failing to resolve a split over trade 
negotiations with the european economic community news reports 
said sunday 
government sources refused to confirm the reports but a brief 
news release from the office of conservative prime minister jan p 
syse said a statement would be issued in parliament on monday 
there is disagreement in the threeparty alliance over norways 
position on talks between the 12nation eec and the european free 
trade association in which norway and five other nations are 
members 
the two trade blocs are discussing possibly opening all 18 
nations to unrestricted trade after 1992 
syses conservative party favors the alliance but the center 
party the smallest coalition partner opposes ecc membership for 
norway or broad changes in norwegian laws that limit foreign access 
to natural resources and ownership in domestic industries 
syse reportedly spent the weekend trying to salvage the 
conservativedominated coalition which also includes christian 
democrats 
the conservatives have previously said they would not allow the 
coalition to stall the talks 
conservative parliamentary leader anders talleraas said 
chances are extremely small a compromise between the two 
parties could be reached before parliaments debate on the issue 
scheduled for monday 
the state television network nrk and the national news agency 
ntb reported syse would resign but it was not immediately clear 
who would form a new government 
syse could propose a singleparty conservative government or a 
new coalition he could also ask former prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland of the labor party to form her third socialist 
government since 1981 
norways constitution does not allow for dissolving parliament 
and calling new elections 
when the coalition toppled ms brundtland last october it left 
the eec issue vague 
what has happened is that the basic difference between the 
conservatives and the center has now come out in full bloom said 
anne enger lahnstein centers parliamentary leader 
the genevabased free trade association includes austria 
finland iceland norway sweden and switzerland present trade 
agreements with the eec are mostly limited to industrial goods 
the eec members are belgium denmark france west germany 
greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands britain spain 
and portugal the nations aim to integrate their economies and 
coordinate social developments

a coalition of basque nationalists and 
socialists that has governed the fractious basque region since 1986 
appeared headed for another term based on early returns from 
regional elections sunday 
there were no reports of violence in contrast to three previous 
basque regional elections since the region was given home rule in 
1980 
an exit poll made public by spanish national radio and 
television immediately after the polls closed at 8 pm gave the 
basque nationalist party about 25 percent of the vote making it 
the strongest single political group 
based on that popular vote the nationalists would gain 21 to 24 
seats in the 75member parliament that would mark a big increase 
over the 17 they had held since the november 1986 election 
it appeared likely the nationalists would form a coalition once 
again with the socialists this time with the nationalists as 
senior partner 
the socialists who run the national government were projected 
to receive 17 percent of the vote and take 15 to 18 seats down 
from the 19 they won in 1986 
the radical basque party herri batasuna considered to be the 
political arm of the terrorist group eta was projected to remain 
the third political force in the basque country with 17 percent of 
the vote and 12 to 14 seats 
herri batasuna is the only basque party that did not subscribe 
to a 1987 pact renouncing political violence 
eta stands for homeland and liberty in the basque language the 
group seeks independence for the threeprovince region since 1968 
its attacks have claimed more than 600 lives including 15 this 
year 
the turnout among the regions 17 million eligible voters was 
estimated at 54 percent the lowest in the basque country since 
spain returned to democracy in 1977 
two other nationalist parties the centerleft eusko 
alkartasuna and the leftist euskadiko ezkerra were projected to 
win 11 and 10 percent of the vote respectively slightly less than 
their totals in the 1986 vote 
the conservative popular party the main opposition party in the 
national parliament increased its presence from two seats to at 
least five the projection showed 
unidad alavesa another nationalist group splintered from the 
popular party was projected to make its parliamentary debut with 
one to three seats 
the projection by the metra6 polling agency was based on 
interviews with 20000 voters at 85 voting stations

most palestinians returned to work in israel 
sunday after a fourday ban but some found they had lost their 
jobs to jews and others were turned back at roadblocks 
police had new orders barring arabs with a record of hostile 
activity against israel about 8000 palestinians carry green 
identity cards that ban them from israel as security risks 
according to the daily haaretz 
we will increase the list of those not allowed into israel 
shmuel goren government coordinator in the territories said on 
israel radio 
the cabinet meanwhile left its police minister to decide the 
fate of senior police officers criticized by an official inquiry 
into the oct 8 killings of 20 palestinians 
the killings on jerusalems hallowed temple mount prompted a 
wave of arabjewish clashes inside israel leading to the fourday 
closure of the west bank and gaza strip 
the closure was lifted sunday but defense minister moshe arens 
warned he might reimpose it if violence continues 
i hope we wont have to take such a step he said on army 
radiothere are tens of thousands who work in israel who are 
trustworthy and we want to allow them to make an honorable 
living 
some israeli cabinet ministers argued against lifting the 
closure saying the atmosphere is still too tense israeli radio 
and television reported 
the closure wasnt to punish the palestinians but to restore 
calm and a sense of security these aims in my opinion havent 
been achieved yet transport minister moshe katsav said 
during a memorial for three israeli stabbing victims some 
jewish extremists demanded a permanent ban on arab labor from the 
occupied lands 
suddenly the gates were reopened so the murderers could come 
to our houses why legislator rehavam zeevi of the ultra 
rightwing moledet party told the gathering 
tel aviv car wash owner nissim ahbari said he hired two recently 
discharged israeli soldiers while his arab worker was confined to 
the gaza strip 
i prefer that jews work instead of arabs he said i am 
ready to pay them more money these guys are getting 15 shekels 
750 more a day than the arabs got 
a jerusalem restaurant owner however said his hired jewish 
replacements were temporary he said his arab workers had been with 
him for 17 years and were like family 
an arab construction laborer in east jerusalem said most of his 
friends were looking for other jobs 
there is always work but the situation is different now 
there is a lot of fear and everyone is tense he said on israel 
radio without giving his name 
three jews were killed in arab attacks and two arabs were 
killed by jews in the random violence that prompted wednesdays 
closure 
israel radio said the attacks fueled a wave of applications by 
israelis for weapons licenses most of which were rejected by the 
interior ministry 
up to 150000 of the 17 million palestinians in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip have jobs in israel mostly as bluecollar 
workers 
the closure was welcomed in israel with many jews saying it 
would vacate jobs for unemployed israelis and soviet jewish 
immigrants as well as free israel from its dependence on arab 
labor 
the education ministry approved a special school schedule for 
children in farming villages to give them a day on which to help 
with work usually done by arabs 
some palestinians also welcomed the closure saying that forcing 
arabs to fend for themselves could be a step toward an independent 
palestinian economy 
although most arabs returned to their jobs sunday it was 
unclear how many would be affected by the new security 
restrictions which included tightening the ban on overnight stays 
in israel the government said 
such stays are illegal but the ban is widely ignored 
at the entrance from gaza to israel soldiers ordered every 
driver to open the trunk of his car and the contents were 
searched 
a man with two blankets in his car was told to take them home 
we are doing this in an attempt to make sure that they arent 
able to sleep in israel a soldier explained on condition of 
anonymity 
the cabinet meanwhile said it accepted the conclusions of the 
threeman investigative team appointed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
the panel said the shooting at the mount known in arabic as 
haram essharif was in selfdefense but chastised senior police 
officers for failing to prepare for violence and being absent when 
it began 
police killed 20 palestinians and injured 140 after arab 
protesters threw rocks at jews praying below at the western wall 
what we decided was to accept the report of the commission and 
to allow the minister responsible to implement those parts which 
need to be carried out health minister ehud olmert said after 
sundays session 
police minister roni milo has declined to confirm or deny media 
reports that the nations three senior police officials may lose 
their jobs but some ministers from shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
rejected the idea 
the police are guilty of not preparing as needed in order to 
deter the riot but they are not accused of the killings said 
katzav the transport minister 
the un security council has passed two resolutions condemning 
israel one for the shooting and one for rejecting a un 
investigative team israel has said its own investigation was 
sufficient 
in rome west european leaders at a twoday summit sunday 
deplored the situation in the israelioccupied territories as 
untenable 
also sunday a 24yearold man in khizah village in gaza was 
stabbed to death by masked palestinian activists who accused him of 
collaborating with israel arab reports said the army confirmed 
his death 
in beach camp in gaza a 29yearold palestinian man was also 
stabbed to death for allegedly dealing narcotics which some moslem 
activists consider treason to the palestinian cause 
the deaths raised to 292 the number of palestinians slain by 
fellow arabs since the start of the uprising in december 1987 
another 756 palestinians have been killed by israelis and 55 
israelis and foreigners have been slain by arabs

remember hiding under the covers when you 
were young praying the lightning and thunder would go away and 
leave you in peace or maybe bullies were your nightmare or 
halloween ghosts and goblins 
todays children have the same fears spiders and snakes large 
green monsters and the dark but they dont have to face those 
demons alone 
not so scary things is a board game that guides children 
through the worst visions of their fears debunking myths and 
allowing them to gain some mastery over life 
the game available in some speciality stores and catalogs is 
for children ages 48 and their parents it forces young players to 
imitate the objects of their nightmares and helps parents remember 
childhood perils 
the game mirrors the way children learn how to handle their 
fears said dr neil izenberg a pediatrician and cocreator 
imitate it learn about it then master it 
as important as the childs reaction is parent participation 
we see parents who inadvertently frighten children because 
they dont have the same fears said darcy lyness a child 
psychologist who created the game with izenberg she used the 
example of a parent who takes a child to see a scary movie we 
forget what it feels like 
lisa johnson 28 of philadelphia says shes played the game 
with her three children several times they really get into it 
the playacting jumping around and stuff she said 
her 6yearold son derrick used to cry and scream during 
thunderstorms until he played the game derrick now knows what 
lightning is she said now it doesnt bother him 
in the game players move up mount courage along a path dotted 
by scary spots and courage spots 
when players land on a scary spot they must pick a card which 
may tell them to do a snake dance make a loud thunder 
noise or stomp like a monster similarly a player landing 
on a courage spot must pick a card that might instruct show how 
to look a bully straight in the eye 
the games scary things are monsters darkness snakes 
lightning and thunder bullies and meanies and spiders fears 
children normally face while growing up lyness said 
izenberg and lyness spent 2 years developing the game running 
ideas past teachers parents and children and getting help from 
izenbergs brother also a doctor 
recently a group of children played the game at albert einstein 
medical center in philadelphia where izenberg and lyness work 
matthew litman landed on a scary spot in the monster section 
told to make a scary monster face the 6yearold ducked 
under the table then popped up with his face scrunched together 
and his fingers pulling his eyelids up to his forehead to the glee 
of his playmates 
later he landed on a courage spot and was told to name three 
famous monsters frankenstein the mummy and the wolfman he 
answered after some thought 
matthew said he was once scared by a neighborhood boy who wore a 
monster mask now he knows that monsters are just kids dressed 
up scary

when the rev beyers naude began 
preaching against apartheid in the 1960s he was shunned by his 
white congregation and later banned by the government 
the 75yearold pastors message is still the same what was 
different sunday were the handshakes and hugs naude received from 
the multiracial congregation after he spoke from the pulpit of a 
white dutch reformed church for the first time in 27 years 
this is good news for south africa this is reconciliation 
said longtime church member louis lillie this proves rev naude 
was right all along 
i never thought id see this day naude said of his sermon 
in germiston just outside johannesburg theres no bitterness in 
my heart ive always wanted to preach the message of social 
justice and now some whites are beginning to listen 
about half of the 200 worshipers at sundays service were black 
mixedrace or indian 
the germiston congregation is officially part of the white 
branch of the dutch reformed church which has separate branches 
for blacks and followers of mixedrace 
but germistons minister pieter dumas has been encouraging 
people of other races to attend services since 1985 many whites 
oppose integration and left the church 
also dumas on sunday installed two black elders reportedly a 
first in a white dutch reformed church 
i hope this will spread to other congregations naude said 
it will help whites see the other side of the racial picture 
how the other side struggles and hopes 
like many longsegregated institutions in south africa the 
white dutch reformed church is wrestling with racial change 
the church the main religion of the afrikaners who control the 
government argued until the mid1980s that there was a biblical 
justification for apartheid the south african system of racial 
separation 
earlier this month the white dutch reformed church agreed in 
principle to unite with its black and mixedrace sister churches 
but the white church does not plan a final decision until 1994 
naude appeared headed for the leadership of the white dutch 
reformed church when he began began to speak out against apartheid 
30 years ago 
he immediately meet opposition from his congregation the church 
hierarchy and the government 
naude resigned in 1963 and set up the christian institute which 
promoted integration and racial justice his offices were raided by 
security police and on several occasions he was blocked from 
traveling abroad to give speeches 
the government banned naude from 1977 to 1984 the restrictions 
made it illegal for him to travel outside johannesburg to attend 
meetings or give speeches it was a crime in south africa to quote 
him 
naude returned to prominence after the banning order was lifted 
often appearing at antiapartheid gatherings with other church 
leaders such as anglican archbishop desmond tutu a nobel peace 
laureate 
naude does not belong to any political group but the african 
national congress the main black opposition movement asked naude 
to be part of its delegation when it held groundbreaking talks with 
the government in may 
naude says he does not expect to be play any future political 
role 
ive never seen myself as anything but an afrikaner said 
naude my goal is to help my fellow afrikaners change to become 
white africans

in a surprise move iraq said sunday it is halting gasoline 
rationing imposed earlier in response to global economic sanctions 
the soviets said their latest diplomatic effort to settle the 
persian gulf crisis has apparently failed 
the cancellation of the gasoline rationing was reported by the 
official iraqi news agency which also said the oil minister had 
been fired and replaced by saddam husseins soninlaw 
the rationing was imposed not because iraq was short of oil it 
controls 20 percent of the worlds supply but reportedly because 
the additives needed for gasoline refining were affected by the 
global embargo 
at the time iraqi officials blamed the sanctions for causing 
the shortage 
but the news agency said the oil ministry had miscalculated the 
amount of chemical additives necessary to refine crude oil into 
gasoline and other products 
the new york times quoting kuwaiti oil officials reported 
sunday the rationing move was simply a ruse by iraq to get the 
world to think the sanctions were working and thus to forestall a 
military attack against iraq their report was published before the 
latest iraqi announcement 
in other developments an envoy from soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev held talks with iraqi president saddam in baghdad and 
gorbachev arrived in paris for talks with french president francois 
mitterrand on matters including the nearly 3monthold persian gulf 
crisis 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said sunday night 
that envoy yevgeny primakovs talks with saddam had not borne 
fruit 
for the moment there are not many reasons for optimism 
coming from the talks shevardnadze said in paris he did not 
elaborate but said he was still hopeful for a peaceful resolution 
of the crisis 
in iraq 301 french nationals were told they had to wait another 
day for freedom the baghdad government said last week that they 
could return home but the trip was delayed from sunday until 
monday 
diplomatic sources said the departure was put off because 26 
other french citizens were unaccounted for 
the parisian newspaper journal du dimanche said france might 
close its embassy in kuwait and send the remaining diplomats home 
with the other french citizens the report did not cite sources 
iraq announced aug 24 that all embassies in kuwait city should 
close and it cut off water and electricity to the compounds one 
by one the embassies have closed and the french us and british 
missions are the only western ones remaining open 
saddam has allowed isolated groups of the thousands of foreign 
nationals held in iraq and occupied kuwait to leave 
he is holding hundreds of the foreigners as human shields at 
strategic sites to deter attack by the multinational force in the 
persian gulf 
iraqs selective release of hostages and concessions it has 
demanded from some nations in exchange for their freedom has 
drawn criticism from world leaders who say it is merely a ploy to 
divide them 
european community leaders holding a summit in rome pledged on 
sunday not to send official representatives to win the freedom of 
hostages and to discourage any private missions 
in a joint statement the leaders assailed the unscrupulous 
use of hostages in the vain attempt to divide the international 
community 
they condemn without reserve this maneuver which can only 
complicate the prospects of a solution of the crisis the 
declaration said 
in athens greece the foreign ministry said sunday that iraq 
agreed to release 10 greek hostages suffering from ill health no 
details about the health problems of the nine men and one woman 
were given 
the statement did not say when iraqi officials may free the 
hostages among 24 greeks being held in iraq 
two former greek socialist ministers left baghdad on sunday 
after seeking the release of the hostages 
in the latest naval confrontation us marines boarded an iraqi 
tanker after an australian vessel and a us warship fired warning 
shots across its bow when it refused to stop us navy officials 
said 
the ship intercepted in the north arabian sea was allowed to 
proceed after a search party found no goods banned under the un 
sanctions 
the ship headed for basra iraq had refused to stop and allow 
a boarding party before the shots were fired the marines boarded 
by helicopter 
as of oct 26 some 2738 ships had been intercepted in the gulf 
region and 282 ships boarded 
gorbachev arrived in paris after a visit to spain during which 
he and shevardnadze suggested iraq may have softened its stand in 
the gulf crisis 
primakov met sunday with saddam in his second trip to iraq this 
month iraqi officials made no comment afterward 
primakov also met twice with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
the second an unscheduled session late sunday a palestine 
liberation organization official said primakov also met in baghdad 
with plo chairman yasser arafat the official said 
the soviet envoy was expected to go to saudi arabia on monday to 
brief king fahd on his talks with saddam a soviet diplomat said 
primakov has emerged as the main shuttling diplomat in the 
conflict which began when iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and occupied 
the emirate iraq was in turn isolated by un trade sanctions and 
widespread international condemnation 
egypts president hosni mubarak meanwhile told reporters 
sunday he supported an increase in us and other military forces 
in the region while peacemaking efforts continue mubarak said he 
was ready to send more egyptian troops if asked 
the united states has said that up to 100000 us troops could 
be sent to join an estimated 220000 troops already in the region 
the multinational force has another 100000 troops they face an 
estimated 460000 iraqi soldiers deployed in southern iraq and 
kuwait 
in a speech at hickam air force base in honolulu president 
bush said the united states was not looking for war in the persian 
gulf but would not walk away from the confrontation 
its clear that the strength of our arms and the strength of 
our will is up to the challenge bush said 
no american will be kept in the gulf a single day longer than 
necessary but we will not walk away until our mission is done 
he said

joan brown an internationally known san 
francisco bayarea artist who used mysticism as inspiration for her 
work has been killed with another american in a construction 
accident at the age of 52 
ms brown was installing a mosaic obelisk at the new heritage 
museum in proddatura india when a concrete turret from the floor 
above collapsed on her friday said her colleagues at the 
university of california berkeley 
ms brown had been a member of the ucberkeley art faculty since 
1974 
im very sorrowful said elmer bischoff the 74yearold 
dean of bay area painters and one of ms browns early mentors 
what she felt particularly gratified by was turning people on 
in art a lot of students feel they dont have any talent and 
she kind of lifted them above that selfdoubt 
an indian official anantapur district magistrate b rama rao 
said ms brown and bonnie lynn mainric 43 of san francisco were 
working as volunteers on a 100foot tower to be dedicated to satya 
sai baba a holy man who claims mystical powers and has a 
substantial following in north america 
a third american michael oliver 25 also of san francisco was 
injured in the accident 
ms brown was there as an individual artist said 
christopher brown a fellow professor who is not related to ms 
brown she wasnt really a follower of this holy man but knew 
him as a friend 
in 1958 when she was a 20yearold student at the former 
california school of fine arts in san francisco ms brown won 
recognition for her large paintings that combined figurative images 
with thick swatches of color 
when she was 24 years old she was already showing in new 
york said ruth braunstein of the braunsteinquay gallery in san 
francisco as one of the few women exhibiting at this time she 
was an inspiration and mentor to young women artists accessible to 
everyone 
at age 25 she became stifled by pressure to continue her 
success so she dropped out of the art world and began traveling 
the globe 
she felt she was being trapped by her celebrity and wanted to 
break away from her early thickly painted canvases to more direct 
expression said allan frumkin who owned a new york gallery and 
became her primary art dealer 
her later work was influenced by the pyramids of egypt incan 
folklore in peru the aztecs of central america and dancing 
krishnas from india she called the resulting pieces inward 
journeys boldly colored paintings with sphinxes and halfhuman 
halfanimal figures and towering obelisks with mosaics of lions 
lambs doves and tigers 
ms brown resurfaced in the bay area in 1974 at an art show at 
ucberkeley 
she is survived by her husband san francisco police capt mike 
hebel and a son from a previous marriage

bargainers for the united auto workers union and 
chrysler corp on sunday struggled to reach an agreement on a new 
threeyear national labor agreement while a midnight monday 
deadline loomed 
negotiators worked until about midnight saturday and resumed 
work early sunday trying to draft a contract to cover about 63000 
chrysler hourly and salaried workers in the united states 
about 10000 chrysler canadian workers are covered by a new 
contact recently negotiated with the canadian auto workers union 
the caw members voted 946 percent in favor of the deal sunday 
union spokesman peggy nash said 
much work remains to be done on the uawchrysler contract 
company and union officials said noneconomic matters which 
usually are agreed to before economic issues are tackled remained 
unresolved sunday said a union official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
its going slow the official said 
among the major issues hanging up the chrysleruaw talks are 
pension matters and healthcare issues 
the uaw is pressing chrysler to accept basicall the same 
agreement it has already reached with general motors corp and ford 
motor co gm employs about 300000 active uawcovered workers and 
ford has about 100000 active workers 
the gm and ford pattern agreements call for among other things 
lumpsum payments to current retirees and surviving spouses a 
method for increasing pension payments for workers who retired 
before oct 1 1979 and increases in the amount future retirees 
will get 
of the big three automakers chrysler has the highest proportion 
of retiree costs since it has nearly one retiree for every active 
worker there are about 14 active workers for each retiree at gm 
and about 15 actives at ford for every retiree 
when bargaining began in midjuly chrysler said it needed help 
from the uaw to cut healthcare expenses which cost the company 
about 684 million last year the pattern agreement has no change 
in healthcare provisions 
chryslers unionized employees have been working since sept 15 
under an extension of a contract negotiated in 1988 late friday 
the union delivered a socalled threeday letter to chrysler 
officials saying the extension would expire at midnight monday 
the letter could clear the way for the union to call a strike by 
all or some of its members in 36 chrysler factories and office 
centers nationwide but the union also may continue working 
without a contract or issue another extension 
the union has scheduled a meeting for thursday in detroit of its 
200member chrysler national bargaining council a group of union 
local presidents and bargaining committee heads the meeting can be 
used to brief them on bargaining progress review a tentative 
agreement or explain strike strategy 
the pressure on chrysler to agree to the gmford pattern 
contract built last week when the caw and chrysler canada ltd the

opposition supporters accused the 
ruling party of cheating in this countrys first multiparty vote 
sunday and they smashed ballot boxes they said were stuffed 
beforehand 
the vote marked the first time a leader of one of africas 
oneparty states was challenged at the polls since a wave of 
prodemocracy protests began sweeping subsaharan africa early this 
year 
preliminary results from two of the 163 administrative regions 
gave more than 90 percent of the vote to octogenarian president 
felix houphouetboigny who has ruled ivory coast since 
independence from france in 1960 
the sole challenger history professor laurent gbagbo showed 
reporters stacks of ballots marked for houphouetboigny gbagbo 
charged the ballots had come from one of dozens of boxes being 
stuffed with votes to rig the election 
we cannot ask them to redo the elections because these are 
not elections said gbagbo who had been mobbed at preelection 
rallies by youthful supporters who hail him as their liberator 
he added they are stuffing boxes in suburbs and in towns 
where gbagbos coalition is wellentrenched this is criminal it 
is cheating treachery to steal the election 
gbagbo said that of the 1500 ballots in the box which was 
seized a halfhour after voting began only seven were marked for 
his coalition 
at one polling station voters said the opposition party 
representative arrived 90 minutes late and voting had already 
begun the opposition representative demanded to see the ballot 
boxes after being refused his supporters smashed open a box 
suspicious boxes were smashed at other polling stations as well 
gbagbos supporters said gbagbo said the government had also set 
up phantom polling booths where no one voted but the ballots were 
all marked for the president 
interior minister leon konan koffi said the fraud charges were 
lies gbagbos supporters destroyed ballot boxes to stop elections 
they knew they would lose he said 
gbagbo who decided to run against the advice of other 
politicians who argued the elections would be fraudulent said it 
had been worthwhile to at least campaign 
nobody ever thought we would get multiparty democracy while 
houphouetboigny was in ivory coast he told reporters it was 
time to put a stop to the system of there being just a single 
candidate 
middleclass ivorians and the urban poor appeared allied with 
the socialistminded gbagbo while peasants rallied around 
houphouetboigny 
a major issue was the governments insistence that african 
foreigners be allowed to vote as they have in past elections such 
africans comprise at least a third of the population of 10 million 
most support the president out of gratitude for allowing them to 
stay or fear the opposition might send them packing because of the 
countrys economic problems 
among the most powerful weapons in the ruling partys arsenal 
are a nationwide network built up during more than 30 years of 
singleparty rule funds from compulsory contributions exacted from 
civil servants salaries and the worship by some of 
houphouetboigny 
houphouet saved us from the cruel forced labor of the french 
and for that he will get my vote until he is buried said ndri 
kouassi a retired farm laborer in his 80s 
villagers have been untouched by the weeks of rioting led by 
university students and joined by dissatisfied urban workers 
the rioting earlier this year forced houphouetboigny to 
legalize political opposition which had been banned since he took 
power 
opposition politicians like gbagbo say democracy will help solve 
the continents economic crisis brought on by mismanagement 
corruption and slumping world prices for raw materials cocoa and 
coffee 
gbagbo also said the personality cult around houphouetboigny 
blocks the country from developing 
the opposition has promised compulsory education improved 
health services and a younger motivated leadership it is 
handicapped by a voting age of 21 years which excludes thousands 
of student supporters 
gbagbo a political detainee from 1971 to 1973 says the 
president has run ivory coast like a personal fiefdom and enriched 
himself and his cronies from state coffers 
african governments are watching ivory coast is one of the most 
stable nations on a continent where governments change more often 
because of coups and wars than elections houphouetboignys 
conservative policies brought about what western backers called 
an economic miracle in africa 
houphouetboigny has made it difficult for the opposition he 
refused to publish a voters roll until the day before the 
elections and denied the opposition access to state radio and 
television until the 10day campaign began oct 18 
houphouetboignys picture dominated many broadcasts his party 
ran footage of the president in younger days kissing babies 
harvesting sugar cane and meeting world leaders

from virginia to a new grave sunday in a horsedrawn hearse 
accompanied by fife and drum music and about 150 people in civil 
war garb 
forensic scientists determined the soldier about 20 when he 
died was from north carolina scattered among his bones were five 
buttons with sunburst symbols worn by tar heel troops during the 
war 
the soldiers remains were unearthed recently from the site of 
the cold harbor battlefield in virginia a civil war buff found the 
remains with a metal detector and word reached the north carolina 
sons of the confederacy which arranged to have the soldier buried 
in his home state 
about 2000 people lined a downtown street to view the 
processional 
fifes and drums played dixie as members of the north 
carolina brigade a civil war reenactment group walked behind a 
horsedrawn hearse the reenactors had the same beards tired eyes 
and sometimes ragged clothes as confederates in civil war 
photographs 
franceine rees a member of united daughters of the confederacy 
held two confederate flags as she watched the hearse go by on her 
lapel were nine pins bearing the names of her ancestors who fought 
in the civil war 
this means a lot to me because i had 25 ancestors who 
served she said some of them came back some of them didnt 
some were captured some were tortured all of them suffered 
organizer tom smith whose greatgrandfather served in the civil 
war said he was proud to be associated with the soldiers burial 
theres a lot of people here and theres no hatred here 
theyre simply interested in their history and past smith said 
civil rights groups did not protest the celebration but the 
north carolina chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people called the event insensitive to 
blacks 
some black bystanders agreed the parade and ceremony was a part 
of history 
i think its real nice we dont have parades like this 
through here that often said ronald davis standing with his 
family on his front porch

snowpacking machines and exploding 
gunshots will be used this winter to avoid a repeat of last years 
record slaughter of moose along railroad tracks and roads 
more than 1000 moose were killed last winter by trains and 
autos between anchorage and fairbanks thats greater than twice 
the number of the hefty animals killed in any previous year 
the alaska railroad corp and the state department of fish and 
game hope to prevent unnecessary moose deaths this winter by 
leading them out of harms way 
last year was an extraordinary year with the amount of snow we 
had said railroad spokeswoman vivian hamilton we had no idea 
the winter was going to be like that 
about half the moose were hit last winter in a 40 to 50mile 
stretch in the susitna valley just south of mt mckinley 
officials said this fall plans are nearly complete to clear the 
rightofway of snow along both sides of the railroad track and to 
pack trails leading away from the rail line and a major road 
called parks highway 
moose which can weigh more than 1000 pounds often take the 
route of least resistance unless something is done to force them 
off roads and tracks they will run along until they are hit 
wildlife biologists say 
the wildlife biologists plan eventually to create new forage 
areas for moose far from the rail line not only to make up for 
diminishing habitat but to keep them from being smashed 
the railroad also plans to use for the second year a pilot car 
that runs ahead of each train workers in such a car operate ahead 
of trains and shoot off cracker shells which are exploding 
gunshots designed to frighten moose off tracks 
we have everything laid out so that if it does snow as much as 
it did last year well be ready hamilton said 
between august and oct 1 a hydro axe a giant 
lawnmowerlike machine mowed trees and brush along both sides of 
a 30milelong stretch of rail in the critical kill area hamilton 
said 
the idea is to reduce the amount of browse material available to 
moose so theyll go elsewhere 
the railroad also plans to use a giant snow packer with 12foot 
blades to pack snow alongside the rail line and to build a berm 
between the line and packed area that moose cannot get over 
hamilton said

kansas gas and electric co announced 
sunday that it had agreed to a buyout offer from kansas power and 
light co possibly dodging a hostile takeover bid from a third 
utility 
kansas power and light will pay 32 in cash and stock for each 
share of kgampe which would value the deal at about 104 billion 
kansas city power and light co had offered 27 per share or about 
875 million for kgampe but had been rebuffed by the utilitys 
management which contended the unsolicited bid was illegal and 
inadequate 
according to a joint statement kgampe will become a whollyowned 
subsidiary of kpl 
in reaching its decision the board determined that the 
friendly combination with the kansas power and light company was 
not only attractive to our owners but the two companys people and 
assets fit together well permitting us to better serve our 
customers said wilson cadman chief executive officer of kgampe 
kgampe had publicly announced it was negotiating with a third 
company as it tried to avert a kcpl buyuout 
this is the thing thats been anticipated for a long time 
said turner white spokesman for kcpl we need to evaluate 
exactly what the transaction is with respect to ours 
excess generating capacity of kgampe had been thought to be the 
main reason for kcpls interest in the takeover kcpl has a rapidly 
growing customer base and kgampe has enough excess capacity that 
could serve as many as 100000 additional residential customers 
john e hayes jr chairman and chief executive officer of kpl 
said the merged utilities would make available electric capacity to 
kcpl enough to fulfill their customer needs into the late 
1990s 
hayes also said that customers of kgampe would benefit from a 15 
million rate reduction that would be sought if the buyout is 
finalized 
this is a winwin for all parties concerned and in 
particular for our customers hayes said 
kcpl had been pursuing its takeover since july 
kcpl extended its tender offer three times reporting earlier 
this month that about 44 percent of the kgampe shares had been 
tendered 
kgampe would continue to maintain its headquarters in wichita 
hayes said no layoffs for either company were expected 
the merger was subject to approval from state and federal 
regulatory authorities as well as shareholders 
kpl is headquartered in topeka and does business as kpl gas 
service co it has about 1 million customers in northeast and 
central kansas western missouri and northeastern oklahoma and had 
revenues of 11 billion in 1989 
kgampe of wichita has about 250000 customers in southcentral and 
southeast kansas it had revenues of 5334 million last year 
kcpl based in kansas city has 406000 customers in western 
missouri and eastern kansas it had revenue of 7315 million last 
year
