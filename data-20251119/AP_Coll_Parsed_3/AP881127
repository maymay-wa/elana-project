a new opec agreement to limit oil 
production and maintain the cartels benchmark at 18 a barrel was 
jeopardized sunday when saudi arabia apparently demanded a 15 to 
18 price range officials said 
iran is not going to accept this type of idea said f 
barkeshli a senior iranian delegate to the winter conference of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries the new proposal he 
said will complicate and it could jeopardize the whole deal 
irans oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh announced earlier sunday 
in tehran that his government had agreed to the new production pact 
his statement was carried by the official islamic republic news 
agency and monitored in cyprus 
but barkeshli said aghazadeh had signed on to a preliminary draft 
that would maintain the cartels benchmark at 18 a barrel 
he said he learned sunday morning about a new proposal calling 
for a band of prices with a range of 15 to 18 a barrel other 
officials said the plan was floated by saudi arabia which maintains 
the largest oil production share at about onequarter the cartels 
total output 
the proposal that was put to the minister when he was here did 
not have anything like 15 he said 
now people are introducing new elements into the package which 
was agreed by the minister he said he said the iranian cabinet 
approved the original draft with the 18 target price iran he 
said would not shoulder the responsibility of any complications 
he said other countries including algeria and nigeria were not 
supporting the price band the ministers apparently fear a floor of 
15 would effectively become the target level rather than the 
higher 18 price 
barkeshli also said aghazadeh was not expected to return to 
vienna 
the minister left friday morning to get his governments 
permission to sign the new accord which would limit the cartels 
output and drive up prices 
barkeshli made his remarks on the way to a meeting with opec 
president rilwanu lukman the ministers had been scheduled to resume 
their winter meeting sunday but the talks were now put in doubt 
the proposed deal would trim current production by about 4 
million barrels a day from the present 225 million barrels in the 
first half of 1989 
it also would retain the cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
prices have been running about 4 below that because of a market 
glut the new accord is aimed at curbing overproduction and raising 
prices 
each onedollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically 
means an increase of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices 
for the us consumer although oil companies do not always pass 
along the full increase 
many analysts fear the effort by opec to limit oil production if 
successful will worsen inflationary pressures in the united states 
at least temporarily and put more upward pressure on interest rates 
that would mean slower growth next year and make presidentelect 
george bushs effort to trim the federal deficit without tax 
increases even harder these analysts said 
the opec ministers began meeting monday but adjourned for 
closeddoor talks to try to end a bitter dispute between rivals iran 
and iraq the two nations signed a ceasefire in august to end their 
8year war a conflict with 1 million casualties that was paid for 
with oil export revenues 
iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with iran in 
any new accord under the new pact iran and iraq would get the same 
quota of 264 million barrels a day 
iran would retain its production share at 1427 percent of total 
output other countries would give up some of their share to bring 
iraq to the same level as iran 
saudi arabia maintains the largest share at about onequarter the 
cartels total output

presidentelect george bush is getting advice 
from aides and former presidents and from think tanks and lobbyists 
in reports that stretch from 50 to 1000 pages with covers that 
range from nononsense navy to peppermint striped 
much of the advice is unsolicited and much goes unheeded and 
unread no matter how flashy the cover or how hard the pitch 
whether they get a hearing depends entirely on their political 
clout said stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution if theyre read at all they will be read by pretty 
lowlevel transition people 
many of the reports are done for other reasons than influencing 
the presidentelect like getting news media publicity he says 
advising an incoming administration has become a cottage 
industry in part due to the success of the conservative heritage 
foundations 1980 mandate for leadership which was a blueprint 
for much of the agenda of president reagans first term 
the transition is a seminal period in a presidency said 
stuart e eizenstat who was a top domestic policy aide to president 
jimmy carter 
the legislative priorities the budget you develop have a 
great deal to say about the first year and indeed your entire term 
people have begun to realize that he said 
heres a sampling of the dozens of books magazines pamphlets 
reports letters panel discussions and briefings 
the governments general accounting office an investigative arm 
of congress published 26 separate unsolicited reports on issues 
facing the new administration ranging from defense to banking to 
transportation the first time it had done so the reports were 
bound in navy blue 
the heritage foundation has published a 953page mandate for 
leadership iii that updates its past policy prescriptions 
heritage advised bush among other things to give his vice 
president dan quayle a key role in dealing with congress not to 
joke on television with congressional adversaries and give short 
businesslike state of the union speeches the foundation also 
supplied the resumes of more than 10000 conservatives it would like 
in the new administration 
the center for strategic and international studies a moderate 
think tank packaged its 50 pages of advice on the transition 
process in bright red with a white stripe across the corner the 
document has been dubbed the peppermint papers 
former presidents carter and gerald ford offered recommendations 
on ways to reduce the federal deficit by cutting spending and 
raising taxes on beer wine cigarettes and motor fuel 
bush said last week he was openminded in terms of hearing from 
all these people but would follow his own counsel 
were always willing to take advice from others as long as they 
understand theres no guarantee the presidentelect will accept 
it said david prosperi a bush spokesman 
some groups try the hard sell 
we cover all the bases every time a name is mentioned in the 
media as a potential candidate we make certain a copy is given to 
that individual that day said curtis farmer of the center for 
strategic and international studies 
the center delivered copies to bush and democrat michael dukakis 
two weeks before the election 
farmer said that because no one on the transition team has much 
time for reading csis scholars decided to keep their report to 
under 50 pages with no section taking more than 10 minutes to read 
i think we approached this in a very cagey manner he said 
burton pines senior vice president at heritage said that policy 
suggestions often sell themselves to harried policy makers who are 
always looking for an efficient way of getting data and ideas 
we have over 1000 recommendations that is a gift to any 
policy maker pines said hell come into the office cold hes 
got to hit the ground running hell open our chapter on his 
department and itll be laid out almost irresistibly

majority democrats gained only a single senate 
seat in this months elections but the chamber is likely to undergo 
a personality change with the choosing of a new majority leader this 
week 
the current majority leader robert c byrd dwva is stepping 
down to assume the chairmanship of the powerful senate 
appropriations committee taking with him his unparalleled 
parliamentary expertise and an untelegenic courtly style 
running to replace him in one of the toughest elections they will 
ever face are sens daniel k inouye dhawaii j bennett johnston 
dla and george mitchell dmaine the election takes place 
tuesday 
while they cant match byrds knowledge of the rules the 
candidates have appealed to fellow democrats with promises to keep 
the ungainly institution on an efficient schedule and to make other 
reforms 
and democrats hope that unlike the somewhat stiff byrd the new 
majority leader will have a popular appeal that emanates to the 
nation beyond capitol hill as congress does battle over the budget 
with a new republican president 
inouye 64 is the oldest of the three and the most senior in the 
senate having first been elected in 1962 
my experience my seniority should be in my favor inouye 
said in appearance with his two rivals sunday on nbcs meet the 
press 
while he won praise for his eloquence and incisiveness during the 
1973 watergate hearings inouyes reputation was seen by some to be 
tarnished when the irancontra hearings he helped direct turned into 
a televised platform for white house aide oliver north he also ran 
into criticism for inserting in a spending bill 8 million in 
federal aid for a schools for north african jews living in france 
predicting a winner in the threeway contest is considered risky 
but inouye once the favorite now is considered the long shot 
johnston is perhaps most like byrd in his command of the 
legislative labyrinth but he is also the most public in pushing for 
change 
the 56yearold senator in his third term has been rapidly 
gaining influence he is chairman of the energy and natural 
resources committee and chairman of the appropriations energy 
subcommittee in the last congress he often handled difficult bills 
on the senate floor for retiring appropriations chairman john 
stennis dmiss 
johnston has the support of southern senators including lloyd 
bentsen dtexas and sam nunn dga if that conservative wing of 
the party is ascendant johnston a moderate could help move the 
democrats image away from liberal one that seems to hurt them in 
national elections 
clearly my centrist approach is an advantage johnston said 
on nbc it would be a good message for the country it would be a 
good message for the democratic party 
george mitchell 55 has only been in the senate for eight years 
but has quickly developed a reputation as a thoughtful and 
wellspoken lawmaker 
unlike inouye the former prosecutor and federal judge saw his 
reputation grow as a result of the irancontra investigation 
afterward he coauthored a book on the subject with his maine 
colleague republican senator william cohen 
like johnston mitchell has been chairman of the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee and during his tenure the party 
regained control of the senate after the 1986 elections the post is 
tailormade for doing favors for other senators the kind of chits 
that come in handy during a leadership battle 
mitchells voting record isnt quite as liberal as inouyes and 
some see him as a choice that could point to the future for 
traditional democratic ideals 
all three however say they believe the race isnt about 
philosophy 
one of the major issues facing the nation is the budget deficit 
all said sunday it will be up to presidentelect george bush to make 
the first move to deal with the deficit including politically 
distasteful proposals like raising taxes or cutting costofliving 
increases in social security 
and they agreed that bush should not invite conflict by seeking 
immediate renewal of military aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
but should seek a consensus policy that relies more heavily on 
diplomacy 
under the senate rules the 55 democrats will choose among the 
three in a closed meeting by secret ballot if no one wins on the 
first ballot the candidate with the least votes drops out and the 
choice then is between the two survivors 
none of the three is claiming a majority but each claims to have 
commitments for more than enough votes to make it past the first 
round 
its something of a tradition in congress for lawmakers to 
mislead their colleagues and even the press as to their true 
intentions in the secret elections when sen edward m kennedy 
dmass was embarrassed by byrd and defeated for the assistant 
majority leader post in 1971 reporters and kennedy himself had 
counted the votes in his favor 
the assistant majority leaders post also is being contested this 
year in a face off that pits sen wendell ford dky against 
incumbent alan cranston dcalif

the release of two elderly 
black leaders capped a week of government moves that earned 
international praise but domestic critics said sunday the goodwill 
gestures must be followed with a dismantling of apartheid 
the government citing medicalhumanitarian reasons on 
saturday freed two seriously ill leaders harry gwala 69 a 
longtime member of the african national congress and zephania 
mothopeng 75 president of the pan africanist congress both 
antiapartheid groups are outlawed 
the men both colleagues of jailed anc leader nelson mandela 
served some 35 years in prison between them 
it makes a pleasant change for south africans to end a week 
with the sweet sounds of praise ringing in their ears rather than 
the harsh rasp of castigation said the sunday star of 
johannesburg an antiapartheid newspaper 
but the newspaper cautioned only if the intent to rid the 
country of apartheid is clearly stated and acted upon will the 
momemtum of the last week be sustained 
in addition to releasing the two prisoners the government last 
week 
announced that mandela the countrys best known black leader 
will not return to prison when he completes his recovery from 
tuberculosis at a cape town hospital however mandela will remain 
in custody at a suitable location the government added 
granted clemency to the sharpeville six a group of blacks 
sentenced to death for complicity in a 1984 mob killing the death 
sentences replaced with lengthy jail terms had provoked 
international protest 
endorsed a regional peace plan under which south africa would 
grant independence to southwest africa also known as namibia 
the actions won widespread praise from western governments and 
are likely to dampen foreign campaigns to place additional sanctions 
against south africa toward ending the system of racial segregation 
under which blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the city press southafricas largestselling blackoriented 
newspaper said sunday the moves bought president pw botha more 
time to maneuver 
but the paper also noted the extremeright conservative party 
which controls dozens of town councils decided last week to ban 
blacks from using public facilities in the industrial town of 
boksburg additional towns controlled by the conservatives have said 
they plan to follow suit 
what this means is that we are back to square one in race 
relations the city press said in an editorial 
the government has won been praised in recent years for releasing 
aging antiapartheid activists who have served lengthy prison 
sentences 
but an estimated 1000 activists remain in detention without 
charge under the governments 29monthold state of emergency the 
government also has banned 23 leading antiapartheid organizations 
this year and has threatened additional crackdowns 
the government faces several politically sensitive issues in the 
near future 
the presidents council an advisory body to botha is scheduled 
this week to debate a bill that would strengthen the group areas 
act which segregates all neighborhoods by race 
also the government is expected to call national elections early 
next year and must contend with the increasingly powerful 
conservatives 
both the african national congress and the pan africanist 
congress use armed resistance against the whiteled government 
however the pan africanist congress favors black selfreliance in 
the struggle for political rights while the anc supports a 
multiracial approach

the election of george bush and dan quayle may 
mean that a bevy of rising gop stars must hold their ambitions in 
check into the next century 
democratic hopefuls already are organizing behind the scenes to 
position themselves for the 1992 presidential election and they 
dont have to be very bashful about it said thomas mann a 
scholar at the brookings institution 
some of them can start running tomorrow he said 
but republicans out of deference to their party and the new man 
in the oval office must put their political ambitions on hold 
said richard a brody a political scientist at stanford university 
bush is likely to be the gop nominee again in 1992 assuming he 
wants the job and that his administration encounters no disaster 
and quayle has a good shot at retaining the second slot on the 
ticket if he performs well in office several analysts said 
the greatest likelihood is that bush will stand for reelection 
and everyone has got to tread water for eight years mann said 
you dont normally challenge a sitting president 
looking to 1996 quayle has a builtin edge to succeed bush 
pushing the presidential prospects of others into the next century 
the analysts said 
theyve got dan quayle sitting in the middle of the road 
blocking the road to advancement william schneider a 
washingtonbased political analyst said of other gop hopefuls a 
vice president usually has a leg up in getting the nomination 
bob dole the kansas senator unsuccessfully sought the republican 
presidential nomination in 1980 and 1988 has complained about 
this promotion idea that you just ought to go up the ladder from 
vice president to president 
the political clock may run out on dole who would turn 73 before 
election day 1996 
younger republicans thought to harbor presidential ambitions 
include outgoing rep jack kemp of new york and former delaware gov 
pete du pont both vanquished by bush this time around new jersey 
gov thomas kean and texas sen phil gramm 
the political futures of the gop hopefuls turn on whether they 
assume prominent positions in the bush administration or elsewhere 
what the ideological bent of the administration turns out to be and 
whether bush and quayle do well said john kessel a political 
scientist at ohio state university 
kemp who joins the heritage foundation in january when his house 
term ends is one whose presidential prospects could be especially 
damaged by fellow conservative quayle brody said 
an increasingly positive position of dan quayle in the 
republican party particularly among conservatives is going to come 
out of jack kemps hide brody said 
du pont from the same side of the party could be discouraged 
from making another run if it looks like either kemp or quayle were 
the conservative favorite mann said 
gramm can use his post in congress to fight the good fight 
and be a strong voice for senate republicans during the bush years 
but he is another who can be hurt by quayle schneider said 
quayle clearly blocks the way for conservative young 
republicans like kemp and gramm he said 
prospects for kean a rising star in the partys moderate wing 
could be particularly affected by the administrations ideological 
slant kessel said keans term ends next year 
if bushs white house turns out to be strongly conservative it 
could leave a vacuum on the moderate side of the republican party 
either freezing them out for eight years or conceivably someone 
like tom kean might emerge kessel said 
if the bush administration does poorly it could taint the whole 
republican party and hinder the election chances for any wouldbe 
gop successor kessel said 
a poor showing by bush could improve the prospects for another 
republican to move in and try a palace coup in 1992 said mann 
challenges to the president from within his party are rare the 
most recent instances both unsuccessful were ronald reagans 
1976 challenge to gerald ford and massachusetts sen edward 
kennedys confrontation with jimmy carter in 1980 
the best bet is that if the bush term is successful no one 
will challenge him mann said

the familiar battle between abortion proponents 
and the catholic church has taken an ironic twist in hawaii where 
planned parenthood wants to perform abortions on churchowned land 
in the shadow of the dioceses cathedral 
hawaii planned parenthood had for years concentrated on 
contraception and referred women to doctors for abortions elsewhere 
but in 1987 it applied for a state permit to perform abortions at 
its downtown clinic which it has leased since 1976 
the clinic is in a building owned by 1164 partners that stands on 
land of which the roman catholic diocese of hawaii is primary owner 
the 12th floor clinic overlooks the cathedral of our lady of peace 
when the state granted permission for abortions at the clinic 
the catholic church which regards abortion as murder took planned 
parenthood and the state to court 
the church was joined in its fight by 1164 partners 
their lawsuit claimed abortion is prohibited under both the 
buildings lease and the master lease written by the church which 
contain provisions against objectionable practices 
the whole question of abortion is against our moral values 
said hawaii bishop joseph ferrario 
a federal judge earlier this month declined to issue a temporary 
restraining order to keep planned parenthood from performing 
abortions there citing lack of jurisdiction a state court earlier 
refused to issue a temporary restraining order although it has not 
yet ruled on the original suit planned parenthood has asked for an 
expedited ruling while the church wants a trial 
ferrario said state approval of the clinics abortion permit 
application was insensitive to the states 220000 catholics 20 
percent of the total population and hawaiis largest religious group 
that clinic is a stones throw away from our church and to me 
this is the grossest insensivity he said there was no public 
hearing no chance for the neighbors to voice their opposition they 
were already in there and wanted to expand so it was a purely 
administrative process 
the proposed abortion clinic also is bad business for the 
buildings owners said paul goto one of the partnerships lawyers 
he said the buildings other tenants were harassed by the 
antiabortion group hawaii right to life which has sent tenants 
letters asking do you want to ride in those elevators with the 
brutally mangled bodies of unborn babies 
protests bomb threats and bad publicity have scared away 
prospective tenants and forced at least one tenant out goto said 
cheryl vasconcellos executive director of hawaii planned 
parenthood said the clinic will move when its lease expires in 
1992 and that the costly legal battle now will lay the framework 
for that move 
the church may say itll be all over once we move but right to 
life will oppose us wherever we try to go she said moving 
takes money and that four years before the lease expires buys us 
some time to earn that money and to apply for the permits well need 
to open a new clinic we cant just pick up and move right now 
vasconcellos said it was ironic the church did not object to 
planned parenthoods rental agreement before even though the clinic 
prescribes birth control pills and other contraceptives which also 
are outlawed by the church 
ferrario admitted the church was lax in ever allowing planned 
parenthood to rent space in the building 
but back then there was a way of sort of living with planned 
parenthood on the issue of contraception its not so easy to live 
with abortion he said 
vasconcellos said planned parenthood was free to perform 
abortions pending the outcome of the lawsuit and would start doing 
so by the end of november declining to be more specific 
last year there were 5964 abortions in the state or one for 
every three births 
the time has come for us to provide this obviously needed 
service vasconcellos said reproductive rights are at stake

syrian peacekeeping troops intervened 
sunday to halt fighting by rival shiite moslem militias around the 
iranian embassy on the fifth day of fierce street clashes around 
beirut 
the syrians set a 1 pm deadline for fighters of the prosyrian 
amal militia and the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god to 
withdraw from the streets in west and south beirut 
the syrian army has orders to shoot on sight any gunman on the 
streets in beirut and the southern suburbs after the deadline the 
ultimatum said 
syrian officers accompanied by soldiers armed with 
shoulderfired rocket launchers blared the warning through 
bullhorns in all embattled districts it was also broadcast by 
several beirut radio stations 
apart from a few sniper shots the fighting stopped in all 
districts at the deadline set by the syrians said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
but several hours later heavy fighting resumed in two districts 
adjoining the beirut airport highway a police spokesman said the 
syrian command called on representatives of the two militias to 
quickly recall their fighters 
it was the first serious effort by the 12000man syrian 
contingent to halt five days of fierce fighting that has left 35 
people killed and 74 wounded by police count 
the warning was issued after amal and hezbollah militiamen 
battled around the sixstory iranian embassy building in west beirut 
police said the militias also fired machine guns and 
rocketpropelled grenades in the neighboring district of bir hassan 
following a tank and mortar bombardment in the citys southern slums 
on saturday night 
in fierce fighting friday and saturday militiamen forced 
hezbollah fighters to leave eight of 11 embattled west beirut 
neighborhoods 
police said the syrians were negotiating arrangements to evacuate 
hezbollah fighters from five beleagered buildings in three other 
districts 
the syrians set up checkpoints on key intersections in the three 
neighborhoods apparently to prevent an attack on hezbollahs 
hideouts amal gunmen were seen lurking in nearby alleys 
amals victory has dealt a harsh blow to hezbollahs bid for 
dominance of the 1 million shiites who form the largest single sect 
among lebanons four million inhabitants 
the syrians have been concerned over hezbollahs growing military 
clout believing their role as lebanons main power broker might be 
challenged 
hezbollahs fighters drove amal out of strongholds in the slums 
during may in a threeweek campaign that left nearly 300 people 
killed and 1000 wounded 
weve now evened the score said an amal official who 
demanded anonymity 
thousands of residents trapped indoors during the fighting 
ventured out after the syrian intervention to assess property losses 
parked cars were riddled with bulletholes severed cables 
dangled from broken power poles and dirty water gushed from 
punctured sewer lines streets were thick with glass shards and 
spent cartridges 
what have we done to deserve all this said mahmoud itter as 
he surveyed the ruins of his electrical tool shop in the district of 
lower basta 
slum residents took advantage of the lull in the fighting to bury 
their dead reporters counted at least eight funeral processions and 
saw mourners frequently duck as sniper fire cracked overhead 
an unsigned letter to the militia combatants published by 
beiruts leftist daily assafir voiced outrage at the fighting 
have you forgotten the women children and elderly living in 
the neighborhoods where you are fighting the letter said 
why dont you go to garbage dumps outside the city and fight it 
out there until you are all killed we will then bury you in the 
garbage because the soil of lebanon should not be contaminated by 
your filthy bodies

more than 115000 has been handed out to house 
democrats by rep william gray a pennsylvania lawmaker who is 
looking for votes in a threeway race for a relatively obscure 
leadership post 
according to federal election commission records campaign 
contributions of more than 123000 have been made to lawmakers who 
will vote dec 5 in the secretballot election for house caucus 
chairman the chambers no 3 leadership position 
nearly all the giving was done by gray who is seeking the caucus 
chair after serving as house budget committee chairman for the 
maximum four years allowed by house rules 
through his regular campaign treasury and a yearold political 
action committee gray has given at least 115450 this year to 84 
returning house democrats and 32 people who sought house seats in 
the last election fifteen of the 32 won and will participate in the 
caucus election 
grays 1988 giving which outstripped all of his contributions to 
colleagues campaigns the previous five years was detailed in fec 
reports through oct 19 the total will rise 
jon plebani chief of staff of grays congressional office says 
that more contributions were made after oct 19 i dont know the 
amounts he said that giving will be covered in reports due at 
the fec three days after the caucus election 
one of grays opponents rep mary rose oakar the ohio democrat 
who is now vice chair of the caucus also has given to colleagues 
7731 which she says was distributed early this year after 
democratic leaders appealed for help for incumbents facing tough 
reelection battles 
the third caucus chair candidate rep mike synar dokla has 
not followed suit he declines to comment on the money being spent 
by his opponents but ms oakar is not happy about grays spending 
its difficult to compete at any time against money she said 
in an interview echoing the complaint often voiced by candidates 
trying to get elected to the house against wellheeled incumbents 
i feel im running on the basis of merit not contributions 
said ms oakar who claims to have commitments from 129 of the 264 
democrats in the party caucus 
plebani who responded to an associated press request for an 
interview with gray declined to discuss their vote count but he 
said of oakars claim if she has 129 votes there are at least 
700 members of the democratic caucus 
the three representatives are running for one of the true insider 
jobs in the house caucus meetings which set policy positions for 
house democrats are closed to the public the chair gets no extra 
pay but four staff positions go with the job 
almost 80 percent of the money given out by gray this year came 
from the committee for democratic opportunity the political action 
committee he formed last december and which had raised 134524 
through oct 19 
his leadership pac is not unusual on capitol hill more than 70 
members of congress have them all with the ostensible purpose of 
helping build party ranks in the senate and house 
but in a fundraising appeal last may gray linked his pac with 
his caucus chair candidacy house members and veteran staffers said 
this was the first time a leadership pac had been openly tied to a 
leadership campaign 
the pac was obviously set up for the caucus chair race ms 
oakar said 
speaking for gray plebani said hes running on his record of 
proven leadership and effective coalition building those 
contributions were given without regard to the recipients 
preference for caucus chair contributions were given to public 
supporters of mr synar and ms oakar the bulk of the contributions 
were given in the most toughly contested races in the country 
nine house members who have publicly endorsed oakar were among 
the 84 incumbents who shared 84200 in gray contributions through 
oct 19 while the average overall contribution was about 1000 
the known oakar supporters averaged 561 each 
fec records show that grays largest contributions this year went 
to colleagues involved in tough races 6000 to louise slaughter 
dny 5500 to peter kostmayer dpa and 5000 to james 
clarke dnc 
gray also gave money to local candidates in pennsylvania and to 
house colleagues who unsuccessfully sought senate seats 5000 to 
mike lowry in washington and 2000 each to buddy mackay in florida 
and wayne dowdy in mississippi

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
party may offer the post of finance minister to labor party leader 
shimon peres as an inducement to join a coalition government a 
shamir aide said sunday 
yossi ahimeir a top adviser to shamir said likud cabinet 
ministers discussed the proposal sunday but made no final decision 
about whether to go ahead with the offer 
we are only at the start of the discussion ahimeir said a 
way must be found to bring about talks for a broad and stable 
government 
but likud leaders are divided over the proposal ahimeir said 
with many objecting to offering peres the nations top economic post 
ahimeir said the proposal may win the approval of likud cabinet 
ministers at a second meeting on monday and that if it did shamir 
would discuss it formally with peres 
if a meeting is held between shamir and peres it could set the 
stage for formation of a broadbased national unity government like 
the one that has ruled israel since the 1984 national elections 
ended in stalemate 
as part of the new proposal which emerged after secret weekend 
contacts between likud and leftleaning labor likuds moshe arens 
a former ambassador to washington would replace peres as foreign 
minister four israeli daily newspapers reported sunday 
the hadashot and yediot ahronot dailies said yitzhak rabin of 
labor would remain defense minister and ariel sharon of likud would 
keep the post of industry minister 
four other cabinet posts would also be earmarked for labor 
appearing to meet the partys key condition for parity in the 
distribution of government posts the newspapers said 
peres made no public comment about the reported proposal 
uzi baram secretarygeneral of the party said peres would have 
a hard time getting approval from the policymaking central 
committee to join a likudled cabinet 
in the nov 1 national elections shamirs likud edged out labor 
winning 40 seats to 39 in the 120seat parliament while small 
religious and rightwing parties made gains president chaim herzog 
chose shamir to assemble a ruling coalition and recommended he try 
to include labor 
such a coalition would substantially limit the bargaining power 
of the small religious and rightwing parties 
the religious parties offer to join a coalition in exchange for 
demands that have aroused the ire of israels secular majority and 
of jews abroad one demand is for legislation giving orthodox rabbis 
the power to define who is a jew a move seen as an affront to 
rabbis of judaisms reform and conservative branches 
extreme rightwing factions want to annex the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip and to expand jewish settlements in the areas

troops and police went on alert sunday 
after authorities blocked bus convoys carrying thousands of 
civilians into manila to distribute leaflets calling for a coup 
officials said 
the leaflets distributed saturday called for the military 
overthrow of president corazon aquinos government said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the armed forces of the philippines is now taking over the 
government the manila newspaper malaya quoted one of the leaflets 
as saying we will replace unpatriotic government officials who 
are only interested in building political parties 
police in the manila suburb of las pinas said they detained about 
20 people who were spreading the leaflets but all but five were 
released 
more than 1000 other people were blocked by police when they 
arrived in las pinas in a convoy of buses and jeeps from the nearby 
province of cavite 
in manilas sampaloc district col leonardo orig of the 
philippine constabulary said police intercepted 12 buses and four 
jeeps carrying about 500 people some of whom were handing out 
procoup leaflets the group came from the northern provinces of 
tarlac pampanga and la union 
similar movements were reported in other areas including the 
capitals financial district of makati where police rounded up more 
than 100 people all were released after a few hours of questioning 
everything is normal now and we may lift the alert tonight or 
tomorrow said orig who said the demonstrators had been paid 
officials who asked not to be identified said they were told by 
investigators that rightwing extremists were using the convoys as a 
way of testing the waters for mounting a possible coup attempt 
authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against mrs 
aquino who came to power after a civilianmilitary uprising in 
february 1986 that ousted president ferdinand marcos 
in another development forensic experts were trying to determine 
if skeletons exhumed in central luzon were those of two women 
allegedly slain in a military coverup of the 1983 killing of mrs 
aquinos husband 
the remains exhumed saturday were being tested in manila to 
determine if they are those of two sisters who knew the man 
initially thought to have killed former sen benigno aquino 
according to officials of the national bureau of investigation 
aquino was shot to death on aug 21 1983 at the manila 
international airport as soldiers escorted him out of a plane when 
he arrived home from three years of selfimposed exile in the united 
states 
marcos and the military claimed aquino was slain by rolando 
galman an alleged communist agent killed by soldiers immediately 
after aquino was shot 
but a civilian board investigating the slaying concluded aquino 
was killed by one of his military escorts and galman was a 
scapegoat investigators described galman as an underworld figure 
with links to military officials 
the bodies suspected to be those of two hostesses at a bar 
frequented by galman were exhumed from a field just outside capas 
60 miles north of manila the grave was identified by five 
militiamen who claimed military officers ordered them to bury the 
women in december 1983 
the philippine daily inquirer and the philippine daily globe 
reported sunday that the orders came from officers linked to eduardo 
cojuangco mrs aquinos first cousin and a close associate of 
marcos 
cojuangco fled the country in 1986 and lives in california mrs 
aquino has banned him from returning 
the sisters anna and catherine oliva disappeared in september 
1983 
gen fabian ver then the military chief of staff and 25 others 
were acquitted of killing benigno aquino in december 1985 
but a new supreme court constituted after mrs aquino came to 
power ruled the first trial was manipulated by marcos and ordered a 
new trial the number of defendants has increased to 40 most of 
them soldiers

a group of activists has called for 
sweeping reforms that would allow citizens to join opposition 
political parties elect government officials and modify the 
constitution through referendums 
the proposals are contained in a program adopted by the 
independent smallholders party which was revived earlier this month 
after more than 30 years of inactivity the independent organization 
is the first of dozens that have been formed over the past year to 
declare itself a political party 
legislation is to be adopted next month to regulate the 
establishment of independent associations but separate laws 
allowing the establishment of political parties are not expected to 
be adopted before 1990 
the communistled government says opposition political parties 
may be allowed to evolve but not before 1990 as it stands now the 
communist party appoints all government officials and modifies the 
constitution when it chooses parliament acts as a rubber stamp 
karoly ravasz spokesman for the smallholders party said 
sweeping political reforms must be enacted before 1990 we think 
society wont wait two years he told western journalists in 
budapest after the smallholders adopted a new platform at a meeting 
this weekend 
the government plans a broad program of political reforms that 
minister of state imre pozsgay calls a plan for democracy to 
coincide with economic reforms that include strict austerity 
measures 
leaders in the provisional presidium say the smallholders party 
which headed a coalition government after world war ii was never 
formally disbanded after the communists assumed power in 1948 and a 
oneparty state was established but the smallholders say they were 
forced to suspend activities 
the party was briefly represented in the government of imre nagy 
in 1956 before soviet troops and tanks crushed an anticommunist 
uprising 
the revived smallholders partys 46point program includes 
several demands similar to reforms pozsgay suggested to parliament 
at a session last week 
ravasz said the smallholders called for free elections 
referendums to modify the constitition full and unconditional 
rights of freedom thought religion speech assembly and 
association and an independent media 
pozsgay says legislation being drafted would deal with many of 
these issues the official media which have become increasingly 
open in recent months have not directly reported on the revival of 
the smallholders party 
pozsgay told reporters last week that no repressive measures 
would be taken against the smallholders but until legislation 
regulating the founding of parties is passed the government will not 
provide publicity for it

about 85 animal welfare activists demonstrated 
saturday against a bowandarrow deer season condemning as inhumane 
the hunt by handicapped people in a mostly fencedin navy yard 
only people in wheelchairs are eligible for the hunt which 
started wednesday and could last until dec 11 at the navys 
manchester fuel depot near bremerton west of seattle across the 
puget sound two deer were killed saturday 
the navy said the deer have overpopulated the 234acre enclosure 
and many have died in recent years of starvation 
the activists walked in front of the main gate at sandpoint naval 
station in seattle carrying signs reading deer today gone 
tomorrow bambi watch out how deer you us navy hold 
your fire stop the deer slaughter and bow hunting tame 
deer inhumane 
one demonstrator was dressed in a deer costume pierced with a 
number of arrows while another protester dressed in a navy uniform 
and carried a bow and arrows 
mitchell fox of the progressive animal welfare society which 
organized the demonstration said the deer were easy targets as they 
were well acclimated to people officials estimate 40 to 45 deer 
live inside the enclosed area 
fox called the demonstration a last resort to stop the hunt 
following a federal judges decision to clear the way for the 
bowandarrow season 
the state has recommended the hunt to promote a healthier herd 
fox said demonstrators want the navy to appoint an arbitrator to 
settle the dispute 
a local navy spokesman ed edwards said about a dozen hunters 
had qualified at the navys archery range there were four hunters 
in wheelchairs out saturday and two were successful taking a doe 
and a buck he said no hunting was scheduled for sunday he added

afghanistan guerrillas met with soviet 
officials sunday to discuss an exchange of prisoners of war said a 
guerrilla source afghan radio and the soviet news agency tass 
no further details were available on the talks in islamabad a 
similar meeting was held earlier this year in bonn west germany 
representatives of other rebel groups that belong to a loose and 
often fractured guerrilla alliance denied talks were held sunday 
the soviet ambassador in islamabad vladimir vakunin refused to 
comment on the reports 
the meeting was first reported by afghanistans official radio 
kabul which said the talks were held with afghan opposition a 
reference to the moslem insurgents the meeting was confirmed by an 
official with the jamiateislami guerrilla group in peshawar who 
spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity 
tass said the meeting between representatives of the soviet 
embassy in pakistan and the afghan armed opposition forces 
discussed the return of soviet prisoners 
hamid gailani spokesman for the national islamic front of 
afghanistan guerrilla group said there has been no such 
contact he said afghan officials have been lying for the past 
10 years so why not about this too 
a denial also came from the afghan news agency a rebel 
information center operated by members of the hezbeislami 
guerrilla group 
earlier this year hezbeislami representatives met soviet 
officials in bonn to discuss a prisonerexchange program 
the two sides agreed to exchange one soviet soldier for 25 
rebels however the rebels abandoned the prisoner exchange after 
the united nations negotiated an accord on april 15 in geneva that 
calls for the withdrawal of all soviet troops rebels say no 
prisoners were ever exchanged 
also sunday moslem guerrillas said they regained control of a 
strategic border post after a week of fighting along a highway that 
serves as their supply route from pakistan 
there was no independent confirmation of the guerrilla claim 
in the latest round of battles that ended saturday the 
ussupported insurgents raided several afghan government posts 
along the road linking pakistan with the eastern afghan city of 
jalalabad said fazle akbar director of the prorebel afghan 
information and documentation center 
he said the rebels gained control of the border post at torkham 
as well as a 20mile stretch of road akbar said 
the battle for control of the highway and its military posts 
began nov 2 when moslem insurgents claimed victory at torkham and 
said they would keep the road closed until the city of jalalabad was 
in their control 
within two weeks soviet troops were flown to jalalabad from 
kabul and made a sweep of the highway recapturing torkham western 
and rebel sources said 
in the latest battle for torkham last week about 200 afghan 
soldiers defected or surrendered said wasil noor spokesman for the 
sevenparty afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered in pakistans 
border city of peshawar 
akbar said two sovietmade surfacetosurface missiles hit the 
torkham area saturday there were no immediate reports of damage or 
casualties 
the soviet union which earlier this month sent more missiles and 
mig fighter jets into afghanistan have claimed that steppedup 
attacks by guerrillas made it necessary to upgrade kabuls arsenal 
the soviets who intervened in afghanistan in 1979 in support of 
the government in kabul agreed to withdraw an estimated 100000 
troops in accordance with the unnegotiated agreement 
half the soviets troops left in august and the remaining soldiers 
were to be pulled out by feb 15 
the soviets recently suspended the troop withdrawal although 
they have promised to meet the february deadline the soviets have 
repeatedly charged that pakistan and the united states continue to 
arm the insurgents 
pakistan and afghanistan pledged to refrain from intervention in 
each others internal affairs when they signed the geneva accord 
the united states and the soviet union signed the accord as 
guarantors

four gunmen apparently angered because 
they couldnt find any wealthy drug dealers to rob opened fire on a 
group of restaurant patrons wounding six people police said sunday 
one man was in critical condition sunday with a shotgun wound in 
his chest but the other injuries were described as minor 
detective sgt dennis orourke said there have been similar 
incidents around palm beach county in recent months 
theyre targeting drug dealers he said but this isnt a 
drugrelated shooting these people are truly victims from 
everything we know up to this point i think in this case these 
people were out there innocently and they got hit 
orourke said the gunmen emerged from a car late saturday and 
forced a group of people in the restaurant parking lot to lie down 
on the ground 
witnesses said the gunmen searched the people and then 
apparently angered at not finding anything worth taking opened 
fire with a sawedoff shotgun a machine gun and a semiautomatic 
weapon 
three people inside the restaurant when the shooting began rushed 
to the doorway and were hit by pellets from the shotgun orourke 
said 
it appears like these are just some opportunists who arent 
from here and hear that if they come to town and go to 
suchandsuch a spot they can rip off local drug dealers 
orourke said 
a switchboard operator at st marys hospital in nearby palm 
beach said sunday that one man remained in critical condition after 
being shot in the chest at pointblank range with the shotgun 
the operator said another victim was released after treatment at

hoping new leads may surface the state 
attorney general has released an investigative report into the 
unsolved mystery of five babies skeletons that were decades old 
when found in a trunk five years ago 
the report quotes the woman who gave the trunk to neighbors as 
saying the person who was responsible for the bodies was no longer 
alive but the womans former coworkers said she often appeared 
pregnant though she never had children 
the skeletons were wrapped in newspapers dating between 1949 and 
1952 also in the trunk was a piece of metal that could have been an 
abortion tool they were discovered in 1983 when a somersworth 
couple who said theyd kept the trunk for the woman for about 20 
years decided to get rid of it and opened it 
pathologists determined the skeletons were about 30 years old and 
were those of newborn or not quite fullterm infants a cause of 
death never was determined and no one was arrested 
deputy attorney general jeffrey howard said his office released 
the report in hopes that someone with information about the case 
would come forward 
the investigative report detailed in the new hampshire sunday 
news focuses on shirley elizabeth fenerty thomas 68 who gave the 
trunk to the somersworth couple 
i dont have any comment for you at all thomas now living 
in lawrence mass told the newspaper 
ronald perron then somersworth police chief said he told thomas 
a pathologist believed the remains were the results of a 
babysnuffing operation 
mrs thomas then replied thats exactly what it was but the 
person responsible isnt alive anymore 
the report includes a letter from alaric faulkner an 
anthropology professor at the university of maine at orono he 
identified a 12inch steel rod found in the trunk as a section of a 
car radio antenna flattened at one end 
he said he inferred that the antenna was modified to make it into 
a tool a specific tool that simply wasnt readily come by and 
this was a deliberate effort to make do 
in this sense i have found no evidence to disprove the 
abortion tool hypothesis 
the report says thomas married in the late 1930s but was divorced 
shortly after world war ii in 1948 she began working at the general 
electric co plant in somersworth 
patrick boyle a somersworth police lieutenant during the 1983 
investigation interviewed thomas supervisor walter osgood and 
several coworkers 
osgood can definitely recall shirley thomas being pregnant on 
two separate occasions boyle wrote osgood said thomas told him 
at the time she had water tumors 
the reason he questioned her was that she would appear 
pregnant leave on a friday and would be back on a monday and 
there was no appearance of being pregnant boyle wrote 
he became suspicious after the second occurrence and requested 
that she have a company physical before returning to work she 
refused to take the physical and it was shortly thereafter that she 
left ge in 1953 boyle wrote 
the report said at least three coworkers recalled thomas 
frequently appearing to be pregnant 
there was a lot of talk among the women at ge that they 
would wonder what had happened to the children that shirley was 
giving birth to because she would never have any children boyle 
wrote 
according to the report one coworker helen parcell of dover 
said shirley was continually pregnant 
parcell the report said stated she remembers another woman 
being upset at the time because the policy at ge was that you 
couldnt work beyond six months of pregnancy and it was obvious 
shirley was going fullterm and would only be out a couple of days 
or less than two weeks 
gregory swope who was an assistant attorney general during the 
investigation said the evidence much of it based on rumor and 
hearsay was insufficient to prosecute anyone

george bushs top advisers are mostly 
longtime friends and loyalists whom he trusted for strategy during 
his campaign and to whom he now turns for advice as presidentelect 
but on monday bush will have to reach beyond this inner circle 
to try to forge a working relationship with a former political 
rival senate minority leader robert dole of kansas 
the meeting could be an early test of bushs ability to work with 
those outside his core of associates in dealing with congress 
the two are to meet for lunch in bushs vice presidential office 
in executive office building next to the white house bush was 
returning to washington on sunday after spending a fourday 
thanksgiving vacation here without meeting with any advisers 
there is one new face in bushs inner circle new hampshire gov 
john sununu who will be white house chiefof staff otherwise 
bushs closest associates are for the most part those who advised 
him during the campaign including james a baker iii nicholas 
brady lee atwater robert teeter and robert mosbacher 
some members of bushs inner circle have already been rewarded 
for their loyalty with cabinet posts including baker who will be 
secretary of state 
bush prides himself on the loyalty he showed as vice president 
for eight years to president reagan and he clearly values the trait 
in others 
baker 58 is one of bushs best friends the friendship goes 
back more than two decades to when they forged a social and 
political alliance in houston baker a lawyer and bush then an 
oil man 
when baker was grieving over the death of his first wife bush 
talked thendemocrat baker into becoming active in republican 
politics baker switched parties managed bushs 1970 senate race 
and his 1980 and 1988 presidential bids 
baker it has been widely reported could have had any job in a 
bush administration he wanted he picked state and bush announced it 
the day after the election 
another longtime bush friend already holding a cabinet post is 
treasury secretary brady whom reagan chose last august to fill the 
vacancy created when baker resigned to oversee bushs general 
election campaign 
bush who had a role in reagans choice is keeping brady 58 in 
that post in his own cabinet 
a new york investment banker the wealthy republican also 
represented new jersey in the senate from 198082 filling the term 
of democratic sen harrison williams convicted in the abscam 
bribery and conspiracy scandal 
sununu 49 was not a member of bushs inner circle previously 
but was an early and tireless campaign volunteer 
bush is known to credit sununu at least in part for his comeback 
victory in last winters new hampshire primary which coming after 
bushs defeat in iowa put him squarely on the victory trail 
sununu became one of the most active of bushs surrogate 
speakers his job as governor of a neighboring state gave him a 
convenient platform from which to blast gov michael dukakiss 
management of massachusetts which the outspoken sununu did at 
every opportunity dukakis was the democrats presidential nominee 
teeter 49 a republican pollster who worked fulltime in bushs 
campaign and is currently codirector of the bush transition team 
is another bush confidant 
sununu has offered him the job of deputy staff director however 
amid reports that he had hoped for something more prestigious 
teeter has indicated he wants more time to decide whether to accept 
the offer or return to the private sector 
atwater 37 the brash and innovative political operative who was 
bushs campaign manager is another close adviser with whom the 
presidentelect consults frequently bush has named atwater who got 
his start working for sen strom thurmond rsc as chairman of 
the republican national committee 
although atwaters combative approach and sometimes unorthodox 
tactics sometimes troubled other morecautious bush advisers the 
vice president is known to be fond of him and to seek out his 
counsel 
mosbacher is another old friend of the vice presidents from his 
texas oil days bush transition sources say he has the inside track 
on being named commerce secretary 
he was finance director for bushs campaign and frequently 
attended strategy sessions 
craig fuller 37 bushs current chiefofstaff who shares with 
teeter the job of running the transition team had been a member of 
the inner circle but has moved to its fringe with bushs selection 
of sununu to be his presidential chief of staff a job fuller had 
wanted fuller is a californian who started out in the public 
relations business before entering politics

the us drug enforcement administration admits it 
has directed local law enforcement agencies nationwide to stage 
phony drug seizures and generate false news reports about them to 
help dea agents gain the confidence of drug lords 
dea spokesman maurice hill in washington dc said the 
technique is employed in high drug traffic areas across the country 
including florida and texas the houston chronicle reported sunday 
its a procedure that is used but i cant begin to tell you 
with what frequency hill told the newspaper its not a new 
technique i can tell you that 
staging bogus seizures and feeding the information to reporters 
apparently came into practice several years ago to resolve a problem 
for undercover drug agents posing as cocaine importers for colombian 
drug lords according to the chronicle 
often the dea operatives posing as middlemen deliver the drugs 
to local dealers according to instructions from colombian exporters 
they then keep the shipment under surveillance in the hope of 
intercepting it before it hits the streets officials said 
but the dea sometimes ensures that drugs never reach the street 
another way the newspaper reported by having local authorities 
seize the drugs before they are delivered to the local dealers in 
some cases even the officers making the seizures dont realize that 
busts were planned in advance by their superiors 
newspaper clippings on the fake seizures help convince the 
traffickers that the seizures are for real according to the 
chronicle which determined that at least two highly publicized 
seizures in the houston area had been staged 
the colombians the only way theyll believe you is to show 
them the stuff drugs the money or the newspaper clips hill 
said 
harris county sheriff johnny klevenhagen whose office cooperated 
in at least two staged seizures said local police agencies use the 
tactic only at the request of the dea he praised the bogus seizures 
as very productive in taking illicit drugs off the street 
he added that withholding information is a common police 
procedure and that it does not constitute lying for officers to 
withhold the true origin of drugs when discussing a staged seizure 
while many law enforcement agencies defend the ruses on grounds 
that they preserve investigations and protect agents journalists 
say the scams raise ethical questions about government deception of 
the news media and the public 
if the dea is willing to lie to the media and public about this 
issue what else might they be willing to lie about asked 
chronicle managing editor tony pederson 
there seems to have been no accountability in the entire 
process pederson added at least some type of judicial review 
has always been necessary for other elements of law enforcement 
deception the key example being wiretaps but who if anyone has 
reviewed this process 
paul larocque an assistant journalism professor at southern 
methodist university in dallas asked how can the public trust 
what they read in the paper if the paper has been converted to an 
arm of government 
the newspaper described two phony seizures in the houston area 
in 1984 dea agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into 
harris country then abandoned the van containing the contraband at 
a prearranged roadblock set up by the texas department of public 
safety the chronicle reported on aug 2 1984 the public safety 
department alerted news reporters that troopers had found a cache of 
drugs described at the time as one of texas largest seizures 
on sept 29 of this year 60 kilograms of cocaine was planted in 
an abandoned car at another spot in harris county and left to be 
discovered by deputy sheriffs who notified reporters 
alan spears one of the state troopers who made the 1984 seizure 
said he never was told that it was staged 
the poor little officer who finds the stuff thinks hes going 
to be named officer of the year the newspaper quoted a source as 
saying sometimes you have to push them with a stick to find the 
stuff

a congressional panel has expanded its 
investigation of security and personnel problems to include the los 
alamos nuclear weapons laboratory after a senior computer operator 
there was arrested on marijuana charges a house aide said sunday 
as part of the investigation rep john dingell dmich has 
asked for the cooperation of energy secretary john s herrington 
whose department owns the laboratories at los alamos nm and 
livermore calif both are being scrutinized 
the department also has been plagued by problems that have shut 
down production at two major nuclear weapons materials laboratories 
the savannah river plant in aiken sc and the feed materials 
production center in fernald ohio production has stopped on two 
key weapons materials tritium and plutonium 
dingell chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations has asked why the management at 
lawrence livermore abruptly halted an undercover investigation that 
turned up the names of 127 employees suspected of using or dealing 
drugs 
the investigation was expanded to los alamos following the arrest 
on oct 12 of a senior computer operator allegedly carrying 207 
pounds of marijuana in his truck according to a dingell aide 
jeffrey hodges 
the new york times which reported the expanded investigation in 
its sunday editions identified the computer operator as david 
blossom 36 and quoted an energy department spokesman as saying 
that blossom held a highlevel security clearance 
energy department spokesmen could not be reached by telephone in 
washington or at regional offices in san francisco or albuquerque 
authorities also are investigating the failure of livermore 
managers to investigate the disappearance of a chemist ronald k 
stump hodges said there were suspicions that stump had been 
embezzling from lawrence livermore 
he had extremely high level clearance and the lab appeared not 
to be doing anything said hodges 
both labs deal in extremely sensitive classified information as 
well as nuclear materials and very sophisticated computers said 
hodges it is disturbing if there is any kind of drug problem 
we received what we feel was very solid information we are not 
just going on a fishing investigation we are in the initial stages 
of an investigation just how extensive remains to be determined we 
are not making any kind of determination that there is extensive 
drug use at los alamos lab but we are looking into it

opposition party supporters seized city halls 
throughout the state of michoacan and demanded the resignation of 
the governor a member of the ruling party officials said sunday 
democratic front supporters occupied 19 city halls saturday 
afternoon to force the ouster of gov luis martinez villicana 
according to a state government statement villicana is a member of 
the governing institutional revolutionary party 
the government newspaper el nacional quoted marciano razo 
amezcua leader of the democratic front in michoacan as saying that 
villicana had squandered the public treasury and fomented 
political hatred in the southwestern state 
the newspaper quoted razo amezcua as saying the seizures were 
unrelated to the dec 1 inauguration of presidentelect carlos 
salinas de gortari 
salinas was the institutional revolutionary partys victorious 
candidate in the bitterly contested july 6 elections which 
opposition leaders said were plagued by fraud 
the presidential runnerup democratic front candidate cuauhtemoc 
cardenas won the most votes in michoacan his home state although 
the governing party has not lost a presidential election since it 
was founded in 1929 its margin of victory in the last election was 
its smallest ever 
an official in the michoacan state press office paper said the 
city halls were seized by members of the authentic revolutionary 
party part of the democratic front coalition the official who 
spoke to the associated press on condition his name be withheld 
said there had been no violence 
we are negotiating with them even bringing them food said 
the official speaking by telephone from morelia the state capital 
about 130 miles west of mexico city 
the official said that the municipal buildings seized were all in 
small towns and that most of the occupying groups also were small 
he said only 10 people were at the city hall in tocumba but about 
800 had occupied the building at zacapu 
it was unclear sunday how many city halls remained occupied 
police in tocumba and jiquilpan said that their city halls were not 
occupied sunday afternoon but that crowds were gathered outside 
the state official in morelia said that several attempted 
occupations had failed 
state authorities will not and cannot accept this insane 
pressure nor any other provocation state government secretary 
genevevo figueroa zamudio said in a statement 
figueroa zamudio accused opposition supporters of releasing 
prisoners from some city jails and said he thought the seizures only 
were the first of a series of provocations planned by the 
opposition 
what the opposition wants said figueroa zamudio is to provoke 
a vigorous response from authorities that could be painted as 
repressive thus making themselves martyrs and victims 
that they will not get the statement said 
opposition senator cristobal arias said the only objective of the 
protests was to achieve martinez villicanas dismissal the mexico 
city newspaper la jornada reported 
the magazine proceso which frequently criticizes the government 
ran an article on martinez villicana in its latest issue dubbing 
him the unpopular governor of michoacan he was elected in 1986

of state george p shultzs move on saturday to deny arafat a visa 
to speak before the un general assembly in new york next month 
shultz said he would not grant arafat a waiver of us policy 
against giving visas to terrorists arafat the chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization knows of condones and lends 
support to acts of terrorism shultz said 
asked whether he thought the plo continued to sponsor terrorism 
reagan said i think there was enough to justify not granting a 
waiver he said it would have been wrong to give a visa to arafat 
who last spoke to the united nations in 1974 
i think the other way would have sent out the wrong signal 
that we are patsies reagan said at point mugu naval air station 
near here as he boarded air force one to return to washington from 
his thanksgiving holiday 
but reagan said he was not involved in the decision 
though he agreed with shultz reagan said you recognize that 
officially it didnt make any difference whether i did or not 
because under the law that is the province of the secretary of 
state 
presidentelect george bush was not consulted about shultzs 
decision spokesman stephen hart told reporters asked if bush 
supported the action hart said i dont have any direct comment 
on the situation from him 
hart added it was an administration decision and he has been a 
loyal supporter of the administration 
reagan meantime said us officials are available and are 
willing to negotiate at any time for peace in the middle east 
we are the ones with the peace plan 
arab spokesmen have criticized the us decision to deny arafat a 
visa calling it a big mistake arafat said he will ask the united 
nations to move its session on palestinian issues to geneva 
switzerland 
three democratic senators seeking to be elected majority leader 
by senate colleagues this week also said they agreed with shultzs 
action the three daniel k inouye of hawaii j bennett johnston 
of louisiana and george mitchell of maine said they did not 
believe the united states was caving into pressure from the israelis 
by denying arafat the visa 
the united states should indicate to one and all that we stand 
against terrorism and i think this was a very dramatic way of doing 
it inouye said in a joint appearance with the others on nbcs 
meet the press 
the plo has members who are engaged actively in terrorism 
and as long as that organization does i dont think they should be 
allowed to speak at the un said johnston 
on his return to washington reagan will prepare for his dec 7 
session with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in new york in 
midweek reagan will meet with his designated successor vice 
president george bush who will also take part in the talks 
reagan has a relatively light schedule at the white house this 
week with several ceremonial events planned and the first couple 
has several social events on their calendar reagan will be the 
guest of honor at a private dinner scheduled for tuesday by 
republican members of the senate 
the president and first lady will remain in washington until dec 
23 when they will fly back to california to spend the holiday 
period socializing with friends in los angeles and palm springs 
leaving his ranch for the last time as president reagan said 
its very sentimental

president roh taewoo may name a 
civilian defense minister as part of major cabinet reshuffle in an 
effort to appease public anger over his disgraced predecessor 
officials said sunday 
government and ruling party sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said roh was expected to announce the reshuffle next 
month the reorganization could affect up to 70 senior officials 
they said 
to resolve the discontent of the opposition we realize the 
quality of the shakeup is very important and it is highly likely 
that we would have a civilian defense minister one government 
official said 
a wellplaced source in the governing democratic justice party 
confirmed the plans president roh really means business and he 
wants to reflect the oppositions view as much as possible he 
said 
in a nationally televised speech saturday roh appealed to the 
nation to forgive his disgraced predecessor chun doohwan and 
promised speedier democratic reform including a major shakeup of 
his government and party to assuage public anger over the former 
strongmans rule 
chun who stepped down in february went into rural exile last 
wednesday after coming under mounting attacks for corruption and 
abuse of power under his sevenyear rule he surrendered all his 
property worth 24 million in a gesture of atonement but has 
denied any personal guilt 
opposition leaders refused to accept rohs plea for mercy for 
chun and called for a thorough probe by the national assembly or a 
special prosecutor thousands of people have staged street protests 
to demand chuns arrest 
faced with the oppositions cool response government and 
governing party officials are hoping that major democratic reforms 
promised in rohs speech including a government shakeup will 
effect a breakthrough 
prime minister lee hyunjae is likely to be retained but most 
key economic officials held over from chuns administration 
including economic planning minister rha woongbae would be 
replaced they said 
most significant would be the possible replacement of defense 
minister oh jabok a retired fourstar general with a civilian who 
has no military background the sources said 
the last time south korea had a civilian defense minister was in 
1960 when the late president park chunghee staged a military coup 
and ousted a popularly elected government led by then prime minister 
chang myun 
since the 1960 coup south korea has been governed by former 
generals roh also an former general succeeded chun in february 
after winning elections last december but his government is closely 
identified with the military establishment 
roh also pledged to release all political prisoners reinstate 
thousands of illegally purged officials and compensate families of 
victims of the bloody government suppression of the 1980 civil 
uprising in southern kwangju city that by official count left 
about 200 people dead activists say the toll was much higher

president chadli bendjedid on sunday 
promised that political reforms would be introduced soon but said a 
multiparty political system in this rigidly controlled nation is 
not presently possible 
bendjedid made his remarks to delegates at the 6th congress of 
the ruling national liberation front delegates are expected to 
approve reforms proposed by bendjedid after violent antigovernment 
riots in october left scores dead 
this north african nation of 25 million has been a oneparty 
socialist state since independence from france in 1962 with the 
front controlling virtually every aspect of the countrys political 
and economic life 
in his speech the president said a package of reforms would be 
introduced into parliament soon but he ruled out immediate moves to 
allow legal opposition but suggested a referendum on the issue could 
be held later 
for now he urged moves to bring a wider range of people and 
opinions into the existing party structure 
a multiparty system is not presently possible bendjedid 
said the question will be put to the people if conviction of its 
need is widely shared at the present time a multiparty system is a 
danger for the unity of the nation 
bendjedid has been trying to ease the partys grip on affairs in 
recent years the effort was speeded up considerably when violent 
protests in october largely over rising prices food and housing 
shortages and unemployment broke out in algiers and other major 
cities 
official accounts said 176 were killed but unofficial reports 
said the death toll was as high as 500 
in announcing his intention to institute reform last month 
bendjedid heightened expectations many observers say that if he 
does not deliver at least some visible change renewed violence may 
erupt 
bendjedid is attempting to loosen the rigid socialist economic 
structure and force stateowned companies to perform competitively 
recently plummeting oil prices have limited the governments 
capacity to keep up financial props under unproductive businesses 
the governments program as published in the press speaks only 
in general terms it says the national liberation front must 
completely free itself from the temptation of direct and 
hegemonistic responsibilities in the state apparatus in the elected 
assemblies in the economy and in the social and professional 
organizations 
how this is to be accomplished is not clear the president is not 
without opposition both from within the stillpowerful army and 
among professional party militants nonetheless he was widely 
expected to get his way at the congress 
the twoday congress is being held in a mushroomshaped white 
arena in the suburban july 5 sports complex on the outskirts of the 
capital 
except for the first few minutes of opening formalities foreign 
reporters and most of the local press were barred from the complex 
the official news agency aps and the state radio carried reports on 
the proceedings 
the party also is electing a new secretarygeneral who under the 
constitution becomes the sole candidate in the presidential 
elections now scheduled for february it is widely presumed that 
bendjedid will seek a third fiveyear term

president raif dizdarevic moved 
sunday to try to stem the nations wave of ethnic strife by urging 
regional leaders to make peace 
he said the feud between the nations largest republic serbia 
and its province of kosovo imperils the stability of the country 
he warned of conflicts and confrontations between 
leaderships of individual republics and provinces which burden the 
overall situation in the country weaken unity and poison 
internationalist relations 
about 100000 ethnic albanians took to the streets earlier this 
month to protest attempts by serbian leader slobodan milosevic to 
take more control over kosovo the province is nominally autonomous 
but serbia exercises some power there 
ethnic albanians predominate in the province near the albanian 
border and many serbs say they are persecuted there they have 
mounted months of mass protests to support milosevics drive 
the strife has already forced two leaders in kosovo and several 
in serbias other province vojvodina to resign under pressure from 
milosevic and his backers 
in an interview with the state tanjug news agency the president 
said recent demonstrations in kosovo have seriously worsened the 
already very grave situation in the country 
he did not elaborate but protests have also sprung up this year 
over economic problems such as 15 percent unemployment and 240 
percent annual inflation in this communistruled country 
the continuation of the situation of distrust and disunity 
between leaders of serbia and kosovo cannot be tolerated any 
longer dizdarevic said 
the president did however assert a need for broad 
democratically implemented personnel replacement in kosovo the 
remarks seemed to back milosevics position 
radio belgrade quoted unofficial sources sunday as predicting 
more demonstrations if the provincial leadership purges continue and 
the two leaders are not reinstated 
yugoslavia consists of a fragile federation of six republics and 
two autonomous provinces each with its own government and party 
structure some of the other republics and their nationalities fear 
and resent serbias importance 
the decentralized system of government was devised in the late 
president titos 1974 constitution to prevent one republic from 
gaining sway over the others 
the most recent eruption of ethnic violence in kosovo was in 
1981 when at least nine people died when an estimated 40000 ethnic 
albanians clashed with police the protesters were demanding that 
kosovo become a fullfledged yugoslav republic

roman catholic archbishop raymond hunthausen 
whose liberal views on church policy have put him at odds with the 
vatican heads to rome this week for a visit with pope john paul ii 
many catholics in the 300000member seattle archdiocese are 
hopeful the vatican will dissolve a threemember commission that has 
been reviewing hunthausens leadership 
there are a lot of people who hope there will be some closure 
to this whole process or issue said russell scearce archdiocese 
spokesman 
in 1985 the vatican removed hunthausens authority in several 
major areas accusing him of being lax in granting church 
annulments general absolution of sins and letting homosexuals meet 
in church facilities 
an auxiliary bishop donald wuerl was assigned to hold primary 
authority in those areas within the archdiocese 
the discipline was unprecedented in the american church and 
distressed many us bishops the action also sparked extensive 
protests particularly among priests and lay people in seattle 
hunthausen and many others called the splitauthority arrangement 
humiliating and unworkable 
in the spring of 1987 hunthausens authority was restored wuerl 
was reassigned and the rev thomas murphy was named coadjutor 
archbishop murphy is traveling with hunthausen to rome 
the commission consisting of catholic cardinals of new york 
chicago and san francisco was appointed last year to continue a 
review of hunthausen the cardinals have met five times with him 
the trip which was scheduled for monday through friday is a 
regularly scheduled one that each catholic bishop makes every five 
years to deliver a report to the pope

killing their two young sons by placing them in a 1300degree 
foundry ladle said she has forgiven him and wants to resume a quiet 
life together 
susan dobben 29 said she has chosen to look forward rather 
than reflect on the grisly event 
she sat in a car on thanksgiving day 1987 while her husband 
bartley james dobben 27 took their children into the muskegon 
foundry where he worked he told her he wanted to pick up a bible 
and show off his workplace to the children 
while she waited he placed bartley joel 2 and peter david 15 
months in the hot foundry ladle 
dobben had previous been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and 
paranoid 
on the day the children died this was not the bart i knew 
she said he wasnt taking his medicine prescribed for 
schizophrenia and paranoia that was it that was it we may end up 
having to move away from here but i want him home with me 
she gave birth to their third son jacob in july 
mrs dobben said earlier this month that she has had to deal with 
criticism over how she has handled the ordeal forgiving her husband 
and ending divorce proceedings he initiated in april 1987 
one of my friends told me if i stopped the divorce id have 
the whole community against me she said but i couldnt live 
with myself if i did people who knew him before will understand 
even therapists have suggested she was too understanding 
one of the first counselors in ypsilanti told me that i 
couldnt just forgive him she said i asked him why not i 
said youre telling me i cant be a christian i cant forgive 
more than a year after the event mrs dobben still is unable to 
call bartley joel and peter david by name she refers to them as 
the kids 
as difficult as the ordeal has been it promises to intensify 
when bart dobben goes on trial next year on two open counts of 
murder his trial was to have started nov 29 but was postponed at 
least until late january 
both sides said they hadnt received psychiatric tests and were 
unable to prepare for what could be a lengthy trial 
dobben is confined in the michigan center for forensic psychiatry 
near ypsilanti 
terry nolan dobbens courtappointed attorney has said he will 
maintain dobben was innocent by reason of insanity 
mrs dobben said she would tell the court the man who killed her

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said the united states is violating its un treaty by preventing 
plo chief yasser arafat from speaking to the general assembly 
he warned that the us decision could hamper middle east peace 
efforts 
arab diplomats meanwhile said they have enough votes to move 
the session from new york to geneva so arafat can address the world 
body on the palestinian issue 
perez de cuellar in a statement released through a spokesman 
said the decision to deny arafat a visa to enter the country runs 
counter to the 1947 agreement under which the united states promises 
not to interfere in un matters 
the secretarygeneral regrets the denial of the visa 
application of mr yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization by the us authorities said spokesman 
francois giuliani sunday night 
such a decision is incompatible with the obligations of the 
host country under the headquarters agreement if maintained this 
action is likely to complicate and render more difficult the further 
debates on the question of palestine and the situation in the middle 
east in the current session of the general assembly 
this would be unfortunate at a time when in the view of the 
secretarygeneral the recent meeting of the palestine national 
council in algiers provides fresh opportunities for progress towards 
peace in the middle east giuliani said 
the palestine national council a plo parliamentinexile 
proclaimed an independent palestinian state during its meeting in 
algiers on nov 15 
it also implicitly recognized israel by endorsing a un 
resolution that guarantees all middle east states the right to exist 
in peace and promised to restrict guerrilla activity 
the plo has nonvoting observer status at the united nations and 
is a member of the arab league 
secretary of state george p shultz said saturday that arafat 
would not be allowed to attend this weeks un debate on the 
palestinian issue because of evidence that palestine liberation 
organization elements have engaged in terrorism against americans 
and others 
president reagan told reporters in santa barbara calif on 
sunday that he supported shultz decision i think the other way 
would have sent out the wrong signal that we are patsies he 
said 
but jordan and egypt agreed to spearhead the effort to reconvene 
the world body in geneva jordans official news agency reported 
also iraq has requested a meeting at noon monday of the un 
committee on relations with the host country to consider the us 
move un legal authorities also are expected to comment on the 
us decision 
reaction to the us decision from other nations was largely 
negative israeli leaders praised it but algeria egypt france 
libya norway and sweden were among nations which protested the 
decision italy summoned a us embassy official to explain the 
decision 
clovis maksoud the arab leagues un ambassador said arab 
nations felt deep anger and outrage over the us decision and 
will ask the general assembly to condemn it 
arafat wanted to enter the united states to address the un body 
in new york on thursday when debate is scheduled on the palestinian 
problem a nearly 1yearold palestinian uprising in 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip has left at least 316 
palestinians and 11 israelis dead 
but the state department rejected his visa saturday and said the 
leader of the plo knows of condones and lends support to 
terrorist attacks 
approval to move the un body to geneva would require a simple 
majority of the 159 members the members have regularly approved 
palestinianbacked resolutions by an overwhelming majority 
i really dont see any problem of passage if the resolution 
is proposed in a reasonable manner maksoud said 
maksoud said the arab group probably would call for postponement 
of debate on palestine in the regular session scheduled to end by 
middecember and reconvene in december or january in geneva 
a source close to the arab league speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the arab diplomats will consider a legal challenge 
to the us decision when they meet monday 
moving the general assembly out of new york as a protest would be 
unprecedented 
earlier this year arab and developing nations considered moving 
the current session to geneva when a us attempt to close the plos 
un observer mission was working its way through us courts 
in march the general assembly voted 1482 to condemn the us 
attempt to evict the plo mission by attempting to enforce an 
antiterrorism law only israel joined the united states in voting 
against the resolution 
in june a us district judge ruled the antiterrorism law does 
not supercede the un headquarters agreement and struck down the 
justice departments lawsuit making the issue moot 
arafat has not commented on the us decision

a man who sued the heavymetal rock group judas 
priest for allegedly prompting his 1985 suicide attempt has slipped 
into a coma and is nearly brain dead his mother said 
phyllis vance said doctors have told her that a preliminary test 
shows her son james vance is 999 percent brain dead brain death 
occurs when all functions of the brain cease 
mrs vance said doctors also told her they were unsure what 
caused her son to slip into a coma early thursday the day he was 
scheduled to leave vance 23 remained in serious condition sunday 
at washoe medical center 
vance and his parents are suing the british band for subliminal 
messages they contend caused vance and raymond belknap 19 to 
make a suicide pact 
the two took a shotgun to a church playground in sparks nev in 
1985 and shot themselves in the head belknap died instantly 
the lawsuit which was filed by the vance and belknap families 
is pending in washoe district court district judge jerry whitehead 
last month gave cbs records 30 days to turn over the master tape of 
the groups stained glass album so it can be examined for 
subliminal messages 
cbs has said it cannot find the master tape for the 1978 album 
the judge has said the case would not go to trial without evidence 
of subliminal mesaages since music and lyrics are protected by the 
first amendment 
if subliminal messages are found the trial would focus on 
whether such hidden communications deserve the same constitutional 
protection the judge said

a girl who is at the center of a possible 
babyswap involving two distraught families turns 10 tuesday and on 
friday faces a court hearing that may possibly lead to a change of 
her identity 
ernest and regina twigg have asked a sarasota county judge to 
order genetic tests of kimberly michelle mays to determine if she is 
their biological daughter the twiggs think kimberly was switched 
shortly after birth with arlena twigg the child they reared until 
her death in august 
genetic tests showed arlena was not related to either twigg 
robert w mays who raised kimberly and thinks he is her 
biological father has refused to allow testing 
mays wants to know if the twiggs plan to seek custody before he 
even considers testing while the twiggs want testing done before 
they make that decision both issues will be taken up at fridays 
hearing 
why should we have a fight over custody before we know who 
kimberly is asked the twiggs attorney john blakely 
mays however is adamant about his refusal to allow testing 
i dont think i have to prove anything at all mays said 
if theres a oneinamilion chance its true im not going to 
gamble it on my daughter 
the twiggs filed a 100 million lawsuit in september claiming 
employees at hardee memorial hospital in wauchula had deliberately 
switched their baby two weeks later investigators and reporters 
had tracked down the only other white girl born at hardee while 
arlena was there 
that girl was kimberly mays 
the two families have little in common 
the twiggs who now live in langhorne pa are a large 
religious family used to financial hardships much of their lives 
centered on arlena who was born with a heart defect 
mays 43 a sarasota roofing supply salesman is a single father 
with enough time and money to take kimberly on frequent boating and 
skiing trips 
the twiggs see themselves as the innocent victims of a horrible 
plot and mays lives in fear that the same thing will happen to him 
it is the most incredibly horrifying thing that can happen to a 
parent said mays whose first wife and kimberlys legal mother 
barbara died of cancer in march 1981 mays later remarried and 
divorced 
weve been through death weve been through divorce in every 
case we came through together mays said of kimberly 
were totally devastated mrs twigg has said our lives 
have turned into a nightmare weve not only lost our arlena 
but also where is our own daughter 
mays describes kimberly as a good student a tomboy until 
recently when she just realized shes a little girl 
shes a wonderful little girl very active in sports 
gymnastics swimming shes very outrageous personable friendly 
loving hey can you tell this is my kid im talking about mays 
said one of her favorite places he said is vail colo where the 
two go skiing 
the twiggs married 21 years have raised a large family on 
strict christian values and limited money she is a former teacher 
and he is an amtrak clerk their seven surviving children range in

the first killer whale born in 
captivity in canada got a resounding welcome from the public but an 
expert says it would have been better if the calf had been born free 
its a pretty shallow existence said paul spong an 
internationally recognized whale expert and one of the leaders of an 
international campaign against whaling in the 1970s 
he said he hoped the 2weekold celebrity at the vancouver public 
aquarium would be freed one day 
from an outward perspective they can make a good case for 
saying were feeding them well theyre surviving theyre as 
far as we can tell happy he said 
but spong who runs a privately funded whaleresearch station on 
hanson island off vancouver island maintains that captive whales 
suffer both socially and physically 
in the wild whales travel in pods kinship groups of 15 or 20 
at speeds of at least 30 mph he said their primary sense is sonar 
hearing and a concrete pool surrounds it with an acoustic fuzz 
causing stress 
aquarium spokesman stefani hewlett said a captive life is not 
necessarily worse than one in the wild 
there will always be that bunch out there that refuses to 
believe that an animal can be thriving and comfortable and normal in 
a situation other than the wild she said adding that a large 
number of whale calves do not survive in the wild 
in captivity hewlett said whales use their sounds and their 
bodies and all their other senses and theres no indication they 
arent healthy and thriving and normal 
whale advocates in the united states have long fought against 
confining the huge mammals to perform moneymaking stunts whale 
handlers say the shows provide educational and research benefits 
the issue was renewed after orca whales at san diegos sea world 
turned on their handlers in march and november 1987 seriously 
injuring two 
critics charged that too much pressure was placed on the whales 
and on inexperienced trainers sea world president robert gault said 
at the time that the importance of entertainment was overemphasized 
and that weve taken a step back to reevaluate our safety and 
training 
sea world a profitable privately run us marine park has had 
two killer whales born in captivity the texas sea world announced 
friday the birth of a 300pound calf another baby whale born at sea 
world died of a heart defect after 11 days

soviet chess players are split over the 
swift move by one of their top woman players and the captain of the 
us chess team who tied the knot and walked out of a major 
tournament 
elena akhmilovskaya was the secondranked player on the soviet 
womens team on friday she secretly married john donaldson a 
31yearold international master from seattle donaldson served as a 
nonplaying captain for the us team 
the couple left greece on saturday as news of their marriage 
leaked out 
world champion garri kasparov dismissed the muchpublicized love 
match sunday as a private matter 
you can do what you like kasparov 25 told reporters at the 
chess olympiad a team tournament 
but another member of the soviet delegation who spoke on 
condition of anonymity suggested ms akhmilovskayas sudden flight 
from greece at a crucial stage of the championship was against her 
team 
if she had waited the soviet said she could have had a 
big wedding here at the end 
most soviets however either refused to comment or seemed 
uninformed about the details of the incident when they were 
questioned during the weekend 
donaldson and ms akhmilovskaya met during a competition in 
havana cuba in 1985 
they both attended a ussoviet friendship party on wednesday 
night a photograph of the gathering even appeared in the official 
olympiad bulletin distributed to players the morning of the wedding 
this wedding is the first consequence of the ussoviet 
friendship party said leontxo garcia a spanish chess commentator 
the early departure of ms akhmilovskaya has forced the three 
other soviet women to play in all the remaining rounds 
although the soviets have dominated womens chess with 10 
olympiad victories in 11 competitions their stranglehold is 
threatened by a trio of hungarian sisters among them is judit 
polgar the highest ranked 12yearold in history 
with one round remaining the two teams are tied for first with 
the winner to be decided in tuesdays final round 
while the soviets are virtually guaranteed the gold medals in the 
mens championship the us mens team was still battling in joint 
third place a point behind england and tied with the netherlands

the united states was hit by a flood of worldwide 
criticism on sunday for refusing to allow plo chairman yasser arafat 
to address the united nations 
france norway china and sweden urged the united states to 
reconsider the decision to deny arafat a visa while italy summoned 
a senior american diplomat and demanded an explanation 
jordan announced sunday that it will work with egypt to move this 
weeks general assembly session out of new york because of the us 
action to bar arafats entry 
secretary of state george p shultz said saturday that arafat 
would not be allowed to attend this weeks un debate on the 
palestinian issue because of evidence that palestine liberation 
organization elements have engaged in terrorism against americans 
and others 
in kuwait arafats chief deputy salah khalaf told the 
associated press the shultz statement is tantamount to an 
open call for extremism 
he said that if the united states continued to ignore palestinian 
rights the plo might reconsider its recent moderate stands 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said the decision 
violates the agreement under which new york serves as the un 
headquarters 
if maintained this action is likely to complicate and render 
more difficult the further debates on the question of palestine and 
the situation in the middle east in the current session of the 
general assembly he said through his spokesman francois giuliani 
chinas official xinhua news agency said the us refusal once 
again reveals the lack of political will on the part of the united 
states to seek a peaceful settlement of the middle east issue 
the italian foreign ministry expressed its astonishment at 
the decision and said in a statement that john holmes the deputy 
chief of mission at the us embassy in rome was called in to the 
ministry sunday and asked to explain the decision 
the french foreign ministry in a statement also criticized the 
decision it said it considered the actions of the palestine 
national council earlier this month in algiers very positive and 
worth encouraging 
the council the plos parliamentinexile announced its 
acceptance of a un resolution that guarantees all states in the 
middle east the right to exist in peace thus implicitly recognizing 
israel it also voted to restrict guerrilla activity 
the council also declared an independent state with jerusalem as 
its capital arafat was expected to ask the general assembly for 
recognition of the state 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson called the visa rejection 
unwise unreasonable and untimely 
its not reasonable that the us decides who may appear at the 
united nations andersson said in a statement 
president reagan on sunday defended the decision 
i think the other way would have sent out the wrong signal 
that we are patsies reagan said in santa barbara calif 
in israel prime minister yitzhak shamir praised the us 
decision saying it would help thwart a plo diplomatic campaign for 
recognition of the palestinian state 
this move will deprive mr arafat and the plo of the 
possibility of culminating their propaganda drive following the 
algiers conference said shamirs spokesman avi pazner 
norwegian foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg said on national 
television that his government had protested the us decision the 
national ntb news agency quoted him as saying it is not 
satisfactory that the visa policy of the united states decides who 
shall come to the world organization 
in vatican city pope john paul ii made an apparent reference to 
arafats visa application by saying on sunday that every positive 
and constructive gesture in the arabisrael conflict deserves a 
corresponding response 
the road of dialogue in the search for peace is certainly 
arduous and difficult but every obstacle that is removed should be 
considered worthy of inspiring other corresponding gestures

mayor w wilson goode has vowed to bring 
the economic wheels to a halt in this city and close cityfunded 
agencies unless barriers that exclude blacks and women are removed 
what i want to do by the time i leave office is remove all 
those signs that say for white males only in this city goode 
said in an interview with the philadelphia inquirer published 
sunday for too long this city has been a closed club white 
women minority women and minority men have been excluded from the 
club 
goodes recent efforts to increase the share of minorityowned 
companies in city contracts has drawn criticism from some who 
contend he is pursuing a social goal while ignoring the principles 
of competitive bidding and the impact on the citys taxpayers 
goode with three years left in his second term responded by 
saying he was responsible for helping reverse what he described as a 
pattern of discrimination that has gone unchecked in prior 
administrations 
goode the citys first black mayor said he intended to pursue 
his goal with a lot of aggressiveness 
in 1982 the city council overrode a veto by thenmayor william 
green and set goals of 15 percent of city contracts for 
minorityowned firms and 10 percent for companies owned by women 
this year the mayor has reset the guidelines on two projects 
raising the minority requirements to 35 percent on a 26 million 
contract and to 30 percent on a 90 million contract the first 
contract was never awarded because of financial and legal problems 
at one of the firms the second was awarded but the cost has risen 
by 17 million over the citys initial projection 
goode said he had privately pushed for change since 1984 the 
year after he was elected but said he was speaking out now because 
he had met resistance 
in august goode declared that all agencies that receive city 
funding would have to comply with the city policy 
if it means stopping the operation of some of these agencies 
for six months we will stop the operations for six months goode 
said 
some city and state legislators have sued the city contending 
taxpayers were being robbed of the savings that come from fully 
competitive bidding 
if you can arbitrarily change the guidelines you can dictate 
who the bidder is going to be and defeat the whole notion of 
competitive bidding said hugh bracken the attorney representing 
the legislators he said the situation creates a real possibility 
of abuse 
white contractors also have complained they are being forced to 
pair up with minority firms without knowing how they perform

trenna klees first exposure to indoor dirt 
bicycle racing was when she went to see her 10yearold son compete 
now she is out on the track racing against girls not much older 
than her son 
mrs klee 35 entered her first national competition at the 
american bicycle associations bmx grand nationals in oklahoma city 
over the weekend the competition featured racers ranging in age 
from 5 to the 50s but those were the men 
the oldest female racer besides mrs klee was 17 
the wichita kan mother competes in the 13 and over girls 
cruiser class 
the girls are real sweet to me but not patronizing they seem 
really excited that a mom would be racing in it mrs klee said 
she entered three girls motos or rounds but didnt win a race 
to qualify for the quarterfinals but she said she got some valuable 
racing experience 
i fell in the first moto coming over the first big jump it is 
big and it is scary she said ive never fallen this was a 
first and i did not like it 
the racers wearing helmets and heavyduty garb go around an 
indoor track that includes hills higher than i am tall said the 
5foot3inch mrs klee she races in a borrowed uniform that her 
neighbors son outgrew 
mrs klee says shes not sure how her son feels about her taking 
up racing after he gave it up for computers but she says her 
husband is thrilled 
he says one way or another hes going to get a racer out of 
this family mrs klee said 
mrs klee began racing in september 
the first couple of times around the track i thought i was 
going to die she said i said what have i gotten myself 
into but if you can ride a bike you can do this 
she says she plans to be back at the national competition next 
year but she hopes by then to be able to interest enough women 
she needs at least four to have a separate womens class 
its certainly a lot more fair to race someone in their 30s 
she said

lou kahns cant forget the sound of 
footsteps that night a decade ago when 40000 people marched to city 
hall to mourn the deaths of the mayor and a popular gay city 
supervisor 
it was soothing measured very powerful the most beautiful 
sound i have ever heard in my life said the 32yearold financial 
consultant 
no one spoke at all not even a whisper he said in 
everybodys hand was a candle the streets glistened and the sky 
seemed darker than i can ever remember we all held hands or hugged 
each other because we all felt so terribly alone and terribly 
terribly hurt 
on nov 27 1978 former city supervisor dan white crawled 
through a basement window at city hall and shot to death populist 
mayor george moscone and supervisor harvey milk the nations first 
openly gay elected city official 
led by a doleful drum beat 10000 people recreated a decadeold 
march of mourning on sunday night 
they spoke up for us back then and now were showing up for 
them said stephen wickes 36 as the crowd began its 1mile trek 
from the largely homosexual castro district to city hall 
folksinger joan baez who had stood on the steps of city hall the 
night moscone and milk were killed and led 40000 grieving people in 
a tearful version of amazing grace joined relatives friends 
and a host of local and state politicians at the civic center plaza 
for a tribute 
one group carried a banner reading we remember harvey and 
george dozens of people lined the sidewalks some of them in 
tears many of them joining in on the spur of the moment after 
marchers passed 
the killings occurred as moscone pressured by milk and his newly 
formed gay political machine was a halfhour away from announcing 
he would not reappoint white to the seat on the board of supervisors 
from which white had impetuously resigned 17 days before 
by appointing a liberal neighborhood activist instead moscone 
could create the first liberal majority on the 11member commission 
but when moscone broke the news to the former policeman white 
pulled out a revolver and shot the 49yearold mayor four times 
white then walked down the hall reloaded the gun and asked 
milk 48 a former wall street analyst to step into whites old 
office where he emptied the gun into milk 
as san franciscans we remember them as politicians of course 
but more importantly as people who embodied that very special thing 
we consider the spirit of san francisco said cleve jones a gay 
activist and former aide to current mayor art agnos they were 
intensely likeable men who in retrospect we always remember smiling 
we remember them laughing 
following by nine days the horror of the deaths of more than 900 
members of san franciscobased peoples temple in the jungle of 
guyana the killings plunged the city into what writer warren 
hinckle dubbed the night of dark intent 
despite the bizarre nature of those events nothing prepared the 
city for the voluntary manslaughter verdict white received six 
months later it provoked a riot by 5000 people who stormed city 
hall burning police cars and hurling bricks through windows to 
protest what they saw as leniency 
the prosecutor had sought firstdegree murder convictions but 
defense lawyers in what came to be called the twinkie defense 
convinced jurors that white suffered from diminished mental 
capacity partially caused by his ingestion of junk food 
white whose campaign literature said he would not be forced 
out of san francisco by splinter groups of radicals social deviates 
and incorrigibles served only five years of his 7year 
eightmonth sentence he committed suicide by carbon monoxide 
poisoning in his garage on oct 21 1985 19 months after getting 
out of prison 
san franciscos homosexual community has elevated milk to the 
status of a martyr often viewing his death as the result of an 
unspoken conspiracy of intolerance 
californias leftliberal political machine long centered in san 
francisco has equally touted the memory of moscone 
george was unique because he wanted to bring about in san 
francisco a political situation where all people had input said 
former police chief charles gain who resigned a year after the 
killings

a new opec accord to limit production 
appeared to be unraveling sunday after saudi arabia pressed for a 
15abarrel benchmark price three dollars less than the cartels 
official level officials said 
iran is not going to accept this type of idea said feredoon 
barkeshli a senior iranian delegate to the winter conference of the 
13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the proposal he said can totally sabotage the agreement 
he said algeria nigeria and libya also opposed changing the 18 
benchmark barkeshli said he met for two hours sunday with opec 
president rilwanu lukman of nigeria but said afterward i am very 
pessimistic 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said the proposed 15 
benchmark was intended to prevent further price erosion 
what we wanted is even to eliminate a reference to the 18 
just in case under the best of circumstances the price might 
even go beyond 18 he told reporters late sunday 
nazer insisted he would not back down from his stand 
irans oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh announced in tehran 
earlier sunday that he would accept the deal to cut the cartels 
output and drive up prices 
but barkeshli said aghazadeh agreed to a preliminary draft that 
would retain opecs 18 benchmark 
the announcement last week that the ministers tentatively reached 
a new output pact sent prices higher brent north sea crude rose 
165 a barrel to close friday at 1442 
prices have been running 4 or more below the 18 target due to a 
world oil glut 
each 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an 
increase of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices although 
oil companies do not always pass along the full increase 
the agreement which would set member quotas would cut opec 
production from the current estimated 225 million barrels a day to 
185 million barrels a day in the first half of next year 
barkeshli told reporters that saudi arabia made two proposals 
sunday morning 
the iranian delegate said one would set a target price at 15 a 
barrel and the other would set a price band ranging from 15 to 18 
this he said is a major divergence from opec resolutions so 
far 
were not going to concede to any new elements whatsoever he 
said 
barkeshli said the plan worked out with aghazadeh did not have 
anything like 15 and that the iranian cabinet approved the 
original draft with the 18 reference price 
aghazadeh left vienna friday to try to sell the package to his 
government barkeshli said aghazadeh will not return to vienna 
the opec ministers had been scheduled to resume formal 
discussions sunday but they were postponed until monday 
the price issue in the accord which would replace one arranged 
in 1986 is critical many opec countries need as much money as 
possible from their oil sales 
iran and iraq want additional revenues to rebuild their 
economies which were badly damaged in their 8yearold war they 
agreed to an august ceasefire 
under the new agreement iran and iraq would each get the same 
quota of 264 million barrels a day 
the issue of parity had been a sticking point in discussions of 
the cartels winter meeting which began nov 21 iraq has been 
demanding an equal production ceiling with iran aghazadeh had 
repeatedly said no 
saudi arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter of 
the cartels total output 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela

the frontrunner in venezuelas dec 4 
presidential race will call for a rescheduling of the nations 204 
billion public foreign debt if elected a source close to the 
candidate said sunday 
social democrat carlos andres perez who was venezuelas 
president between 1974 and 1979 and is campaigning for a second 
term will necessarily have to call for new negotiations with 
creditor banks said senator carlos canache mata one of perezs 
closest aides 
perez consistently has led opinion polls since the campaign began 
last may 
the nations new president will take over feb 3 nearly a year 
after venezuela signed a second public debt repayment accord 
involving 461 creditor banks mostly from the united states 
canache who is one of the top leaders of the government social 
democratic party accion democratica said the current 14year 
repayment period which extends through the end of this century 
should go well into the next century 
payments he said in a sunday interview with the newspaper el 
nacional should be stretched out over a period of 25 to 30 years 
plus a threeyear grace period 
perez himself has said repeatedly that under the current 
conditions venezuela cannot pay its debt canaches remarks 
apparently signaled for the first time the candidates desire for 
the extension of the repayment period and the for a yetundisclosed 
fixed interest rate he would request from creditors 
perez main contender social christian eduardo fernandez of the 
copei party also has said the current agreement should be improved 
but has offered no details on his plans 
this year venezuela paid about 5 billion to service its public 
and private sector debts which total about 33 billion venezuela 
is latin americas fourth largest debtor after brazil mexico and 
argentina 
canache said that because of the lack of new loans from private 
banks venezuela is in no capacity to pay for november 
installments he would not mention any figure 
growing imports and debt service have created a balance of 
payments gap of 3 billion this year 
the outgoing social democratic government of president jaime 
lusinchi is attempting to obtain 1 billion in december by selling 
seven years worth of receivables of its oil exports 
canache did not say whether the inability to pay november 
installments would be carried over in december 
the government has said consistently it intends to abide by the 
current accord and leave to the incoming administration the decision 
on whether to call for new debt negotiations 
canache suggested that before requesting new terms perez would 
begin talks with other latin american debtors such as brazil mexico 
and argentina perez would simultaneously try to involve creditor 
countries especially the united states japan and european nations 
in negotiations with private banks and multilateral financial 
organizations

the pressure to force george bush to renege on 
his promise not to raise taxes began months ago but it turned 
fierce within hours of his election as president he must go back on 
his word they said 
they can be just about anyone so diverse is the they 
group it includes financial leaders and labor leaders tightfisted 
republicans and liberal democrats conservative and ultraliberal 
economists 
so uniform is the cry it would seem to leave bush with no 
options but it isnt so he has several of them 
most cynical of them is to give in and then blame congress to 
fight a battle worthy of his promise knowing that in the end he will 
submit and while still denouncing higher taxes allow them to be 
imposed 
another is only slightly less cynical but it has been used over 
and over in recent years it is a creative technique an art that 
raises taxes without ever using the word tax relying instead on 
a string of elusive euphemisms 
why bring up the nasty t word when user fees revenue 
enhancers earmarking mandated benefits education premiums and 
other nontax taxes have already been imposed and can be reused and 
extended 
revenue enhancers for example raise funds without any 
legislation or attendant controversy laws already on the books 
simply are employed more intensively congress is not involved 
controversy is kept to a minimum 
revenue enhancing at the internal revenue service for instance 
means tightening procedures hiring more auditors scrutinizing 
returns challenging taxpayers and carrying more disputes to court 
aside from these two procedures however the bush team has still 
another option and that is to hold firm 
such a stand would seem to require fortifying the white house and 
building a moat around it because the tax increase crowd is armed 
for the battle with statistics moral preaching and a near consensus 
of economic thinking 
any economic consensus is a frightening thing seeking to trample 
and ridicule other notions uncertain mercurial changeable most of 
the time economists in consensus constitute a rigid selfrighteous 
intellectual bloc 
but there is another side to the budget deficit controversy and 
it is likely to emerge more forcefully over the next few weeks in 
response to the onslaught from advocates of a tax increase 
stephen moore of the heritage foundation a washingtonbased 
conservative think tank that has been highly influential in the 
reagan administration has challenged the consensus 
moore maintains that the deficit already is being reduced by 
economic growth and that if congress holds spending to a rate of 
less than 4 percent a year the entire deficit will be eliminated in 
1993 without any new taxes 
the facts are on bushs side says moore there is no 
reason for him to retreat from his pledge 
paul craig roberts former white house adviser and now with 
georgetown universitys center for strategic and international 
studies also contends the deficit already is being overcome 
in a column for business week magazine roberts says federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and others who claim we cannot 
outgrow the deficit are in obvious contradiction to the fact that 
we have been doing precisely that 
he also cites the view of robert eisner a professor at 
northwestern university and president of the american economic 
association that the budget deficit might even be a product of 
incorrect measurements 
it is conceivable in fact that once the bush team marshals its 
economic arguments it might not even have to consider any option but 
that of standing firm
