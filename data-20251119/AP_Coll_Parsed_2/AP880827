a judge has decided comedian joe 
piscopos celebrity good will can be counted as an asset in 
dividing property with his wife in a divorce settlement 
it is a quantifiable asset just as in any other profession 
superior court judge isabel b stark said wednesday but she added 
that the way celebrity status should be quantified is somewhat 
different from a partnership or corporation 
one of piscopos attorneys gary n skoloff said thursday it 
was only the second time a judge in a divorce case had placed a 
value on celebrity status a judge in new york last march made a 
similar ruling regarding actress marisa berenson he said 
skoloff who vowed to appeal the ruling said it was unclear how 
to value piscopos celebrity from the judges oral opinion 
he said he would have to wait for a written opinion but added 
that under his understanding of what the judge had said nancy 
piscopo would be eligible to receive roughly 50000 
piscopo is a onetime star of nbcs saturday night live who 
has appeared in several movie comedies including wise guys 
and also appears in a series of beer commercials he and his wife 
separated three years ago

republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle still the 
center of controversy on the campaign circuit shrugged off his 
latest problem resume inflation as democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis planned to address a civil rights rally of 
thousands in the nations capital 
meanwhile vice president george bush on friday lashed back at 
dukakis for his criticism of the reagan administrations handling 
of drug problems and took up the defense of his embattled running 
mate whom he had not mentioned by name in two previous days of 
campaigning 
dukakis pondering todays commemoration of the 25th anniversary 
of the march on washington led by the rev martin luther king jr 
said of the 1963 event 
it was one of the great historic events in the history of this 
country and it came at a time when black people and minority 
citizens were facing terrible discrimination it was an historic 
event which triggered a civil rights revolution in this country 
the massachusetts governor who spent friday attending to state 
business was to march in the procession today and speak at a 
rally afterward among those planning to attend were coretta scott 
king the widow of the slain civil rights leader and jesse 
jackson dukakis onetime rival for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
jackson lauded the democratic ticket of dukakis and sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas saying we do have a choice and chance in 
november dukakis and bentsen represent an alternative a chance to 
change 
neither bush nor quayle had responded to an invitation to join 
the commemoration said ofield dukes a spokesman for march 
organizers 
bushs schedule for today called for him to remain in his 
adopted state of texas while quayle was expected to make several 
stops in california 
quayle buoyed by a warm welcome from the veterans of foreign 
wars earlier this week was ready to focus on issues and move on 
from questions about whether he joined the national guard in 1969 
at the height of the vietnam war to duck combat duty and whether 
he had help from his influential family in getting into the guard 
but another question arose friday this one concerning what he 
was doing the following two years 1970 and 1971 
the indiana senator acknowledged friday that an entry on his 
official biography that portrays him as indianas chief consumer 
investigator for those two years was inaccurate but he said 
his senate staff was responsible for the document and that the 
matter was unimportant 
all of these issues are side events many of them are 
untrue quayle said in billings mont regarding reporters 
questions about his erroneous biography and other issues that have 
dogged his campaign 
the law creating the consumer unit passed april 14 1971 and 
the division did not being operations until july 1 1971 indiana 
officials said quayle served as chief investigator from july until 
midseptember 
quayle also fended off questions about his academic record and 
said he would not authorize their public release 
i dont want you to go through and pore over all those 
mediocre grades i got he said 
the senator got a boost from bush who told a rally in eastern 
texas that quayle would be an outstanding vice president and 
bush later called him to discuss the campaign 
bush also told the rally that it was an insult for dukakis 
to refer to president reagans drug policies as criminal and 
absurd when thousands of federal and local law enforcement 
officials are putting their lives on the line every single day to 
stop the narcotics flow 
dukakis is the governor who vetoed the mandatory sentencing 
for drug dealers bush said he opposes capital punishment for 
drug king pins and he fought tooth and nail to keep that 
outrageous furlough program that lets murderers rapists and drug 
dealers out on appeal 
bentsen meanwhile pressed for southern votes friday by 
stressing the democratic tickets interest in maintaining americas 
military strength 
we want to build up americas military might but once again 
it has to be bipartisan cooperation he told a crowd of 1000 
arkansas democrats adding that he was fed up with republicans 
trying to portray the democrats as weak on defense 
bentsen arrived at the arkansas state democratic convention in a 
small twoengine airplane after his campaign jet was grounded in 
mississippi he was forced to cancel a trip to atlanta because of 
airplane trouble 
aircraft troubles previously created havoc with the media 
representatives attempting to follow bush on the campaign trail 
and prompted the bush campaign to change charter airlines

a navy captain whose ship failed to rescue a 
boatload of vietnamese refugees who claim they later had to resort 
to cannibalism to survive on the high seas has been relieved of his 
command and ordered to prepare for military courtmartial 
proceedings pentagon sources say 
capt alexander g balian was notified of the navys decision 
friday according to the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
balian has 10 days to appeal the decision regarding his command 
of the uss dubuque to vice adm george w davis jr the chief of 
surface ships in the pacific fleet because balians loss of 
command for cause is considered a permanent blight on an 
officers career any appeal will go directly to the chief of naval 
personnel in washington 
balian 48 was relieved temporarily of his command of the 
dubuque on aug 13 pending the outcome of a navy investigation 
that investigation ended a week ago with balian being charged with 
dereliction of duty and ordered to appear last tuesday at an 
admirals mast a closeddoor administrative proceeding in which an 
admiral serves as the lone judge 
balian exercised his right to refuse the admirals mast forcing 
the navy to decide whether it wanted to escalate the matter to the 
level of a courtmartial or to simply drop the charges 
the sources said davis served balian on friday with notice of 
his loss of command and ordered an article 32 investigation 
balian has been told to begin preparing for an article 32 
hearing the rough equivalent of a civilian grand jury proceeding 
and the first step in a military courtmartial the sources said 
however a spokesman for the naval surface force us pacific 
fleet in san diego disputed the sources saying the navy still was 
investigating the incident and hadnt decided yet whether to take 
further action 
senior chief petty officer steve hinney said rear admiral 
geoffery l chesbrough commander of the naval surface group 
western pacific has been ordered to direct an investigation of the 
matter and make a determination as to whether or not any kind of 
further action is warranted 
balian has been charged with violating a general navy regulation 
by wrongfully failing to render appropriate assistance to 
vietnamese refugees found on the south china sea on june 9 1988 
in danger of being lost 
a second count accuses him of violating standing operational 
orders for the pacific fleet which require a commanding officer 
to aid and rescue refugees encountered at sea in lifeendangering 
circumstances 
the navy also alleges balian was derelict in the performance 
of those duties in that he negligently failed to investigate 
sufficiently and render appropriate assistance as it was his 
duty to do 
the dubuque an amphibious landing ship encountered the 
boatload of vietnamese refugees while steaming to duty in the 
persian gulf the navy has said the dubuque gave the refugees 
several hundred pounds of food and water and navigational aids but 
did not take them aboard because balian judged the refugee craft 
was seaworthy 
the boat people eventually were rescued off the coast of the 
philippines and taken to a refugee camp there where reports of 
murder and cannibalism surfaced 
some survivors have been quoted as saying they ate fellow 
passengers to stay alive after they encountered the dubuque two 
victims reportedly died of starvation but three others allegedly 
were murdered through drowning and then eaten 
the survivors charge the dubuque refused to take them aboard 
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure 
and starvation

the department of energy says construction of 
the superconducting super collider will require about 100 miles of 
new roads if the massive atom smasher is built in arizona or 
colorado 
by contrast the project will need only eight to 10 miles of new 
roads if it is built in illinois or michigan but up to 2800 acres 
of valuable wetlands could be affected by construction work at the 
michigan site 
these were among findings presented in a draft environmental 
impact report released friday by the department as part of a 
process expected to result in selection of a site for the super 
collider early next year 
other states vying for the 44 billion research project are 
north carolina tennessee and texas 
the collider will be a 53milecircumference underground ring 
of magnets capable of whipping proton beams into each other with 20 
times the force of the worlds most powerful existing accelerator 
scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from 
studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions 
the project is expected to generate thousands of construction 
jobs provide permanent employment for as many as 3000 people and 
have an operating budget of 280 million 
supporters argue that the super collider is needed to keep the 
united states competitive in the next century while opponents say 
the project would siphon muchneeded money from other scientific 
research 
the environmental impact statement presented data about the 
colliders anticipated impact at each of the seven site 
alternatives on water resources air quality ecological resources 
socioeconomics and infrastructure 
the statement did not rank the seven sites in terms of overall 
advantages and disadvantages 
the document noted that in addition to some detrimental effects 
on environment the ssc would also have beneficial impacts at all 
of the site alternatives many job opportunities would be created 
both during construction and operations local businesses would 
also benefit 
the ssc is expected to have a beneficial impact on community 
socioeconomic and educational standards as experienced at fermilab 
a national accelerator in batavia ill where there has been an 
influx of highly trained scientists into the area it said

eastern airlines will learn tuesday whether it 
can inaugurate its september schedule calling for curtailment of 
service to 14 cities at a savings of some 57 million 
us district judge barrington d parker on friday extended his 
order preventing eastern airlines from firing some 4000 workers 
whose unions alleged in a lawsuit that easterns parent company 
texas air corp deliberately dismantled the financially troubled 
passenger carrier to rid it of organized labor 
john gallagher an attorney for eastern attempted repeatedly 
without success to get parker to elaborate on his twopage order in 
which he said the three unions suing eastern were entitled to 
relief 
gallagher complained that the airlines business was hurting due 
to news reports that parkers order had blocked the companys plans 
to end service to 14 cities 
i cant help what the newspapers are reporting parker said 
you should know better than to rely on the newspapers 
if you could tell me at this point what i am going to do on 
tuesday you are a better man than i said parker i dont 
know 
gallagher told the judge later our client is being prejudiced 
in the marketplace our client does not know what it can or cannot 
do 
parker refused to reply in detail saying only i am working 
on the opinion 
in his friday order parker essentially continued the temporary 
restraining order he issued aug 4 prohibiting eastern from firing 
the 4000 workers but not preventing the company from curtailing 
service to 14 cities 
gallagher said the september schedule set to go into effect 
next wednesday would save eastern 50 million in the change of 
schedules and 7 million in salaries 
we will appeal he said of parkers ruling 
capt jack bavis a representative of the air line pilots 
association called the judges decision a victory for 40000 
eastern employees for once justice is working for the little 
people not just the big people 
jonathan cohen an attorney for the association also considered 
parkers decision a victory 
we know now that at least the temporary restraining order will 
be extended that means 4000 jobs he said after the court 
hearing but he parker said he is considering other issues the 
tro temporary restraining order is the minimum we are 
optimistic 
asked whether eastern can close down its service in the 14 
cities cohen said the company has to be cautious they are 
operating at a risk with what they do he said he has everything 
under consideration 
earlier karen ceremsak a spokeswoman for the miamibased 
eastern said in a statement that the company believes the unions 
are not entitled to relief of any sort and we expect we will be 
filing an appeal at the appropriate time 
the statement said the airline would take no action against the 
employees pending clarifications of what our obligation will be 
under terms of the ruling 
the pilots association the international association of 
machinists and the transport workers union of america filed suit 
earlier this month accusing frank lorenzos texas air of 
deliberately taking eastern apart to get rid of organized labor at 
the carrier 
the 81page suit filed in us district court here said texas 
air was trying to undermine the unions legal right to represent 
eastern employees by transferring the airlines assets to other 
subsidiaries of the parent 
eastern which has lost about 1 billion over the past 10 years 
posted a second quarter net loss of 898 million compared with 
net income of 271 million a year earlier easterns revenue in 
the most recent quarter declined to 1 billion from 12 billion 
the eastern plan announced july 22 also calls for elimination 
of 140 of its 1225 daily flights to help cut costs 
the plan would end nearly all operations at kansas city 
easterns principal hub for the western united states and 
dramatically reduce flights at its philadelphia hub flights to 14 
cities also would be dropped under the plan 
the suit said the eastern plan violated the railway labor act 
and federal and state security laws 
the complaint charged that the transfer of some eastern air 
routes planes and airport gate rights to other subsidiaries such 
as continental was part of a scheme to weaken the iams power to 
represent eastern employees

the transportation department proposed setting 
a higher fueleconomy standard for the nations automakers but held 
out the prospect the new level would remain less than the 275 
miles per gallon voted by congress 
under a proposed rule the corporate average fuel economy 
standard would be set between 265 mpg and 275 mpg for the 1989 
and 1990 model years 
without the rule the standard would revert to the 275 mpg 
voted by congress in 1975 the standard has been set at 26 mpg 
since 1986 under an administrative exception allowed by the 
national highway traffic safety administration a branch of the 
transportation department 
two of the big three automakers praised the agencys action 
general motors corp said it would have to limit production of 
larger cars should the rule revert to 275 mpg this would give 
japanese automakers who are already planning to import more luxury 
and familysize cars with v8 and highperformance v6 engines a 
powerful competitive advantage in the larger car market segments 
a 275 mpg standard would cause the automaker to reduce 
production by 212000 vehicles at a loss of 76000 jobs in 1989 
and by 470000 vehicles with a loss of 158000 jobs in 1990 said 
john hartnett a gm spokesman 
a ford motor co spokesman bill peacock predicted artificial 
rationing of fullsized cars under a 275 mpg standard 
if relief is not granted and the standard ticks back up to 
275 then the vehicles that the industry supplies will not match 
the demand level that were getting from the public he said in 
dearborn mich 
chrysler corp however said it expects to meet the law as it 
stands now and will meet it in the coming year said a spokesman 
tony cervone 
it is really not a chrysler issue he said the companys 
cars on average are smaller than those of its larger competitors 
the 1975 fuel economy law adopted to reduce petroleum 
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices requires us 
manufacturers to meet an average fuelconsumption level of 275 mpg 
on all passenger cars they make 
the law allows the nhtsa to lower the standard below 275 mpg if 
it finds that manufacturers have made reasonable efforts to achieve 
that level 
moreover the law requires the agency to consider whether 
achieving the 275 mpg level is economically and practically 
feasible 
it was under those provisions of the law that the agency lowered 
the standard beginning in 1986 
had the agency not proposed new rulemaking on the standard it 
would have automatically reverted to 275 mpg in october for the 
1989 model year 
nhtsa scheduled a sept 14 public meeting on the proposed rule 
transportation secretary jim burnley in announcing the proposed 
rule called the fueleconomy standard a dinosaur that should be 
extinct 
the standard puts domestic manufacturers at a competitive 
disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers who have been 
building mostly small cars burnley said the agency last year 
proposed legislation that would abolish the standard 
the competitive enterprise institute a freemarket advocacy 
group which has sued the transportation department alleging the 
agency concealed the safety impact of fuel economy standards said 
that even at 265 mpg the standard would cause 1500 to 2800 more 
traffic deaths involving 1989 cars than if there were no standard 
the additional deaths would occur because the standard would 
discourage the manufacturing of larger cars and crashes of smaller 
cars tend to be more deadly the group said

former assistant attorney general theodore 
olson informed that an independent counsel will not seek perjury 
charges against him says he is glad the 2year probe has ended 
it has been a long and difficult process olson said friday 
after independent counsel alexia morrison notified him that she had 
ended her investigation into allegations that olson perjured 
himself in connection with a congressional probe into political 
manipulation of the superfund toxic wastecleanup program 
ms morrison in a statement released by her office said she 
told olson that no indictment will be sought against him 
specifically ms morrison looked into whether olson should have 
been prosecuted for perjury in connection with testimony he gave 
march 10 1983 before a house judiciary subcommittee regarding the 
withholding of epa documents 
olson now in private law practice said he has accumulated 
legal bills of between 1 million and 15 million for which he 
will seek reimbursement from the government under the law people 
investigated by independent counsels but not charged are entitled 
to collect reasonable fees 
as required by the 1978 ethics in government act under which 
independent counsels are appointed ms morrison said she will file 
her report with a special division of the us court of appeals 
that panel will have the authority to release the report she said 
ms morrison who helped begin the investigation of olson in 
april 1986 noted that olson and two others had challenged the 
constitutionality of the independent counsels in the spring of 1987 
that challenge which could have affected other independent 
counsels such as lawrence walsh the prosecutor in the irancontra 
case was unsuccessful 
the supreme court ruled june 29 that independent counsels were 
legal allowing ms morrison to continue her investigation 
the case grew out of a congressional investigation into possible 
political manipulation of the superfund created to pay for 
cleanups of toxic waste sites 
initially washington lawyer james c mckay was appointed 
special counsel on april 24 1986 by a threejudge panel of the 
us court of appeals to look into the matter he resigned the 
following month to avoid the appearance of a conflict of 
interest involving his law firm mckay said another member of his 
law firm had given advice to an interested party in the case 
ms morrison mckays deputy then took over the case 
the house judiciary committee had sought a far broader 
investigation than the one that mckay and later ms morrison were 
told by the judges to conduct 
the panel wanted a dozen current or former reagan administration 
officials investigated for denying congress access to hundreds of 
documents in 1982 and 1983 that the committee said it needed to 
investigate mismanagement by epa 
house judiciary committee chairman peter w rodino jr dnj 
said at the time that thenattorney general edwin meese iii in 
seeking an independent counsel with only limited jurisdiction had 
disregarded overwhelming evidence of other possible wrongdoing 
and appeared to have made judgments that are beyond his 
authority 
but meeses decision stuck 
former epa administrator anne gorsuch burford who resigned at 
the height of the controversy said she urged release of many of 
the documents that congress wanted but that the justice department 
overruled her 
the judiciary committee said the justice department was 
generally aware that the files congress sought contained evidence 
of political manipulation of superfund

as the deadline approaches the reagan 
administration is wrestling with a decision on whether to go back 
to court to try to close the palestine liberation organizations 
office in new york 
its a controversial decision whichever way it goes and 
ultimately president reagan is likely to have the final word 
two months ago a federal court ruled against congress and the 
justice department and said the plo observer mission at the united 
nations could not be closed under a 1947 us agreement 
establishing un headquarters in new york 
the plo information office in washington already has been put 
out of business the new york mission is the only real footing 
yasser arafats group has in the united states which shuns the plo 
as a matter of policy as a promoter of terrorism against americans 
and israelis 
the 60 days allowed for an appeal to a higher court regarding 
the new york office runs out monday 
the issue confronting reagan who is vacationing in california 
is whether to authorize an appeal of the decision in order to try 
to reverse it or to let the deadline pass which would mean 
letting the ruling stand 
so far the administration has not made a decision said amy 
brown a justice department spokeswoman 
reagan apparently is under conflicting pressure secretary of 
state george p shultz opposed the closing of the mission in the 
first place while former attorney general edwin meese iii 
attempted to enforce congress overwhelming decision to shut it 
down 
meeses successor attorney general richard thornburgh is 
understood to favor appealing judge edmund palmieris june 29 
decision while some of reagans white house advisers evidently 
want to drop the controversial subject by not appealing 
one of the questions plo foes are asking is whether thornburghs 
legal views are reaching the president in california 
brown said thornburgh was in touch with the white house but she 
declined to say whether his opinion had reached reagan she also 
declined to say where thornburgh stood on the issue 
the justice department had argued last spring that last years 
antiterrorism act which branded the plo a terrorist organization 
empowered the government to close the observer mission 
but judge palmieri said the government did not have the legal 
authority because the law did not supersede the 1947 agreement that 
established un headquarters in new york however the judge 
decided that under the law the government could try to halt plo 
operations apart from the mission itself 
palmieri dismissed the governments lawsuit with prejudice 
meaning it cannot be brought again although his ruling could be 
appealed to a higher court 
us attorney rudolph giuliani who argued the governments case 
before palmieri said after the ruling that he and the justice 
department would study the ruling and we will make a decision as 
to further proceedings as soon as possible 
the head of the plo mission in new york hailed the decision as a 
victory for international law 
the united nations now has no fear that the host country or 
any host country can violate its legal obligations and get out 
scotfree zehdi labib terzi permanent observer of the plo told 
the associated press 
lawyers for the plo including former us attorney general 
ramsey clark had argued that closing the mission would violate 
international law because the headquarters agreement called for 
arbitration of disputes between the united states and the united 
nations 
they maintained that palmieri lacked jurisdiction and should 
defer to an advisory opinion from the international court of 
justice which said the united states was bound to submit to 
arbitration 
but palmieri rejected those arguments

no new pentagon consultants will be hired for 
the rest of the reagan administration defense secretary frank c 
carlucci ruled in a move related to an ongoing fraud investigation 
in view of the recent attention given the employment of 
consultants by the department of defense effective immediately and 
continuing through the remainder of the present administration new 
individual consultant appointments may not be made by dod 
organizations carlucci wrote in an order he signed earlier this 
week 
some exceptions may be possible to accommodate special 
problems or unique circumstances carlucci said but added that 
all such requests for exceptions would have to be sent directly to 
him along with detailed justification 
under investigation in the defense fraud probe are allegations 
that defense contractors and consultants many of them former 
military men bribed pentagon officials for contracting details 
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
the new ban does not apply to the hiring of consultants by 
defense contractors noted william caldwell a pentagon spokesman 
who declined to predict the impact of the fivemonth ban 
the defense probe has not focused on consultants hired by the 
pentagon but some congressional leaders have questioned the 
pentagons hiring practices 
in june sen david h pryor dark chairman of a senate 
governmental affairs subcommittee accused the pentagon of 
keeping a shadow government under wraps by failing to 
disclose how much money it was spending on private consultants 
the pentagon subsequently denied that accusation releasing a 
detailed financial breakdown of its spending 
according to budget documents the defense department expected 
to spend 114 million this year hiring individual experts and 
consultants to assist with various studies the ban would apply to 
them 
the pentagons total consulting budget approaches 39 billion 
including such services as management support studies engineering 
and technical support for new weapons systems and computer work

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen is back in his native texas to give vice president 
george bush some competition for attention 
bentsen extended a planned fourday campaign trip to come here 
where he planned this morning to meet with local law enforcement 
people about the democrats anticrime agenda 
he also told reporters he didnt want bushs texas campaign this 
week to go without a response both bush and bentsen claim texas as 
their homes 
bentsen was expected to give some tough talk on crime following 
up a couple of days of presenting the national security positions 
of the ticket he has joined with democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis 
bentsen promised arkansas democrats on friday that he and 
dukakis would build up americas military might and he said he 
was fed up with republicans trying to portray the democrats as 
weak on defense 
we want to build up americas military might but once again 
it has to be bipartisan cooperation he said 
bentsen was cheered repeatedly by the 1000strong partisan 
crowd a sharp contrast with a speech thursday before the veterans 
of foreign wars in chicago where he was interrupted by boos on 
several occasions 
his message to the arkansas democratic convention in hot springs 
was that dukakis was a democrat they could support instead of 
voting republican in the presidential election as they did when 
walter mondale ran against president reagan in 1984 
our message to them in 1988 is come home to the democratic 
party he said 
bentsens campaign swing was interrupted friday when his 
campaign jet was grounded because of a damaged door another plane 
was found but bentsen missed a campaign stop in atlanta 
he planned to return to washington tonight

still trying to move forward in his 
republican vice presidential campaign sen dan quayle remains 
mired in questions about his past 
the latest brushfire to face the indiana senator is an error in 
his official resume which states that he was the chief 
investigator in the consumer protection division of the indiana 
attorney generals office for two years when he only had the job 
for several months 
quayle said friday he was not trying to pad his resume and that 
his senate staff had prepared it the biography is dated june 1 
1987 
but once again quayles campaign was distracted at a critical 
moment now on his first solo campaign trip as the nominee quayle 
is trying to focus attention beyond such questions 
all of these issues are side events many of them are 
untrue quayle said friday after taking reporters questions 
about his erroneous biography mediocre academic record and various 
other matters 
quayle has appearances today in california stuart spencer his 
campaign manager said well be talking about more substantive 
issues and not personal issues 
at a billings mont news conference quayle parried questions 
about his academic record which he acknowledges was mediocre 
there have been suggestions that quayle who comes from a wealthy 
indiana publishing family pulled strings to get into law school 
after a poor performance in college 
quayle said he would not authorize the public release of his 
academic records 
i dont want you to go through and pore over all those 
mediocre grades i got he said 
at the news conference quayle issued a strong statement on gun 
control blasting democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
as a cardcarrying member of the american civil liberties union 
and noting that republican presidential nominee george bush is a 
life member of the national rifle association 
also on friday quayle spoke with bush who called quayles 
campaign plane from texas 
there is some momentum building i can feel it i can feel the 
excitement in the air quayle told bush 
quayle said the vice president did not speak to him about his 
erroneous resume during the phone call 
the senator told reporters that the consumer investigation job 
was the last job i had of many different jobs in the attorney 
generals office from 1970 to 1971 
media coverage of quayles controversies including whether he 
used family influence to get into the national guard during the 
vietnam war has increasingly come under fire at the candidates 
rallies and appearances 
at a breakfast in sioux falls sd former gov william janklow 
criticized media coverage of quayle as he introduced the senator 
the american people cant stand scurrilous scummy types of 
personal attacks he said 
sen jake garn rutah told a rally in farmington utah that 
the national guard question was a phony issue 
ive been angry as one who served 20 years in the utah 
national guard and flew missions to vietnam he said id like 
to take some of the press who went to canada to vietnam with me

delegates at the latest round of 
southern africa peace talks ended the twoday session late friday 
without resolving the issue of a timetable for the withdrawal of 
cubas 50000 troops from angola 
instead the delegates agreed to meet again in brazzaville in 
two weeks for more talks 
the timetable is the key both to ending fighting between 
cubanbacked angolan forces and south africa and to independence 
for southwest africa angolas southern neighbor that is also 
known as namibia 
sources in the south african delegation said substantial 
progress was made on cuban withdrawal the united states which 
mediated the talks proposed that the cubans pull out within 18 
months a compromise the angolan delegation took home to luanda 
overnight thursday for consideration by its marxist government 
angolas ambassador to west germany herminio escorcio told 
reporters upon emerging from the conference it is a question of 
flexibility on the part of south africa and the united states 
south africa has insisted the cubans be withdrawn within a year 
if it is to grant independence to namibia angola has said it would 
take three to four years to send the cubans home 
the talks among south africa cuba and angola on ending the 
13year angolan civil war and granting independence to namibia 
began wednesday 
the negotiators also discussed south africas support for the 
antimarxist guerrillas fighting angolas government said sources 
close to the south african delegation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
angola was believed to be demanding that south africa and the 
united states stop supporting the rebels in return for concessions 
on the timetable 
the rebels of unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola have not been involved in the talks and 
have ignored a ceasefire signed by south africa angola and cuba 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp 
broadcasting in johannesburg said the talks had reached a 
delicate stage it also said the south african delegation met 
with a special united nations observer present for the brazzaville 
talks

sept 1 and grant independence to namibia within a year as long as 
the cubans withdraw 
on thursday the four parties did not meet leaving us 
mediators to work out a compromise proposal

anticipate their results he commented in an interview with congo

with the iraniraq war apparently nearing 
an end tens of thousands of war prisoners now look ahead to 
freedom most with joy but some with dread 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammad larijani has said a 
prisoner exchange could start within three months after the 
ceasefire that took effect aug 20 
but baghdadbased diplomats say repatriation could be delayed by 
hard bargaining at geneva peace talks and by the sheer immensity of 
the task of registering all pows and determining whether they want 
to go home 
its going to be a very long process said one european 
diplomat who like his colleagues refused to be identified 
the exact number of pows is unclear 
the international committee of the red cross which has agreed 
to organize the exchange registered 50182 pows held by iran and 
19284 held by iraq red cross officials say they believe both 
sides hold many prisoners who have not been registered 
diplomats in baghdad estimate that iran holds 6000070000 pows 
and iraq 3000050000 
iran is also believed to hold 10000 to 20000 egyptians 
captured while working as mercenaries in the iraqi army or while 
working as fishermen for kuwait which iran accuses of supporting 
iraq 
some prisoners have been held since sept 1980 when the war 
began but thousands of iranians were reported captured in iraqi 
offensives in the final days of fighting before the truce began 
the iraqis apparently sought to seize as many iranians as 
possible as bargaining chips in the geneva talks 
both sides have used pows for propaganda purposes apparently 
violating geneva conventions that forbid exposing pows to public 
curiosity 
each day irans staterun television monitored in cyprus 
shows iraqi pows in spotless fatigues singing the praises of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and denouncing president saddam hussein 
of iraq 
iraq in turn has taken reporters to pow camps and displayed 
iranian prisoners knitting portraits of saddam and praising his 
wisdom and fair treatment 
for such prisoners the prospect of returning to their families 
will be balanced against fear of their own governments who would 
likely question them closely and for some time about the conditions 
of their capture and imprisonment 
people assuming theyll be instantly reunited with their kids 
will be disappointed the european diplomat said 
diplomats say many pows may choose to stay with the country that 
captured them rather than return to an uncertain fate red cross 
rules forbid the repatriation of prisoners against their will 
tehran newspaper said that at least 20000 iraqis have opted to 
stay in iran 
but diplomats said that getting prisoners back is a relatively 
low priority for baghdad which is more interested in assuring a 
lasting peace and ending iranian support for kurdish rebels 
fighting iraqs government 
the priority would be on more essential issues such as the 
establishment of a durable peace another diplomat said 
an early return of prisoners bearing tales of mistreatment could 
damage the peace talks in geneva unless both countries 
uncharacteristically play down such reports 
diplomats said the prisoner exchange may be snarled not only by 
arguments about those who choose to stay but by uncertainty over 
how many each side holds and by their fate 
iran halted red cross visits to its 15 known pow camps after red 
cross officials in 1984 witnessed a prison riot in which guards 
killed several pows 
the iranians allowed the visits to resume in 1986 but the red 
cross found that more than 7300 previously listed prisoners had 
disappeared off the rolls tehran said they had chosen to live in 
iran 
the red cross itself suspended visits earlier this year because 
it alleged it was unable to visit all prisoners

george bush is painting himself as the 
conservative heir to the texas vote as he accuses presidential 
rival michael dukakis of hiding his true liberal colors 
top bush strategists today were holding a statewide meeting for 
the campaigns texas leadership and volunteer corps to discuss the 
election plan for the critical state bush advisers lee atwater 
charles black tom loeffler and john tower were meeting with the 
group said spokeswoman alixe glen 
bush after addressing the meeting in houston was scheduled to 
travel to dallas to speak to a marine corps veterans group and 
attend a fundraiser for the republican partys victory 88 fund 
the republican presidential nominee is to conclude a fourday 
trip to his adopted home state sunday and head to st louis and 
nashville before returning to washington on monday night 
bush highlighted differences between himself and dukakis on gun 
control energy policy and defense on a campaign trip friday to 
longview 
he also accused dukakis of lax crime policies as governor of 
massachusetts striking back a day after dukakis said the reagan 
administrations drugfighting policies were absurd and 
criminal 
dukakis bush said is the governor who vetoed the mandatory 
sentencing for drug dealers he opposes capital punishment for drug 
king pins and he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous 
furlough program that lets murderers rapists and drug dealers out 
on appeal 
the vice president called for more support of local law 
enforcement officers who are out there every day fighting the 
drug war 
he called dukakis the liberal governor of massachusetts who 
does not want to highlight his differences with bushs conservative 
positions 
were not going to let this man be something hes not im 
going to pin him down bush said 
bush also praised his embattled running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana on a day when quayle acknowledged the truth of a new 
allegation that his resume exaggerated the job he had as a young 
man in the indiana attorney generals office 
bush who has not mentioned quayle by name in two previous days 
of campaigning said friday he would be an outstanding vice 
president 
he praised the congressional qualifications that the bush 
campaign had hoped to highlight before quayle became engulfed by 
controversy about his national guard service at a time when his 
peers were being drafted to fight the vietnam war 
the secondterm senator bush said is a wonderfully 
thoughtful person who has taken a leadership role in job 
retraining the job training partnership act but also is a 
member of the armed services committee knows as i do that only a 
strong america can prevent expansion of totalitarianism around the 
world 
bush telephoned quayle from his plane friday morning said bush 
chief of staff craig fuller and told him i think things are 
going very well 
bush told a longview rally that he intends to put up a fight for 
texas a key state and im not going to let them take it away 
from me 
on texas faltering economy and depressed oil industry the new 
england native said texas has been hurting bad but today more 
texans are at work than any time in the history of the state 
now weve got to keep this recovery going until every texan 
benefits he said 
he emphasized also that dukakis opposes offshore drilling and 
supports gun control while bush takes the opposite view on both 
issues of interest to texans 
bush who has been attacking dukakis on the defense and foreign 
policy fronts also reiterated his support for the strategic 
defense initiative which dukakis opposes 
i say it is essential i will support research vigorously and 
fully and when it is ready i will deploy it

the un secretarygeneral called a recess today 
in the iraniraq peace talks after negotiations faltered sources 
said problems arose when iraq insisted on redrawing the southern 
border between the warring nations 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he hoped both 
sides would be more flexible when they return to the bargaining 
table sunday he refused to comment on reports of problems 
it is too early to ask for flexibility he said friday after 
six hours of separate and joint sessions with both sides we are 
making progress slowly but we are trying 
the talks began thursday and are the first in eight years 
between iran and iraq they are aimed at consolidating a fragile 
ceasefire that began aug 20 and at reaching a comprehensive peace 
settlement 
in all these exchanges today many points have been clarified 
and i hope that on sunday after the day of reflection saturday 
perhaps the flexibility will start perez de cuellar told 
reporters 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi 
counterpart tariq aziz met in separate sessions for two hours in 
the morning and in a facetoface plenary meeting for four hours in 
the afternoon 
diplomatic sources said both sides set forth their often 
divergent positions on numerous intractable subjects from the 
border dispute to exchange of prisoners 
velayati gave the first public indication of a problem when he 
told reporters after the morning session that a settlement requires 
observance of the 1975 algiers treaty 
the treaty made the southern boundary between iran and iraq the 
middle of the shattalarab waterway and granted iran its claim to 
the eastern half the waterway is iraqs only access to the sea at 
the persian gulf 
in 1980 president saddam hussein of iraq repudiated the treaty 
five days later on sept 22 the iraqi army invaded iran 
iran says the treaty still is valid under international law 
the treaty is a crucial issue in the peace talks because a un 
peace resolution calls for a troop withdrawal to internationally 
recognized boundaries 
iraq says the boundaries are in dispute and seeks renegotiation 
of them 
sources close to the iranian delegation said the iraqi side was 
insisting the ceasefire line be drawn so as to give iraq control 
of the waterway 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said iraq also 
was pressing for early dredging by the united nations of the 
waterway heavily silted after eight years of war and impassable 
because of sunken ships 
neither velayati nor aziz spoke to reporters after the session 
friday night 
while the talks were under way iraqi kurds demonstrated in 
front of the un building to protest the reported continued use of 
chemical weapons by baghdad against the rebellious minority 
in new york meanwhile the security council denounced the use 
of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war especially attacks 
against iran by iraq 
before the talks began perez de cuellar told reporters that the 
bitterness and historic hostility between the two sides was such 
that it would be difficult to continue the facetoface 
discussions which began thursday 
i dont think that continuing facetoface is possible so 
far he said we have to be a little patient it is too early 
for two sides alone facetoface and even facetoface with me 
would be very difficult he said 
the friday session began with both sides meeting in separate 
chambers and un officials shuttling between them 
but in the afternoon they returned to the spacious council 
chamber and addressed each other directly

comedian bill cosby has said no to a 
county request to make up for a 10000 budget cut by the 
administration of gov michael s dukakis in a program aimed at 
preventing teenage pregnancy 
franklin county commission chairman william benson said 
frustration and anger at state officials prompted commissioners to 
seek the donation from cosby who lives in the county in nearby 
shelburne falls 
its one thing to say that money is tight its another thing 
to have to approach a local celebrity hat in hand just to keep 
alive a program that was supposed to be a priority of the 
governor benson said thursday 
the 10000 grant for the program was among 40000 cut from 
county allocations in the states fiscal 1989 budget following 
projected revenue shortfalls 
in a letter to county commissioners this week an aide to cosby 
said the comedian would not cover the state aid cut

singersongwriter john denver has denied 
reports that he would pay the soviet union 10 million to take a 
ride on a soviet space ship but he still would like to go 
let me be clear i would give my guitar to go into space 
denver said friday ive expressed this to nasa unfortunately 
it looks like a civilian in the american space program is now a 
long way off to fly with the soviets greatly enhances what i 
already considered an incredible opportunity 
he said the commercial arm of the soviet space program 
approached him about being the first american civilian to go up in 
a soviet spacecraft last april denver said he traveled to moscow 
to discuss the proposal with soviet officials and learned that it 
costs them roughly 10 million to house train and ultimately put a 
human in space for one week 
in the past when a noncivilian foreigner has gone up in a 
soviet spacecraft these costs have been assumed by means of a 
governmenttogovernment agreement since this venture is 
nongovernmental alternative means of financing will have to be 
explored 
regardless of what has been implied elsewhere i have no 
intention of paying the soviets 10 million and i think it would be 
highly inappropriate to do so

designer hats for horses may be the next fashion 
trend on new york city streets says mayor edward i koch 
koch told the industrial designers society of america on friday 
that hes been looking into ways to comfort the citys carriage 
horses during hot muggy weather 
city regulations require that the animals be taken back to their 
stables when the mercury reaches 90 degrees but animal lovers say 
the horses can experience discomfort in temperatures just below 
that one horse collapsed earlier this month while being taken to 
his stable on a 90degreeplus day 
weve looked into the question of having umbrellas of 
different sorts to safeguard the horses and weve discarded that as 
unworkable koch told the designers weve come up with 
something that goes back to our roots i guess a straw hat for a 
horse 
he said there is no official design contest for such a hat but 
if anyone wants to send me a drawing i will select the best 
hat and then parks commissioner henry stern will issue 
regulations

president vinicio cerezo said the main 
leftist rebel coalition must put down its weapons before being 
allowed to participate in a planned national dialogue aimed at 
ending 30 years of civil war 
cerezo who has been under fire from the powerful right for even 
considering talks with the rebels said in a statement friday that 
only groups and organizations within the law can participate in 
the dialogue 
he urged the guatemalan revolutionary union to understand the 
human cost of a 30year confrontation and to avoid a blood 
bath 
mongsignor rodolfo quezada toruno head of the national 
reconciliation commission said the rebels told him at a meeting in 
costa rica this week that they wont lay down their arms prior to 
the talks 
the dialogue is scheduled to begin next month 
the revolutionary union is a coalition of three leftist 
guerrilla groups 
cerezos one meeting with the rebels last year in spain under 
the terms of a central american peace plan sparked a storm of 
criticism from the right he has since survived an attempted 
military coup 
cerezo pointed out in his communique that the regional peace 
plan gives the rebels the option of asking for political amnesty in 
return for laying down their arms 
revolutionary union leaders have said they wont do this until 
there is a clear sign that the government is ready to address the 
sharp economic and political inequalities in guatemala 
the rebel leaders are currently on a central american tour that 
includes meetings with the presidents of nicaragua and costa rica 
and highlevel meetings in honduras and el salvador 
the presidents of those nations in addition to guatemala 
signed the regional peace accord last summer it is aimed at ending 
wars in the region through negotiations and also calls for

the arrest of former army sgt clyde lee 
conrad on charges that he reaped enormous profits as head of an 
international spy ring brought anguish to his family and stunned 
residents of his hometown 
i always thought i knew my son harry conrad said we were 
pretty tightly wrapped if i had had this knowledge before it would 
have killed me its about to kill me now 
his sister karen henschen said family members had not spoken 
with conrad since his arrest tuesday in frankfurt west germany 
his parents and his sister live in alliance about four miles west 
of this blue collar town where he grew up 
his relatives said they tried to keep in contact with conrad 
while he was in the military but he never wrote back 
he always distanced himself from us ms henschen said he 
didnt see big opportunities in sebring joining the military was a 
way for him to travel 
harry conrad said in a television interview that he had not seen 
his son in nine years but other family members said they saw him 
when he came back in 1985 for a 20year high school class reunion 
we love him and we are quite certain he needs moral 
support harry conrad said theres no way we can take back 
what has happened but his mom and dad and family love him and he 
has our prayers 
conrad 41 enlisted in the army on aug 9 1965 soon after he 
graduated from sebring mckinley high school acquaintances said he 
seldom returned to his hometown about 55 miles southeast of 
cleveland 
west german authorities are holding conrad on charges of 
compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially 
grave case west german officials said millions of dollars in 
payments by the soviets may have been involved 
but few residents of the northeast ohio city of 5000 knew much 
about conrad 
he was very quiet very nice and he kept mostly to himself 
he went to the service at a very early age said mrs robert 
blake who has lived in the same house on mckinley street for about 
30 years the conrads lived about four houses away 
john garrett who taught at the high school remembered conrad 
as a student who excelled on the track and rifle teams but never 
expressed any interest in politics or caused trouble 
i was very surprised he went into the service right after 
high school and he never seemed that outgoing or aggressive as a 
young person to do something like that said garrett 51 
i went down to the coffee shop and saw some of the people who 
knew him as a student and they were just stunned he just wasnt 
that kind to make waves he said 
restaurateur dennis rohde made light of the news with patrons of 
his tin lantern cafe 
you want our spy sandwich rohde asked customers it comes 
with a secret decoder ring 
but rohde admitted the news seemed to have taken residents aback 
they live in this town for years and they suddenly have a spy 
scandal and they say my god how could it be someone from 
here said rohde 50 
officials have said the spy ring linked to conrad was believed 
to have stolen documents concerning nato defense plans for europe 
and us army contingency plans for a ground war with the soviet 
union in europe 
army records released in washington said conrad worked for the 
us military for 20 years first as an infantryman and then as an 
administration specialist 
according to his service records conrad received the national 
defense service medal the vietnam service medal five army 
commendation medals the army achievement medal three meritorious 
service medals and seven good conduct medals

farmers suffering drought losses will not be 
allowed to collect on the same loss twice even if they are eligible 
for benefits under more than one agriculture department program 
officials said 
undersecretary roland r vautour said friday that if a farmer 
has a crop loss that would qualify him for ongoing emergency 
livestock feed provisions and the new disaster payment program he 
cannot double up on the benefits 
the basic restrictions are spelled out by the disaster 
assistance act of 1988 which went into effect friday however 
vautour the regulations and operating procedures which will 
implement the statutory provisions have not been completed 
producers should start assembling their sales receipts and 
other data to substantiate their actual production information 
he said 
department officials have said they hope to begin actual 
operation of the 39 billion droughtaid law by oct 1 at that 
time they hope farmers can begin applying at country offices of 
the departments agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service for benefits

in an unprecedented exchange program 56 
soviet students have spent the past three weeks at middlebury 
college studying english and computers in preparation for a year at 
26 us colleges and universities 
the program marks the first time soviet students will study at 
us universities unaccompanied by adult chaperones said raymond 
benson director of the american collegiate consortium for 
eastwest cultural and academic exchanges 
today some students head for the eastern schools most of them 
small liberal arts colleges 
i have never been so far away from my family said a 
homesick nino betlemidze a 22yearold female student from soviet 
georgia slated to attend wesleyan university in middletown conn 
us students will study in the soviet union next year while 
another group of soviet students will attend us universities 
benson said 
it is a mark of a new normalcy in our relations he said 
recently 
soviet education officials selected their brightest students 
this year but some werent as fluent in english as us officials 
expected without a strong command of the language the first few 
months could be difficult for the students and host schools he 
said 
we thought they would be awfully damn good he said but 
well work through it this year because the students are so bloody 
motivated 
in addition to practicing english betlemidze and the others 
have been learning to use personal computers so they can write 
their first term papers 
another adjustment problem is the diversity of course offerings 
at us schools according to benson 
they look at our catalogs and they go berserk he said 
the wealth in our catalogs is very hard for them to grapple 
with 
womens studies said a laughing betlemidze who studies the 
physics of metals at her home school georgia polytechnic institute 
the soviets who are earning a years credit for transfer to 
their home schools must take half their courses in their major and 
the rest outside of it 
mikhail chkhenkeli a 20yearold math major focusing on 
topology plans to study spanish photo processing logic and 
tennis when he starts at swarthmore college in swarthmore pa 
his major at georgia state university in the southern soviet 
republic the study of the properties of geometric figures that 
remain unchanged even under distortion points to the specificity 
of soviet study and the problem it poses for fitting the students 
into us schools 
they specialize far earlier than our undergraduates benson 
said who said he changed several college assignments for students 
who felt a schools course list would not adequately meet the 
requirements of their major 
other schools in the program include amherst college in amherst 
mass bates college in lewiston maine davidson college in 
davidson nc colgate university in hamilton ny oberlin 
college in oberlin ohio vassar college in poughkeepsie ny and 
washington amp lee university in lexington va 
one condition of the exchange was that at least onethird of the 
soviet students be women benson said we told them there would 
be no exchange without them he said adding that few women have 
been on previous student exchanges 
the us organizers first thought soviet reluctance to send 
women was due to fear they would not return home however benson 
said its more likely because of sexism 
benson who recently served as a counselor on educational 
exchanges to the us embassy in moscow hopes the educational 
exchange will create a generation that knows life intimately in 
both superpowers 
by the next century a couple of thousand people who really 
know that other country can say i know what they mean ive been 
there benson said

a retired us army sergeant who allegedly 
headed an international spy ring that sold nato secrets to the 
soviets held a top secret security clearance but never had the 
periodic mandatory followup review according to us officials 
an army spokesman said friday that the soldier clyde lee 
conrad held a top secret clearance from 1978 until his 
retirement in 1985 
normally a background check is done every five years said 
army spokesman lt col greg rixon 
but rixon acknowledged that conrad had never been subjected to 
the usual followup background investigation to keep his clearance 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s the defense department fell 
behind and they werent getting them done that quickly the 
spokesman said 
according to rixon conrad was investigated and authorized for a 
top secret clearance in march 1978 while serving his first tour 
with the headquarters company of the 8th infantry division in west 
germany 
he then carried that clearance through to retirement in 
september 1985 the spokesman said 
rixon said he had no information on conrads specific duties 
while with the 8th infantry but he stressed that a top secret 
security clearance didnt necessarily give conrad access to 
everything marked top secret access is still based on a 
needtoknow basis said rixon 
officials in west germany said conrad was in charge of guarding 
the classified documents in a safe at a us base 
conrad was arrested in west germany on tuesday and charged with 
compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially 
grave case prosecutors said 
officials say the ring started operating in the late 1970s 
reportedly selling the soviets secret documents about nuclear 
missile bases military pipelines and nato troop strength 
attributing the information to a west german newspaper that it 
did not identify cbs evening news reported friday that the 
41yearold conrad collected more than 1 million in the sales of 
nato secrets cbs said investigators believed conrad deposited the 
money in numbered swiss bank accounts but did not use his name 
cbs said investigators have uncovered evidence of a 
europeanwide operation run from conrads west german home with 
other agents operating out of three neutral countries they 
included an agent in switzerland who handled money two in sweden 
who acted as couriers and a hungarian intelligence officer in 
vienna austria who was said to be conrads controller 
in molndal sweden a district court arraigned two 
hungarianborn swedish brothers as suspected members of the spy 
ring 
prosecutors in sweden and west germany said the two men were 
couriers for the network sandor kercsik 48 and imre kercsik 34 
confessed to working for the hungarian intelligence service chief 
prosecutor svenolof hakansson told reporters 
cbs added that the different ways countries handle spy cases 
became advantageous to conrads alleged network in austria 
espionage is considered a crime only if it is against the austrian 
government and swiss law does not allow it to lift banking secrecy 
laws for espionage investigations 
it could take months before we know the full extent of the 
damage to nato defenses said a spokesman for west german 
prosecutors 
meanwhile conrads german wife antje told the associated 
press outside the couples home in the central german town of bad 
kreuznach on friday that she had not seen him since his arrest but 
added i expect to see him next week

afghanistans foreign minister said 
sovietbacked efforts to build a communist society in afghanistan 
failed so the country wants to introduce a multiparty system and 
mixed economy 
foreign minister abdul vakil also said friday that pakistan 
which supports the afghan guerrillas has a subversive attitude 
that threatens the success of an accord calling for the withdrawal 
of soviet troops from afghanistan 
we once thought socialism could be built in afghanistan but 
this was a theory that proved wrong vakil said at a news 
conference the country has had a feudal traditional tribal 
system and socialism is a luxury in such a backward state 
he added state ownership of property is under 20 percent 
public ownership of land under 1 percent how could one build 
socialism amid such circumstances we have no funds for that 
a multiparty system and a mixed economy is the choice of our 
people we have failed with the land reform with the obliteration 
of illiteracy our reforms were rash and ran across national and 
tribal feelings vakil said 
while admitting failure to establish a oneparty communist 
state vakil did not criticize the soviet military intervention in 
afghanistan in dec 1979 
soviet troops entered to back the afghan government in its war 
with moslem guerrillas who are based in pakistan 
under a unmediated accord reached in geneva in april the 
soviet troops began withdrawing may 15 and are to be out of the 
country by feb 15 
only three months have passed since the signing of the geneva 
agreements and there are another seven left vakil said we do 
hope that the united nations and other international bodies will be 
able to see that order returns in that respect if not we shall 
take joint steps with the soviet union 
he did not elaborate 
while soviet troops have withdrawn already from 25 of the 
countrys 30 provinces vakil said none of the provinces could be 
taken over by the armed extremists fighting government troops 
he pledged the kabul government would pursue the policy of 
national reconciliation and stop further bloodshed but where 
rockets are fired at us we retaliate firmly he said 
vakil said his government is striving for a dialogue with the 
opposition the aim being a broadbased coalition government 
pakistan itself agreed to this if it continues its 
subversive attitude the geneva accords spirit and content could 
be eroded he said

the latest round of talks on the 
future of angola and southwest africa left unresolved the key 
question of a timetable for the withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola 
the delegates agreed friday to return to brazzaville the week of 
sept 5 for more meetings after adjourning the latest negotiations 
which began wednesday 
cuba and angola have said the withdrawal process for the 50000 
cuban troops from angola will take four years the south africans 
want the withdrawal to be linked to their own withdrawal from 
southwest africa due to be completed by june 1989 
south africa rules southwest africa also known as namibia 
under a disputed mandate 
a joint statement issued by the angolan cuban and south african 
delegations and the american mediators described the talks as 
serious detailed and constructive 
an american diplomat close to the us delegation said a sept 1 
target date for agreement on the cuban withdrawal timetable was not 
applicable now 
there is a substantial set of differences of perspective on 
some issues the parties come here with a certain view of the 
situation it isnt just a blank check he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he refused to speculate on the content of specific proposals but 
said the differences between the two sides can be resolved 
earlier friday sources in the south african delegation said 
substantial progress had been made on the cuban withdrawal issue 
they said the united states proposed the cubans pull out within 18 
months a compromise the angolan delegation took home to luanda for 
consideration by its government 
angolas ambassador to west germany herminio escorcio told 
reporters on emerging from the talks it is a question of 
flexibility on the part of south africa and the united states 
who both support the angolan rebels 
on the question of continuing us support for antimarxist 
unita guerrillas which was raised earlier in the week by president 
eduardo dos santos of angola the american diplomat said this was 
obviously on delegates minds but was not on the agenda 
the south africanbacked unita guerrillas led by jonas savimbi 
are fighting to overthrow the angolan government unita has not 
been involved in the brazzaville talks and has ignored a ceasefire 
signed by south africa angola and cuba 
when asked if the united states was under pressure over its 
support for unita the american diplomat said it cant be a 
bargaining chip its absurd to ask us to unilaterally disengage i 
dont consider it a condition of our mediation at the talks 
there are no conditions on our acting as mediators in that way

a navy videotape made aboard the uss vincennes 
during the battle that led to the accidental downing of an iranian 
airliner shows a tense crew that rejoices when it thinks it has 
shot down a fighter plane 
that was a deadon shouted a crewman moments after the 
missile roared into the sky aboard the persian gulf direct hit 
on the airplane asked someone yes another replied 
but within 10 minutes the crew members appeared bewildered 
and solemn after learning the missile had shot down a civilian 
airliner instead of an iranian f14 nbctv reported all 290 
people aboard the jet died 
the tape made by a navy camera team during the july 3 incident 
was obtained by nbc through the freedom of information act and 
shown friday on its nightly news it also was broadcast on 
other networks 
a us defense department investigation found that the vincennes 
crew had misinterpreted radar and electronic signals emitted from 
the iranian airbus a300 
the investigators blamed human error by the crew but defense 
secretary frank c carlucci said iran bore a heavy responsibility 
since it allowed the jetliner to fly over the area while a sea 
battle raged below 
carlucci said no navy personnel will be disciplined 
the tape shows the vincennes crew training their binoculars on 
distant iranian gunboats at the start of the battle one appears 
to be going out to starboard and ones in the middle called out 
someone 
coming inbound fast the one at 350 is inbound said 
another there she goes shouted someone else 
during the ensuing fight with the gunboats which used the 
5inch guns mounted on deck one crewman yelled i dont know 
where its hitting 
come on lets keep it down said another over the din of 
the radio transmissions and firing of the guns 
in the tape a crewman stared intently at a green radar screen 
a supervisor paced back and forth and someone called out the 
positions of the approaching vessels 
then the missiles blast off from the ships deck a crewman 
wearing earphones shouted oh dead three other crewmen 
gathered around him and he shouted that was a deadon 
relax shouted someone keep the noise down another 
person yelled knock it off ordered another 
direct hit on the airplane asked someone yes another 
replied 
within 10 minutes the crew of the aegisclass crusier which 
contains the navys most sophisticated electronic warfare 
equipment realized it had shot down an airliner and began a 
futile search for survivors nbc reported 
the defense departments report said several of the crews 
assumptions about the approaching flight were wrong including that 
it was descending toward the vincennes and flying outside a 
commercial air corridor 
iran has rejected us claims it was partly responsible for the 
tragedy saying the navys presence in the persian gulf was to 
blame

detachment at the height of the vietnam war 
capt cathi kiger a spokeswoman for the national guard said 
quayles record of service was solid 
it appears senator quayle mised two drills in six years we 
can still consider his attendance very good said kiger who 
released the documents friday if you missed five drills you were 
ordered into active duty 
the smart ones obviously didnt do it more than five times 
tropp said in a telephone interview from his sturgis mich home 
his attendance record was perfectly acceptable quayle 
spokesman jeff nesbit said friday from his washington dc 
office he did miss the last weekend but that was fairly common 
i dont think its an issue 
the morning report for the may 1975 drill the last in which 
quayle participated shows a second unit member was absent in 
addition to quayle 
kiger said enlisted men who had fewer than the allowed five 
absences during their stint occasionally did not show up for their 
final drill weekend 
you did your six years and said good bye kiger said 
lt timothy r sendak a member of quayles unit said he did 
not recall awol absences as being particularly commonplace in the 
guard 
it just didnt happen that often said sendak who stressed 
he was unfamiliar with circumstances of quayles absence if a 
regulation was broken it was broken 
but both sendak and jon d perry another member of the unit 
said commanders took special circumstances into account 
most of the people in the unit were professionals and from 
timetotime provisions were made said perry of bloomington 
ind we all had occasions when there was some kind of conflict 
sendak added it was quite common for guardsmen or reservists 
to take time and make it up later 
the records further confirmed both that the headquarters 
detachment was under strength when quayle enlisted in may 1969 and 
that a slot was available at the time he transferred into the 
commands public information unit

a jury took only 14 hours to clear 20 
reputed mobsters of racketeering charges in what was believed to be 
americas longest federal criminal trial a 21month marathon that 
generated 40000 pages of transcripts 
the acquittal friday of all defendants in us district court 
was a stunning defeat for prosecutors who said the men on trial 
represented virtually the entire new jersey faction of a powerful 
mafia family 
the government had charged that anthony tumac accetturo of 
hollywood fla and codefendants controlled the lucchese 
organized crime faction and its illegal gambling loan sharking 
drug dealing and fraudulent credit card operations 
after the verdicts were read cheers and applause broke out in 
the courtroom defendants and lawyers hugged and kissed shouting 
thank you and god bless you to jurors some of whom wept 
many on the defense team quickly moved to a nearby tavern where 
the celebration continued as a defendant went behind the bar to 
serve drinks 
im just glad it was everybody acquitted said defendant 
michael taccetta a florham park resident who was charged with 
supervising the mob faction 
the prosecutors appeared dejected 
there really is very little you can say said us attorney 
samuel a alito jr were disappointed by the jurys verdict 
needless to say but when you try cases you have to accept the 
verdict whether its good or bad 
despite this loss the days of the mafia are numbered he 
said 
apparently the jury just resented the length of the trial 
and the breadth of the indictment said v grady omalley the 
justice department attorney who prosecuted the case 
defense attorney david ruhnke said the verdict represented a 
complete rejection of lengthy government racketeering 
prosecutions involving large numbers of defendants 
alito who assumed his post after the indictment was returned in 
august 1985 said the experience would not deter him from 
prosecuting crime groups if such a broad indictment was necessary 
however he said if there is an alternative a way of 
achieving the same result then were going to do that 
one juror contacted at home criticized of the trials length 
they should never ever do anything like this to anybody 
again its really unfair not only to defendants but to jurors 
dorothy bannigan of jersey city said in a telephone interview 
asked about the verdict she said i can sleep i can go to 
bed with a clear conscience 
the panel began deliberating thursday morning they were faced 
with testimony from 89 witnesses 850 exhibits including 400 
tapes and a court file 5 feet thick that included 40000 pages of 
transcripts 
during the trial the defense tried to discredit government 
witnesses many of whom had serious criminal records the 
government contended that only such insiders could tell the story 
of the alleged mob family 
the governments star cooperating witness was joseph alonzo a 
diagnosed schizophrenic admitted drug addict and alcoholic and 
convicted criminal who had shot one of the defendants his cousin 
five times 
mrs bannigan said she did not take cooperating witnesses 
backgrounds into account 
im not interested in criminal records she said im 
interested in what he says and how he said it 
before the jury was dismissed judge harold a ackerman thanked 
its 12 members i commend you in the highest terms for your 
dedication your patience your attentiveness 
im just glad its over he said later adding that he 
planned to go on vacation as soon as possible 
the government alleged the defendants operated out of the 
holeinthewall luncheonette in newark where pictures of 
gangsters al capone and meyer lansky adorned the wall witnesses 
testified about kisses of respect for the boss and tribute 
payments 
according to the administrative office of the courts in 
washington the trial surpassed in length the socalled pizza 
connection heroin smuggling case which ended after 17 months in 
march 1987

vice president salvador laurel 
launched a new opposition movement today to challenge president 
corazon aquino claiming mrs aquino will lead the country to 
national disaster if she remains in power 
i accept the honor and the challenge to lead a coalesced 
opposition against a blundering and immoral administration that has 
betrayed the people laurel said in announcing formation of the 
union for national action 
the unions platform calls for a new treaty on the status of 
american military bases in the philippines that would provide for a 
gradual phasing out of the facilities 
the vice president said his movement will serve as a watchdog on 
government action and will expose alleged corruption 
i am relieved that i no longer have to stand up beside the 
president said laurel chairman of the union if she continues 
to run the government the country is headed for national 
disaster 
laurel was joined at the unions inaugural news conference by 
sen juan ponce enrile and leaders of several opposition groups 
including the new society movement of ousted president ferdinand 
marcos 
mrs aquino ran under the banner of laurels united nationalist 
democratic organization in february 1986 elections that led to 
marcos ouster after 20 years in power 
 
two weeks ago laurel accused mrs aquino of incompetence and 
urged her to resign to make way for new elections but he received 
little popular support mrs aquino vowed to remain in office until 
the end of her term in 1992 
there was no immediate reaction from the president to formation 
of the union 
the announcement by laurel and enrile was the latest in a series 
of attempts to build a viable opposition movement previous 
attempts have foundered because of personal rivalries 
enrile is the only opposition figure in the 23member senate 
and laurels political fortunes have been declining since 
september when he resigned as foreign secretary and refused to 
serve in the cabinet 
manila newspapers reported this month that 21 of 22 members of 
laurels party in the house of representatives were defecting to 
proaquino parties many members left the party last year 
enrile fired as defense minister on nov 23 1986 after a 
failed coup by his followers said the country was facing the 
deepest crisis of its history because of a crisis of leadership 
enrile vice chairman of the union said opposition groups 
rallied behind laurel not for the selfinterest of any one of us 
but above all to avert a potential possible national tragedy 
in a statement to reporters the union called for negotiating a 
new treaty with the united states on the status of american 
military bases after their lease expires in 1991 the coalition 
said a new treaty should be limited to 10 years and provide for 
gradual phasing out of the six bases 
mrs aquino has refused to say whether she would support a new 
bases treaty 
the union also called for replacing the usstyle presidential 
government with a parliamentary system 
mrs aquino abolished the unicameral legislative system imposed 
by marcos and replaced it with a senate and house of 
representatives returning to the system in force before the former 
president declared eight years of martial law in 1972 
the union statement also called for stepping up the fight 
against communist insurgents but offered to legalize the communist 
party of the philippines if it disavowed violence the government 
has made similar offers in the past 
mrs aquino originally named laurel as prime minister of her 
government but abolished the post soon afterward laurel had 
complained since then that he was shunted aside by mrs aquinos 
advisers 
todays announcement came the day before the first anniversary 
of the bloody aug 28 1987 coup attempt led by enriles former 
protege lt col gregorio honasan honasan escaped from detention 
last april and remains at large 
the coup attempt was the strongest and most dangerous of the 
half dozen attempts to topple the aquino government at least 53 
people were killed and hundreds were wounded

sometimes try to buy up all the tickets to an event to push up the 
resale price 
they mistreat and cheat their customers said batalla

union called the authentic union of independent ticket resellers

yonkers officials continuing to defy a 
housing desegregation plan upheld by a federal appeals court plan 
to ask the supreme court for relief from up to 1 million a day in 
fines that could bankrupt the city 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals on friday reaffirmed the 
fines imposed by us district judge leonard b sand against this 
community just north of new york city the fines had been stayed 
pending the appeals courts ruling 
the panel also upheld 500aday personal fines and the threat 
of jail against four city councilmen found in contempt for refusing 
to endorse the desegregation plan mandated by sand 
however the court softened the fines against new yorks 
fourthlargest city setting a 1 millionaday cap instead of 
letting them double each day as under the original order 
otherwise the threejudge panel said the fines would reach 
unreasonable proportions 
the court also delayed reimposing the fines until sept 2 
allowing the city to seek a further stay of the penalty and a 
chance to appeal the case to the nations highest court 
an appeal is planned city manager neil deluca said 
a few hours after the ruling the sevenmember city council held 
a weekly meeting to give the four recalcitrant councilmen a chance 
to change their votes 
but the four stuck to their position for the third time making 
the vote 43 against the plan 
what i see here is the manipulation by the judiciary of a 
legislative body said one of the four councilman henry 
spallone i believe this is a miscarriage of justice 
the appeals court upheld the threat of imprisonment against the 
councilmen after the 10th day of the penalties if they continue 
blocking the plan 
councilman nicholas longo said the only reason there were any 
yes votes was intimidation and fear by the court 
mayor nicholas wasicsko told those attending the meeting that he 
voted for the plan because he feared a contempt citation 
the fines sand imposed against the city aug 2 started at 100 
but doubled daily and would have wiped out the citys 337 million 
annual budget in less than a month 
the fines and the countdown to the councilmens jail time were 
suspended aug 9 when the city and the councilmen appealed to the 
2nd circuit the councilmen had been scheduled to go to jail aug 
11 
by aug 9 the city had paid 12700 in fines and each 
councilman had paid 3500 
under the new timetable yonkers would pay 12800 next friday 
and would reach the 1millionaday cap a week after that at 
which time the city would have paid more than 26 million in all 
the fines would be 1 million each day after that 
though yonkers budget for the year would be wiped out in about 
11 months the city would face bankruptcy long before that a state 
agency the financial control board has taken over the citys 
pursestrings imposing spending restrictions and drafting a 
worstcase plan 
secretary of state gail shaffer who heads the control board 
said the states declaration of a fiscal crisis would continue 
until the city council acts to purge the city of its contempt 
sands contempt ruling was the most serious step in his 
continuing battle to impose a plan to build hundreds of subsidized 
apartments in yonkers predominantly white neighborhoods that plan 
stemmed from his 1985 landmark ruling that yonkers had deliberately 
segregated housing and schools for four decades 
about 24 percent of the citys 200000 residents are black or 
hispanic the city is divided by highways that the courts have 
ruled serve as racial barriers 
sand imposed the fines after the council refused 43 to 
endorse the housing plan by approving incentives for 800 units of 
low cost housing throughout yonkers 
the vote reversed the councils 52 approval in january of the 
same proposal which the city had agreed to as part of a consent 
decree

soviet leaders have issued a decree giving 
paramilitary police broad search and seizure powers and the 
authority to keep public order at demonstrations activists say the 
officers brutally put down recent protests 
the soviet media did not report on the measure issued friday 
but they carried extensive dispatches on a decree that requires 
advance permission for public demonstrations and meetings and sets 
stiff fines and jail terms for violators 
demonstrations have become more frequent under soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness 
the decree involving the paramilitary police also empowers the 
officers to enter homes and businesses in pursuit of suspects 
seize autos and communications equipment and use a wide range of 
weapons 
crowd control previously was the responsibility of regular 
police who along with the paramilitary police are governed by the 
interior ministry the paramilitary police until now had been 
assigned only to guard prisons and labor camps and protect 
government property and special shipments 
the presidium of the supreme soviet approved the new decree july 
28 and it was published in a legislative digest that reached 
subscribers friday the measure was signed by president andrei 
gromyko 
political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at a 
demonstration sunday in moscow and during this years unrest in 
armenia 
in peacetime the army is taking on extraordinary powers 
said yuri mityunov a leader of an unofficial opposition political 
group called the democratic union what is happening here is what 
happens in other countries only under martial law 
mityunov said the new measure gives paramilitary police not 
regular police jurisdiction for the first time over political 
meetings and demonstrations 
dissident journalist sergei grigoryants said alleged beatings at 
sundays protest were unprecedented in recent times 
on sunday the paramilitary police helped regular police stop a 
democratic union protest in moscows pushkin square against the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 20 years ago 
they wore khaki uniforms without insignias black boots and 
berets with interior ministry markings more than 100 protesters 
were arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat and 
kicked about 30 of them 
mityunov said some members of the force told those arrested they 
had served in the soviet army in afghanistan 
paramilitary police units were reported in armenia as early as 
february months before the decree they helped quell 
demonstrations by armenians demanding the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian region attached to the 
neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
under the decree paramilitary police need not obtain a search 
warrant from a prosecutor as regular police are required to do 
mityunov said this violates a constitutional provision of 
inviolability of the home 
gorbachev told a special communist party conference june 28 
there should be strict observance of the rights of citizens to 
the inviolability of their private life home the secrecy of 
telephone communication postal and telegraph correspondence 
on friday mityunov said gorbachev called for creation of 
a state based on laws but even in the times of soviet dictator 
josef stalin there werent laws that openly violated the 
constitution such as this one does regarding inviolability 
the decree says the paramilitary police will be used to stop 
violations of public order that have a mass character threaten 
peoples lives and health disrupt businesses and damage property

people on long flights should exercise their leg 
muscles if they want to stay healthy particularly if they are 
flying coach when they might be more cramped and drinking alcohol 
as well doctors said 
the three doctors from britain and new york said in an article 
published friday that passengers on flights of four hours or more 
risked a blood clot developing in the legs that could lead to chest 
pains and heart failure 
they said the problems could occur in any cramped conditions 
even if flying business or firstclass but were more likely in 
the economy section 
they subtitled their article in the british medical journal the 
lancet the economy class syndrome 
the article advised exercising the leg muscles while sitting 
getting up to walk around the aircraft from time to time and 
avoiding alcohol smoking and inside seats 
highrisk subjects should consider taking lowdose aspirin 
on either a permanent or temporary basis they said 
we are just trying to alert people to the possible danger of 
long flights particularly under cramped conditions or under 
conditions of dehydration due to excessive alcohol said dr john 
m cruickshank a cardiovascular consultant to imperial chemical 
industries britains largest chemical company 
cruickshank wrote the article with dr richard gorlin of mount 
sinai medical center new york and dr bryan jennett a 
neurosurgeon at southern general hospital glasgow 
the two british doctors cited their own experiences of chest and 
limb pains after long flights in asia and across the atlantic 
the article said passengers were at risk even if they had no 
history of heart disease 
it cited a 1986 investigation into 61 sudden deaths over three 
years at londons heathrow airport which estimated that 18 percent 
of them were due to blood clots 
our simple advice is to keep the legs moving do muscle 
exercises go for little walks every once in a while and keep off 
the heavy drinking which occurs on longer flights said 
cruickshank 
alcohol causes dehydration which makes this sort of 
thrombosis more likely and smoking can make the platelets in the 
blood more sticky and encourage thrombosis he said

the parents of a rape victim who spent 
more than a year pursuing their daughters attacker say they never 
suspected the man they helped capture would be linked to almost 70 
rapes 
robert biddings a 34yearold restaurant dishwasher remained 
in custody friday night on a 21count indictment alleging he raped 
five people including the couples daughter and a 12yearold 
girl between 1986 and march 1988 
franklin county prosecutor michael miller said the county grand 
jury is expected to review evidence from other rape cases next week 
the parents who asked not to be identified by name said at a 
news conference friday after the indictment was released that they 
were compelled by rage to pursue the man who raped their 
23yearold daughter 
their persistence led to biddings arrest monday the columbus 
man was indicted on 12 counts of rape six counts of kidnapping 
two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of felonious assault 
police said biddings is a suspect in more than five dozen rapes 
attributed to the handcuff rapist a nickname that resulted 
from the use of handcuffs in early attacks later attributed to the 
same man over a fouryear period 
the couple said they decided to pursue the rapist shortly after 
the june 1987 attack on their daughter at first they staked out 
the bus stop where the rape occured 
when that failed to produce results they decided to use the 
victims mother as a decoy the woman stood at the bus stop while 
her armed husband waited nearby 
the couple said they repeated the ploy only a few times before 
the wife was attacked aug 5 her husband scared off the assailant 
and gave police the license number from his vehicle 
i wasnt afraid i was furious the woman said that is 
every parents first reaction ill go out and get the person who 
did this to my child 
columbus police who had placed decoys in areas around the city 
after the attack warned the couple that staking out the scene of 
the crime was dangerous 
but said the victims father they police have thousands of 
cases very similar to this they cant drop everything theyre 
doing to work on one case i was not hesitant at taking the law 
into my own hands 
he said he was more afraid that his wife would be attacked by a 
mugger or purse snatcher than by their daughters attacker 
at the news conference the couple and their daughter sat behind 
a screen that allowed them to be seen only in silhouette 
the mother who sat rigid and unsmiling said she and her family 
did not anticipate the attention their actions would draw 
were private people we did what we had to do and dont feel 
we should get any credit for doing anything were embarrassed im 
very embarrassed the mother said 
but their daughter said the incident has helped her through a 
rough time yes it gives me hope she said adding a message 
to other victims dont be afraid to step forward because 
even though he has assaulted you and its all said and done maybe 
you can stop him from assaulting someone else and stop someone else 
from going through the pain 
the mother and daughter sought counseling after the initial 
attack but the mother said she stopped going the counselor later 
asked her to come back and talk about her problems 
i said why to get rid of the rage and i said i wont be 
back because i dont want to get rid of the rage not before we get 
him

a communist party leader said today the 
government is ready to meet halfway demands for trade union 
freedom that gave rise to a wave of strikes crippling coal mines 
docks and factories 
there were other signs that authorities had adopted a more open 
stance toward talking with strikers who are demanding legalization 
of solidarity and higher wages 
government spokesman jerzy urban said proposed roundtable talks 
between polish officials and worker representatives would not 
exclude solidarity leader lech walesa 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski urged fellow party 
leaders to use courage and unconventional means to solve 
economic and social problems that led to the labor unrest 
polish newspapers printed in full a statement from roman 
catholic bishops calling for dialogue and for rejection of force in 
settling strikes 
strikes continued at 12 enterprises but there were no reports 
of police actions to end them 
jaruzelski said todays meeting of the 230member central 
committee of the polish united workers party would work out a 
program to remove threats to peoples living standards improve the 
market stability and speed reconciliation within society 
in short what is needed is a brave turn he said opening 
the plenum parts of which were televised courage to break the 
stereotypes limitations and barriers courage to use 
unconventional but most of all effective means 
jaruzelski denied the meeting was a direct result of strikes 
the situation is complex but we have not lost control even 
for a moment he said the goal of the meeting is to make a 
critical and selfcritical analysis of the causes for the present 
tensions jaruzelski said 
politburo member jozef czyrek said the party was ready to meet 
halfway demands for trade union pluralism however we will 
oppose ideas which would give rise to conflicts he said 
the meeting came after interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak 
on friday night proposed broadbased roundtable talks with 
representatives of workers 
urban asked in a telephone interview if kiszczaks proposal 
would exclude walesa replied no 
the proposal is directed at all who do not reject the existing 
legal and constitutional order he said one may also 
understand this as those who behave or are ready to behave in a 
way complying with the law 
poland is struggling with 60 percent inflation and the 
government this year has raised prices an average of 40 percent in 
an effort to help the stagnant economy 
strikes began aug 16 at coal mines in southwestern poland and 
evolved into polands worst labor unrest since 1981 the strikes of 
1981 ended in a martiallaw crackdown that crushed solidarity 
which was outlawed a year later 
lech walesa who founded solidarity in 1980 said authorities 
asked how he felt about possible negotiations 
i am ready unconditionally and without any thematic 
restrictions to start talks at any time walesa said friday in a 
statement brought out of the lenin shipyard in gdansk where he 
works as an electrician and is participating in a strike 
roman catholic bishops in their first statement on the strikes 
in this predominantly catholic nation issued a statement urging 
negotiation 
intimidation and force must be abandoned and the reasonable 
voice of all the citizens of the country must be loyally 
acknowledged it said 
their message was released after a meeting at the jasna gora 
shrine in czestochowa the whole nation is again experiencing 
dramatic shocks they said and the fundamental cause of the 
countrys present politicalsocial situation is the violation of 
human rights and the dignity of labor 
in recent days the government has used a combination of limited 
force displays of strength and propaganda against the strikers 
police have evicted striking miners in southwestern poland and 
transit workers in the baltic port of szczecin 
repeating their position that the government should permit union 
pluralism which solidarity and the strikers demand the bishops 
said dialogue must be accepted as the basis for solving all 
social conflicts 
they also implicitly criticized the government for not honoring 
agreements signed with workers in 1980 the social accords signed 
eight years ago and developed with such difficulty remain a task to 
be fulfilled they said 
those agreements recognized solidarity the first free union in 
the soviet bloc and included guarantees relating to working 
conditions and social and political rights key provisions were 
voided after the military crackdown in 1981

damaged orings destined for space shuttle 
rockets were apparently sabotaged but they were caught before they 
could be installed in boosters officials said as nasa and the fbi 
investigated 
however a former morton thiokol employee told a television 
station friday that a deliberately cut oring was put in a rocket 
segment being assembled at the booster makers northern utah plant 
the 1986 challenger disaster was blamed on a faulty oring that 
allowed superhot exhaust gases to escape through a booster joint 
igniting the shuttles external fuel tank and killing the 
sevenmember crew 
a very small number of orings that appeared to have been 
deliberately cut were discovered in june said hydrapak inc vice 
president james dockstader whose company makes the rings under 
contract to morton thiokol 
the discovery was immediately reported to the fbi the national 
aeronautics and space administration and morton thiokol 
dockstader said friday 
the fbi is investigating the possibility of sabotage said agent 
cal clegg who declined to elaborate 
nasa inspector general bill colvin likewise refused to discuss 
his agencys probe but said nasa officials believed none of the 
damaged orings ever reached morton thiokol and that their 
discovery would not affect plans to launch shuttle discovery 
the nations first shuttle mission since the challenger tragedy 
is expected to be scheduled for late next month or early october 
dockstader said a check determined none of the flawed seals was 
shipped from hydrapaks plant in suburban west jordan to morton 
thiokol dockstader said 
the damaged orings were immediately secured dockstader 
said no orings have been shipped from hydrapak with any kind of 
damage 
hydrapak has taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the 
future and is confident the problem is now resolved he added 
nasa spokesman dwayne brown said extensive inspection and 
quality control procedures found the damage before the orings 
left hydrapaks plant 
but a former morton thiokol employee told television station 
ktvx he saw a flawed oring placed in a rocket segment 
i was there when they received the damaged oring and it was 
labeled from hydrapak and it was in a package that had gone 
through quality assurance at morton thiokol said the worker who 
was not identified 
the man said that when he called attention to the flawed seal he 
was told to keep quiet because the exposure could cause further 
delays in the space shuttle program 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab denied the allegations 
no unacceptable component has either been delivered to us or 
been delivered by us for use in the shuttle program raab said 
he said the company conducts extensive inspections of shuttle 
parts inspection records show there was virtually no possibility 
that any damaged oring has ever gotten into the flight hardware 
raab said 
jr thompson director of nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala said some hydrapak employees were suspected of 
damaging orings to win cash bonuses awarded to workers who found 
defects 
dockstader denied such an incentive program existed saying 
thompson was either misinformed or misquoted 
former hydrapak inspector cathy crocker said she discovered 
three orings with slash marks as early as may but management was 
unable to determine who was responsible 
after more cuts were found crocker said she was asked to take a 
liedetector test and agreed because she had nothing to hide 
i took the test and i failed it she told ksltv 
she said that when cuts continued to surface in some orings 
she was moved to a filing job and asked to resign 
dockstader said no employees were fired because of the 
investigations but wouldnt say whether any were disciplined 
he said security at hydrapaks plant was strict including 
employee badges for admission and escorts for visitors 
but crocker said security was lax and that anyone could walk 
into the plant

when a university of colorado student 
asked is new england a separate country action was taken to 
make sure the astonishing question wouldnt burn the ears of 
faculty again 
the college has a new requirement for beginning arts and 
sciences students of all majors a geography course 
there had been some deterioration in what we used to think of 
as basic knowledge said ron james editor of the colorado 
alumnus newspaper 
bonnie mahler an assistant in the school of arts and sciences 
said the push to include a geography requirement has won wide 
support because the subject is relevant to many disciplines 
the mandate is part of a larger curriculum reform being 
implemented officials said 
in most cases students have a number of options to meet 
requirements but in geography there are just two choices human 
geography or international geography 
both are designed to give students a geographical 
perspective during the first or second semester 
students who can demonstrate a competence in geography on an 
entrance exam or who took a similar course in high school are 
excused but officials say most students will have to take one of 
the courses

south florida braced for heavy rain today and the 
bahamas warned boaters to stay ashore as a tropical depression 
dumped rains on the caribbean and threatened to strengthen as it 
moved over the southern bahamas 
the weather system moving westnorthwest at 10 to 15 mph has 
caused at least three deaths and forced hundreds of evacuations due 
to swollen rivers and mudslides as it moved across the northern 
edge of the caribbean on friday 
at 6 am today the broad poorly defined center of the 
depression was estimated to be about 225 miles southeast of miami 
a reconnaissance plane reported highest sustained winds near 35 
mph with tropical stormforce gusts of up to 45 mph in squalls 
over bahamian waters on the northern edge of the system 
these thunderstorms are spreading into the central bahamas and 
should continue spreading into the northwestern bahamas later in 
the day max mayfield a forecaster for the national hurricane 
center in coral gables said today 
tonight this poorly defined center should be near the 
southeast florida coast and the scenario now is for it to continue 
northwest toward florida with the heaviest activity offshore he 
said even if it were to intensify a little bit it would still 
be a minimal tropical storm 
mayfield said the storm was more likely to brush the southeast 
coast and keep the heavy activity off the water rather than 
hitting the florida keys directly 
bahamian officials issued a tropical storm watch for the 
northwestern and central bahamas according to the center advising 
small craft to remain in port 
if the depression attains tropicalstorm strength it will be 
called chris 
depressions are upgraded to tropical storms and named when their 
maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph and become hurricanes when 
maximum sustained winds hit 74 mph 
depressions tend to weaken and become erratic over land and 
strengthen over open waters 
the official cuban news agency la prensa said friday that civil 
defense authorities in four eastern provinces moved thousands of 
people to higher ground 
the depression which began forming sunday in the central 
atlantic dumped 66 inches of rain on puerto rico in a 24hour 
period ending thursday and then dumped more than 5 inches on the 
dominican republic forecasters said 
two men and a 12yearold boy were killed in puerto rico in two 
separate accidents wednesday when trees crushed their cars as they 
were driving along rural roads police said 
more than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged by 
flooding including two that were destroyed according to civil 
defense officials in puerto rico they also reported mudslides and 
damaged highways and bridges 
two tropical storms have developed so far in the atlantic during 
this years hurricane season but neither reached hurricane 
strength the season runs from june 1 to nov 30

another 1200 army soldiers underwent training to help 
hardpressed civilian crews battle western wildfires so numerous a 
blaze in washington state burned out of control today because there 
was no one to fight it 
we are really stretched thin on firefighting forces right 
now state department of natural resources spokesman rob harper 
said friday as the 5000acre blaze burned on the colville indian 
reservation in northeast washington 
at yellowstone national park rangers escorted tourists down 
roads otherwise closed by fires and residents of a town on the

at yellowstone on friday two convoys of up to 350 cars took 
visitors from one side of the park to the other in safety after a 
ranger checked the road between the yellowstone communities of 
canyon and norris 
the tourists think its a big adventure said ranger mona

the convoys filed past the 114000acre north fork fire one 
of 10 involving more than 400000 acres of the park

firefighters by rolling the blaze back on itself said fire 
official troy corn 
just outside yellowstones northeast entrance a 36000acre 
blaze in the absarokabeartooth wilderness in southcentral montana 
came within four miles of cooke city and evacuation plans were 
readied for 500 to 1000 people officials said 
but the warning was lifted when shifting winds pushed the fire 
away from the town 
its too early to say for sure but its looking pretty 
good said forest service spokesman steve waterman 
yellowstone stopped charging its 10 entry fee wednesday because 
of the inconvenience fires created for visitors 
park facilities at grant village lewis lake norris canyon 
pebble creek and madison remained closed friday 
the parks west entrance was reopened friday although 
intermittent closures were expected

the fire earlier forced closure of the main road through the 
area destroyed a trailer home and two bulldozers and chased fire 
crews out of a mining camp in the deerlodge national forest

people north of grants pass in the northeastern corner of the 
state the ward canyon fire spread to within a mile of the tiny 
community of troy authorities said 
both communities were placed on evacuation alert the ward 
canyon blaze had burned 15 unoccupied structures mostly hunting 
cabins 
about 120 secondgrade children from the fir point bible camp

exploded to 26300 acres of grass and timber by friday night from 
150 acres thursday afternoon and firefighters said it could spread

fires near the famous inca ruins of machu 
picchu have charred at least 15000 acres burning trees and 
grasslands in several mountain valleys near cuzco authorities say 
but firefighting specialist wayne langlois said the fires many 
of them burning since early this month were not endangering any 
ancient sites including the mountaintop tourist attraction of 
machu picchu 40 miles northwest of cuzco 
langlois of the british columbia forest service in canada and 
three antifire technicians arrived in peru last week to advise 
local officials how to combat the recurring blazes 
five hundred soldiers and civilians battling the fires have been 
hampered by remote terrain and a shortage of modern equipment such 
as chemicals and aircraft civil defense authorities said friday 
langlois said he flew over the burning areas but saw no damage 
to farms or any of the stone buildings bridges terraced fields 
and other ruins of the prehispanic cultures that dot the cuzco 
region 
langlois said he believed peasants burning off tough grass for 
planting a traditional practice in the andes were accidentally 
sparking new fires civil defense authorities say the blazes have 
spread because of the extremely dry conditions this year in the 
peruvian highlands

a second former us soldier 
involved in a spy ring that sold secrets to the soviets apparently 
provided information that led to the arrest of the alleged 
ringleader a west german newspaper said today 
the die welt newspaper of bonn also said that no charges have 
been filed against the second american citizen although he is 
still in the federal republic 
the man alleged to have led the ring former us army sgt 
clyde lee conrad remained in prison today facing espionage 
charges carrying a maximum 10year sentence 
conrad allegedly paid another us soldier a fivefigure sum 
for obtaining secret nato information according to chief west 
german prosecutor kurt rebmann 
the information that led to the arrest of the alleged 
international spy ringleader former us army sgt clyde lee 
conrad apparently came from the us army soldier who was 
recruited by conrad to provide information after conrad left the 
service in 1985 the conservative die welt said 
although the west germans say the second american was a soldier 
when he was recruited for espionage the washington post quoted 
administration sources as saying the man has since left the army 
in washington a us official said friday that conrad had a top 
secret security clearance before leaving the us army 
the us official also conceded that conrad was never subjected 
to a periodic followup investigation during the time he held the 
highsecurity clearance 
west german and us news media reports have said the spy ring 
sold the soviets secret documents about nuclear missile bases 
military pipelines and nato troop strength officials say the ring 
started operating in the late 1970s 
according to a report friday night on cbs news the 41yearold 
conrad collected more than 1 million for peddling the secrets 
cbs attributed the report to a west german newspaper that it did 
not identify 
west german investigators have said they believe conrad kept the 
money in numbered swiss bank accounts

accords 
the united states has said it will not ratify the treaties until

benazir bhutto who may become the 
first woman in modern history to lead an islamic country is edging 
her leftist party toward the center in hopes of winning 
middleclass and army support 
she is confident her pakistan peoples party will win elections 
scheduled for nov 16 and hopeful that democracy will be restored 
after 11 years of military rule 
when president mohammed zia ulhaq died aug 17 in a plane crash 
that some officials blamed on sabotage ms bhutto urged political 
leaders to act responsibly to avoid provoking a military coup 
i have no doubt that in free and open elections the pakistan 
peoples party will take a majority ms bhutto recently told 
western reporters at her home 
the 35yearold opposition leader is the daughter and political 
heir of zulfikar ali bhutto the last freely elected prime 
minister who was ousted by zia in a 1977 military coup and ordered 
hanged two years later 
bhutto had two sons and another daughter but he doted on 
benazir and groomed her in the hope that she might one day be the 
counterpart to indias late prime minister indira gandhi 
my father taught each one of us to believe that its not 
important whether you are a man or a woman what is important is 
what sort of person you are said ms bhutto who studied at 
radcliffe college in cambridge mass before studying law at 
oxford 
ms bhutto returned to pakistan to lead the unsuccessful 
struggle to stop her fathers execution after his death she 
denounced zias military rule and spent five years in jail or under 
house arrest before she was allowed to go into selfimposed exile 
in europe 
despite the suffering inflicted on her family by zia ms bhutto 
said she was not motivated by revenge 
my mother became ill and couldnt lead the struggle the 
people who had been jailed or tortured under the general looked to 
me and i saw i had a duty to them she said 
since her return from selfexile in 1986 ms bhutto has spoken 
at rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of pakistanis they 
chant her name wait for hours to catch a glimpse of her and listen 
spellbound as she speaks 
some pakistanis including many in the army and the government 
bureaucracy remember her father as a tyrant who crushed his 
opponents but millions of poor pakistanis still think of bhutto as 
a hero who sought to lead them out of deep poverty and oppression 
they regard ms bhutto as a daughter faithful to his memory and 
promises 
bhuttoism the creed developed by the prime minister was a 
vague mix of democracy socialism and islam food clothing and 
shelter for all was bhuttos most popular slogan 
ms bhutto remains a committed populist and has promised to 
redistribute 10 million acres of state land to landless peasants if 
she takes power 
but the policies that attract the downtrodden frighten 
pakistans more conservative voters 
our political message has been based on social and economic 
justice so women minorities and the working classes have looked to 
us now we are trying to make a bridge between our traditional 
constituents and the middle class ms bhutto said 
she has said that westernstyle capitalism is the key to 
pakistans development and that her party will work to attract 
foreign investment but she promised no sweeping nationalizations 
although the shift to the center puts her in conflict with the 
leftwing antiamerican wing of her party it enables her to 
negotiate with the moderateconservative muslim league a potential 
coalition partner 
pakistans prime minister is selected from the party that wins a 
majority in the national assembly ms bhuttos party is expected 
to take the largest number of votes but the muslim league also is 
expected to draw substantial support 
the muslim league was considered a zia tool until its leader 
mohammad khan junejo was ousted as prime minister by zia in may 
now the party is in serious disarray but junego is expected to 
rally his supporters behind him and attract independent votes 
if he is not allied with ms bhutto by november junejo could be 
a formidable opponent to her bid for prime minister 
ms bhutto said if she is elected she would also resolve the 
ethnic and sectarian disputes that threaten to turn pakistan into 
the lebanon of the subcontinent 
shiite moslems who make up 5 percent of the population have 
been in conflict with the majority sunni moslems over pakistans 
foreign policy and domestic law 
armed groups in the southern province of sind are demanding 
autonomy and say they are treated unfairly by the central 
government which is dominated by punjabis zia a sunni moslem 
was from the northern punjab province 
ms bhutto blamed zia for the divisions and said that by 
dissolving the national assembly and restricting political parties 
he eliminated avenues for resolving disputes 
by restoring a political culture reintroducing a 
representative parliament and by being a national party we can 
pull these people together from the different regions to talk 
she said my father did it in the 1970s and we can do it now 
although it wont happen overnight 
ms bhutto who married a karachi businessman in december in a 
traditional islamic arranged marriage is expecting her first child 
news reports say the baby is due in december but sources close 
to the family who spoke on condition of anonymity said the baby 
would arrive in the next six weeks 
ms bhutto declined to discuss her pregnancy but she said zia 
set the elections for november as an inconvenience to my health 
you cant really interfere too much with nature she said 
but i do believe motherhood and politics do not conflict we all 
grew up believing in careers

although most blacks in south africa have never 
heard his voice never read his statements never seen his picture 
nelson mandela has become a legendary figure to them in their 
struggle for political rights now he is an increasingly 
troublesome problem for the government here is a report on mandela 
by a longtime associated press correspondent in south africa 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
through 26 years behind bars 
in south african jails nelson mandela has grown into a mythic 
symbol of black resistance to apartheid 
now 70 and stricken with tuberculosis the international stature 
of the leader of the african national congress is at a peak and he 
is locked in a test of wills with president pw botha that will 
have a profound impact on their countrys future 
since mandela was hospitalized aug 12 botha has come under 
unprecedented pressure here and abroad to free the man many 
believe would be president if black south africans could vote 
more than ever before botha has indicated he is ready to 
oblige saying he wants to act in a humane way toward a 
prisoner in a special category of his own 
but commentators across the political spectrum say botha has 
become as much a prisoner as mandela caught in a dilemma with no 
easy escape 
keeping mandela in jail will intensify the international 
protests and pose the risk of a furious response by blacks if their 
most esteemed leader dies behind bars 
freeing an unrepentant mandela will outrage rightwing whites 
and could revive militant black opposition activity that has been 
heavily suppressed under a 26monthold state of emergency 
these conflicting pressures leave botha in a bind government 
officials say he is unlikely to choose the bolder option of release 
without some sort of concession from mandela such as tacit 
acceptance of the governments demand that he renounce the use of 
violence 
mandelas supporters believe he will accept nothing short of 
unconditional freedom they recall 1986 when mandela said he would 
not renounce violence until the government lifted its ban on the 
african national congress scrapped the segregation laws of 
apartheid and agreed to negotiate the granting of political rights 
to the nations 26 million black majority 
there is no violence worse than apartheid wrote black 
newspaper editor khulu sibiya if one were to weigh the violence 
of apartheid and that for which mr mandela was imprisoned that of 
mr mandela is like a sunday school picnic 
calls for mandelas release are coming not only from blacks and 
white liberals but also from some conservative whites the 
progovernment afrikaanslanguage newspaper beeld incurred bothas 
wrath this month for twice urging that mandela be freed 
some analysts argue that the exiled leadership of the anc the 
major guerrilla group fighting the whiteruled government benefits 
more with mandela behind bars than if he were free 
as long as he is in jail he cannot make a mistake and yet he 
might once free especially because people have high expectations 
from him said chris maritz a political science professor at the 
university of potchefstroom 
mike hough director of the institute for strategic studies at 
university of pretoria suggested that some anc leaders might 
prefer that mandela die in jail this would give the anc a martyr 
and avoid a possible ideological split in the guerrilla 
organization if a freed mandela diverged in any way from current 
anc policy 
there is no firm indication that such a split would occur but 
mandela is on record as opposing guerrilla attacks on civilian 
targets while some of the younger generation of anc officials have 
advocated such attacks as a way of demoralizing whites 
mandela in his few publicly reported statements while in 
prison has never distanced himself from the anc or apologized for 
masterminding an antigovernment sabotage campaign the crime for 
which he received a life sentence 
if white leaders do not act in good faith toward us if they 
will not meet with us to discuss political equality then there 
really is no alternative other than violence he told samuel 
dash an american law professor in 1985 
dash one of the few foreigners to meet mandela in prison wrote 
of the encounter throughout our meeting i felt that i was in 
the presence not of a guerrilla fighter or radical ideologue but 
of a head of state 
doctors say the prognosis for mandelas complete recovery from 
tuberculosis is good and government officials have suggested that 
he might be moved to a private clinic while he recuperates 
under this scenario he would be allowed to see an increased 
flow of visitors and the government would decide after several 
months whether to free him or return him to prison 
such a plan is depicted as a means of gradually demystifying 
mandela who is a living legend to many blacks 
his name is scrawled on countless township walls and chanted at 
antiapartheid gatherings even though few south africans have seen 
a photograph of him and only a handful have heard his voice it is 
illegal to quote or publish photos of prisoners inside south africa 
abroad he has become probably the most famous prisoner in the 
world the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees the 
focus of repeated campaigns and appeals seeking his release 
many prominent black moderates including those who condemn the 
ancs use of violence refuse to negotiate with the government 
unless mandela is freed some describe mandela as the only leader 
capable of preventing factional conflict among blacks if they did 
gain power 
if he died in prison said dr nthatho motlana a veteran 
activist and former anc member many blacks would reach an easy 
and reasonable conclusion that the system had killed mandela 
south africas largestselling newspaper the sunday times last 
week exhorted botha to seize this moment and free mandela 
before he became a giant martyr figure who will haunt our 
politics into perpetuity 
what a tragedy it would be if this chance to combine 
compassion with sound political judgment were missed and 
subsequent generations could point to this moment as the one when 
their leaders failed them the times editorial said mr botha 
may not be granted such a chance again

navy investigators have recommended 
scrapping the firedamaged submarine uss bonefish because it would 
cost more than 100 million to repair a newspaper reported 
saturday 
three sailors were killed and 23 injured in april when the 
dieselpowered vessel caught fire off the florida coast 
a report to adm frank b kelso commander of the norfolkbased 
atlantic fleet suggests scrapping the 30yearold sub but does not 
suggest how to do it 
there is no easy way to put the bonefish back into commission 
it was very badly damaged a navy officer familiar with the 
investigation and the report told the virginianpilot and the 
ledgerstar 
navy officials said it would be inappropriate to comment on the 
report which has not been made public until all reviews have been 
completed 
after kelso completes his review the report will be forwarded 
to the navys judge advocate general and the chief of naval 
operations 
the investigators said the fire was caused by a wet battery 
cable that shortcircuited and not by a buildup of hydrogen gas as 
originally thought the newspaper reported in saturdays editions 
the bonefish was one of the navys four dieselelectric attack 
subs all built in the 1950s and all to be decommissioned by the 
end of this decade

michael dukakis today joined tens of thousands 
commemorating the march on washington by 25 years ago by martin 
luther king jr and paid tribute to the slain civil rights leader 
who even in death has the power to look down upon us and see 
into our souls 
the democratic presidential nominee flew to the nations capital 
this morning to participate in the march from the washington 
monument to the lincoln memorial 
in a speech he was to deliver there this afternoon dukakis 
likened king to lincoln and promised if elected president to work 
to fulfill the dream king spoke of at the end of the 1963 march 
what is it about a man that eve though most of us did not know 
him we felt as if we did dukakis said in the text of his 
speech released in advance 
and although he did not knowmost of us we feel that even in 
death he has the power to look down upon us and see into our souls 
like the man whose memorial we gather at today martin luther 
king was such a man dukakis said and as abraham lincoln in 
his time defined our nations purpose at gettysburg so dr king 
in his time defined americas soul 
dukakis said blacks and other minorities have made great strides 
in the quarter century since the march but quoting john f 
kennedy said further work lies ahead this is the side of the 
hill not the top dukakis said in quoting the late president 
dukakis paid tribute to former rival jesse jackson also at the 
march as someone dr king must be very proud of and applauded 
republican challenger george bush for his support of 
antidiscrimination laws to protect aids victims 
but he rattled off a list of issues on which he implied the 
reagan administration has failed to help minorities and said the 
war on racism would not be won until we have a president who 
understands and respects the constitution of the united states 
from washington dukakis was headed to western massachusetts to 
spend the weekend with his wife at her fathers cottage 
the massachusetts governor spent all day friday catching up on 
state business and attended a fundraiser for state sen royal 
bolling sr before heading home for the evening bolling the 
states only black senator is a longtime friend of the governors 
and served with him in the house in the 1960s 
it was during a short walk from the statehouse to the historic 
african meeting house the site of the bolling event that dukakis 
spoke about king and his march on washington 
it was one of the great historic events in the history of this 
country and it came at a time when black people and minority 
citizens were facing terrible discrimination dukakis said it 
was an historic event which triggered a civil rights revolution in 
this country 
there was an awkward moment at the fundraiser as dukakis was 
introduced by the senators son boston city councilor bruce 
bolling who was cochairman of jacksons massachusetts campaign 
and recently criticized dukakis for not bringing more jackson 
followers into his campaign 
bruce bolling discussed his support of jackson but then praised 
dukakis record as a legislator and governor on issues of concern 
to minorities and for his plans to attend the march 
that sign alone means so much substantively and symbolically 
of where we need to go in this country the younger bolling said 
michael dukakis will be there george bush will not 
aides to bush the republican presidential nominee said the 
vice president cannot attend because of a scheduling conflict 
dukakis did not mention bush at the fundraiser but had kind 
words for his rival earlier in the day when asked about the vice 
presidents statement that deployment of the costly star wars 
space defense program should be contingent on further research 
i think that makes sense dukakis said of bushs stance 
im glad to see that the vice president now agrees with me and a 
great number of american citizens 
it was a rare friday at the statehouse for dukakis who for 
months has left the state by midweek to campaign in recent weeks 
he has spent two or three days in boston but will cut the time he 
spends at home in half after labor day spokesman dayton duncan 
said 
hell be campaigning increasingly in the fall around five 
days a week duncan said it will mean a day less at the 
statehouse

american diplomats in panama are facing a 
variety of real and potential problems brought on by the reagan 
administrations decision to have no dealings with that countrys 
militarydominated government us officials say 
in addition harassment of american servicemen is on the 
increase prompting us military officials to take precautionary 
measures panamanian officials respond that troublemakers among 
us military personnel pose daily headaches for panamanian 
authorities 
the state departments constraints on us envoys are such that 
they are prohibited from carrying out even simple tasks such as 
renewing their license plates or their drivers licenses 
as a result many diplomats have been forced to rent cars rather 
than run the risk of driving with expired plates some make their 
rounds with expired drivers licenses worried what local 
authorities might do if they catch them in a traffic violation or 
an accident the officials said 
the diplomats lack the documents entitling them to diplomatic 
immunity thus they are subject to imprisonment if found guilty of 
a legal infraction 
according to us officials there is concern that agents of 
panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega might stage an 
accident in which an american diplomat might be subject to 
prosecution 
the diplomats have been in this unusual position since last 
february when the reagan administration refused to recognize the 
de facto government that took office after the ouster of president 
eric arturo delvalle 
delvalle was deposed after his abortive attempt to fire noriega 
commander of panamas defense forces noriega has been indicted on 
drug smuggling charges by two florida grand juries 
by withholding recognition from the noriegaled government which 
assumed power after delvalles ouster the administration hoped to 
force its ouster and to lay the groundwork for the restoration of 
democratic rule 
there were confident predictions in washington six months ago 
that noriega soon would be forced to surrender power but with key 
elements of the defense forces supporting him he has been able to 
maintain his position despite widespread popular opposition 
meanwhile us diplomats and others in panama have been forced 
to make difficult adjustments 
there have been increased incidents of harassment of american 
servicemen but us officials do not believe the actions represent 
deliberate harassment by the panamanian government 
earlier this week panamas defense forces issued a statement 
denying a published report that american servicemen are being 
singled out for harassment 
the statement said us troops cause daily problems for 
panamanian authorities including fights mistreatment of women 
venereal disease shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar 
and restaurant tabs 
according to us officials the most serious incident involved 
the panamanian wife of an american serviceman the officials said 
she was raped by two panamanians who were wearing defense force 
uniforms there also have been reports of beatings and abductions 
of us military personnel 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the us embassy said 
american residents of panama including businessmen and embassy 
personnel have reported no increase in harassment 
but an official at the us southern command in panama who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said 240 cases of harassment of 
us servicemen had been reported between february and august of 
this year 
in response the pentagon has been sending some servicemen back 
to the united states or moving them to safer locations in panama 
the southern command official said an increasing number of 
panamanian policemen have been attempting to bribe us servicemen 
stopped for traffic violations but he noted that the police have 
not been getting paid regularly because the government has been 
short of cash since the start of the year 
in another example of harassment the defense forces recently 
refused to allow us military personnel to pick up mail at 
panamas international airport for three days the official said

what worried george bush and his top aides 
most as he and dan quayle prepared for their first news conference 
was how to deal with questions about their differences on issues 
the indiana senators national guard service and his brief 
encounter with paula parkinson were secondary concerns at best 
when bush aides asked quayle why he joined the indiana national 
guard in 1969 he replied that he wanted to go to law school had 
he been drafted he already had passed his preinduction physical 
his law school plans would have been delayed three years 
never mentioned was the suggestion that he might have joined the 
national guard during that period to avoid service in vietnam 
neither was quayle asked if his prominent family had helped him 
get into the guard he didnt volunteer the information that a call 
was made on his behalf 
the briefing session took place in a suite on the 40th floor of 
the new orleans marriott hotel it was the second day of the 
republican national convention and bush had just made public the 
biggest news of the week his choice of a running mate 
a dynamic young leader for the future was how bush 
introduced his choice at a rally on a mississippi river levee 
within 24 hours of its disclosure that decision generated a 
flood of unfavorable publicity that threatened to undermine the 
benefits expected from a carefully scripted convention damage 
control became the top priority in the bush campaign 
after nearly two weeks bush remains in danger of having his 
message overshadowed by the persistent questions about his running 
mate 
how much influence did quayles family exert to get him into the 
national guard did he require similar help to get into law school 
did his relationship with parkinson ever go beyond the most casual 
encounter during a golf weekend in florida 
how bush came to choose one of the most obscure people on his 
list of potential vice presidents and how his staff dealt with the 
controversy remains a wellkept secret 
but interviews with people who had varying degrees of 
familiarity with the process produced some details of the process 
all of the people interviewed insisted on anonymity 
bush held off his search for a running mate until after the 
democratic ticket of michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen was set in 
midjuly 
the idea was that bush would have the advantage of countering 
whatever vice presidential strategy dukakis pursued 
the list of those under consideration was long two opponents 
for the presidential nomination senate gop leader bob dole of 
kansas and rep jack kemp of new york one close friend sen alan 
simpson of wyoming two other senators pete domenici of new mexico 
and quayle two women former transportation secretary elizabeth 
dole and and sen nancy kassebaum of kansas govs george 
deukmejian of california jim thompson of illinois carroll 
campbell of south carolina and john sununu of new hampshire and 
former gov richard thornburgh of pennsylvania 
bush sought advice from a wide range of people but never gave a 
hint of whether he was leaning toward one or another individual 
for the most part he listened and took notes on yellow pads 
as the time for the republican convention grew near bush held 
two meetings in his office in the old executive office building 
with top advisers to discuss the contenders 
the participants included treasury secretary james a baker iii 
slated to become campaign chairman pollster robert teeter 
campaign manager lee atwater staff chief craig fuller media 
adviser roger ailes and friend and adviser nicholas brady who 
would succeed baker at treasury 
the first meeting was held aug 8 the second one week later 
by the end of the second meeting the list of prospects had been 
pared to no more than eight names still on it were both doles 
simpson domenici quayle kemp and thornburgh there also were 
rumors of an unnamed wild card 
atwater and teeter were strong advocates of a generational 
approach the choice of a socalled babyboomer that 
description is given to americans born between 1946 and 1964 
people coming to political maturity in this election they are 
voters who grew up in the age of television whose views of 
government were shaped by vietnam and watergate and whose lives 
were touched by rapidly changing attitudes toward drugs and sex 
both quayle 41 and kemp 50 were felt to represent a positive 
generational contrast to the 67yearold bentsen 
that argument appealed to bush and as he looked at the two men 
he was far more comfortable with quayle than with kemp 
bush kept his decision a secret until he landed at belle chasse 
naval air station outside new orleans on the morning of the second 
day of the gop convention 
he had a brief symbolic meeting with president reagan on the 
runway and whispered to him that he had decided on quayle 
a moment later he gave top aides the news and began to call the 
other people on the list 
methodically bush went down his list saving quayle for last 
the indiana senator appeared with bush at a riverside rally where 
an enthusiastic bush called his running mate a dynamic young 
leader for the future 
conservatives were ecstatic quayle was one of their own a hawk 
who voted the conservative line on social and economic issues 
in fact it was quayles conservative views that bush aides 
assumed would be the subject of most questions at the introductory 
wednesday morning news conference 
the indiana senator is a stronger advocate of the earliest 
possible deployment of the star wars missile defense system than 
either bush or reagan and also was far more skeptical of the recent 
arms control treaty between the us and the soviet union 
he also differed with the administration on some labor issues 
including legislation to ban use of lie detectors to screen job 
applicants the administration supported the ban quayle opposed it 
as for paula parkinson the insurance industry lobbyist and 
playboy model quayle and the campaign advisers dismissed her as an 
old story parkinson made headlines in 1981 when it was disclosed 
she had shared a room in a florida condominium with rep tom evans 
rdel quayle and rep tom railsback rill also stayed at the 
condominium but denied any involvement with parkinson 
the national guard service was viewed as no different than what 
millions of other americans had done at the time 
twelve hours later they learned how wrong they were 
it was the national guard story and parkinson that made 
headlines 
baker and other top bush aides met until 3 am thursday 
despite reports to the contrary sources insist there never was any 
discussion of dropping quayle from the ticket 
baker ordered a reinvestigation of the senators background to 
include interviews with family members 
a lid was put on quayle on thursday to prevent any comments he 
might make from dominating coverage of the night bush would deliver 
his acceptance speech 
but when the ticket hit the road on friday it was quickly clear 
that the no 2 spot on the ticket still was the no 1 story

the northern part of south korea was a cold 
boring place to be in the fall and winter of 195556 and true to 
form michael dukakis decided to spend the time bettering himself 
then a young army private he tried to learn to speak korean 
time was really heavy on our hands recalled jay levine an 
army colleage there just wasnt a lot to do it really was 
pretty dull 
dukakis like millions of other men received a standard college 
deferment when the korean conflict was at its height in the early 
1950s when he graduated in june 1955 he had already been accepted 
at harvard law school as had levine his friend from swarthmore 
i could have gotten an additional student deferment if i had 
gone to law school but i was anxious to do my service 
dukakis said last week 
the democratic presidential nominee recalled that shortly before 
he graduated i went to my draft board and asked them to draft me 
just as soon as they could after i graduated from college and they 
did 
frank sieverts dukakis college roommate recalled that when 
we graduated from swarthmore he was already in the process of 
volunteering for the draft i dont know that he was particularly 
looking forward to going into the army but it was something he 
knew he had to do and he decided to make the best of it 
dukakis and levine now a manhattan lawyer joined the army 
together in the summer of 1955 after eight weeks of basic training 
at fort dix nj the two were shipped off to the korean 
peninsula where the bloody war of 195053 had settled down to a 
nervous armistice 
dukakis was in korea 16 months the bulk of his twoyear army 
career and much of that time was spent at the united nations base 
camp near the demilitarized zone 
dukakis was in a specialized army unit providing support of the 
un commission which oversaw the ceasefire most of his time was 
spent as a clerk typing and filing at the units headquarters in a 
barren muddy outpost 
dukakis voiced the same complaint to sieverts who by then was 
at oxford university as a rhodes scholar we exchanged letters 
and he described it there as cold and rainy it was hard duty 
said sieverts 
publicly dukakis is proud of his military record it was 
after the truce had been signed but at a time when korea was very 
much on a wartime footing im very proud of that service he 
said recently 
levine recalled that it was pretty unpleasant for example 
there wasnt much water it was restricted because of the fear of 
infections so that meant you got water in cans and you didnt get 
many showers 
the countryside was desolate both as a consequence of the war 
and because if there were any trees or shrubs they were ripped up 
and used to burn to warm up he said 
the duty wasnt demanding levine recalled a lot of us 
counted the days until we got out you had a lot of time on your 
hands and michael characteristically decided to try to learn 
korean he spent a lot of time on that 
the hitch in korea also offered the chance to travel for 
young men who had grown up in the northeastern united states where 
we had it was an opportunity to see some places you wouldnt 
normally go he said for example dukakis went to japan on one 
occasion he said 
time passed slowly but dukakis fulfilled his duties finishing 
his service with the rank of specialist third class

in the spring of 1942 with the united states 
bracing for a long bloody war secretary of war henry l stimson 
visited phillips andover academy and delivered a message to its 
blueblood students 
stimson himself an alumnus of the massachusetts prep school 
told the graduating seniors they shouldnt rush into uniform the 
war would be long he said and they should continue their 
education and then fight 
but one of the graduates wasnt persuaded george herbert walker 
bush had already made up his mind he wanted to fly and he was 
going into the navy 
the republican presidential candidate began his military career 
on june 12 1942 when he enlisted on his 18th birthday 
after 10 months of flight training bush became the navys 
youngest pilot and was sent to the pacific where the navy was 
waging a huge war with aircraft carriers to roll back the japanese 
based on the carrier san jacinto bush and his two crew members 
flew a tbm avenger a slow singleengine bomber they took part in 
missions at wake island palau guam and saipan 
on one occasion the crew had to ditch when the plane carrying 
four 500pound bombs began leaking oil shortly after taking off 
bush put the plane down tail first and the three men scrambled into 
a life raft and paddled away as the bombs detonated 
his closest call came sept 2 1944 when bush was ordered to 
bomb a japanese radio station on chichi jima one of the bonin 
islands in the western pacific bush took off shortly after dawn 
with his crew members radioman jack delaney and turret gunner 
william g white a family friend 
the flak was the heaviest id ever flown into bush wrote 
later in his autobiography the japanese were ready and waiting 
their antiaircraft guns were set up to nail us as we pushed into 
our dives 
as bush began his dive the plane was hit by gunfire smoke 
poured into the cockpit and i could see flames rippling across the 
crease of the wing edging toward the fuel tanks 
bush kept the plane on target dropped his bombs and turned 
back to the ocean with the plane about to explode he said he told 
delaney and white to bail out and then jumped himself 
bush probably pulled the rip cord too soon he admits his head 
and then his parachute smashed into the planes tail when he hit 
the water the only thing he saw was a life raft that was part of 
his shoulder harness there was no sign of the plane delaney or 
white 
blood running down his face his arms aching from jellyfish 
bites bush paddled with his hands away from the japaneseheld 
island he recounted later the japanese sent gunboats after him 
but another avenger chased them off 
finally his prayers were answered bush said a submarine 
surfaced and it turned out to be american the uss finback 
bush was rescued 
bush spent a month on the sub accompanying it on the rest of 
its mission when he got back to land he was given the 
distinguished flying cross 
by the time he returned to the san jacinto bush was in time to 
take part in the landing on the philippines 
on aug 6 1945 bush and his bride of six months barbara were 
at ocean naval air station va preparing for the invasion of 
japan when word came that the atomic bomb had been dropped on 
hiroshima 
the war was over for george bush and millions of other 
americans as bush recounted later we were still young life lay 
ahead of us and the world was at peace it was the best of times

starting this week a new federal law will put 
limits on the number of days that banks and other financial 
instutions can place holds on checks which customers deposit in 
their accounts 
the law has been hailed by consumer groups who charged that 
americans were losing millions of dollars annually because banks 
were freezing funds for undue amounts of time 
banks however complain that the new guidelines are confusing 
proving costly to implement and will subject them to greater risks 
of fraud 
the controversy is being stirred up by the expedited funds 
availability act which goes into effect sept 1 
under the law banks savings and loans and credit unions must 
give customers access to deposited funds within one three or seven 
days depending on the type of check 
while many banks have been operating voluntarily under such 
deadlines consumer groups argued that a law was needed because too 
many banks were freezing funds for periods as long as two weeks 
even though 99 percent of the time they were getting credit for the 
money within two days 
the us public interest research group which led the lobbying 
effort for the new law charged that banks were making 290 million 
annually in interest on the money they were withholding from 
customers during the socalled float period 
additionally the consumer research group said that banks were 
collecting another 145 million a year in bouncedcheck fees 
because funds were not released faster for depositors use 
in broad terms the new law requires that all local checks must 
be cleared by the bank within three business days a local check is 
one written on an institution in the same metropolitan area or 
within the same federal reserve check processing region there are 
48 such regions in the country 
nonlocal checks must be cleared within seven business days 
funds deposited in the form of cashiers checks certified 
checks and government checks must be available to depositors the 
next business day 
by sept 1 1990 the maximum hold period will drop to two days 
for local checks and five days for nonlocal checks 
many bankers grumble that the new law will open the door to con 
artists they complain that they will not have enough time to make 
sure deposited checks dont bounce or were not forged especially 
in the case of the oneday deadline for government and cashiers 
checks 
the regulations implementing the new law have proven to be 
complex requiring a 600page guide from the federal reserve 
dealing not only with the deadlines but such matters as how checks 
should be endorsed and what information banks must supply to 
depositors 
by oct 31 all banks are required to have placed notices 
explaining the new rules in customers monthly statements 
one area of confusion concerns new guidelines for check 
endorsements they state that only the first 15 inches on the back 
of the check should be used by depositors to endorse their checks 
this is proving to be a major headache for many retail stores 
who routinely stamp the backs of checks with a lengthy list of 
identification items store clerks must obtain from customers 
as a consequence many stores are rushing to buy new rubber 
stamps or reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller 
endorsement area 
fed officials say the new requirements are needed to help speed 
the checkclearing process so that bounced checks can be quickly 
returned to the institution where they were cashed the goal is to 
get the check back before the institution releases the funds 
while the fed says there are no civil penalties for faiing to 
comply with the endorsement procedures some banks are warning 
depositors that they may be held liable for lost money if an 
improper endorsement delays the quick return of a bounced check 
the fed is planning to spend 30 million over three years in new 
equipment and procedures to speed check processing and officials 
estimate that banks will spend 23 million work hours each year to 
comply with the new regulations 
how much of these costs will be translated into higher customer 
fees is not known but consumer advocates say that a 1986 survey 
found that 20 percent of banks were already meeting the new 
guidelines suggesting that they could do so without increased fees 
leslie gainer a lobbyist for us public interest research 
group said even though the regulations may increase some banking 
costs the tradeoffs are worth it 
shorter hold periods for checks are especially important to 
people on tight budgets or fixed incomes she said it will be 
a relief because they wont have checks bounce while their funds 
are tied up

civil and military authorities agreed 
secretly two months ago to wait until at least next year before 
filing charges against ferdinand marcos and allowing the ousted 
president to return a former official said saturday 
ramon diaz who resigned this month as chairman of the 
presidential commission on good government told the associated 
press that he reached the agreement on the timetable with military 
chief of staff gen renato de villa before president corazon aquino 
visited switzerland last june 
diaz said he sought de villas advice on the possibility of 
marcos returning after the government gave up hope that the us 
government would allow a filipino court to try the deposed 
president on american soil 
he said de villa asked for a little more time to make sure of 
the stability of the situation diaz qouted de villa as saying 
the first three months of 1989 would be a fairly reasonable 
time to prepare for marcos coming home 
we will have to consult with the military because 
naturally they will be the ones who will bear the brunt if any 
problems arise diaz added 
as chairman of the good government commission diaz was the 
principal official responsible for tracking down the estimated 10 
billion that filipino authorities say marcos embezzled during his 
20year administration 
much of the money was believed to have been stashed in secret 
swiss bank accounts swiss authorities have refused to lift banking 
secrecy laws until the government files criminal charges against 
marcos 
but philippine law bans trials in absentia and the government 
has delayed criminal proceedings for fear marcos would insist on 
attending the trial 
last year filipino authorities privately asked american 
officials about the possibility of trying marcos in hawaii where 
he has lived since the february 1986 uprising that toppled his 
administration and swept mrs aquino into the presidency 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
told the filipinos they disapproved of the plan for various 
constitutional and procedural reasons 
last wednesday marcos filed a petition with the anticorruption 
court asking permission to return home when a former cabinet 
minister gives a deposition on alleged kickbacks by japanese firms 
during the previous administration 
but mrs aquino ordered solicitorgeneral francisco chavez to 
ask the court to reject marcos petition chavez said he would 
appeal to the supreme court if the lower tribunal rules in favor of 
marcos 
the anticorruption court has ruled that marcos would be within 
his rights to ask to be present when former public works minister 
baltazar aquino gives his deposition in november 
the court stopped short of ordering marcos to return for the 
deposition hearing former minister aquino is no relation to the 
president 
diaz said chavez violated the agreement with the military on the 
timetable for charges by asking the court to schedule the 
deposition hearing in november 
in hawaii marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad withheld comment on 
the governments plans to block the former presidents return 
because we are confused by all the reports on the proceedings 
mrs aquino has said that the country is very stable and shes 
not worried about any marcos return trinidad told manila radio 
station dzxl in a telephone interview from honolulu

physicists wanting to understand whats in 
the mind of god are frustrated by glitches in a new 115 million 
atom smasher that may someday yield secrets about the makeup of 
matter and the birth of the universe 
its like youve been on a long trek to a mountaintop and 
thought you were going to reach it but discover youre only on a 
ridge with another valley to cross said physicist michael 
riordan spokesman for the stanford linear accelerator center 30 
miles southeast of san francisco 
construction was completed may 1987 on the taxpayerfunded 
collider a 3milelong underground machine shaped like a tennis 
racket that summer it was expected to start its major task 
massproducing what are known as z particles 
but numerous technical problems have prevented proper operation 
of the device so its unlikely well make a z particle before 
the end of the year narrowing the us lead in a race against 
european physicists to make new discoveries riordan said 
people are frustrated center director burton richter said 
last week there are thousands of components to this machine 
which all have to work at a high level of reliability to get 
everything to work properly its going to take months to get this 
thing in decent shape i hope people dont get depressed waiting 
but richter who won the 1976 nobel prize in physics declared 
well make this thing work i have no doubt about it 
z particles are so unstable they existed naturally only for an 
instant after the big bang the explosion scientists believe 
formed the universe up to 20 billion years ago 
by using the collider to manufacture z particles and analyze how 
they decay into other particles scientists can study the makeup of 
matter and the fundamental forces that governed the development of 
the universe 
what were really after is trying to understand whats in the 
mind of god richter said something started all of this 
universe we call it the big bang and we really dont understand 
what went on back then we want to find out what are the most 
fundamental things and most fundamental forces in the physical 
universe 
scientists hope collider experiments will bring them closer to 
developing and testing theories to explain why matter exists and 
how it developed from the big bang 
the collider is a daring attempt by american scientists to beat 
european physicists in making new discoveries 
using unproven technology and old components it cost only 
onetenth as much as the conventional ringshaped 1 billion large 
electronpositron collider which is due to massproduce z 
particles late next year at cern the european laboratory for 
particle physics near geneva 
were concerned the more than oneyear lead we thought we had 
over cern is narrowing riordan said 
stanfords collider is designed to produce z particles by 
smashing together beams of subatomic particles called electrons and 
positrons the beams will concentrate enough energy to power 30 
homes on a point about onetenth the width of a human hair 
richter said stanford already proved its approach works and 
can serve as a model for future atom smashers because we can 
produce small beams we can get them colliding so they dont wander 
around too much and we can produce the beam intensities we 
wanted to produce 
but he added the problem is we cant keep the whole thing 
going long enough 
so richter who labeled the machine a miserable beast and 
three colleagues assumed direct responsibility for further 
operation of the collider on aug 1 since then 100 people have 
worked around the clock on fixit efforts riordan said 
he said as many as 20 flaws remain but theres no one major 
problem that defies solution 
riordan said problems remain with transformers that provide 
power to magnets that direct the beams and with old switches that 
sometimes stick as they regulate the flow of cooling water to the 
magnets 
one problem which riordan called overstated was hot 
weatherinduced malfunctions in computer microprocessors that 
control the beams 
im a physicist myself and know what it means to have an 
experiment not work said dave nelson executive director of 
energy research at the us department of energy which provided 
the 115 million youre eating your fingernails and struggling 
to make it work its just not fun

a majority of americans believe news coverage 
of the troubles of republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
has been unfair according to a poll released saturday by times 
mirror corporation 
the survey conducted by the gallup organization said 55 percent 
of people questioned said they thought coverage of the indiana 
senator was unfair thirtynine percent called the coverage fair 
in addition 69 percent of the respondents said the story had 
received too much coverage while only 2 percent said it had been 
given too little 
the survey of 1000 likely voters was conducted wednesday and 
thursday and had a margin of error of 3 percent 
the poll was part of the los angeles based media companys 
series the people the press amp politics which has tried to 
measure public attitudes toward the news media 
while people surveyed were critical of coverage of the quayle 
story they also gave him far lower ratings than his democratic 
counterpart texas sen lloyd bentsen when asked if they were 
qualified to serve as president 
when asked based on what you know about the republican vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle do you think he is qualified to 
serve as president 41 percent said yes and 40 percent said he 
was not 
when the same question was asked about bentsen 62 percent said 
yes and 16 percent said no 
on quayles national guard service only 15 percent said they 
had a less favorable opinion of him because he served in the guard 
during the vietnam war while 82 percent said that did not lower 
their opinion of him 
while people said they thought the news media had overplayed the 
story and been unfair 56 percent also answered in the affirmative 
when asked if they thought it is important that voters learn 
about the details of dan quayles past in order to judge whether he 
would be a good vice president a total of 38 percent said they 
did not think information about his past was relevant to 
determining his ability to serve as vice president 
the survey also showed a steady decline in bushs unfavorable 
ratings 
on the current poll 30 percent of people said they had 
unfavorable opinions of bush a gallup survey a week earlier had 
him getting a negative rating from 33 percent while a month 
earlier it was 40 percent and in may 44 percent 
when asked about democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis 33 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion virtually 
the same figure as in the previous two surveys last may dukakis 
unfavorable rating was 22 percent

bacteria discovered growing at the 
bottom of a lake in what once was the throat of a volcano is the 
strongest evidence yet that warm water is flowing into the lake 
two researchers say 
that discovery by jack dymond and bob collier of oregon state 
university puts them in the middle of a controversy involving 
proposed geothermal energy development near the 1932footdeep 
crater lake which is the main part of a national park 
the national park service and some environmental groups are 
concerned that drilling for underground hot water or steam could 
affect the lake formed when a volcano exploded and collapsed into 
itself 
dymond and collier announced friday after three weeks of 
exploring crater lake in a oneman submarine that they had found 
evidence that hydrothermal vents or hot springs do exist on the 
lake floor 
the main focus of that venting was around some large bacterial 
mats an exotic lifeform that we dont believe exist in other parts 
of the lake dymond said at a news conference 
he said the mats were clearly associated with warm waters that 
are coming up through the rocks 
dymond said temperatures recorded at the mats were almost 11 
degrees warmer than the surrounding water 
california energy co is trying to tap the geothermal potential 
of the area still warm from past volcanic activity but 
legislation that would place crater lake national park on a list of 
other national parks with significant hydrothermal features is 
now pending in congress such a designation could halt drilling 
leases outside the park 
determining if there is a link between the vent area and the 
site of the proposed geothermal energy plant in winema national 
forest some 4 miles away would be an extremely difficult 
problem even with the most modern scientific equipment dymond 
said 
but he emphasized that the bacterial mats are the best evidence 
yet of vents because the mats are a lifeform that is not based on 
photosynthesis but is based on the chemicals and chemical 
energy thats available within the fluids that are coming up from 
within the rocks 
collier described the bacterial mats first found at a depth of 
about 1500 feet as big clumps of cotton plastered over the face 
of a wall 
the potential impact of the research on geothermal development 
would be pure speculation at this time said peter thompson 
chief ranger for the national park service at crater lake 
joe lafleur a geologist with california energy said friday 
that he still doesnt believe there is enough evidence to confirm 
the theory that heated ground water is entering the lake primarily 
filled by rain and snowmelt 
regardless lafleur said the companys proposed geothermal plan 
would not affect the lake or the park 
the research is part of a 10year study of crater lake by the 
park service which will end in 1992 this summers research was 
funded by a 225000 park service grant

it was inevitable even without his national 
guard problems that dan quayle would launch a thousand jokes 
americans love to joke about their public figures especially 
politicians who move from unknown to nationally famous in an 
instant as happened to quayle who was only the junior senator 
from indiana until george bush picked him as his vice presidential 
ticketmate 
quayles name lends itself to puns and the questions that arose 
about whether quayle had used family influence to get into the 
national guard and stay out of the draft invited jokes at his 
expense 
so it was no time at all before americans were asking each other 
what do you get when you cross a hawk with a chicken 
a quayle 
satirist mark russell even before quayle was selected 
commented that bushquayle sounded to him like the name of a 
hunting magazine 
bob hope said he has golf balls older than quayle 
jay leno filling in for johnny carson on nbc said he ran into 
pat roberton and dan quayle swapping war stories 
leno joshed about what guardsmen do you just kind of sit 
around waiting for something to happen if that isnt training for 
the vice presidency i dont know what is 
he disclosed what quayle has that his democratic counterpart 
lloyd bentsen lacks a blow drier and a pulse 
then carson came back on the tonight show just in time to 
offer 
quayle is not going to be helped by that film that comes out 
about his military career 30 seconds over indianapolis 
russell on public television said the gop ticket consists of 
two combat veterans bush a navy pilot in world war ii who was 
shot down in the pacific and dan quayle who was bombed in new 
orleans 
making the rounds in washington were these jokey questions 
why does the chicken cross the road 
to join the national guard 
and 
whats the difference between a turkey a chicken and a quayle 
nothing there is no difference

the second former us soldier 
implicated in a growing international spy scandal provided 
information that led investigators to crack the 10year operation 
a west german newspaper said saturday 
west german prosecutors meanwhile said us officials first 
informed the west germans about the spy case a little more than two 
weeks ago 
the west germanybased ring reportedly sold the soviets secret 
information about nato nuclear missiles pipeline systems and troop 
strength prosecutors are predicting a lengthy inquiry to assess 
the damage to the north atlantic treaty organization 
former us army sgt clyde lee conrad who allegedly led the 
spy ring remained in prison saturday facing espionage charges 
carrying a maximum 10year sentence 
conrad paid another us soldier a fivefigure sum for 
obtaining secret nato information said chief west german 
prosecutor kurt rebmann 
the bonnbased die welt newspaper said the second soldier whose 
name has not been released provided the information that led to 
the arrest 
die welt has found out that no charges have been filed against 
the second american citizen although he is still in the federal 
republic west germany the conservative newspaper added it did 
not elaborate 
alexander prechtel spokesman for rebmann said he could not 
confirm or deny the report 
the americans first informed us about the suspicions against 
conrad on friday aug 12 prechtel told the associated press in 
a telephone interview 
he said us investigators had been trailing conrad long before 
then but he said he did not know the source of the information 
that led investigators to suspect conrad west german officials 
arrested conrad on tuesday 
although officials here say the second american was a soldier 
when he was recruited the washington post quoted administration 
sources in washington as saying he has since left the service 
reports continued to emerge saturday about conrads lavish 
lifestyle 
conrads neighbor johanna horst told the us militarys 
unofficial newspaper stars and stripes that maybe there were a 
few people that were jealous because they had so much money and his 
son had everything 
mrs horst said that conrads west german wife antje had 
lots of gold jewelry and he just gave her a new car with her 
initials in gold 
stars and stripes said its calculations showed conrads monthly 
pension was 900 
the bild newspaper of hamburg said conrads current apartment 
near the base was luxuriously furnished and that he received 
about 1 million for his espionage work 
cbstv quoted west german investigators friday as saying conrad 
may have kept the money in numbered swiss bank accounts 
cbs said investigators found a picture of a europeanwide 
operation centered in conrads home in west germany with other

one of the navys highestranking admirals has 
asked to retire after being disciplined for alleged personal 
misconduct while stationed in italy according to the navy and 
defense sources 
vice adm kendall e moranville until aug 20 the commander of 
the navys 6th fleet was taken to admirals mast on aug 19 
said capt brent baker a navy spokesman 
vice adm moranville was given a punitive letter of reprimand 
at admirals mast baker said the action taken at the 
admirals mast is presently under review vice adm moranville 
has requested retirement 
baker noting that the results of the disciplinary hearing were 
being reviewed by adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval 
operations refused to discuss the nature of the alleged misconduct 
beyond saying it involved several alleged improprieties 
asked about statements by other defense sources that the 
allegations included adultery baker would only say the allegations 
had no connection with vice adm moranvilles operational 
responsibilities as commander 6th fleet 
in fact he continued to do an outstanding job as commander 
6th fleet until relieved on aug 20 baker said but in 
recognition of vice adm moranvilles rights in the matter it 
would be inappropriate to discuss the matter further 
baker said moranville was traveling to washington on friday on 
temporary assignment pending review of his admirals mast the 
spokesman declined to attempt to contact him for comment 
the navys 6th fleet is headquartered in naples italy 
the 56yearold moranville was replaced as the 6th fleet 
commander on aug 20 in a routine longscheduled rotation what 
was not routine however was that moranville departed his old post 
without the navy announcing new orders for him 
the navy rarely proceeds with a change of command involving 
officers at the rank of three stars without having announced the 
next job of the officer who is moving on 
in this case the sources said moranville a veteran pilot who 
fought in vietnam had been widely rumored to be on his way back to 
washington after serving two years as the head of the navy fleet 
that operates in the mediterranean sea 
according to one navy source moranville was thought to be 
returning to the pentagon to become the next deputy chief of naval 
operations for naval warfare 
the navy announced last may 18 the current deputy chief for 
naval warfare vice adm james r hogg had been tapped to become 
the next us representative to the nato military committee the 
service still has not announced hoggs successor 
although moranville has now requested retirement the review of 
the punishment meted out at the admirals mast could still be 
important as is the case with any flag officer of three or 
fourstar rank it is up to the chief of naval operations and the 
navys secretary to decide whether to recommend retirement at the 
grade an officer currently holds 
it is then up to the senate to make the final decision 
moranville won the threestar rank of vice admiral on june 1 
1985 
an admirals mast is a closeddoor nonjudicial proceeding 
during which an admiral reviews the evidence and decides if any 
discipline is warranted 
in this case baker said moranville had appeared at mast on aug 
19 before adm james b busey the commanderinchief of us naval 
forces europe 
baker said the allegations against moranville did not come to 
light until shortly before the vice admiral already had been 
scheduled for routine rotation 
moranville a native of guide rock neb is a highly decorated 
aviator who holds two legion of merit medals the air medal with 
numeral 10 and two navy commendation medal with combat v

when 18th century naturalist 
william bartram explored floridas st johns river he found 
alligators so plentiful it would have been easy to have walked 
across their heads had the animals been harmless 
the reptiles numbers and menacing jaws proved no protection 
against the human onslaught that pushed the florida alligator to 
dangerously low numbers and onto the federal endangered species 
list by the late 1960s 
there were times when the fate of the alligator didnt look 
too good said allan woodward head of the alligator research 
unit for the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
but now there are so many alligators thanks to preservation and 
the animals resilience that a monthlong alligator hunting season 
opens thursday 
i can say weve all been pleasantly surprised by how fast the 
gator has rebounded woodward said 
floridas first widespread hunt in 26 years smallscale 
experimental hunts have been held since 1981 sets a maximum of 15 
alligators for each of 238 license recipients who were selected at 
random from 5000 applications 
its not just sport alligator hides sell for 42 a foot and 
their meat brings about 5 a pound 
wildlife experts credit strong antipoaching laws adopted in 
1970 as instrumental in nearly doubling the alligators population 
in florida to 1 million and removing the animal from the endangered 
species list in 1977 
the lacey act sought to close off lucrative markets for poachers 
by making interstate transportation of alligator products a federal 
offense poaching is now only a state offense with a maximum 
penalty of a 1000 fine or a year in jail 
we made a pretty good living off the gators before they 
stopped it said norm padgett 66 who will guide some of the 
novices in the hunt 
alligators adaptability also contributed to their 
proliferation woodward said 
they can generally tolerate encroachment of homes and highways 
as marsh and deepwater areas diminish alligators have learned to 
thrive in manmade canals or even roadside ditches and golf course 
water hazards 
as long as there is food and water and a place to sun 
themselves thats what makes a gator happy woodward said 
despite their laconic behavior they learn quickly to be wary of 
humans and their keen night vision and acute smell and hearing can 
make them an elusive prey 
theyre not as dumb as some people seem to think their 
skittishness is an asset for their survival woodward said 
officials say the upcoming hunt is confined to areas where 
exceptionally high alligator populations could force the animals to 
relocate or starve 
in texas which resumed alligator hunts in 1984 about 1400 
gators were taken last year louisiana officials reported about 
23800 gators were killed last year in the states 30day season 
which has been held since 1972 
participants in floridas hunt many of them city dwellers who 
have never stalked gators will be armed with harpoons and bang 
sticks which fire a cartridge upon impact with a captured gator 
guns are prohibited because the animals often sink after being shot 
its just an adventure that i never thought id go on said 
thomas alpern a freelance writer from new york city one of only 
two nonflorida residents who won licenses ill just try to have 
fun and get some gators 
alpern will be one of the many inexperienced gator hunters 
hiring veteran trappers as guides 
its a good relationship said mike rafferty who 
exterminates nuisance alligators for the state and plans to guide 
several hunters for the new hunters its excitement for me 
its business

thousands of civil rights demonstrators 
chanting keep hope alive rallied today for the 25th anniversary 
of the martin luther kings march on washington and renewed his 
demands for peace jobs and freedom 
the crowd at the foot of the washington monument was far smaller 
than the quartermillion marchers who jammed the national mall to 
hear kings famous i have a dream speech in 1963 
the us park police made an early estimate of 20000 
demonstrators today but the throng was expected to grow by the 
time democratic nominee michael dukakis and civil rights leader 
jesse jackson deliver their speeches in late afternoon 
president reagan who spent the day campaigning for republican 
candidates in california issued a statement saying america has 
made vast progress toward fully achieving dr kings dream of a 
colorblind society 
as a result reagan said america today is a freer land for 
americans of all backgrounds he added that freedom is our 
unending challenge and our continuing vocation as americans 
but at the rally one speaker after another said kings dream of 
equality is far from being realized 
we are here looking for jobs looking for peace and looking 
for freedom said rep charles rangel dny 
there are some who will say that freedom is reciting the 
pledge of allegiance but that is not what we mean when we say 
freedom rangel added freedom means our children can get an 
education as easily as they can get cocaine in our schools 
jackson appeared briefly and led the rally in his trademark 
chant of keep hope alive 
on the eve of the march jackson told a cheering crowd of black 
activists that dukakis his former rival for the democratic 
nomination and running mate lloyd bentsen provide a choice and a 
chance in november an alternative a chance to change 
jackson dukakis and coretta scott king widow of the slain 
civil rights leader were to address the rally today 
an estimated 250000 people marched in washington on aug 28 
1963the same number of people commemorated the 20th anniversary of 
the march five years ago 
during the 1963 event the largest demonstration in history in 
the nations capital martin luther king outlined his vision of a 
colorblind america where all citizens had equal economic 
political and social opportunity the march spurred congress to 
pass the landmark civil rights act of 1964 
jackson lashed out friday at the republican ticket of vice 
president george bush and sen dan quayle of indiana 
bush and quayle want to privatize the justice department they 
want to privatize foreign policy they want to privatize public 
education said jackson 
and since they like privacy so much i want to help them move 
back into private life jackson told a lunch meeting of the a 
philip randolph institute an organization of trade unionists named 
after the late black labor leader 
neither bush nor quayle had responded to an invitation to join 
the commemoration said ofield dukes a spokesman for the march 
organizers 
a bush spokesman said the gop presidential nominee would be 
campaigning in texas today 
the tide of rhetoric was running against the republicans in 
advance of the march 
aflcio president lane kirkland addressing the same lunch 
audience as jackson said it was black voters more than any 
other factor that held the line against reaganism four years ago 
and turned the tide against it two years ago 
the decisions made by black voters will be no less crucial 
this time around said kirkland whose labor federation voted 
wednesday to endorse dukakis and bentsen 
the plagues of egypt lasted seven years the reagan 
administration has been allotted one more year than that 
kirkland said the job before us is to see that the curse is 
lifted from the land on schedule and that the incumbent and his 
chosen successor get their termination notice on election day 
that will give them 72 days to pack up and clear out which is 
generous they themselves believe that workers deserve no notice at 
all said kirkland alluding to a new law opposed by reagan that 
requires employers to give workers 60 days notice of largescale 
layoffs

the lifestyles of the rich and famous in 
this swank new york suburb may become a little less opulent if some 
city leaders have their way they want to pass a law limiting the 
size of some houses 
i never thought id see the day when the planning and zoning 
commission would say a rich man cannot build a large house in 
greenwich said willis n mills of sms architects of new canaan 
greenwich population 60000 is home to many celebrities and 
corporate leaders including singer diana ross real estate 
magnates donald trump and harry and leona helmsley and tennis star 
ivan lendl it is also where vice president george bush grew up 
the problem suporters of the proposed ordinance say is not the 
big old estates but the huge homes being built on small lots 
small by greenwich standards that is 
peter joyce chairman of the planning and zoning commission 
said the ordinance would allow homes of up to 6500 square feet on 
a twoacre lot and up to 8700 square feet on a fouracre lot it 
also would limit expansion of existing homes 
in the past five years each new house that is being built is 
bulkier than the one before it said jara burnett president of a 
neighborhood group it is distressing to the neighborhood 
there is a loss of sunshine and a definite loss of privacy 
the town had its first hearing on the proposed ordinance last 
week and 150 people showed the heated discussion went late into 
the night another hearing is set for sept 13 
there is a mystique and an ambiance to greenwich that you can 
build the big house said g thomas dadakis a commercial 
realestate developer i dont think the commission has looked at 
the economic impact of this which will happen in 20 years 
dadakis also said the commission shouldnt have selected august 
for the hearing because everybody is up in nantucket or the 
vineyard at this time of year 
first selectman john margenot said he opposes the ordinance 
because its a little like the last man over the bridge syndrome 
i got my house so lets do it now 
the reason houses are getting so big is economic he said 
the land is too expensive and people want to get their money 
out of it by building large homes margenot said friday how 
could a builder charge you 15 million for a threebedroom 
colonial so theyre building a super house with a pool and 
everything 
real estate agents say that even without a house four acres can 
cost 1 million 
i think its a good idea as long as its not so restrictive 
that people in homes cant make some additions and it doesnt 
influence the architecture said bett mccarthy executive 
director of the greenwich board of realtors 
mccarthy said people in greenwich have lost their sense of 
proportion in the size of a lot to a house

major shortages of reliable spare parts are 
plaguing efforts to sustain operations of the b1 bomber fleet 
causing the air force to cannibalize grounded planes to continue 
flight training the general accounting office said saturday 
the air force even with its extraordinary efforts has not 
been able to meet training and readiness objectives the gao 
said reliability shortfalls parts failing faster than expected 
continue to be a major cause of spare parts shortages 
the air force took exception to the report saying that while 
challenges do remain the service is making steady progress 
in assuring adequate spare parts are available for the b1b 
the most important point is that the b1b is performing its 
deterrent mission right now said capt jay defrank an air force 
spokesman today b1b aircraft have trained crews and fly the 
necessary sorties to meet wartime requirements 
the air force has steadily improved the planned rate of b1b 
training flights and expects that trend to continue as the system 
matures and spare parts are delivered he said 
the new gao report comes just days after the congressional 
budget office released estimates that making significant 
improvements in the b1 program could cost up to 34 billion 
the budget office said those improvements once made would 
allow the bomber to fly to targets inside the soviet union its 
original mission 
the reports mark the latest rounds in a longrunning fight 
between the air force which has defended the plane and 
congressional critics who contend it may cost too much in trouble 
and money to improve it 
its very difficult to get a straight story out of the 
pentagon about the planes problems said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee who released the 
latest report on the aircraft from the gao 
he noted that the air force disputed a gao finding that the 
strategic air command reduced the number of missionready crews 
available for the b1 fleet because parts difficulties reduced the 
number of planes available for training 
the defense department said the reason wasnt spare parts but 
the extensive modification of the b1 aspin said and added in 
fact the gao had training reports that cited spare parts shortages 
as the primary cause of the training limitation 
once again the facts seem to contradict pentagon assertions 
about the b1 aspin said 
shortages of b1 bombers ready to fly affect not only training 
but plans for placing bombers on alert to respond to a nuclear 
attack on the united states 
alert status is the bombers reason for being aspin said 
if thats adversely affected and it is here then youve got 
problems 
the ga0 report said some problems have improved since its last 
examination of the b1 bomber program last year 
the air forces and contractors attention to priority parts 
has resolved some parts problems but a more systematic approach 
would ensure early and appropriate attention to the problem 
parts the report said 
two weeks ago aspin said it might be necessary to halt spending 
on the bomber rather than pay for expensive repairs 
the earlier congressional budget office report on the bomber 
said problems center around electronic countermeasures the 
complex computerdriven system that defends the plane against 
attack as it flies on its mission 
the b1 program was killed by president carter in 1977 but 
resurrected by president reagan four years later because reagan 
said the plane was needed as a successor to the aging b52 
the air force has bought 100 b1s and will use the plane in 
conjunction with the socalled stealth b2 bomber as the b52 
replacement in the nations arsenal of strategic weapons the b2 
nicknamed for its capability to evade enemy air defenses will have 
its first public flight in november 
the last b1 was delivered on april 30 the air force said the 
total cost of the program was 273 billion but that figure 
doesnt include any improvements

beneath 40yearold murals depicting the end of 
wars and plagues the envoys of warring iran and iraq entered the 
grand chamber separately and skeptically to sit at opposite tables 
for peace talks 
they faced each other across a gulf of gray carpeting 15 feet 
wide and a another gulf of centuriesold hatred they called each 
other monsieur excellency and colleague but after 
two days of direct and separate talks under un auspices both 
sides remained far apart 
ater eight years of the war and more than a thousand years of 
arabpersian enmity no one expected the long peace process to be 
without pitfalls or its first step in geneva to be easy 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar recessed the talks 
saturday for a day of reflection after both sides set out their 
divergent positions on numerous contentious issues from the 
shattalarab waterway dispute to the repatriation of more than 
80000 prisoners of war 
the talks are to resume sunday 
we are working i must admit at a rather slow pace in an 
atmosphere of mistrust perez de cuellar told reporters saturday 
so far the talks have been highly polite and they have listened 
to each other with patience and i hope understanding 
but while the weekold gulf ceasefire continued iraq was 
continuing poison gas attacks against its own rebellious kurdish 
minority killing 200 and injuring 1000 in the last few days 
kurdish guerrilla leaders told the associated press in nicosia 
the security council in new york meanwhile denounced the 
repeated use of chemical warfare against iran un experts have 
said iraq has ignored un appeals against using the morally 
repugnant weapons banned under international law 
on friday night after the talks were suspended the un chief 
said it is too early to ask for flexibility i hope that after 
reflection perhaps flexibility will start later 
their two days of peace talks which began thursday were the 
first facetoface discussions between the envoys since the gulf 
war began eight years ago in september 1980 
the talks are aimed at consolidating a fragile weekold gulf 
ceasefire and moving toward a comprehensive peace settlement the 
secretarygeneral said the talks could drag on for years if 
problems persist or could lead to a settlement in a few months if 
both parties show the political will 
the iraqi side has not commented but iranian president ali 
khamenei on saturday accused iraq of procrastination and trying 
to degrade the role of the secretarygeneral and the un peace 
resolution 
if iraq continues its way he said talks may go on for 
years and may never come to a conclusion his comments to 
journalists were reported on tehran radio and monitored in nicosia 
after two days of talks both in the same room and in separate 
chambers inevitable problems became evident especially over the 
shattalarab waterway it is the disputed border between iran and 
iraq and the only outlet to the sea for landlocked iraq 
western and middle eastern diplomats said iraq which had scored 
a series of impressive military victories was taking a hard and 
uncompromising position in the talks and seeking to make the 
waterway dispute a high priority on the agenda 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said iran 
badly battered in the war was taking a more cooperative position 
but it too was unyielding on key issues 
iran says the waterway and other issues are not on the agenda 
iraq says that the waterway and other problems must be discussed at 
this time 
the diplomats also said the iraqi side which demanded 
facetoface talks appeared to be annoyed and to feel it was being 
rushed and pressured into accepting a timetable before its 
suspicions about iranian intentions were allayed 
on july 18 after resisting the un peace resolution 598 for 
one year the warweary tehran government abruptly announced it 
would accept a unmonitored ceasefire and pushed for an 
immediate end to hostilities 
then it was iraq which had formally embraced the resolution for 
a year that held back and demanded facetoface talks before a 
ceasefire iraq said it feared iran merely was seeking a temporary 
truce to rebuild its forces before continuing the war it said 
early talks were necessary to test irans good intentions 
iran refused both sides compromised on talks shortly after the 
ceasefire which began aug 20 
on friday velayati broke his silence on the talks and said iran 
insists that the 1975 algiers treaty which gives tehran rights to 
the eastern half of the the shattalarab is valid he said 
observing the treaty unilaterally repudiated by iraq before it 
invaded in 1980 is a fundamental condition for peace 
the secretarygeneral has said that points have been clarified 
in the current discussions and that both sides appear sincere in 
their desire for peace 
but this is a problem that has lasted many centuries he 
said and it is not in one afternoon that we can decide it 
irans culture is persian and iraqs is arab although iran 
shares the moslem religion with the arabs it adheres to the 
minority shiite sect that has been at odds with the predominant 
sunni branch of islam for 1300 years

a federal appeals court has ordered the 
district of columbia to pay 13 million in fines because of its 
failure to alleviate crowded conditions at the cityrun lorton 
reformatory in fairfax county va 
the district has for years been aware of recurrent 
overcrowding in its prison and has not taken steps adequate to 
eradicate the problem the court stated in its decision friday 
the judges also faulted the city for failing to build a sorely 
needed new prison facility or to find other solutions 
the fines were originally imposed by a us district court judge 
last year and have been increasing at a rate of about 5000 per 
day since then the city immediately challenged the fines and 
refused to pay anything until its appeal was ruled upon 
on friday the appeals panel decided the city was out of time 
it is our hope that confronted by the prospect of heavy 
fines the district will at last face up to its responsibilities 
judge spottswood w robinson iii wrote for the court 
he added that the limits of judicial tolerance have been 
reached 
city officials were not expected to appeal the ruling dc 
corrections director hallem williams jr said through a spokesman 
he was disappointed in the courts ruling 
its going to be very expensive for the city to continue 
exceeding the population ceiling at lorton said alan pemberton an 
attorney for the inmates at the central facility at lorton 
the city has been given a population limit of 1125 inmates at 
lortons mediumsecurity central facility which is currently 
housing about 400 extra prisoners

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen on saturday charged vice president george bush with 
an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts for accusing 
michael dukakis of failing to fight drug use 
bentsen wrapping up a fiveday campaign swing with a stop in 
his native texas visited the local sheriffs department and then 
met with reporters to counter the republican accusations 
george bush comes to texas goes to longview and charges mike 
dukakis with being soft on the war on drugs said bentsen that 
is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts 
in massachusetts bentsen said the homicide rate is half the 
national average dukakis has added 1500 law enforcement 
personnel and pushed programs to help victims of crime 
i dont think dukakis record has been surpassed by any 
other state in the nation he said 
bentsen who added the texas stop to his schedule to counter 
bushs campaigning in the state that both call home said the vice 
president himself has failed to stop drugs despite being appointed 
head of a drug interdiction task force by president reagan 
this administration has rhetoric that isnt balanced by the 
realities bentsen said citing attempts by the white house to 
cut back what congress planned to spend on drugs particularly 225 
million in aid that was earmarked for local law enforcement 
theyve been talking tough and cutting back the money at the 
same time he said 
asked about the death penalty bentsen said he supports it but 
dukakis continues to oppose it and he conceded that he and dukakis 
have differences over gun control also although he said dukakis 
does believe in the ultimate right of people to own guns to protect 
their homes or hunt 
i think what you have to look at is beyond some of the 
symbols of tough law enforcement and look at the results he 
said 
much of bentsens campaign trip was spent in the midwest and 
south trying to sell democrats who voted for reagan on the 
massachusetts governor and his positions on national defense 
trade health care and law enforcement 
bentsen told reporters on his campaign plane that he felt he was 
making progress in convincing people dukakis is their man 
i still think we have to work at making it understood on the 
defense issues he said but i think well get our message 
across 
rep bill alexander dark who met with bentsen in hot springs 
where the senator received a raucus enthusiastic welcome on 
friday said the texas senator was an important element in the

here is a statement by president reagan on 
the anniversary of the march on washington issued by the white 
house saturday 
twentyfive years ago about a quarter of a million americans 
gathered in washington to bear witness to a noble cause in their 
speeches in their songs in their prayers those marchers recalled 
americas promise of liberty and opportunity and said it was time 
to make that promise an unblemished reality 
no one was more eloquent on that day than dr martin luther king 
jr speaking from the steps of the lincoln memorial he said that 
he had a dream of freedom justice and hope for every american and 
of a day when all americans would not be judged by the color of 
their skin but by the content of their character 
since that day a quarter of a century ago america has made vast 
progress toward fully achieving dr kings dream of a colorblind 
society as a result america today is a freer land for americans 
of all backgrounds and this nation which lincoln called the last 
best hope of earth is an even more brilliant beacon of freedom 
and hope for peoples throughout the world 
on this anniversary it is fitting that all americans should 
give thanks for that progress and for the work of those who 
sacrificed so much to bring it about and let us remember as well 
that freedom is our unending challenge and our continuing vocation 
as americans this was what the march on washington was about this 
is what we as a nation are about

guards shot to death 36 prisoners and 
wounded 103 others who tried to escape from a rangoon jail in an 
escalation of the unrest in burma staterun radio rangoon said 
today 
more than 500 prisoners also escaped today from a jail in the 
southern city of mergui 350 miles south of the capital the radio 
said 
as the law and order situation in burma deteriorated a popular 
former defense minister and an ailing leader of the communist 
movement joined widespread calls for an interim government to end 
the countrys authoritarian oneparty rule 
radio rangoon said prisoners burned buildings and tried to scale 
the walls at insein jail eight miles north of downtown rangoon in 
their escape bid friday 
by today all the jail buildings had burned to the ground the 
radio reported without saying if the rioting had ended 
so prison personnel had to control the situation and 
unavoidably had to shoot the broadcast said as a result 36 
prisoners were killed and 103 injured 
earlier radio rangoon said seven inmates were killed and at 
least 1000 escaped during uprisings at three prisons across the 
country strikes closed factories government offices and 
transportation 
sources said student activists on friday circulated photographs 
of six men they said were caught in acts of arson bombings and 
shootings the students said the six were identified by their 
military units and confessed to being military intelligence 
officers who were ordered to create disorder 
retired gen tin oo told a rally of about 50000 people in 
downtown rangoon that a transitional government must be formed 
immediately to end the turmoil that has toppled two leaders 
sparked almost daily demonstrations nationwide and killed at least 
112 people 
following the recent public demonstrations against the 
oneparty regime the light of democracy has now been visible 
tin oo said but the final goal has yet to be achieved 
i therefore urge the government to immediately form an interim 
government to ease the situation and allow the interim government 
to prepare for democratic reforms he said 
tin oo said the military must play an important role in 
reestablishing democracy 
tin oo 62 widely respected by both the military and the 
public was removed as defense minister and army chief of staff in 
1976 by strongman ne win at that time he was considered the 
thirdranking member of the ruling hierarchy and had a strong 
following in the military he was later jailed after an 
investigation into an alleged plot against the government 
he said today he was not interested in political office 
when a multiparty system is eventually introduced i for one 
will not stand for any election i wont be in politics i have now 
come in simply because the situation has developed into a serious 
national matter tin oo said 
many retired top military officers attended tin oos rally 
along with buddhist monks and students 
one of burmas former communist leaders thakin soe issued a 
statement from his bed in rangoon general hospital calling for a 
return to multiparty government 
the statement supported the mass demonstrations for democracy 
and demanded the government form an interim government and restore 
peace 
thakin soe 82 formed the prochinese faction of the communist 
party in 1937 he spent most of his life underground but was 
captured after army suppression campaigns in the late 1960s and 
granted amnesty in 1980 his party no longer exists and he is not 
active in the movement 
the situation in burma has deteriorated since president maung 
maung lifted martial law wednesday and security personnel virtually 
disappeared from rangoons streets 
on friday radio rangoon said guards at insein jail fired on 
2000 rioting inmates and some inmates and prison warders were 
injured sources said there could have been many people killed 
but the situation remained confused and they did not believe even 
the government had precise casualty figures 
the british broadcasting corp said the rebellion at insein jail 
occurred friday morning and that about 1000 inmates were killed 
the bbc broadcast monitored in london said 
antigovernment demonstrations are reported to have begun 
at insein jail early in the day when prisoners had left their 
cells for breakfast several who tried to give speeches are said to 
have been shot dead and in the chaos that followed fires were 
started 
as inmates fled to escape the flames it is reported that 
security guards opened fire according to reliable sources about 
1000 people were killed 
the report could not be independently verified 
prodemocracy strikes halted all rail service and union burma 
airways domestic flights closed oil refineries in syriam across 
the rangoon river and in mann in central burma crippled most 
factories of the industries ministry and left foreign ships 
waiting at rangoon port officials said 
most government offices in rangoon were empty people were 
hoarding goods and the price of rice was soaring 
the current turmoil in burma began when ne win who led the 1962 
coup that ended democracy and instituted rigid socialist rule 
resigned and the ruling burma socialist program party named 
hardliner sein lwin to succeed him 
demonstrations began almost immediately against sein lwin 
widely hated for ruthlessly crushing dissent they turned bloody 
aug 8 when security forces fired on protesters sein lwin resigned 
aug 12 
on aug 19 maung maung became burmas first civilian president 
in 26 years

president reagan renewing his plea for aid 
to the nicaraguan contra rebels cautioned today that world peace 
cannot be achieved unless americans stand firm stand tall and 
stand for freedom 
reagan used his weekly radio address to celebrate advances 
toward international peace in several of the worlds hotspots 
which he credited to the efforts of his administration and his 
policy of peace through strength 
he also put in a plug for renewed aid to the contras which is 
stalled in congress 
reagan cited the ceasefire in the persian gulf the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan work toward an agreement for cuban and 
south african withdrawals from angola as well as the improvement 
in relations with the soviet union 
peace is gaining ground but the gains havent just come in 
the last few months its taken seven and a half years of effort 
reagan said we came into office convinced that the word peace is 
just an empty slogan unless the word strength follows hard upon 
it 
the president said the united states has supported noble and 
brave freedom fighters such as the afghan rebels and stood firm 
to the military threat of the soviet union 
once the soviets learned they could not intimidate us or 
cajole us into giving them the advantage they came to the 
bargaining table reagan said they did business because we 
proved we meant business 
reagan complained that it has been almost two years since 
congress has approved any military aid to the rebels battling the 
leftist sandinista government 
heres the results the sandinistas come to the bargaining 
table making promises to bring democracy and end the war and then 
they violate those promises with impunity they feel free to do all 
this because they do not believe that we mean business reagan 
said 
the president warned that there is still time to turn the tide 
in nicaragua the future for world peace is bright if we 
americans continue to stand firm stand tall and stand for 
freedom 
reagans radio address was taped prior to his departure today 
for a round of fund raising for the california republican party 
in the democrats response sen john glenn criticized the 
president for vetoing the 2995 billion pentagon budget bill 
earlier this month accusing him of making rejecting the measure in 
an effort to help the prospects of republican presidential 
candidate george bush 
i am appalled that he chose the wellbeing of his political 
party above the wellbeing of the country said glenn dohio 
following a week in los angeles reagan and his wife nancy were 
then returning to their 688acre ranch north of santa barbara 
the reagans are scheduled to attend two fundraising events 
one for the california gop and the second for reagans congressman 
rep robert lagomarsino rcalif 
earlier this week reagan appeared wednesday at a rally for vice 
president george bush 
the republican party expects to use reagan as much as possible 
in california since the states 47 electoral votes are considered 
crucial for bushs effort for taking the white house in november a 
total of 270 electoral votes are needed to win 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagans first event 
today in thousand oaks calif was arranged for 350400 people 
who either contributed or gathered 5000 per person for the state 
partys campaign coffers 
some 1000 people contributing 200 apiece were to attend the 
second even held for lagomarsino near santa barbara fitzwater 
said 
on tuesday reagan spoke at a fundraising luncheon for sen 
pete wilson rcalif that brought in 500000 fitzwater said

his annual checkups with his allergist and ear nose and throat 
specialist 
his longtime otolaryngologist dr john house determined friday 
that the president continues to suffer from mild hearing loss 
in his left ear and moderate hearing loss in his right ear 
there has been no change in the presidents hearing deficit in 
the past 10 years said a statement issued by white house 
physician dr larry mohr after house conducted his examination 
the statement said the hearing aids reagan wears in both ears 
also were checked and are working perfectly 
fitzwater noted that reagan started to use a new type of hearing 
aid last year and he has had no complaints reagan is able to 
adjust the volume by using a creditcard sized control 
reagan also got a clean bill of health from his allergist who 
determined theres been no essential change in reagans 
sensitivity to pollen fitzwater said friday 
reagan who receives weekly shots to control the allergy was 
examined thursday by his longtime allergist dr ralph bookman and 
the checkup was routine the spokesman said 
the examinations were conducted in the privacy of the 
presidents penthouse suite at the plush century plaza hotel 
outside of appearing at the fundraising events the president 
only left his los angeles hotel suite for private dinners with old 
friends in the evenings 
the president and his wife have no public events scheduled next 
week and are to remain at their secluded mountaintop spread in the

a ruling by minnesotas supreme court 
upholding the states grass tax on illegal drugs will encourage 
other states to enact similar laws as a way to cash in on the sale 
of contraband officials said 
ive had calls from every state in the union said dorothy 
mcclung director of appeals and legal services for the state 
revenue department many were going to wait until the minnesota 
supreme court ruled there may be further action now 
at least 12 other states have already patterned laws after 
minnesotas officials said most recently utah and illinois 
imposed drug taxes this year 
the law upheld by the state supreme court friday allows 
revenue officials to put liens on and seize the property of dealers 
who dont buy revenue stamps and stick them on their packets of 
drugs 
under the 1986 law the state has been busy filing tax liens 
against drug dealers and seizing cars boats jewelry and computers 
from those who forget to buy their red blue and green tax stamps 
so far the state has collected 430000 but has more than 16 
million in outstanding assessments the law triggered 90 challenges 
in state tax court 
weve been upheld people who have been challenging it are 
going to be paying up said chris sanft a collection officer 
with the department of revenue 
the law is similar to those requiring cigarette and alcohol 
manufacturers to display stamps on products they sell violations 
can result in felony charges dealers arrested with drug packages 
that are not stamped can be assessed the tax plus a 100 percent 
penalty regardless of whether they are convicted on drug charges 
the law is the brainchild of robert ebel director of the 
states tax study commission he wanted to use tax policy to make 
life miserable for drug pushers 
i got sick and tired of the pushers he said the grass tax 
seemed like a perfect tool 
people thought it was very funny he said nobody 
understood the concept of taxing narcotics 
under the law drug stamps can be purchased through the mail or 
at the revenue department offices in st paul the state has sold 
only 254 stamps bringing in 2018 the stamps cost 350 for each 
gram of marijuana with a required minimum purchase of 150 worth 
of stamps the rate for a controlled substance including cocaine 
is 200 per gram with minimum purchase of 1400 in stamps 
revenue officials must guarantee confidentiality to those buying 
stamps the right to purchase them anonymously is important to 
ensure that dealers are allowed the constitutional guarantee 
against selfincrimination mcclung said a similar law in south 
dakota was struck down because it offered no such protection 
we learned from the mistakes of others and obviously we did 
it right said state rep bill schreiber chief sponsor of the 
legislation dope peddlers were getting slaps on the hand rather 
than being placed behind bars and taken off the street with the 
grass tax were going to hit them in the pocketbook 
fridays ruling was a loss for william sisson of roseville who 
objected to the states seizure of his recreational vehicle travel 
trailer and lawn tractor after he failed to pay a 113000 
assessment in taxes and penalties for possession of controlled 
substances 
the court ruled that the grass tax law does not violate due 
process rights or the right against selfincrimination its 
uncertain whether the ruling will be appealed

the cost of living in fairfield county is 
among the highest in the country but the cost of dying has become 
pricey too to make matters worse burial plots are running out 
most cemeteries where single plots can cost 1000 and more 
are likely to be filled within 10 or 15 years according to funeral 
home and cemetery managers 
cemeteries are going to become a thing of the past said 
william e magner jr who manages willowbrook cemetery in westport 
harriet steuber president of a group that administers union 
cemetery of norwalk said that once space runs out i guess well 
all have to be cremated and dumped in the sound referring to 
long island sound the stretch of ocean off the connecticut coast 
i dont like to think about it it gives me the creeps 
steuber said 
one solution may lie above ground 
mausoleums up to four stories high are becoming increasingly 
common in the region construction of one such facility by the 
roman catholic diocese of bridgeport began this month at dariens 
st johns cemetery 
its one of the shall we say contemporary modes of burial to 
help meet the lack of space said monsignor nicholas b grieco 
the structures are often multistory units containing hallways 
lined with crypts each floor might contain up to 100 bodies 
think of it as a giant bookcase with slots magner said 
but mausoleums are not costsavers they are generally more 
expensive than belowground burial grieco said other cemetery 
managers say mausoleum interment is about twice the price of 
traditional burial 
sometimes its possible to economize 
at st johns cemetery in norwalk a twograve plot can be used 
for four individuals one on top of another the practice is 
allowed at the discretion of the cemetery which charges 1050 for 
the double plots 
but the cost of the grave site is only the start add to that 
payments to the cemetery for digging the grave and the price of a 
concrete vault plus a foundation for a gravestone and it could 
cost as much as 2000 
cremation which one local funeral director said now accounts 
for about 30 percent of his business can save several hundred 
dollars at the funeral home and there would be no cemetery costs 
basic cremation and transporation services can cost as little as 
160

plan to use when they release a group of endangered california 
condors into the wild in the 1990s 
the andean condors are listed as endangered but there are 
thousands of them while there are only 28 california condors the 
california condors all are in zoos in los angeles and san diego as 
part of a breeding program to reintroduce the species into the wild 
the three andean condors are beginning to adjust to life in a 
cliffside cave north of fillmore said los angeles zoo biologist 
mike wallace who is in charge of the release program 
by early december the birds will likely begin to fly and hunt 
their own food wallace said friday 
the largest bird was apparently homesick and welcomed a visit in 
her enclosure from her puppet mother two of the three andean 
condors were raised by human hand puppets 
if you can imagine a 17pound bird just bouncing all over the 
place and grunting for attention it was way too much for one arm 
with a puppet on it to handle wallace said 
the bird raised by real condor parents has kept her distance 
from the others and ardently protects her territory wallace said 
but she is eating from the puppets nonetheless 
a fourth andean condor died apparently of shock en route to 
the ventura county site last week

on only her second day off in 50 days 
of 12 to 24hour shifts fighting western forest fires dorothy 
hays went dancing 
she and hundreds of others battling this summers recordsetting 
fires are having the time and challenge of their lives 
but for some fatigue is setting in the duration of these giant 
blazes fueled by droughtdried timber and erratic wind has begun 
to take its toll on those cutting and digging on the front lines 
we just dont have enough bodies anymore were spread so 
thin us forest service spokesman bob mchugh said saturday 
firefighters work at least 12 to 16hour shifts for at least 10 
days straight before one day of rest and relaxation is granted 
some find themselves working double shifts 
some end up in crews that employ coyote tactics staying at 
the battle front for up to 36 hours straight until all food and 
supplies are exhausted 
if you get tired fatigue can be dangerous you forget about 
safety said kirby more whos been fighting fires since 1956 
but we hold up our folks are trained for this 
on saturday mores hot shot crew was heading to the top of 
a mountain ridge to clear a 40footwide fire break through the 
forest the work had to be done by hand because the terrain was too 
steep for bulldozers 
it aint the fun although at times it is fun and it sure 
aint the pay i think i do it for the challenge the excitement 
its one hell of a challenge and sometimes you get to say damn 
we stopped it more said 
ms hays a forest service employee from oregon said flames 
twice forced her crew to retreat quickly her crew digs lines at 
the front of the storm creek fire which on friday threatened cooke

whats going to happen next its a lot of fun 
when the crew has to pull double shifts 24 hours straight 
people start dropping like flies said brian spivey 
forest service officials said some crews were losing people who 
had to return to school or jobs that coupled with new fires in 
other parts of the west caused manpower problems about 1200 
soldiers from fort lewis in washington state were being trained to 
join the front lines 
saturday morning some 830 firefighters were in a camp outside 
this tiny town they are paid at varying rates starting at 638

various federal agencies including the forest service and bureau 
of land management depending on their agency and pay scale some 
receive overtime and hazard pay as well

beverages 
they feed you a lot of liquids and a lot of food said james 
begay a navajo firefighter from window rock ariz they keep you

the nuclear regulatory commission fined 
virginia power 100000 for safety violations at its surry nuclear 
plant including an incident in which three workers were exposed to 
radiation because a supervisor lost track of the time 
fridays decision marked the second time this year the plant has 
been fined by the federal agency and the 15th since 1972 
the nrc is concerned that these violations collectively 
indicate significant weaknesses in the overall radiation protection 
program at the surry power station j nelson grace the agencys 
regional administrator said in a letter to the utility 
virginia power said it would not contest the penalty which is 
double the usual fine 
the fines followed two inspections the first was conducted 
during a routine refueling shutdown in may the second was after a 
maintenance worker was exposed to more radiation than allowed by 
federal regulations on may 27 
during the shutdown inspectors said workers at the plant were 
not properly equipped with monitors when entering highradiation 
areas the utility also failed to post warning signs that 
respirators were required and failed to evaluate adequately the 
amount of radioactive material in the air the nrc said 
in the second incident three contract maintenance workers were 
exposed to unusually high radiation doses because a virginia power 
technician lost track of the time and let them stay in a 
highradiation area for longer than they should have virginia 
power spokesman carl f baab said one of the workers was exposed 
to levels higher than nrc standards allow

the palestine liberation organization is 
on the verge of proclaiming an independent palestinian state that 
would recognize israels right to exist within pre1967 boundaries 
senior plo officials say 
the plo also will set up a provisional government to run the 
state in the west bank and gaza strip occupied by israel since 
1967 with yasser arafats old guard sharing leadership for the 
first time with young militants in the territories the officials 
say 
we have the people and we have the land with the declaration 
of our government we would have fulfilled all the prerequisites 
for an independent state chief plo spokesman bassam abu sharif 
said last week in a telephone interview from baghdad 
recognition of israel would challenge the united states refusal 
to talk to the plo washington has said it would deal with the 
group only when it formally accepted the existence of a jewish 
state and renounced terrorism 
but whether plo recognition of israel would signal a breakthough 
in middle east peace efforts is highly questionable at best 
israel has said it will not accept an independent palestinian state 
on its doorstep it refuses to negotiate with the plo which it 
views as a terrorist group 
the provisional government is expected to be announced when the 
450member palestine national council a kind of 
parliamentinexile meets in algiers algeria 
palestinian leaders agreed to hold the meeting originally set 
for sept 20 sometime after september said salah khalaf 
secondincommand to plo chairman yasser arafat he said the delay 
will give the plo leadership time to crystallize a clear and firm 
vision and define the steps it will take 
the plo encouraged by some arab governments has long 
considered forming a governmentinexile an idea given fresh 
impetus by the 8monthold uprising in the occupied territories 
plo officials said the difference between a governmentinexile 
and a provisional government is that the former would involve only 
plo leaders while the latter will include known plo figures and 
leaders from inside the occupied territories 
the inclusion of the young palestinian militants is an 
acknowledgment by the middleaged men who have long run the plo 
that the rebellion in the west bank and gaza has breathed new life 
into the palestinian struggle 
the uprising also produced a new generation of palestinian 
figures who have long been frustrated with arafats failure to 
achieve a homeland and who could eventually challenge his authority 
more than 250 palestinians and four israelis have been killed 
since the uprising began dec 8 
the plo move is a direct result of jordanian king husseins 
abrupt decision last month to sever ammans administrative and 
legal links with the west bank which jordan has run with the tacit 
agreement of the israelis 
husseins action challenged arafat and the plo to take 
responsibility for the west bank and declare an independent 
palestinian state 
were capable of filling any legal or adminstrative vacuum 
created by the jordanian decision abu sharif stressed 
the plo announced last week it would pay the salaries of 21200 
officials and teachers who were laid off by amman 
asked if the plo had secured enough international backing for a 
provisional government abu sharif said the countries that will 
recognize our government will be more than those that recognize 
israel 
the plo is recognized as a liberation movement by 115 countries 
senior plo officials including arafat have been touring arab and 
european capitals to lobby support for a provisional government 
salah khalaf a senior arafat lieutenant and a veteran 
hardliner said this month in vienna that the proclamation of a 
palestinian state will certainly come this year 
asked if the state would recognize israel he said were 
realistic israel is there it exists as far as the political 
reality is concerned 
he earlier told frances journal du dimanche weekly that the 
state would recognize israel 
the new direction in plo thinking emerged earlier this year in a 
document signed by abu sharif one of arafats closest aides which 
advocated recognition of israel and a twostate solution an 
independent palestinian state existing alongside israel 
arafat cannily kept his options open by not endorsing the 
document publicly but the documents emergence raised hopes that a 
new political awareness was creeping into palestinian thinking 
a palestine national council committee drafted a comprehensive 
political program for a provisional government during an aug 1012 
meeting in baghdad and the program is now being debated by the 
plos 15man executive commitee the decisionmaking body 
abu sharif said the document is based on the un general 
assemblys resolution 181 of 1947 which partitioned palestine into 
jewish and arab states 
endorsement of that resolution is in effect recognition of the 
jewish state within pre1967 boundaries 
palestinian hardliners have opposed the idea of a 
governmentinexile or a provisional government arguing that would 
dilute the plos status as a liberation organization committed to 
armed struggle 
but one key opponent george habash of the marxist popular front 
for the liberation of palestine declared in algiers this month 
that it was now time to form a government to run the affairs of the 
5 million palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories

the former head of navy rescueswimmer 
training testified saturday that he never permitted use of force to 
make unwilling students get into the swimming pool for drills 
the testimony came in the courtmartial of lt thomas a 
torchia charged with dereliction of duty for allegedly permitting 
instructors to push a panicstricken recruit back into a pool at 
pensacola naval air station and hold his head under water 
the sailor airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
died in the incident march 2 
i never authorized a person to be placed back in the pool 
said cmdr allan p nesbitt iii torchias predecessor that is 
something that would not occur and did not occur 
but he also said that regulations at the time did allow 
instructors to pull tired students away from the walls of the pool 
during a june investigative hearing a pathologist testified 
that mirecki had a phobia about being pulled under water that fear 
triggered heart failure followed by drowning although it was 
uncertain which caused his death 
one of torchias superiors and four instructors have received 
nonjudicial punishments ranging from a reprimand to reduction in 
rank another instructor faces courtmartial on charges of 
involuntary manslaughter battery and conspiracy to commit battery 
the maximum penalty for torchia on the dereliction of duty 
charge would be a reprimand and loss of two months pay and 
seniority for promotion 
the prosecution contends use of physical force in training is 
illegal but defense lawyer ferdinand salomon argued in his opening 
statement that it is a necessary part of the rescueswimmer course 
salomon a retired navy captain told four officers sitting in 
judgment of torchia that the navy rescuers do not pluck little 
children out of the shallow end of the country club swimming pool 
the training had to be tough 
nesbitt was the first of 25 witnesses scheduled to testify 
during the trial questioned by salomon he testified that it was 
not unusual for swimmers to go to the aid of downed fliers at 
night in heavy seas and high winds 
in an effort to make the training realistic the school 
traditionally permitted instructors to pull students who were 
tired suffering from cramps or believed to be malingering away 
from the wall of the pool if they grabbed it for support nesbitt 
said 
we were training as if we were in the middle of the indian 
ocean that was the philosophy of the school nesbitt said 
there was nothing out there for you to grab a hold on 
in the wake of mireckis death the navy has prohibited 
instructors from touching students at all 
mirecki died during a sincebanned exercise called sharks and 
daisies in which students would swim in a circle and instructors 
would grab them at random pulling on their heads the way a 
panickedstricken drowning person might grab a rescuer

harrison hawkins was a 20yearold busboy when 
he joined 250000 civil rights demonstrators in the 1963 march on 
washington where martin luther king articulated the dreams of black 
americans 
hawkins couldnt eat at the washington restaurant where he 
worked at the time no blacks were served 
i thought something had to be done about segregation he 
said saturday as he joined a rally marking the 25year anniversary 
of that historic day it was the first time id seen that many of 
our people black people get together and do something 
positive 
hawkins now a rigger who handles heavy objects at the 
smithsonian institution said he feels good about the progress 
thats been made on civil rights in the past quartercentury 
although he says more remains to be done 
in the workplace you see petty things hidden things he 
said its not direct discrimination but its there 
another veteran of the 1963 march who was on hand for saturdays 
anniversary event was 76yearold eula johnson of washington who 
sat quietly in a shaded lawn chair listening to the speeches 
she said she left her six children at home and came to the 1963 
march because i felt that negroes were making progress and i 
wanted to be a part of it i was raising children at the time and i 
wanted them to have the opportunities i thought they should have 
mrs johnson said she returned home picked up her youngest 
daughter 7yearold theresa and took her to a rally later that 
day just so she could know how it felt for blacks and white to 
be together 
theresa recently died of a stroke at age 32 but not before she 
became the only black woman to work in her division at a 
telecommunications company mrs johnson said proudly 
she was able to see the hope before she died she said 
naomi and seymour wenner a retired white couple from suburban 
chevy chase md said they too felt drawn to the 1963 march 
it was a great event in my life wenner 75 recalled 
saturday everything was focused on one thing civil rights for 
negroes 
he said that while saturdays rally marked the progress made 
over the past 25 years there are too many groups taking a free 
ride on this justice for janitors this union that union 
socialist workers era theyre not focused it isnt what the 
memory of martin luther king was about 
roselyn smithwithers 38 who is entering howard universitys 
school of divinity saw saturdays rally as a celebration that 
marked her acceptance of kings message after years of anger and 
hurt 
she was 13 and the only black child in her long island ny 
school when her mother brought her to the 1963 march to hear king 
speak 
he articulated the pain that i knew the fears i had and the 
exclusion i was living through she recalled it has been a 
force in my life from that point to this day 
she said that while her 8yearold son doesnt know the racism 
i knew he feels it in other ways 
the major message of this rally is the ongoing fight i dont 
know that its always accepted

the military government ended the state 
of emergency saturday for the first time since president gen 
augusto pinochet took power in a bloody 1973 coup 
the lifting of the legislation that severely restricted civil 
liberties took effect with the publication of government decrees in 
the official bulletin 
interior minister sergio fernandez who last wednesday announced 
the state of emergency would be rescinded said the restrictions 
were no longer needed because order had been reestablished 
throughout chile 
the government lifted the state of emergency and the state of 
disruption of internal peace combined they allowed the government 
to suspend publication and broadcasts by news media restrict 
public gatherings and labor union activities and censor mail and 
communications 
pinochet was empowered to order the arrest and detention of 
opponents for up to 20 days to send into exile citizens considered 
dangerous to internal security to order internal exile for up to 
three months and prevent citizens from freely traveling through 
chile 
the move took effect three days before chiles top military 
leaders meet to nominate a single candidate for a presidential 
referendum to be held in early october 
pinochet who is commander of the army will nominate a 
candidate as will the commanders of the navy air force and 
national police the 72yearold general is widely expected to be 
nominated for reelection so that he can serve until 1997 
the governments move however was viewed by some as helping to 
meet opposition demands for fair play in the presidential 
plebiscite 
but dissidents while acknowledging it will improve the 
political climate say they will wait to see whether the government 
will really allow citizens to exercise the basic liberties that 
they were deprived of during the state of emergency 
genero arriagada a leader of the moderate opposition christian 
democratic party said saturday this does not erase the 15year 
image of gen pinochet as a dictator 
a coalition of socialist groups promptly decided to test the 
governments mood by scheduling an opposition rally in santiago 
next week before the emergency was lifted the military had 
refused to authorize rallies 
another leftist coalition that includes the outlawed communist 
party also set a rally in santiago for sept 11 the day the 
government commemorates the 15th anniversary of the coup that 
toppled elected president salvador allende allende who died 
during the coup killed himself the military junta said 
the political opposition the roman catholic church and several 
foreign governments including the reagan administration have 
urged pinochet to lift the state of a emergency as a basic 
condition for a clean referendum 
in the referendum about 72 million chileans will vote yes 
or no on the single militarypicked candidate if he is 
approved by voters the candidate will start an eightyear term on 
march 11 1989 if rejected an open election will be held within a 
year with pinochet staying in power until then 
no precise date has been announced for the vote but pinochet 
and other government officials say it will be held in early october

i say to you today my friends so even though we face the 
difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a 
dream deeply rooted in the american dream 
i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live 
out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be 
selfevident that all men are created equal 
i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons 
of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able 
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream 
that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with 
the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will 
be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice 
i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in 
a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character 
i have a dream today 
i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious 
racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words 
of interposition and nullification one day right there in alabama 
little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands 
with little white boys and little white girls as sisters and 
brothers 
so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new 
hampshire let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york 
let freedom ring from the heights of the alleghenies of 
pennsylvania let freedom ring from the snow capped rockies of 
colorado let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of 
california but not only that let freedom ring from lookout 
mountain of tennessee let freedom ring from every hill and 
molehill in mississippi from every mountainside let freedom ring 
and when this happens when we allow freedom to ring when we 
let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every state 
and every city we will be able to speed up that day when all of 
gods children black men and white men jews and gentiles 
protestants and catholics will be able to join hands and sing in 
the words of the old negro spiritual 
free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at 
last

tens of thousands of civil rights marchers 
tried to recapture the spirit of martin luther king on the 25th 
anniversary of his i have a dream speech saturday with warnings 
that the struggle to fulfill kings dream of equality is far from 
over 
singing we shall overcome demonstrators led by jesse 
jackson democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and 
coretta scott king widow of the slain civil rights leader marched 
from the washington monument to the lincoln memorial waving signs 
and banners in the hot midday sun 
us park police estimated the crowd at 55000 people far fewer 
than the 250000 who thronged the national mall for kings famous 
oration climaxing the march on washington on aug 28 1963 a crowd 
that was equalled five years ago at a 20th anniversary march 
dukakis appeal to banish all forms of racism and discrimination 
was greeted warmly but it was jackson his former rival for the 
democratic nomination who got the biggest cheers of the day with 
a scathing attack on republican nominee george bush 
george bush is not in washington today jackson said to a 
roar of approval he must not be here for the inauguration next 
january 
the civil rights activist said that a quartercentury ago we 
looked forward to new frontiers under president kennedy 
today reagan and bush attempt to return us to an old 
fortress he said they are trying to rebuild old walls they 
have fought to crush the dream 
jackson made no mention of the dukakis or the democratic ticket 
but he appealed for his predominantly black audience to vote in the 
nov 8 elections 
hands that once picked cotton can now pick mayors 
legislators governors and presidents he declared 
others at the rally echoed jacksons message 
twentyfive years later we are here stronger and more 
determined than ever said rep john conyers dmich 
conyers told the demonstrators they were not marching so jackson 
could be the next president but so that your son or daughter can 
be a future president of the united states 
ethel d smith of washington who had marched in 1963 brought 
her grandson to the demonstration saturday looking back she said 
a whole lot of doors have been opened but weve got a long way 
still to go 
dukakis and jackson met on the front ranks of the march for the 
first time since the massachusetts governor defeated the civil 
rights activist for the democratic nomination at last months party 
convention in atlanta 
jackson led the monument rally in chants of keep hope alive 
and dukakis claimed that only a democratic president could help 
meet the demonstrators demands for full social and economic 
equality 
president reagan spending the day campaigning for republican 
candidates in california issued a statement asserting that since 
king led the landmark march on washington in 1963 america has 
made vast progress toward fully achieving dr kings dream of a 
colorblind society 
as a result reagan said america today is a freer land for 
americans of all backgrounds 
he added on this anniversary it is fitting that all 
americans should give thanks for that progress and for the work of 
those who sacrificed so much to bring it about and let us 
remember as well that freedom is our unending challenge and our 
continuing vocation as americans 
but rep charles rangel dny said the marchers are still 
looking for jobs looking for peace and looking for freedom 
referring to a campaign dispute between dukakis and gop nominee 
george bush rangel said freedom is not about reciting the pledge 
of allegiance rather he said freedom means our children can 
get an education as easily as they can get cocaine in our schools 
from the washington monument the demonstrators retraced kings 
steps to the lincoln memorial where dukakis invoked kings i 
have a dream speech a quartercentury ago 
let us in the words of dr king transform the jangling 
discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood 
dukakis said to polite and friendly applause 
we have to march not just so that some of us can reach the top 
of the hill dukakis said we must march until every american 
has reached the bright sunshine of opportunity until we can stand 
and stand together in the golden glow of our shared dream 
we must march until racism and antisemitism and 
discrimination of all kinds are banished from this land until we 
have a justice department that understands the meaning of the word 
justice until we have a civil rights commission that believes in 
civil rights and until we have a president who understands and 
respects the constitution of the united states 
bush and his running mate dan quayle did not respond to 
invitations to attend the rally march organizers said bush was 
campaigning saturday in texas 
jackson in a speech on the eve of the rally pledged to help 
get out the vote this fall for the democratic ticket of dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen we do have a choice and a chance in november 
jackson said dukakis and bentsen represent an alternative a 
chance to change 
at the time the 1963 demonstration was the biggest ever held in 
washington the peaceful orderly march and kings galvanizing 
speech are credited with spurring congress to pass the landmark 
civil rights act of 1964 under pressure from president johnson 
mrs king said the 1963 march helped break the spine of racial 
segregation in the united states and that today we still have 
a dream of a nation free of the cancer of racism 
the rev joseph e lowery president of the southern christian 
leadership conference recalled that king had said america has 
given the negro people a bad check a check which has come back 
marked insufficient funds 
lowery said the marchers had returned to cash that check 
its not that there are no funds he said its that your 
ways of accounting are faulty we know the money is there if you 
dont cash it now we will be back again and again and again

police on saturday found the body of an 
8yearold jewish boy whose head was crushed with a rock and they 
said palestinian guerrillas may have killed him israel radio 
reported 
israeli troops shot and wounded eight palestinians in clashes 
saturday and four more were wounded in an argument with a fellow 
arab suspected of being an israeli agent hospital officials and 
reporters said 
israel radio said police in the northern port city of haifa 
discovered the jewish boys body in a dry riverbed in his hometown 
of qiryat tivon 10 miles south of haifa 
police found his skull cap a sign that he was religiously 
observant and a large rock that may have been the murder weapon 
near the body the radio said they said palestinian guerrillas 
were suspected but they did not elaborate 
palestinian professional leaders rejected charges that a 
jerusalembased federation of professional groups closed friday by 
authorities had instigated antiisraeli protests 
police said they ordered the building which houses seven 
professional groups including doctors dentists and lawyers shut 
for one year because members were holding meetings under the 
auspices of terror organizations and planned to establish 
alternative structures to the israeli administration 
israel closed a west bank union representing 38 different trades 
on thursday 
the police accusations are groundless said walid asali 
chairman of the arab bar association our objectives are to help 
out members manage a retirement fund plan lectures and license 
new members 
earlier this month israel outlawed the socalled popular 
committees that have sprung up in towns and villages throughout the 
occupied territories 
the foreign ministry meanwhile criticized as onesided the 
un security councils condemnation of israels policy of 
deporting palestinian activists 
the security council on friday demanded that israel allow 33 
activists already expelled to return immediately to their homes 
israel expresses displeasure with the security councils 
onesided approach which ignored israels security needs said 
ministry spokesman alon liel he said israel would continue to use 
deportations selectively 
in the occupied gaza strip the army imposed a curfew on the

laurel was joined by sen juan ponce enrile and representatives 
of several opposition groups including the new society movement of 
ousted president ferdinand marcos in launching the union for 
national action 
i accept the honor and the challenge to lead a coalesced 
opposition against a blundering and immoral administration that has 
betrayed the people laurel told reporters if mrs aquino 
continues to run the government the country is headed for national 
disaster 
the unions platform calls for a new treaty on the status of 
american military bases in the philippines that would provide for a 
gradual phasing out of the facilities over a 10year period 
the union also called for replacing the usstyle presidential 
government with a parliamentary system as well as escalating the 
battle against the communist new peoples army the armed wing of 
the banned communist party of the philippines 
mrs aquino had no reaction to formation of the union on aug 
13 laurel called mrs aquino to resign or he would dissociate 
himself from her government 
one week later mrs aquino said she would remain in office 
until her term expires in 1992 
laurel ran for vice president with mrs aquino against marcos in 
the 1986 elections the marcosdominated parliament ruled that 
marcos had won the election but he fled the country for hawaii on 
feb 25 1986 after a civilianmilitary uprising 
mrs aquino named laurel prime minister in her government but 
abolished the post soon afterward since then laurel has 
complained he has been ignored by mrs aquinos advisers

faced the deepest crisis in its history because of a crisis of 
leadership he is the only opposition figure in the 23member

stretch of highway on the island of basilan 560 miles south of 
manila according to lt col porcawa dia regional military 
commander 
dia said three vehicles carrying 50 people bound for zamboanga 
were stopped by about 30 suspected members of the moro national 
liberation front 
the guerrillas belong to the main faction of moslem separatist 
rebels seeking independence for the southern island of mindanao 
dia said the rebels ordered the passengers to leave the three 
vehicles then set a bus and a car on fire before soldiers arrived 
he said 
a gunfight broke out during which eight of the passengers 
escaped and 14 others were rescued by soldiers dia said he said

she stepped out onto the high bar with a 
look of determination quivering while she tried to steady herself 
the crowd gasped when she lost her footing then broke into cheers 
when she twirled her tail around the bar saving herself from a 
15inch drop 
welcome to the second annual rat olympics a lesson in patience 
sensitivity and positive reinforcement 
since june about 50 psychology students at kalamazoo college 
have been training 11 white pinkeyed rats to inch their way 
across the 2footlong quarterinchwide wooden bar jump hurdles 
and climb a 5foot vertical screen 
with a piece of chocolate chip cookie as bait the beadyeyed 
entrants in the trirathlon also had to climb a fivestep ladder 
and make their way through a tunnel and a pan filled with an inch 
of water to which most rats have an aversion 
i was really afraid of them when we started but theyre 
really very sweet said junior robin lake 19 of traverse city 
as her rat mimi crawled across her shoulders 
professor lyn raible said it all started as a way to teach her 
students about learning and conditioning but it turned into an 
ethics lesson 
in some of my classes we do live animal experiments with the 
rats and i found this teaches sensitivity she said they 
realize that rats have personalities and feelings and it makes 
them think twice before they do their experiment 
though some students in the fourperson teams refused to touch 
the rats at first almost all the racing rodents found homes with 
their trainers after fridays competition 
weve been together about 10 weeks and weve gotten very 
close junior tom remble 20 of st joseph said of his rat who 
wore a superman cape and had her tail painted red white and blue 
most people think of rats as mean but shes very peaceful and 
affectionate he said 
because pets arent allowed in dormitory rooms rembles rat 
like many of her rivals will be sent to parents asked if he 
thinks his parents will be pleased with their new pet remble said 
i dont know but im sure my cats will be 
none of the rats will go back to the lab for experiments 
my students would kill me said raible who has been 
researching brain chemicals that affect rats sexual behavior 
in fact the small liberal arts college rolled out the red 
carpet for the rodents there was an opening ceremony and 
procession of students to the tune of chariots of fire a 
torchcarrying student wearing pointed ears and a tail was led down 
a grassy hill by raible carrying a package of oreos 
the competitors all were female because raible said male rats 
are too ugly fat and lazy 
blackrobed judges held up numbers to rate each competitor no 
overall winner was announced but the crowd of about 75 seemed to 
agree the champion was elle dopa named after ldopa a drug used 
to substitute for dopamine a brain chemical 
this may be just the beginning of the path to stardom for 
rodents with fourlegged fortitude 
raible said she has twice sent videotapes to talk show host 
david letterman with the hope of getting the rats a spot on his 
stupid pet tricks segment both times she was rejected because the 
show doesnt consider rats pets 
can you imagine she asked

howls of protests over train whistles in chicago 
suburbs have reached the ears of the illinois commerce commission 
which plans to take up the issue next week 
a recently enacted state law requires trains to signal their 
approach at all railroad grade crossings but as train engineers 
began complying and tooting at all intersections with roadways 
suburban residents found themselves suffering through sleepless 
nights and angry days 
im extremely tired and extremely annoyed mary krippner of 
westmont said last week whos going to pay for my nervous 
breakdown 
the commission on friday authorized hearings beginning tuesday 
on possible exemptions to the new law 
in the meantime a du page county judges temporary order 
remains in effect barring four major railroads burlington 
northern chicago amp north western soo line and wisconsin central 
from sounding whistles in some suburban areas 
some of the railroads are interpreting the judges 10day order 
issued thursday as stretching beyond du page county to the west 
of chicago so they also have been keeping horns quiet in the 
northern and southern suburbs 
about 500 of the states 13000 railroad crossings are at issue 
in the icc hearings which are expected to run at least two days 
said bernard morris chief railroad engineer for the icc morris 
will act as hearing officer and make a recommendation to the 
sevenmember commission 
i think were going to hear a lot of people wanting to say 
they dont like whistles or they dont want whistles near their 
church or near their hospital because its a nuisance morris 
said friday 
he cautioned however that the laws wording may limit such 
evidence 
it says exemptions can be granted if the public is 
reasonably and sufficiently protected morris said it doesnt 
say anything about not being able to sleep 
asked whether the state legislature went too far in passing a 
blanket whistleblowing requirment icc chairwoman mary meg 
bushnell said i dont think they went overboard i think they 
didnt realize perhaps what the consequences of this would be 
alfred ronan the state representative who proposed the 
whistleblowing requirement has defended it as a crucial safety 
measure 
i was trying to protect the people who dont pay attention 
when they go through train stops and id do it again he once

it takes a lot to keep a 
force of 1000 firefighters going and karla mcnary can lay her 
hands on just about everything they might need 
mcnary is the distribution leader for the wolf lake fire camp 
established at canyon to funnel firefighters onto the wolf lake 
fire in yellowstone 
from row after row of cardboard boxes stacked in her blue and 
white tent she can pull sleeping bags fire resistant clothing 
gloves goggles hard hats and fire hoses of which more than 
12000 feet was dispensed friday alone 
there are also shovels pulaskis a tool that is a cross between 
an ax and a hoe mres meals ready to eat and fire shelters 
behind these piles are more piles of ground sheets chainsaw kits 
chainsaw oil earplugs water jugs files to sharpen the tools and 
garbage cans 
and then there are the drip torches for starting backfires and 
kerosene lamps to see by when you come off the fire lines after 
sundown 
mcnary also has to keep track of all that gear 
if it doesnt come back then the crew that had it last is 
responsible for it she said in an interview late friday you 
have to know exactly whos got it when theyre taking it and when 
theyre bringing it back 
whats the most popular item in her inventory sleeping bags 
and not your average down or synthetic bag these are made out of 
paper according to mcnary 
they go like wildfire she said realizing too late the pun 
she made 
although made of paper the bags endure a dry cleaning after one 
use and are ready to go again 
after that one cleaning they throw them in the garbage 
said mcnary theyre just paper regular paper its not much 
but itll keep you warm 
but for real warmth in yellowstone where the night temperatures 
in late august can dip into the low 30s theres nothing like a 
cardboard box she said 
a lot of people to keep really warm theyll sleep in 
boxes mcnary said explaining that the boxes left after the 
equipment is doled out are quite popular with the firefighters

michael dukakis linked up with onetime democratic presidential 
challenger jesse jackson on saturday for a quartercentury tribute 
to martin luther king jr on the steamy hot steps of the lincoln 
memorial 
george bush campaigned in texas where his spokeswoman said he 
had already agreed to address a marine veterans group in dallas 
before being invited to participate in the washington march 
press secretary shelia tate said the bush campaign sent regrets 
and dispatched bushs son marvin to attend the march 
without mentioning the reagan administration by name dukakis 
said many of the late civil rights leaders dreams remain 
unfulfilled and promised to work to change that if elected 
president 
we cannot look back or look down when we know that the cancer 
of racism and bigotry is still with us and that over the healed 
wounds of the past new wounds are opening in our cities and in our 
suburbs he said 
we have to look up because that march for good jobs and real 
freedom didnt end that august afternoon 25 years ago we have to 
march on 
a crowd estimated by us park police at about 30000 gave 
dukakis a friendly reception and there were chants of where is 
george after his speech 
however the warmest response was for jackson who did not speak 
until after dukakis had departed and did not mention the democratic 
presidential ticket specifically 
but jackson urged his followers to vote and it was clear it did 
not mean for them to vote for the republican ticket 
george bush is not in washington today he said he must 
not be here for the inauguration next january 
bushs decision to campaign in texas emphasized his 
determination to go allout to win what his campaign chief termed 
the must win state of all must win states 
i mean to run hard to run hard i mean to fight hard and i 
mean to win texas bush told a rally of party workers at houston 
hotel 
the vice president praised his running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana and told the qroup he is going to be a tremendous asset 
to this ticket and i am proud to have placed my bet on the future 
we have a new generation bush said this man will measure 
up 
he then left for a couple of late afternoon stops with campaign 
chairman james baker it was bushs first trip to texas since bush 
was annointed the republican presidential nominee in new orleans 
less than two weeks ago 
baker told reporters the election is one hell of a lot more 
winnable for bush than a lot of sages were saying just two weeks 
ago 
if there was ever a must state for a presidential election 
texas is it in 1988 baker added 
as if to underscore that strategic assessment the democratic 
vice presidential nominee sen lloyd bentsen wrapped up a 
fiveday campaign swing with an appearance at austin the capital 
of his home state before flying back to washington he attacked 
bush for what he termed an outrageous misrepresentation about 
dukakis 
george bush comes to texas goes to longview and charges mike 
dukakis with being soft on the war on drugs said bentsen that 
is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts 
bentsen said the homicide rate in massachusetts under dukakis 
governorship is half the national average that dukakis has added 
1500 law enforcement personnel and has pushed programs to help 
victims of crime 
i dont think dukakis record has been surpassed by any 
other state in the nation he said 
meanwhile quayle was in california expressing confidence that 
his campaign is getting off the dime after being bogged down by 
questions about his national guard service 
at a news conference in irvine quayle said he was pleased with 
the response from the crowds during his first week on the campaign 
trail by himself 
i really feel a great deal of enthusiasm beginning to build 
he said 
quayle was asked about comments by his wife marilyn aired 
friday night on abcs 2020 suggesting that the media was out 
to get her husband because he is a conservative 
i am not going to disagree with marilyn marilyn is my best 
adviser and my strongest supporter quayle said 
pressed to say whether he believed the media was against him 
quayle said i just hope that the press will begin to focus on 
the issues of this campaign 
mrs quayle said she stood by her comments on the television 
interview that the press had engaged in overkill in its 
coverage of her husband in new orleans last week she said we 
had a real feeding frenzy by media which has abated only 
slightly 
quayle traveled to several rallies in california and a state 
fair in sacramento

fbi agents aided by a state senate 
staff member mounted a twoyear sting to uncover corruption in the 
legislature forming dummy companies that lured lawmakers with 
bribes a lawyer close to the investigation says 
the investigation began when john a shahabian facing 
allegations of wrongdoing arising out of an earlier fbi probe 
agreed to cooperate with the fbi and assisted in recording 
legislators engaged in allegedly illegal acts donald heller 
shahabians attorney said friday 
shahabian was snared in the earlier fbi sting and told 
authorities he would cooperate in an expanded probe into bribery 
and extortion heller said 
for years and years there has been widespread corruption in 
the legislature a cesspool heller said my client was 
initially caught up in it and came forward and cooperated for two 
years 
lawmakers who were rumored to be on the take were offered 
illicit donations heller added and sure enough they took the 
bait he described the sting as creative and inventive 
shahabian a staff member of the state senate elections 
committee pretended to be a part owner of one of the dummy 
companies peachstate capital west a shadowy venture capital 
company located above a store 1 blocks from the capitol the other 
two owners of the company were fbi agents heller said 
heller did not identify the lawmakers who were videotaped but 
said he expected dozens of indictments soon he did not 
elaborate 
terry knowles agent in charge of the sacramento fbi office 
said arrests in the case were not expected at the present time 
late wednesday and early thursday 30 federal agents with 
warrants descended on the capitol and searched the offices of four 
lawmakers and their aides seeking materials related to two obscure 
bills both measures had been vetoed by gov george deukmejian 
who unaware of the sting operation described them as unwarranted 
special interest bills 
capitol sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
four legislators whose offices were searched were democratic 
assemblywoman gwen moore of los angeles who wrote the two bills 
republican assemblymen frank hill of whittier and pat nolan of 
glendale and democratic sen joseph montoya of el monte 
nolan the republican leader of the assembly offered to resign 
his leadership post friday at a closeddoor meeting in the wake of 
the investigation the san francisco examiner reported saturday 
heller made the comments in a telephone interview from hawaii 
where he was on vacation shahabian who has declined to speak with 
reporters is also on a short vacation heller said

its been one year of quiet persistence in 
jail for plastic surgeon j elizabeth morgan who holds the keys to 
her own freedom in the knowledge of her daughters whereabouts 
although she has committed no crime on sunday dr morgan of 
mclean va who holds degrees from harvard yale and tufts will 
mark her first anniversary in a solitary cell at the district of 
columbia jail 
dc superior court judge herbert b dixon jr ordered her 
jailed indefinitely on contempt of court charges until she produces 
her 6yearold daughter hilary the centerpiece of a bitter battle 
between morgan and her former husband oral surgeon eric foretich 
of arlington va 
the thought of giving up would not cross my mind said the 
slightly eccentric articulate morgan in a recent interview i do 
my share of crying but i cannot think of a more sinful thing to 
do than trash hilary for my personal comfort 
morgan 41 hid the girl one year ago rather than allow hilary 
to have unsupervised visits with foretich whom she calls 
unstable unpredictable and violent morgan claims foretich 
has been sexually abusing the girl and her halfsister from a 
previous marriage since before hilary was 2 
morgans claims have been buttressed by the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals in virginia which recently directed a lower court 
to examine previously inadmissable testimony from doctors and 
psychiatrists that hilary has been sexually abused 
that court has been hearing civil suits including morgans 
damages suit against foretich and his countersuit of defamation 
because the couple lived in virginia during their marriage but 
since morgan is now a washington dc resident dixon has 
jurisdiction over the custody case and he has refused to rule on 
the allegations of sexual abuse 
foretich agrees that his daughter has been molested but he says 
it was morgan who committed the atrocities against his daughter 
its sick he said 
although foretich recently agreed to supervised visits with his 
daughter were she to be found morgan refuses to allow it under 
any conditions except at the request of hilary and her therapist 
i dont see why a child should have supervised visits with 
their rapist she said i think thats sick 
foretich whose voice becomes forceful with emotion when 
discussing the case says he doesnt believe the authorities are 
trying hard enough to find his daughter hes offering a 2000 
reward to whoever finds hilary who turned 6 last week 
if elizabeth morgan really loved this child why would she put 
her off somewhere away from both parents he asked 
morgan says hilary is safe and doing well but will say nothing 
more 
i dont tell anybody anything to do with her she said 
for me to risk her safety is to risk her life she added 
explaining that hilary has been occasionally suicidal and would not 
be able to handle more court battles and forced visits with her 
father 
it would certainly be the end of her sanity 
foretich doesnt agree she loved being with me she wanted to 
be with me hilary and i have been the victims of all this he 
said 
the bitter divorce and custody battles have been dragging on 
since 1982 when morgan left foretichs great falls va home a 
week before hilary was born the mother was granted custody and 
foretich received liberal visitation rights 
morgan first reported that hilary was being abused in 1984 two 
years later she refused to let foretich visit his daughter 
morgans current jail term marks the third time she has been 
incarcerated for contempt 
dixon has ruled that morgan could remain in jail until hilary 
turns 18 lawyers are appealing that decision 
former maryland attorney general stephen sachs one of morgans 
attorneys says the purpose of contempt of court jailings is to 
coerce a person to divulge information and its obvious morgan 
will not reveal her daughters whereabouts 
if the goal is to punish her she has the right to a 
trial sachs said 
the attorney also complains about the secretive nature of 
morgans legal proceedings and wants future hearings to be public 
with no evidence or testimony supressed 
experts in the child abuse profession say it is unusual for a 
mother to go to jail for so long to protect a child but child 
abuse cases are often entrenched in ambiguities 
in general cases of sexual abuse are very hard to try and 
very hard to prove said anne cohn executive director of the 
chicagobased national committee for the prevention of child abuse 
so in that sense dr morgans case is not unusual 
local child abuse experts generally believe morgans story 
not that they necessarily believe what shes done is the right 
thing said joan danzansky executive director of the 
organizations washington chapter 
in the end its the rare child who isnt better off having 
some sort of relationship with both parents cohn explained 
the national organization for women has lobbied in morgans

graying but for the most part still true to 
their ideals activists who demonstrated at the tumultuous 1968 
democratic national convention gathered saturday to commemorate the 
20th anniversary of the protests 
it took quite a while to get here but here we are said 
former yippie abbie hoffman 
about 400 people gathered in the 17000seat international 
amphitheater where the convention was held thenchicago mayor 
richard j daley banned the demonstrators from the facility in 1968 
most of the participants including former students for a 
democratic society president carl oglesby and former chicago seven 
defendants hoffman and david dellinger agreed that while the 
goals they sought remain largely unfulfilled their movement and 
the chicago protests had a positive effect on the country 
what i saw and experienced in chicago the police unleashed 
like stormtroopers seeing that repression seeing that 
violence and then seeing the response the fact that mayor daley 
didnt scare us out of chicago for the first time i thought 
im not a radical im not a reformer im a revolutionary said 
stew albert 
we caused a lot of things to actually happen and change we 
broke down a lot of the racial barriers added bobby seale who 
was ordered bound and gagged when he stood trial on conspiracy 
charges stemming from the demonstrations 
im very proud of my history i dont regret one nickel of 
it said seale 51 now involved in minority recruitment at 
temple university in philadelphia 
i think we had a tremendous impact in sticking up for the 
right to protest said hoffman 51 a perennial activist who 
calls himself an american dissident 
the incidents that happened here changed the way that police 
forces are trained in america today hoffman said 
during the 1968 convention hundreds of protesters fought with 
police in downtown grant park after daley said they would not be 
allowed to march to the amphitheater 
eight protest leaders were indicted on charges of conspiracy to 
incite violence they were known as the chicago seven because seale 
was tried separately 
the atmosphere in the hall saturday was a far cry from aug 26 
1968 when the democratic convention formally opened this time the 
hall houses scores of sympathizers for those who were once barred 
and many of them set up tables to promote causes ranging from 
maoists to the free puerto rico committee and the league of women 
voters 
only about 40 of those attending the conference participated in 
the protests others said they were there for a sense of history 
theyre real history makers that ive studied said valerie 
yoshimura a junior at the university of california at santa 
barbara who was born two weeks before the convention we have a 
lot to learn from them

eugene daniell a selfproclaimed champion 
of the underdog who once teargassed the new york stock exchange 
and was known for his oratory in the state legislature has died at 
age 83 
the maverick nineterm state representative died friday said 
franklin memorial hospital spokeswoman marcia hansen she would not 
disclose the cause of death 
daniell who retired from the legislature in 1986 practiced a 
stirring oratory style compared to that of unsuccessful 
turnofthecentury presidential candidate william jennings bryan 
but his politics were like those of louisianas populist us 
senator and governor huey long with whom daniell briefly worked 
until long was assassinated in 1935 
throughout his career daniell fought for redistributing 
americas wealth in 1933 he opened tear gas canisters near 
ventilators in the new york stock exchange and then waited to be 
arrested unable to come up with a 500 fine daniell served 30 
days in jail 
as i saw it that was the one institution that contributed 
more than anything to the imbalance daniell said in a 1985 
interview 
after long died daniell established a oneman law office in 
franklin 
he was elected to his first of seven terms as mayor in 1948 the 
following year he was elected to the state senate for one term he 
first won election to the house in 1961 he also waged several 
unsuccessful campaigns for congress on shoestring budgets 
he was known for having compared president reagan to hitler 
pushing a resolution to recommend impeaching president nixon and 
wearing his army uniform as he marched in demonstrations against 
the vietnam war 
after his wife eva died in 1982 after much suffering daniell 
fought for living will legislation allowing people to sign a 
document barring the use of extraordinary means to continue life 
the legislature eventually overrode gov john sununus veto of the 
measure 
he is survived by a son eugene daniell of concord no funeral

milliondollar week of republican fundraising in his crucial home 
state of california warned saturday that democrats threaten to 
send the ship of state into drydock 
our economy and our national defenses are strong but theyre 
also under threat reagan said in a speech at a 200perperson 
moneyraising event for rep robert lagomarsino the congressman 
from his district 
theyre threatened by those who want to use the law to 
engineer the changes in our nation that american people do not need 
and do not want and that would hurt he said 
after his speech on a spacious estate near santa barbara the 
president left for his 688acre ranch north of here ending a 
fiveday outing to los angeles he will return to washington after

republicans who contributed or raised 5000 for the california 
gop on his way to los angeles monday he spoke at a fundraiser 
for sen pete wilson 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the events raised 
about 1 million altogether reagan is expected to play a key role 
in the campaign for californias 47 electoral votes 
in his speech for lagomarsino reagan commented for the first 
time on the dispute over democratic presidential nominee michael s 
dukakis veto of a proposed massachusetts law that would have 
required teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance 
touching on a massachusetts program giving furloughs to 
prisoners for which dukakis has been under fire in the campaign 
the president asked and how about a furlough for the pledge of 
allegiance 
reagan also reiterated his support for the stand taken by vice 
president george bush the republican nominee in support of 
reagans opposition to tax increases 
speaking to californians accustomed to seeing tax measures 
appear on the ballot under proposition numbers he said george 
bush is going to americans with his own proposition number one no 
new taxes 
our liberal friends seem to love to fiddle around making big 
government even bigger the president said and then before 
you know it theyve fiddled around so much that theyve sent the 
ship of state into drydock 
reagan conceded that lagomarsino has a tough race his 
toughest ever from democratic challenger california state sen 
gary k hart but he said the job bob has done these past 14 
years has earned my vote this year

sweltering sunny weather on a broad lawn of the estate overlooking 
the pacific ocean he wore a jacket but no tie and apologized for 
this saying he had just come from an event for which casual attire 
was prescribed

such as pledge to resist us war in central america there 
also were friendly placards such as santa barbara loves the 
gipper 
in his weekly radio address the president spoke of a move 
toward peace that shows how successful this nations commitment to 
peace through strength has been 
expanding on a theme he is expected to sound throughout the 
campaign he said peace is a godly thing but men are seldom 
godly what weve learned is that peace is hard to achieve unless 
the forces of good have the strength to stand firmly for it 
ticking off areas of the world in which he said there have been 
advances toward peace he added there is still time to turn the 
tide in nicaragua 
sen john glenn delivered the democrats response accusing the 
president of heeding political pressures and in the process 
weakening the nations defenses when he vetoed the 2995 billion 
military budget bill on aug 3 
the ohio lawmaker noted that reagans veto came despite 
recommendations to sign the measure from defense secretary frank 
carlucci and national security adviser colin powell 
his actions should be condemned by all americans who value a 
strong national defense glenn said of reagans decision 
congress will resume consideration of reagans request for 
renewed aid to nicaraguan rebels when it returns to session after 
labor day 
reagan recorded his radio speech before leaving los angeles 
in a statement issued in los angeles he noted the 25th 
anniversary of the civil rights march on washingtgon led by martin 
luther king jr and said since that day a quarter century ago

a group of navajo indians led by tribal 
chairman peter macdonald defied the hopi tribe and a congressional 
mandate saturday and began repairing homes located on hopi land 
the navajohopi relocation act of 1974 partitioned some 18 
million acres of land that once was occupied by both tribes the 
hopis have left land assigned to the navajos but about 200 navajo 
families refuse to leave land now designated as hopi 
federal officials and hopi chairman ivan sidney contended the 
navajos should get permission from the hopi tribe before making 
repairs to those homes but macdonald said navajos would not 
consent to relocation as the hopis wanted in return for permission 
macdonald wearing a brand new tool belt and blue jeans rather 
than his customary threepiece suit watched as tribal employees 
and volunteers put a new roof and windows in a home owned by 
jeannie paddock 75 
other volunteers worked on homes elsewhere on the land the 
ownership of which has been disputed by the two tribes for more 
than a century some repair plans went awry as rain turned dirt 
roads into mud bogs and two cement mixers sank to their hubs 
macdonald said crews would continue work sunday and monday 
beginning with homes in the greatest state of disrepair 
these families have a right to repair their houses he said 
these people dont want to leave they believe they belong here 
he added that he feared navajo children and elderly tribal 
members could die if their homes were not repaired before the onset 
of a cold winter 
sidney said macdonald should provide homes on navajo land if 
hes so concerned about his tribes wellbeing 
macdonald talks about relieving hardships and building houses 
on our land but if he is really worried about relieving hardships 
why cant he build them homes on his side sidney said friday 
but macdonald said people like mrs paddock do not want to leave 
their traditional homes and mrs paddock speaking through an 
interpreter agreed 
for many years i have been asking for repairs she said 
this is our land this is where we were born and were going to 
resist were not going anywhere 
sidney has said the hopis will go to court to seek a restraining 
order against macdonald

police searched saturday for an inmate wanted on 
murder charges who escaped from jail using a john dillinger 
special a fake gun carved from a bar of soap that fooled a 
guard 
victor thomas 27 told cook county jail officials that he was 
ill and wanted to go to cermak memorial hospital which is 
connected to the jail by a tunnel said robert glotz assistant 
director of the county corrections department 
in the basement of the hospital the inmate pulled out a weapon 
made of soap and threatened the unarmed guard escorting him glotz 
said 
thomas tied up the guard then took his uniform badge and 
wallet and walked out of the jail complex friday he said 
people here are saying he got out using the john dillinger 
special said an officer in the cook county sheriffs department 
who spoke saturday by telephone on condition of anonymity there 
are many ways out and he used the oldest ruse the phony gun 
routine and it worked 
it was quite a work of art said the officer describing the 
soapbar gun it was black with some light blue highlighting 
probably made with a marker pen it was approximately the size of 
25caliber automatic pistol with a delicately carved barrel 
grooves and a trigger guard 
according to legend dillinger escaped from a jail in crown 
point ind in 1934 after brandishing a fake gun that he carved 
out of wood the legend lives though it later was revealed 
dillinger accomplished the escape with a real 45caliber automatic 
glotz said thomas had been in jail for a year on three armed 
robbery charges his soap gun was recovered a block from the jail 
thomas was in jail on three counts of armed robbery police 
said he also is wanted in california for the march 3 1987 
slaying of three alleged drug dealers who were strangled or stabbed 
to death in the los angeles area police said 
about 40 officers were looking for thomas on saturday 
interviewing acquaintances and checking areas thomas has been known 
to frequent said police sgt tom whalen 
according to the encyclopedia of american crime the story 
that dillinger used a wooden gun to escape was a hoax to cover up 
the fact that the real gun had been smuggled into the jail by an 
indiana judge bribed by dillingers lawyer

michael dukakis joined thousands saturday to 
mark the 25th anniversary of martin luther king jrs march on 
washington and promised to pursue the slain civil rights leaders 
famous dream if elected president 
we must march until we reach the finish line at the top of the 
hill and there we will find no barriers separating us one from the 
other dukakis told a rally at the lincoln memorial after the 
anniversary march 
there we will merge the reality of america with the promise 
of america he said there together together we will fulfill 
the american dream 
dukakis and his wife kitty marched from the washington 
monument to the lincoln memorial in a row of dignitaries that 
included kings widow coretta scott king jesse jackson dukakiss 
former rival in the democratic presidential race naacp executive 
director benjamin hooks the rev joseph lowery and atlanta mayor 
andrew young 
dukakis saluted mrs king and his former rival referring to 
jackson as a man able to lift the hopes and spirits of millions 
of americans with the energy and vision and the excitement of his 
campaign dr king must be very proud of jesse jackson 
dukakis was wellreceived by the gathering and there were chants 
of where is george after dukakis completed his speech 
he also took time before the speech to meet with representatives 
of several black media outlets promising to bring more jackson 
supporters into his campaign and to campaign hard for the black 
vote 
jackson who did not speak until after dukakis had departed did 
not mention the democratic presidential ticket specifically 
but he urged his followers to vote and it was clear it did not 
mean for them to vote for the republican ticket 
george bush is not in washington today he said he must 
not be here for the inauguration next january 
in rhetoric unlike any dukakis had delivered previously to a 
predominantly black audience the massachusetts governor likened 
king to lincoln using uncharacteristically emotional language in 
his tribute 
like the man whose memorial we gather at today martin luther 
king jr changed the course of history dukakis said and as 
abraham lincoln in his time defined our nations course at 
gettysburg so dr king in his time defined americas soul 
dukakis continued the dream he shared with us that afternoon 
25 years ago was more powerful than any single cause it soared 
above all barriers of race and creed and it has endured and 
expanded through time because it was born of a profound optimism 
about life it was nurtured by faith in the promise of america it 
was sustained by his belief that we americans for all our 
wonderful diversity and it is a wonderful diversity are one 
people one nation one community 
dukakis recalled racial beatings and bombings and the 
assassination of president kennedy that occurred the same year of 
kings march and said that while much progress toward the 
realization of kings dream has been made that much more needs to 
be done to deliver america from the scourge of racism and the 
slow death of indifference 
we cannot be satisfied to rest here dukakis said in quoting 
kennedy this is the side of the hill not the top we have 
made a beginning but we have only begun 
the democratic nominee promised to lead a nation that will 
march on to fulfill kings call for racial harmony 
dukakis without directly mentioning the reagan administration 
said a litany of problems facing minority americans have not been 
addressed including discrimination a lack of fair housing and 
affordable health care poor schools high teenage pregnancy rates 
and infant mortality and shoddy enforcement of civil and voting 
rights laws 
he applauded bush for supporting antidiscrimination laws to 
protect aids victims but also left little doubt about his 
perception of the reagan administrations record on issues of 
concern to minority americans 
we must march until we have a united states department of 
justice that understands the meaning of the word justice he 
said we must march until we have a civil rights commission that 
believes in civil rights my friends we must march until we have a 
president who understands and respects the constitution of the 
united states 
dukakis ended his speech with a rhetorical flourish more likely 
to come from jackson than dukakis 
let us in the words of dr king transform the jangling 
discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood 
dukakis said let us look up let us march on and little by 
little step by step hand in hand together we will overcome

days 
the radio said that on friday guards at the insein jail eight 
miles north of central rangoon fired on 2000 prisoners who set 
fire to buildings and tried to break open the gates 
prison personnel had to control the situation and unavoidably 
had to shoot the radio said as a result 36 prisoners were 
killed and 103 injured 
the british broadcasting corp had reported friday that the 
rebellion at insein left about 1000 dead but that report could 
not be independently verified 
the rangoon radio broadcast said all buildings at the jail 
burned to the ground but did not say if the rioting was over some 
injured prisoners remained untreated because they tried to prevent 
medics from entering the prison 
authorities at insein also released at least 655 prisoners some 
because they were nearing the end of their sentences and some for 
good conduct 
the radio also reported prison riots wednesday at bassein 90 
miles west of rangoon where one inmate was killed and 100 escaped 
and thursday in the arrakan state bordering bangladesh where six 
inmates were killed and about 1600 escaped 
tin oo a popular former defense minister and retired general 
told about 50000 people in rangoon on saturday that burma needs a 
transitional government now to end the monthlong turmoil that has 
toppled two leaders sparked almost daily protests nationwide and 
by official count killed at least 112 people 
following the recent public demonstrations against the 
oneparty regime the light of democracy has now been visible 
tin oo said 
the situation in the country is still very delicate with 
demonstrations continuing in many cities he said i therefore 
urge the government to immediately form an interim government to 
ease the situation and to prepare for democratic reforms 
the widely respected tin oo 62 was removed as defense minister 
and army chief in 1976 by former leader ne win once considered the 
third most powerful official with a strong military following he 
was jailed after an investigation into an alleged plot against the 
government 
thakin soe a former communist leader issued a statement from 
his hospital bed calling for multiparty democracy and demanding an 
interim government to restore peace 
thakin soe formed the now obsolete ultraradical communist party 
of burma in 1937 
the turmoil in burma began july 23 with the resignation of 
77yearold ne win who took over in a military coup in 1962 and 
presided with an iron hand over burmas economic destruction the 
burma socialist program party the countrys only party named 
hardliner sein lwin to succeed him 
during demonstrations against sein lwin hated by the public for 
his alleged brutal suppression of dissent army troops fired into 
crowds of protesters the government said 112 were killed but 
diplomats said the toll may be much higher 
sein lwin resigned aug 12 and was replaced aug 19 by maung 
maung the first civilian president in 26 years 
but even maung maungs announcement wednesday that he would 
recommend a popular referendum on oneparty rule has not ended 
protests 
rallies have been peaceful since sein lwin quit but law and 
order has deteriorated since maung maung lifted martial law 
wednesday 
security in the city isnt so good especially after the 
darkness comes on said an asian diplomat the streets are 
nearly empty at night theft and looting cases are reported 
incessantly 
the government has been silent on the most recent protests and 
on the stream of demands from prominent figures for immediate 
democracy that silence along with deterioriating social conditions 
has provoked rumors that ne win and other officials may be 
preparing to flee burma

communist party officials criticized the 
government of prime minister zbigniew messner on saturday as 
polands leaders struggled to solve the economic problems that have 
bred widespread labor unrest 
eleven strikes continued at mines ports shipyards and 
factories throughout poland but there were no reports of police 
attempts to dislodge the striking workers 
the communist partys 230member central committee met on 
saturday and several delegates lambasted the governments handling 
of polands dire economic problems and the labor unrest 
messner prime minister since 1985 acknowledged the criticism 
in a speech in which he reviewed his governments performance and 
stressed its plans to improve the economy the state news agency 
pap said 
in opening remarks to the party meeting earlier gen wojciech 
jaruzelski said that the communist government would undertake a 
selfcritical analysis of the problems behind the latest wave 
of strikes in poland 
messner as head of the government oversees the various 
ministries and is theoretically responsible for government 
performance but ultimate power rests with the communist party led 
by jaruzelski 
pap said the party plenum would continue on sunday 
on saturday the government was attacked by a series of 
committee members as ineffectual some of the sharpest criticism 
came from politburo member alfred miodowicz leader of the official 
trade union alliance opzz which was set up after authorities 
crushed the solidarity union in 1981 
nothing can explain the sluggishness in solving various 
problems the failure to make progress miodowicz said according 
to pap hence the sodetermined voices demanding personal 
accountability 
aleksandra koszada a party member from a radio plant in kutno 
said it is tragic that the conviction is becoming widespread 
that only strikes can prod our government into resolute action 
the governments ineptitude is responsible for many economic 
problems and wasted years added bogdan borys a metalworker from 
czestochowa 
the attacks added strength to speculation that the plenum would 
lead to government changes perhaps replacing messner himself 
the meeting was held less than a day after the government 
offered to begin talking with workers possibly including 
solidarity leader lech walesa 
but speakers also railed against the strikes they have an 
anarchygenerating destructive character said politburo member 
jozef czyrek they cannot be accepted 
jaruzelski denied that the party session was a direct result of 
the strikes but he said the meeting would make a critical and 
selfcritical analysis of the causes for the present tensions 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak on friday proposed 
unconditional talks with the striking workers 
i have been authorized to promptly hold a meeting with 
representatives of various social and employee groups i am not 
laying down any preconditions either concerning the subject matter 
of the talks or the participants kiszczak said on national 
television 
excellent said adam michnik a senior solidarity adviser 
reached in gdansk after kiszczaks speech i believe this is the 
first serious step in the right direction 
striking workers at the stalowa wola steelworks in southeast 
poland said they responded to the offer by empowering walesa and 
the catholic bishops to negotiate their demand of legalizing 
solidarity 
government spokesman jerzy urban asked saturday in a telephone 
interview if kiszczaks proposal would exclude walesa replied 
no 
the proposal is directed at all who do not reject the existing 
legal and constitutional order he added 
solidarity the first independent union in the soviet bloc was 
crushed during a wave of strikes in 1981 when marshal law was 
declared the union was outlawed in 1982 
walesa who founded solidarity in 1980 said friday he was ready 
to talk to authorities at any time without any preconditions 
workers at the striking 30 years of peoples poland mine in the 
southern city of jastrzebie voluntarily abandoned their occupation 
strike at 7 pm saturday because of a fire that started in the 
coal mine before the strike began aug 19 
urban earlier said authorities might deploy police at the mine 
because of the underground fire until saturday striking miners 
remained inside the shaft denying that the danger was critical 
several dozen miners at the moszczenica coal mine in jastrzebie 
who had barricaded themselves in an underground shaft emerged at 
noon saturday after talking to a priest officials and activists 
said 
in recent days the government has used a combination of limited 
force and propaganda against the strikers police have evicted some 
striking miners in the coalrich silesia region as well as some 
transit workers from depots in the northwestern port of szczecin 
striking dockworkers in szczecin said talks with management 
begun saturday broke off without any results 
jaruzelski said the central committee meeting would work out a 
program to improve peoples living standards and market stability 
as well as to end polands rising wageprice spiral 
in short what is needed is a brave turn he said at the 
plenum parts of which were televised 
politburo member wladyslaw baka a reformer in charge of 
economic poliy said the politburo had rejected a price freeze but 
it plans other steps to curb 60 percent annual inflation and 
improve erratic supplies to the marketplace 
a special parliament commission on the economy is scheduled 
wednesday and the full parliament is expected to meet shortly 
thereafter

palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafat on saturday asked the united nations to play a larger role 
in protecting palestinians in the israelioccupied territories 
there was a long discussion about all aspects of the 
palestinian question un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar told reporters after a 90minute private session with 
arafat at the un office here 
he conveyed to me his concern about the fate of the 
palestinians in the occupied territories which i do share perez 
de cuellar said 
since the palestinian uprising began dec 8 in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip more than 250 palestinians have been killed 
most by israeli gunfire four israelis also have died 
perez de cuellar said the plo chief also raised other 
political aspects of the problem he did not elaborate 
a statement issued by the plo saturday said arafat during the 
meeting with the un chief stressed the need for immediate 
international measures to ensure the protection of the palestinian 
people and also to provide for their support 
the statement also said arafat briefed perez de cuellar on steps 
taken by the plo to assert the sovereignty of the palestinian 
people over its homeland and the assumption by the plo of its full 
responsibilities as the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people 
arafat has floated the idea of asking for a un peacekeeping 
force in the occupied territories if the arabisraeli conflict is 
settled a plo official said before the meeting that arafat would 
explore ways of involving the world body directly in the 
territories including a possible trusteeship 
one agenda topic was believed to be the possible creation of a 
provisional palestinian government and proclamation of independence 
in the territories occupied by israel since the 1967 middle east 
war and home to 15 million palestinians 
a related issue would be securing international recognition of 
such a state the plo is backing its claim with a 1947 security 
council resolution envisioning a palestine partitioned into 
separate jewish and arab states 
arafat also was expected to urge stronger involvement of the 
un in efforts to call an international middle east peace 
conference 
the uprising and the july 31 decision by king hussein of jordan 
to sever ties with the west bank and gaza have led the plo to take 
a more active role in the territories 
a special meeting of the palestine national council the 
palestinians parliament in exile was expected to discuss the 
independence issue the middle of next month but a top plo official 
said saturday in tunis the session probably will be put off until 
after september 
on friday the un security council issued a statement backed 
by all 15 members expressing concern over israeli policies in the 
occupied territories 
the statement spoke of a grave and serious situation resulting 
from the closingoff of areas the imposition of curfews and the 
consequent increase in dead and injured 
the council also demanded that israel stop deporting palestinian 
civilians from the occupied territories

a police officer has been charged with 
murder in the shotgun death of a neighbor that authorities said 
stemmed from a 14yearold grudge 
robert a mclaughlin 47 an 18year veteran of the hampton 
police department surrendered to state police friday and confessed 
to killing real estate broker robert cushing in june said barbara

murder charge saturday at portsmouth hospital where he was being 
treated for high blood pressure mclaughlin was being held without

stemmed from an incident about 14 years ago in which mclaughlin 
made a misdemeanor arrest and cushing became involved indirectly 
keshen gave no further details of that incident 
since that period of time mclaughlin had evidently harbored 
ill will feelings against mr cushing that seem to have come to a 
head on the evening of june 1 where he admitted that he took his 
shotgun loaded it went over to the cushing residence and shot mr 
cushing keshen said 
cushing 63 was shot when he answered his front door 
hampton police chief robert mark said in a telephone interview 
that he could not comment on the case but he described mclaughlin 
as a model policeman he had a very good record 
he was what you wanted cops to be sharp clean cut mark

two women were rescued from the 
brink of horseshoe falls after they jumped from their boat and 
clung to rocks until workers rescued them 
janelle spain 25 and karen himmel 23 of hammond ind 
suffered only bruises in the accident friday night authorities 
said 
they were unfamiliar with the river and drove their boat through 
control gates at the international central dam once a boat passes 
the control gates it has reached a point of no return one official 
said 
niagara parks police said the women lost control of their boat 
apparently after it hit rocks in the shallow water near the falls 
they had no knowledge of the danger involved because it was 
apparently their first venture into the area said niagara fire 
chief gilbert neufeld 
passersby saw the women in the 16foot boat above the falls and 
called police when authorities arrived about 20 minutes later the 
pair had abandoned ship and were fighting the current a few hundred 
yards from the brink 
ms himmel was rescued by workers who threw her ropes and pulled 
her over a retaining wall 
ms spain lost her grip and was swept down the river toward the 
173foothigh falls before grabbing onto another rock she was 
rescued by a fireman who connected to a lifeline swam out about 
150 feet to her officials said 
operators closed off control gates to lower the level of the 
river and slow its pace approaching the falls exposing rocks so 
the women could grab onto them 
the two women who were camping on the ontario side of the river 
at the time of the accident were treated for bruises at a hospital 
and released 
last month four boaters were rescued from rocks 40 feet above 
the falls by workers who formed a human chain and waded into the 
rivers rapids those boaters had begun drinking while sitting 
aboard the craft in a marina authorities said and hadnt realized 
how it had drifted

a soviet diplomat said saturday that he was 
optimistic a quick agreement could be reached between china and the 
soviet union on the conflict in cambodia 
soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev arrived in the 
chinese capital for talks set to begin sunday asked by reporters 
at the airport if a breakthrough was imminent rogachev said i 
think so 
his chinese counterpart deputy foreign minister tian zengpei 
was more cautious saying only we hope to make some headway 
the two nations broke off relations in the early 1960s over 
ideological and strategic differences normalization talks opened 
in 1982 but they bogged down over three major obstacles moscows 
support of vietnams nineyear occupation of cambodia soviet 
troops in afghanistan and soviet forces stationed along the 
chinese border 
with the soviet pullout from afghanistan and a reduction of 
forces along the border cambodia could be the last obstacle to 
normalizing relations 
if the conflict there is resolved it could also pave the way 
for a summit meeting between soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and 
chinese leader deng xiaoping 
the communist giants have not held a summit in 30 years 
we see some light at the end of the tunnel rogachev said of 
the cambodia talks 
rogachev said he expected the talks to last about a week it 
will be the first time the two sides have met solely to discuss 
cambodia 
rogachev he did not reveal what was on the agenda for the talks 
which are closed to foreign reporters 
we are waiting for initiatives from the kampuchean cambodian 
side we with our chinese colleagues can only facilitate or 
assist in the settlement he said 
he also said a final solution would have to await the outcome of 
a meeting in november between cambodan resistance leader norodom 
sihanouk and hun sen prime minister of the hanoibacked government 
in cambodia 
china has said it wants the soviet union to put pressure on 
vietnam to completely pull out of cambodia as soon as possible 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 has agreed to withdraw 
50000 troops about half its forces there this year and all its 
troops by 1990 
in the past china has backed the communist khmer rouge rebel 
faction in cambodia it now supports a fourparty coalition 
government made up of the three resistance groups including the 
khmer rouge and hun sens forces the government would be headed 
by former national leader sihanouk who remains probably the most 
popular political figure in cambodia

sen dan quayle said saturday he is 
pleased with the response from crowds during his first week on the 
campaign trail by himself 
i really feel a great deal of enthusiasm beginning to build 
the republican vice presidential nominee said at a news conference 
quayle was asked about comments by his wife marilyn aired 
friday night on abcs 2020 suggesting that the media was out 
to get her husband because he is a conservative 
i am not going to disagree with marilyn marilyn is my best 
adviser and my strongest supporter quayle said 
pressed to say whether he believed the media was against him 
quayle said i just hope that the press will begin to focus on 
the issues of this campaign 
mrs quayle said she stood by her comments on the television 
interview that the press had engaged in overkill in its 
coverage of her husband in new orleans last week she said we 
had a real feeding frenzy by media which has abated only 
slightly 
quayle traveled to several rallies in california and a state 
fair in sacramento 
at lake mission viejo park quayle got a rousing reception from 
the audience which carried signs reading prolifers for quayle 
and i dont love the liberal media 
he warned them that a victory by michael dukakis would mean a 
return to the economic doldrums and the weakness of national 
security during the carter years 
if america liked jimmy carter they are going to love michael 
dukakis he said 
at the california state fair quayle hopped on an antique 
reaping machine and pitched hay he then drove a tractor telling 
reporters afterward i havent done this in a long time 
he also presented ribbons to a group of 4h teens who had 
trained guide dogs for the blind 
when he handed a ribbon to one student he bent and pet her dog 
a black labrador retriever named madonna who sat up and licked his 
face 
when he got to the next dog however the animal just lay on the 
ground without reacting 
now i know how it feels to be hounded quayle quipped 
at the news conference quayle reiterated his position that 
there is nothing left to ask or answer about his membership in the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war 
there have been a lot of innuendoes out there over the last 
few weeks implying that somehow there was undue influence used in 
getting into the national guard which weve denied from the very 
beginning quayle said 
the facts are now out and there is no longer a discussion 
he said 
records released friday by the indiana national guard confirmed 
both that the headquarters detachment he joined was under strength 
when quayle enlisted in may 1969 and that a slot also was available 
at the time he transferred into the commands public information 
unit

difficult for protesters who have come from new york california 
virginia and illinois said operation rescue spokeswoman juli 
loesch

unconscious from the stricken vessel and that they may have been 
overcome by fumes in the submarine there was no word on their 
condition 
he said the three sailors still not accounted for could be in 
waterfilled compartments of the vessel garcia spoke to reporters 
in his office after spending several hours at the accident site

friday evening by the japanese fishing ship no 8 kyowamaru near 
the callao the navy and the japanese embassy said

officer daniel nieve and three junior officers had been killed 
the navy on saturday had issued several conflicting figures on 
the number of men on board the ship the number believed missing 
and those feared trapped in the sunken vessel 
it said 52 crew members were believed on board when the 
collision occurred and said 45 were rescued but the 22 crew 
members rescued friday and 21 rescued saturday total 43 and there

there were no reported injuries on the fishing boat 
a us embassy spokesman who declined to be named said the us 
navy was sending a special team and equipment aboard three c141 
transport planes to assist in the rescue operations 
garcia said peru officials decided to mount their rescue after 
determining that it was too dangerous to wait for a special us 
navy rescue crew to arrive saturday night 
sources close to the rescue said the trapped men were believed 
to have been in the forward part of the submarine and had sealed 
the section with hatch doors from the rest of the vessel which is 
believed filled with water 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said an air 
line running to the surface had been attached giving survivors an 
unlimited supply of air 
the peru navy said the submarine was purchased in 1974 from the 
us government the vessel formerly the uss atule was 
commissioned on june 21 1944 according to janes fighting ships 
the submarine sank shortly after impact castro said adding he 
did not know the extent of the damage to the craft 
castro said divers working since 8 pm friday made contact with 
crewmen inside the sunken vessel 
the callao port authority said the submarine was heading for 
naval ship repair docks and the japanese boat carrying a crew of 
21 was leaving port to fish when the accident occurred 
the japanese boat skippered by tsukasa ohkado suffered some 
cracks on the bow the japanese embassy said saturday 
the embassy said 16 of the japanese boats crew are japanese and 
the remaining five are peruvians

in addition harassment of american servicemen is on the 
increase prompting us military officials to take precautionary 
measures panamanian officials respond that troublemakers among 
us military personnel pose daily headaches for panamanian 
authorities 
the state departments constraints on us envoys are such that 
they are prohibited from carrying out even simple tasks such as 
renewing their license plates or their drivers licenses 
as a result many diplomats have been forced to rent cars rather 
than run the risk of driving with expired plates some make their 
rounds with expired drivers licenses worried what local 
authorities might do if they catch them in a traffic violation or 
an accident the officials said 
the diplomats lack the documents entitling them to diplomatic 
immunity thus they are subject to imprisonment if found guilty of

a simmering debate about program trading has 
resurfaced with a new york stock exchange report that shows the 
computerdriven technique accounted for only a tenth of the big 
boards business last month 
if the report was meant to show program trading isnt an 
important element in the stock markets postcrash malaise it 
didnt convince many critics 
instead the report raised new concern about what some opponents 
of program trading see as the insidious influence of a hightech 
strategy that is little understood and widely feared by a broad 
range of investors and brokers 
im not in favor of program trading the very philosophy is 
alien to stock market investing said rao chalasani a market 
strategist at the clevelandbased investment firm of prescott ball 
amp turben inc program trading has scared people away 
the nyse increasingly concerned about investor apathy since the 
stock market collapse 10 months ago issued its first monthly 
report on program trading this past week 
it showed that program trading comprised 101 percent of the 
exchanges average daily volume of 1669 million shares in july 
and that most program trading was conducted by a handful of big 
investment firms 
the nations largest stock market where the overwhelming level 
of program trading is executed said the report was part of what it 
called a broader policy of making as much information available to 
investors as possible 
but the report got a lukewarm reaction at best partly because 
it gave no comparable figures for program trading during the crash 
and its aftermath 
some studies have suggested the strategy accounted for 15 
percent or more of the frenzied volume on black monday others say 
it was as low as 7 percent but regardless of the volume level 
some critics say thats not the point and only obscures the real 
concerns about program trading 
ten percent doesnt sound very high but probably 90 to 95 
percent of the time there are no programs being executed said 
carmine grigoli equity portfolio strategist at the first boston 
corp in new york 
its just a very small timeframe that program trading tends to 
move the market dramatically grigoli said there youll come 
up with a very different picture 
chalasani said its not the volume of program trading that 
matters but how concentrated it is and how fast its executed 
thats what creates more volatility ten percent volume executed at 
10 times during the day isnt the same as when it comes all in the 
last ten minutes of the day 
john bachmann chairman of the securities industry association 
was more receptive to the nyse report saying in a telephone 
interview that it was at least a first step toward understanding 
program tradings influence 
the point is were doing something he said whats 
significant is not the number its that you have a number whether 
this is the number thats going to be the most illuminating i have 
my reservations 
program trading was developed in the early stages of the 198287 
bull market that collapsed with frightening speed last october 
the strategy which some studies have linked to the crash 
involves the use of highspeed computer delivery systems to quickly 
buy and sell stocks or groups of stocks based on preprogrammed 
mathematical formulas 
the most common and controversial form of program trading is 
called index arbitrage in which traders buy stockindex futures in 
chicago futures markets and sell big groups of the underlying 
stocks comprising those indexes in new york or vice versa to 
profit from fleeting price disparities 
defenders of the practice claim it stabilizes stock prices by 
keeping them from straying too far from futures prices critics 
contend that because the highrisk futures markets are so volatile 
the linkage created by index arbitrage wrenches stock prices around 
without regard to their real values 
moreover the critics contend the measly volumes of trading in 
the postcrash market exaggerate the influence of this type of 
trading and further discourage the genuine longterm investing 
central to the markets health 
for example some critics accuse program traders of manipulating 
the market by pushing down indexfutures prices to incite selloffs 
in stock prices then purchasing the stocks for less than they had 
sold them earlier 
program traders also have been accused of a practice called 
frontrunning in which they supposedly take profitable 
positions in one market based on what they know will happen in 
another market as a result of their computerized strategies 
none of the questions about the effects of program trading were 
settled by the statistics in the nyse report which provided no 
analysis of their possible significance 
big board spokeswoman sharon gamsin declined to comment on the 
meaning or value of the numbers saying they were meant to speak 
for themselves but she also said that in future monthly reports 
more statistics might be added 
since february the exchange has enforced a temporary restraint 
on program trading triggered when the dow jones industrial average 
swings more than 50 points from the previous days close but the 
effect of this socalled collar is debatable 
last month the nyse also proposed other restraints on program 
trading in conjunction with the chicago mercantile exchange where 
key stockindex futures contracts are traded those restraints 
which would replace the collar include coordinated trading halts 
if the dow average drops 250 points in a day

after the october crash did anyone seriously 
expect wall streeters to do some frantic celebrating on the first 
anniversary of the markets august 1987 peak 
they did not investors marked the occasion by giving the market 
the cold shoulder daily trading volume on the new york stock 
exchange tumbled this past week to its lowest average for any week 
in about 20 months 
traders and analysts who stayed around during the week to answer 
the telephone blamed the slowdown on a combination of summer 
doldrums persistent worries about inflation and the economy and 
uncertainty about whether the federal reserve will push interest 
rates higher 
rates available on fixedincome investments such as treasury 
issues are already offering wary investors a tempting return with 
little risk 
yields on oneyear treasury bills for instance were more than 
82 percent last week and fiveyear treasury notes offered more 
than 9 percent 
on top of that some market analysts say investors skepticism 
about stocks sharpened by the frantic price collapse last october 
that followed so closely after the markets august highs remains 
keen 
they said the periodic and often unexpected bouts of 
computerdriven program trading that still send the market through 
some scary turns and the sour taste left by government 
investigations of insider trading are also keeping the investors 
out of the market 
investors got a reminder about program trading this past week 
when the nyse issued its first monthly measurement of the the 
volume involved in the technique saying it accounted for 101 
percent of shares traded in july 
you have an extremely high level of fear and apathy on the 
part of investors generally said dean a gulis director of 
research for the brokerage firm roney amp co in detroit the 
volume numbers are telling you more than anything you need to look 
at 
jack garry manager of institutional trading at butcher amp singer 
inc in philadelphia said no one is really ready to make a 
commitment to stocks 
we have some people nibbling at prices sometimes adding to 
existing positions but there is just no real reason people can 
find over the past few weeks to jump in and become buyers he 
said 
that type of environment is especially troublesome in the late 
summer when many traders and their clients are trying to take a 
break from normal routines 
in past years traders often stayed on the job when the market 
was busy but garry said this years inactivity means nobody is 
canceling their vacation plans not many people have reasons to 
stick around 
the reduced interest in trading stocks ironically occurred on 
the first anniversary of one of wall streets headiest days the 
dow jones industrial average reached its alltime peak of 272242 
on aug 25 1987 
this past week the dow jones swung widely before finishing at 
201743 up 143 from its close a week ago 
for the week the nyse composite index slipped 030 to 14724 
the american stock exhange marketvalue index lost 116 to 29387 
and the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market fell 
299 to 37443 
volume on the big board averaged 11729 million shares a day 
against 14461 million shares the week before 
that was the lowest for any week since volume averaged 11425 
million shares a day the week ended jan 2 1987 which included 
the new years holiday 
for some wall streeters low volume could soon take on a 
personal dimension traders are worried that if volume fails to 
pick up after the labor day holiday brokerage houses may lay off 
employees 
perrin long who follows the brokerage business for lipper 
analytical securities corp said they may have genuine cause for 
concern 
i think there will be more layoffs coming probably around the 
15th of october he said most firms will have good handle on 
what thirdquarter profits were by that time 
long said brokerage executives cant put their fingers on what 
has to happen to get individual and institutional investors more 
interested 
gene jay seagle director of technical research for the 
brokerage gruntal financial inc in new york said he disagress 
with market watchers who feel low volume is a sign stocks may be 
headed lower 
i think the selling has pretty much taken place he said 
but he attaches one cautionary note to his optimistic view 
that the fed refrains from giving another jerk on the reins by 
tightening credit

the bond market already battered by recent 
hikes in us interest rates is reeling from a new onetwo punch 
the new blows came on thursday when the commerce department 
released a report on the gross national product for the second 
quarter and several central banks in europe raised key interest 
rates 
the punches knocked the wind out of bond prices sending 
interest rates higher the treasurys closely watched 30year issue 
slumped 1732 point or about 530 for every 1000 in face value 
its yield often an indicator of interest rate trends rose to 945 
percent from 940 percent late wednesday 
theres no doubt that both elements were negative said 
william sullivan director of moneymarket research at dean witter 
reynolds inc referring to the gnp report and the european rate 
hikes 
the gnp data showed that the us economy expanded at a robust 
annual rate of 33 percent from april through june despite the 
severe impact of the drought on farm production that was up from 
an earlier estimate of 31 percent 
but what really hurt bond prices in the report was a gnp price 
index indicating that inflation accelerated the index rose at an 
annual rate of 51 percent during the second quarter the sharpest 
increase since a 58 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982 
the gnp figures indicated that the economy is expanding much 
too rapidly and inflation will become more of a problem later on 
said marshall front an economist for stein roe amp farnham an 
investment firm in chicago 
evidence of accelerating inflation raises fear that the federal 
reserve could put the brakes on the economy by tightening credit 
and forcing interest rates higher 
thats what the fed did in a dramatic move on aug 9 announcing 
a halfpercentage point increase in its discount rate to combat 
inflation that put the fee the fed charges member banks for 
shortterm loans at 65 percent its highest level in more than two 
years 
it was the first rise in the key rate since september 1987 the 
month preceding the stock market crash and sparked a halfpoint 
increase in the us prime lending rate to 10 percent 
the ripples sent out by the feds discountrate hike turned into 
waves this past thursday when the central banks of west germany 
and britain raised key interest rates the moves were quickly 
matched by france switzerland the netherlands and austria 
west germanys central bank the bundesbank said it raised its 
discount rate in order to stem the dollars rise against the mark 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the base 
lending rate was boosted to keep domestic inflation under control 
the coordinated european actions viewed as a catchup to 
the rise in the us discount rate rekindled fears of a world 
interestrate spiral and dealt another body blow to bond prices 
it reminded people that the course of global rates may still 
be in an upward direction said dean witters sullivan 
the double whammy came when the bond market was just recovering 
from its pummeling two weeks earlier by the discountrate increase 
the unexpected rate boost wreaked havoc on the three quarterly 
auctions of treasury securities that followed the move 
now bond traders are looking ahead anxiously to upcoming 
reports on the economy for an indication of what course the fed 
might take a critical set of data the report on the nations 
unemployment in august will arrive on friday of the coming week 
some analysts believe the fed could push the discount rate still 
higher other experts though think the central bank would be 
loathe to take such drastic action again so close to the 
presidential election in november instead they expect the central 
bank to nudge rates gently higher by using routine operations such 
as playing on the federal funds rate the interest on overnight 
loans between banks

at least one grain trader snoozed through the noon hour while 
most of his colleagues chatted along the sidelines in a scene that 
could hardly have been imagined just six weeks ago at the chicago 
board of trade 
the great drought rally of 1988 is history just a big blip on a 
long chart the smalltime speculators whose money fueled the 
midsummer runup have gone home to count their winnings or nurse 
their lumps and seasoned players in the crop futures markets are 
looking ahead to the next wave the harvest trough and the demand 
surge 
the weather market ended three or four weeks ago said 
gerald zusel a vice president of balfour maclaine corp and 
manager of the brokerage firms activities on the cbot grain floor 
the weather is certainly a lot less important now than it was 
then agreed victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc the focus is shifting more and more to demand 
zusel said balfours grain and soybean trading volume has fallen 
20 percent to 30 percent since late juneearly july when prices 
peaked then plunged following a weekend of unexpected rain 
we had a tremendous speculative exit with the ending of the 
drought segment of the market he said the market has become 
much thinner 
the change in the markets was readily apparent during a visit to 
the floor this past thursday the soybean futures pit the eye of 
this summers speculative storm was jammed and boisterous at the 
opening and close but held less than 20 traders at midsession 
exchange statistics show the average daily trading volume in 
soybean futures during the first three weeks of august has fallen 
36 percent since the same period in june while corn volume has 
dropped by 28 percent 
prices for nearmonth delivery of soybeans and corn the two 
major markets most affected by the drought have also fallen 
dramatically september soybeans closed friday at 831 a bushel 
down 24 percent from the june 23 peak of 1099 september corn 
finished the week at 277 a bushel off 21 percent from the july 
5 high of 352 
the break was almost as vicious as the rally said michael 
omalley a trader with rj obrien amp associates a chicagobased 
commodity brokerage house specializing in retail accounts a lot 
of latecomers who bought the market lost money on the break and 
when people lose money they have a tendency to stay on the 
sidelines for a while 
with the corn harvest already begun in the south corn and 
soybean traders are anticipating a seasonal dip in prices linked to 
the gathering of new supplies harvest pressure they call it 
the phenomenon is expected despite estimates that corn and soybean 
production will decline 37 percent and 23 percent respectively 
from last years levels 
after the harvest demand typically becomes the prime influence 
in the grain markets 
the wheat market has been firming lately on expectations of 
increased foreign demand and some experts believe wheat futures 
prices are primed for a dramatic surge wheat for september 
delivery in chicago settled at 390 a bushel on friday 31 cents 
below the contracts lifetime high 
the wheat market is about to blow up said gordon d linn 
president of chicagobased linnco futures inc 
linn citing declining us wheat stockpiles and reduced wheat 
production this year in the united states canada and argentina 
predicted a 15 percent jump in wheat futures prices in the near 
future

oil futures prices have bounced back from a 
steep slide but the markets underlying sentiment remains bearish 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for october

on thursday oil futures tumbled sharply on reports that oil 
production by the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries had surged anew 
the oil futures market has been inactive in recent weeks without 
news on supply and demand to guide it analysts said thursdays 
reports on opec provided the first sign of direction in some time 
with prices likely to weaken further as the increased oil outflow 
reaches consuming nations 
fridays recovery did not signal a change in market sentiment 
analysts said but was mainly due to buying late in the session by 
traders who wanted to balance their positions before the weekend 
the market is continuing in a bearish trend said chris 
gohler an oil futures broker with elders futures inc the market 
just has a tendency to spike back very quickly 
he also noted gasoline prices are being supported by fairly 
tight supplies in the physical market and by some oil refineries 
already converting their facilities to prepare for increased 
heating oil production for the winter

government economic figures suggested the inflationary threat 
isnt as acute as some people fear but the news wasnt enough to 
wake wall street which slumbered through the slowest trading day 
of the year 
the commerce department said friday that americans personal 
incomes bolstered by the biggest increase in wages in seven 
months rose 06 percent in july while consumer spending slowed 
because of a drop in auto sales 
the increase in incomes was identical to the june advance but 
spending on personal consumption which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt rose a 05 percent in july less than 
half the 11 percent june advance 
as with other recent statistics economists found signs of 
growing inflationary pressures in the report primarily in a 1 
percent gain in wages and salaries the biggest rise in this key 
component since last december 
but others said the slowdown in spending was an 
antiinflationary sign because it suggested demand for goods 
wasnt overwhelming the ability of factories and stores to supply 
them 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in los angeles with 
president reagan called the report good news 
the figures in the report are favorable with steady income 
growth good growth in consumer spending and an in the personal 
saving rate fitzwater said 
but there was little reaction on wall street where stocks 
gained slightly and volume on the new york stock exchange slumped 
to 8924 million shares the lowest level since an 8636 million 
share day last nov 27 the friday after thanksgiving bond prices 
also ended little changed in slack trading 
i just think a lot of people are finding an excuse to take 
vacations or an early labor day said lawrence r helfand 
manager of retail sales at the chicagobased investment firm rodman 
amp renshaw inc theres no question that people are just sitting 
on the sidelines
