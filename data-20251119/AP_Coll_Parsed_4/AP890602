a victim of last weeks bridge collapse over 
the great miami river was identified thursday but efforts to 
recover other bodies were hampered by inadequate equipment and 
strong river currents officials said 
hamilton county sheriff simon leis jr identified the victim as 
helen c zorn 52 of nearby green township her decomposed body 
was recovered tuesday from surfaced debris leis said 
still missing was her daughter terry siemon 27 who was 
believed to have been with mrs zorn as the two were driving over 
the bridge when it collapsed last friday afternoon said sheriffs 
spokesman frank weikel 
no other bodies or either of two submerged vehicles believed to 
have fallen from the bridge were recovered thursday said lt 
chris robertson one of five police divers on the search team 
in another development a sheriffs deputy directing traffic at 
the bridge site died at a cincinnati hospital after suffering a 
heart attack late thursday afternoon he was identified as sgt 
robert mondary 51 a 21year veteran

underwater currents and little or no visibility underwater 
reducing divers to feeling in the darkness for objects 
were fighting current its like trying to hang onto the back 
of a boat robertson told reporters

the murky river thursday afternoon prompting officials to call off 
the rest of the days recovery efforts at the site 12 miles west of 
cincinnati

based on eyewitness reports police believe two vehicles and as 
many as five people fell in when a 100foot section of the bridge 
collapsed 
the onelane temporary bridge opened to traffic in december 
while workmen built a nearby replacement for a 94yearold bridge 
collapsed during rush hour while taking a pounding from large 
debris in a strong current swelled by heavy rains

the daily shapeup of longshoremen looking 
for jobs so vividly portrayed in the film on the waterfront is 
going the way of silent movies but in a talky way 
a new phonein system is taking its place 
its the end of an era for that type of hiring of 
longshoremen something thats been in existence for 36 years 
said jerome j klied deputy director of the waterfront commission 
of new york harbor as the commission announced the change thursday 
on the waterfront which won four academy awards in 1954 
depicted corruption part of which was the daily socalled shapeup 
on the piers once the men gathered for work the jobs in 
reellife and reallife were passed out on the basis of kickbacks 
and friendships among other corruptions 
it was a very degrading form of employment klied said 
in 1953 the waterfront commission was created to end that 
freewheeling system 
now the workers get their assignments by telephone the day 
before they work only unemployed longshoremen show up each day in 
one of three employment centers hoping to get the 50 slots left 
vacant by absentees 
under the system that goes into effect tuesday employers will 
factor in the vacancies and call up the unemployed the day before 
an assignment

his summer vacation thanks to contributions from businesspeople 
individuals and a chevrolet dealer 
but wooten wont be old enough to drive the car 16 until 
september 
i think they didnt believe it would be a reality said 
mcneill who added that he hasnt decided whether to use the same 
incentive next year but weve made believers of them now 
he said thursday the car incentive was an idea to interest 
students in coming to school who would otherwise have poor 
attendance records

than punishment as an incentive for good attendance 
we came up with what every kid wants a car mcneill said

the united states and its allies would no 
longer need to aim at containing the soviet union militarily if 
the soviet union achieves significantly greater democracy 
president bush is quoted as saying 
instead the president told interviewers from the washington 
post us concern would shift to the economic side of things 
bush was interviewed in london on thursday the interview was 
published in friday editions of the newspaper 
sounding themes he has emphasized in recent speeches bush said 
the soviet union might well be in the state of radical change 
and as this change asserts itself and as they genuinely 
change our doctrine need no longer be containing a militarily 
aggressive soviet union the president said 
greater freedom in the soviet union means more freedom and less 
rigid boundaries in all of europe he said as those things 
happen the role of nato shifts our own role shifts from the main 
emphasis on deterrence to an emphasis on the economic side of 
things 
bush emphasized he did not believe that freedom had fully 
arrived in the soviet union and we have got to keep our guard 
up until then 
in a separate post interview in washington defense secretary 
richard cheney said if bushs proposals for armed forces reductions 
in europe are accepted us land forces might wind up stressing 
lighter equipment for easier deployment to world trouble spots 
cheney said the proposed ceiling of 275000 troops for both the 
united states and the soviet union in europe might raise other 
questions such as whether ships would be better than aircraft for 
reinforcement from the united states in war 
though the proposal makes military sense cheney said he was 
worried that congress would try to double or triple the presidents 
proposed reduction of 30000 us troops maybe eventually we can 
talk about those numbers but not now 
bush will visit poland and hungary this summer but he said he 
did not believe talks with the soviets about the soviet allies in 
eastern europe were appropriate that is not my concept he 
said 
on the massive prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing where 
bush represented the united states in 1974 and 1975 bush said he 
had learned dont judge events in china by the headlines of the 
moment but i dont think the chinese want to put the democratic 
genie back in the bottle or can put it back in the bottle i dont 
think the soviets can 
he said soviet president mikhail gorbachev had told him 
elements in the united states did not want the new soviet 
restructuring policies to succeed and i said not so i dont 
know of any credible elements that dont want it to succeed 
gorbachev apparently has stopped shipping weapons to nicaragua 
as he has said but other sovietbloc countries are doing it bush 
said

the chief of the kgb said thursday that the 
newly elected soviet legislature should have have full authority 
over his agency and use us congressional oversight as its model 
the new york times reported 
vladimir a kryuchkov in his first interview with western 
reporters said the supreme soviet would probably create a 
commission similar to the congressional committees charged with 
overseeing intelligence activities in the united states the times 
reported in its friday editions 
we are decidedly in favor of this he said and as far as 
the creation of a commission is concerned i think well borrow 
some of the experience of the americans 
included in the legislatures powers would be the authority to 
approve the appointment of the kgb chairman kryuchkov said 
human rights activists have said the kgb should be accountable 
to the new legislature in order to protect rights and curb police 
powers 
kryuchkov who was appointed last october spoke with reporters 
a day after a member of the new congress yuri p vlasov charged 
that the kgb exercises allembracing control over society over 
each individual 
the frankness of the accusation shocked other legislators and 
millions listening on radio and television broadcasts 
the kgb is technically overseen by the council of ministers the 
administrative branch of government but in practice it has been 
virtually independent

a conference of 24 nations on thursday rejected 
protectionist trade policies in an implicit condemnation of the 
united states 
officials of nations belonging to the organization for economic 
cooperation and development declared their determination to 
dismantle trade barriers erected by individual nations in favor of 
a stronger international trading system 
in a communique issued at the end of the annual meeting the 
members said they would continue to fight inflation cut 
unemployment and improve protection of the environment 
the meeting which brought together ministers of economy 
finance and trade from member countries provided one barometer of 
the main issues that may come up at the annual economic summit of 
the seven industrialized democracies to be held in paris on july 
1416 
the most talked about issue at the meeting ending thursday was 
trade with many countries voicing concern about a us move last 
week singling out japan india and brazil as unfair trading 
partners 
under us trade law washington can now take retaliatory 
actions in 12 or 18 months if the countries do not remove the 
restrictions they are accused of imposing 
at the trade meeting japan vigorously attacked the us measure 
and won support from some european nations and canada in getting 
strong language on free trade into the final communique 
in their final statement thursday the ministers said they 
wanted to express their determination to halt and reverse all 
such protectionist tendencies and avoid any discriminatory or 
autonomous actions 
despite the implied criticism of washington us treasury 
secretary nicholas brady put a positive face on the meeting he 
insisted there was basic agreement on fundamental issues 
us trade representative carla a hills said the bush 
administration remained committed to joint trade practices 
she noted us law does not require retaliation against 
purported offenders but did not rule out such action 
in recommendations for specific countries the final communique 
also said priorities for the united states should remain to 
contain inflationary pressures and cut the federal budget deficit 
industrial nations formed the organization for economic 
cooperation and development to foster international economic growth

boris yeltsin is a vocal critic of the communist 
party leadership during a time of momentous change in the soviet 
union and has become a voice for millions of the discontented and 
disillusioned here is a report on the yeltsin phenomenon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a mechanic basking in the noonday sun near his 
friends vending cart on moscows old arbat summed up the secret 
that has made communist party bad boy boris n yeltsin the hero of 
millions 
if the party bosses are against him then were for him its 
that simple said yuri chaplygin 
maverick martyr demagogue populist yeltsins image has 
shifted with his changing political fortunes but he holds a trump 
card backing from millions of supporters who relish his open 
battles with party leaders and cheer his calls to ease the brutal 
daily grind of soviet life 
yeltsins speech this week at the congress of peoples deputies 
showed him at his best his throaty bass booming out accusations 
and demands in simple phrases his doughy face set in a 
characteristic snarl his strapping erect figure topped by a 
smooth sweep of silver hair 
yeltsin told the congress that president mikhail s gorbachev 
was responsible for the nations continuing economic decline said 
he was accumulating too much power and that the new parliament 
should take over political power from the communist party 
but the soviet public has also seen yeltsin when he was down 
crushed after he made a daring 1987 speech criticizing the slow 
pace of gorbachevs reforms at a closeddoor party meeting 
that speech included harsh words for politburo foe yegor k 
ligachev and brought yeltsin a scathing reprimand from his former 
mentor gorbachev and vitriolic attacks from other party officials 
who accused him of dealing a stab in the back to economic 
reform 
the criticism of yeltsin was published in the press he was 
stripped of his post as moscow party chief and soon afterward 
hospitalized for heart trouble 
word went out that the 58yearold yeltsin had been broken 
ultimately however adversity and the open opposition of the 
communist party apparatus only increased yeltsins popularity 
people identify with yeltsin the weekly moscow news wrote 
in april in a fullpage story headlined the boris yeltsin 
phenomenon 
hes a victim of dislike on the part of higherups who of us 
hasnt been in the same position the weekly said and he is 
being slighted for refusing to seek their approval who hasnt 
dreamed of doing that 
yeltsin became a victim said alexander poroshkin a moscow 
street artist and russians love a victim hes like a martyred 
saint 
yeltsins reputation began to swell when he was still moscow 
party chief he chopped the local party apparatus campaigned in 
stores and on tv to improve food supplies and spoke out against 
special privileges for the government and party elite 
at the 1986 communist party congress just three months after 
taking the moscow post yeltsin already was firing salvos at the 
party bureaucracy demanding an end to the perquisites top 
officials enjoy and saying no leader should be above criticism 
for many muscovites who watch their leaders rocket by in sleek 
limousines while they stand in line to buy soap sugar and 
countless other scarce items yeltsins borschtineverypot 
message has immediate appeal 
yeltsin wants to give what everyone wants to raise the 
standard of living and get us what we dont have said a 
middleaged warehouse worker standing in a long line to buy pickles 
he wants sharp changes and thats what we need chaplygin 
said if you want a revolution it should be the real thing 
in his campaign to win a seat in the congress yeltsin linked 
his call for immediate improvements in the average soviets living 
standard with daring denunciations of the privileges granted top 
state and party officials 
voters responded with a landslide yeltsin was swept into office 
with almost 90 percent of the vote obtaining the ballots of more 
than 5 million muscovites and crushing the establishment candidate 
who opposed him for a moscow seat 
for many ordinary muscovites the choice was clear 
the former construction engineer set a personal example by 
refusing the privileges of rank though he still is a member of the 
partys policymaking central committee and was chauffeured to 
election rallies in a limousine 
his candidacy got an extra boost 10 days before the election 
when the partys central committee formed a special commission to 
investigate allegations that yeltsin had been espousing views that 
clashed with the party line 
the tactic backfired badly voters saw heightened persecution 
from above and a preelection rally attended by thousands 
condemned the commission and vowed to stand by yeltsin 
yeltsins support also stems from the convenient position of 
being a shadow leader a critic of whatever is being done 
poorly without having to run reforms himself the moscow news 
said 
hes not a main dish progressive editor vitaly korotich of 
ogonyok magazine has said but korotich says yeltsin can fulfill a 
useful role in the countrys legislature 
despite his toughtalking frankness yeltsin has expressly 
refrained from presenting himself as a direct rival to gorbachev 
but he has done nothing to conceal the animosity between himself 
and ligachev 
he has also publicly questioned raisa gorbachevs active role in 
her husbands political life playing to a widespread dislike for a 
woman who wont accept a traditional behindthescences role 
yeltsin has brought bigtime politics down from the olympian 
heights and put them at the feet of rankandfile citizens 
political analyst vitaly tretyakov wrote in moscow news 
the question now poroshkin said is whether yeltsin can put his 
popularity to use to get his ideas made into official policy 
its like a player at a casino who has won a lot of chips but 
hasnt cashed them in yet he said 
actually yeltsin already reaped some benefit from his popular 
support after his failure at the congress on saturday to gain a 
seat on the new fulltime national legislature the supreme soviet 
tens of thousands of people chanted yeltsin yeltsin at a 
mass rally in a moscow stadium parking lot sunday and called for 
another deputy to give his seat up to yeltsin 
their wish was granted the next day with gorbachevs backing 
support for yeltsin at such recent rallies in moscow has 
appeared intensely personal with backers wearing his buttonsized 
portrait and chanting his name but some say they like him not for 
who he is but for what he embodies 
no one loves him for himself its just that for the first 
time an alternative has appeared poroshkin said

an army marches on its stomach napoleon 
supposedly remarked but senators say a 15page set of 
specifications for government issue cookies may be carrying the 
concern with rations too far 
the specifications showing the pentagon pays equal attention to 
chocolate chips and computer chips were read aloud thursday at a 
hearing by the senate governmental affairs subcommittee on 
oversight of government management 
the subcommittee was looking into the strict specifications for 
commercial and offtheshelf products along with excessive 
requirements that have turned away wouldbe contractors 
the cookies shall be wellbaked said sen william cohen 
rmaine reading just before lunch from the guidelines for 
chocolate chip oatmeal cookies they shall be browned on the 
bottom surface and outer edges but not appreciably browned on the 
top surface 
they shall be wholly intact free of checks or cracks the 
cookies shall be tender and crisp with an appetizing flavor free 
of a burnt or scorched flavor 
specifications for sandwich cookies require each cookie shall 
consist of two round base cakes with a layer of filling between 
them the base cakes shall have been uniformly wellbaked with 
a color ranging from not lighter than chip 27885 or darker than 
chip 13711 
the color comparisons shall be made under sky daylight 
with the objects held in such a way as to avoid specular refracture 
glossiness 
the filling shall be centered so that it does not protrude 
beyond the perimeter of the base cakes 
would mrs fields comply cohen teasingly asked greg 
saunders the pentagons assistant for commercial acquisition 
i suspect it would be too high quality a cookie saunders 
replied 
saunders defended specification saying the department has to 
have a number of specifications for food items because many remain 
on the shelf for up to five years 
on an even more serious note deputy defense secretary donald 
atwood promised to review the specifications that limit purchases 
of cheaper commercial products 
i can only pledge to you that with the staff at the defense 
department well review some 50000 specifications in great 
detail with the idea in mind of making use of commercial products 
wherever theyre available said the former vice chairman of 
general motors corp 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of the subcommittee said 
recent legislation that requires the pentagon to purchase whenever 
possible products already sold commercially or used by the 
government has had little effect 
the real problem is that despite the 1986 law the pentagon 
remains hooked on the old way of doing business levin said 
levin also noted that a recent study by the center for strategic 
and international studies found that the number of companies 
competing for defense contracts has dropped from 118000 to 38000 
over a fiveyear period 
atwood described one example of strict specification government 
inspectors at a general electric production line for military 
aircraft engines nearly equaled the number of workers while 
employees building the same engines for commercial use were not 
scrutinized 
it doesnt make sense to have that wide a disparity atwood 
said 
the deputy defense secretary attributed the high number of 
specifications to the publicity surrounding last summers ill 
wind investigation into alleged pentagon fraud and corruption in 
the acquisition process 
there has been and is a natural tendency on peoples part to 
bend over backwards to make sure it couldnt happen in this 
particular procurement atwood said and we do see a little 
overreaction because of the recent visibility 
but atwood cautioned against legislative steps that could harm 
the department 
you can think of any commercial product that if its loosely 
worded some organization can meet that loosely worded specification 
and were all the worse off for it he said

if youre looking to buy a new home the decline in interest 
rates over the past few weeks could open a few doors 
economists say an improved inflation outlook and stronger dollar 
have helped reverse a stubborn upward trend in rates that began two 
years ago and has sent the oncevibrant housing industry into a 
slump 
many people out there who wouldnt be able to buy a home can 
now qualify at the lower rates richard w peach deputy chief 
economist of the mortgage bankers association of america said 
thursday 
at the same time rates on some certificates of deposit have 
fallen while changes in other types of consumer interest charges 
such as bank auto loans and credit cards have been mixed 
many experts predict interest rates will continue easing the 
rest of the year as the us economy slows and as foreigners 
attracted by a firm dollar pump money into us financial 
investments some predict fixedrate mortgages could drop to 10 
percent before the end of the year 
fixedrate loans have dropped most steeply over the last two 
months dropping below 11 percent in tandem with declining 
longterm rates in the credit markets 
but adjustable rate mortages which are tied to an index of 
oneyear treasury notes have shown only a slight drop because 
shortterm rates remain comparably high that stems from the 
federal reserves decision to keep a tigher rein on credit to fight 
inflation 
the average rate on the first year of an arm was 918 percent 
the last week in may down from 928 percent the previous week 
according to the latest bank survey of the federal home loan 
mortgage corp the rate averaged 940 percent in april 
freddie mac said the average rate on fixed 30year mortgages 
fell to a fivemonth low of 105 percent the last week in may down 
from 1069 percent the week before just two months ago that same 
loan averaged 1122 percent a nearly fouryear high and in may 
1988 it averaged 1046 percent it said 
the decline of nearly threequarters of a percentage point in 
30year fixedrate mortgages over the past two months could mean 
significant savings in comparing monthly mortgage payments 
homebuyers for example who got a 100000 conventional loan at 
the 1122 percent rate are paying 972 a month in interest and 
principal those who took out a mortgage last week at 105 percent 
pay 915 or 684 less a year for a 6 percent difference 
that could mean the difference between qualifying for a mortgage 
and having to put homebuying plans on hold for some the rule of 
thumb is that monthly mortgage payments not exceed 25 percent of 
net household income 
for every half percentage point increase or decrease 
another half a million people get in the housing market or out of 
the housing market said ronnie j wynn president of montgomery 
alabased colonial mortgage co one of the nations largest 
mortgage companies 
wynn said business is brisker these days as people rush to 
exploit the break in rates loan applications are running about 20 
percent higher than a year ago compared with a 10 percent drop in 
applications during april he said 
stephen ashley president of the rochester nybased mortgage 
banker sibley corp said his business was slower than last year 
but he expects it to pick up this summer 
i think that the drop in rates has been positive in terms of 
bringing a greater number of homebuyers into the market but i 
dont want to represent it as being a land rush he said 
while fixedrate mortgages have come down significantly other 
consumer interest charges havent 
a 48month bank loan for a new car averages 1256 percent up 
from 1254 percent a month ago and 1173 percent at the beginning 
of the year according to the north palm beach fla publication 
bank rate monitor 
bank credit cards average 1813 percent up from 1809 percent a 
month ago and 1803 percent earlier this year bank rate monitor 
reported 
for savers rate changes have been mixed the yield on a 
oneyear certificate of deposit has an average yield of 928 
percent down from 951 percent a month ago according to the 
publication 
money market accounts yielded an average 662 percent in the 
week ended wednesday unchanged from the previous month it said

the euphoria and even the selfcongratulation are 
subsiding and now president bushs ambitious arms control 
initiatives will be put to the test 
indeed as secretary of state james a baker iii said thursday 
the ball is in the soviets court and a response by them is now 
clearly called for 
bushs proposals for ceilings on troops tanks combat aircraft 
and attack helicopters artillery and armored personnel carriers 
refine what nato put on the bargaining table in vienna in march 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev responded last month with 
his own blueprint for drastic cuts 
but bushs proposals change the picture in the eastwest talks 
again for the first time for instance nato is willing to 
negotiate over combat airplanes 
the soviets presumably will have to deal with that issue 
defining what is a combat craft is difficult and gorbachev is 
bound to have his own version of what kind of aerial cutbacks 
should be made 
the soviet leader also may push for reductions in western naval 
forces and it would be amazing if he did not try to trim or even 
eliminate british and french troop concentrations in west germany 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in an initial 
reaction wednesday in paris said those 100000 forces could 
complicate the quest for an accord 
this had echoes of the fight two years ago over pershing 
missiles in west germany that were partly under us control 
it threatened to hold up a treaty to ban us and soviet 
mediumrange missiles 
the reagan administration argued the negotiations did not 
involve west germany finally there was a compromise in which the 
west germans volunteered to destroy the missiles 
bush outlining his plan in brussels said it should be possible 
to complete a treaty in six months to a year 
it would be carried out by 1992 or 1993 at the latest under 
the bush timetable 
shevardnadze said he was pessimistic about bushs timetable 
baker was not about to contradict his boss especially on the 
presidents best week in office 
it was optimistic but not unrealistic baker said 
but he acknowledged there are lots of questions for nato to work 
out before the proposal is put on the table in vienna 
these he said include finding ways to verify that the 
reductions are carried out and dealing with the equipment the 
united states would like to keep stored in europe after tens of 
thousands of troops are withdrawn 
baker also said there are questions about the extent to which 
troops must be demobilized and deactivated 
responding to shevardnadze on british and french troops he 
said i suppose we will have an interest in knowing what happens 
to other warsaw pact troops other than soviet troops 
the pace of arms control has quickened since gorbachev took 
power in 1985 
the united states and the soviet union signed an unprecedented 
treaty in 1987 to destroy all their mediumrange nuclear missiles 
by pushing hard on a number of fronts the soviet leader has 
forced bush to abandon his cautious stance and come up with his own 
wideranging plan 
but that does not mean the problems of pursuing disarmament go 
away 
just remember east and west negotiated for 15 years to reduce 
their forces in central europe the talks eventually collapsed 
and now nato and the warsaw pact are dealing with all of europe 
and a much wider range of weapons

there were those who said george bush would never 
get along as famously with margaret thatcher as ronald reagan did 
it appears they were wrong 
the british prime minister and the new american president 
showered each other with praise at a formal dinner at 10 downing 
street on thursday night and regaled the celebritystudded audience 
with anecdotes 
bush on the final night of his first trip to europe as 
president stayed a halfhour later than planned and said before 
driving off it was a wonderful trip 
both leaders had the 60 guests at the celebritystudded 
blacktie event in stitches 
thatcher made a jocular reference to the bushes purported 
difficulties with a famous guest at their family compound in maine 
mrs thatcher recalled that it was from downing street that 
orders went out to burn the white house in 1814 
well houses do need a bit of renovation from time to time 
she said but dont worry weve decided to spare kennebunkport 
the same treatment ever since we heard that you had to rebuild it 
anyway for your recent distinguished visitors 
mrs thatcher was referring to reports denied by the white

exhausted by cancer calamity 
and revolution president jose napoleon duarte has completed what 
may be his greatest victory peacefully turning his government 
over to an elected successor 
he yielded power thursday to alfredo cristiani the new 
president who represents duartes nemesis on the right wing 
duartes closest political adviser commenting on condition his 
name not be used said that with the presidents ebbing strength 
duarte is given to reflecting on his crusade for democracy in el 
salvador 
he feels ambivalent because he began by taking power away 
from the oligarchy and now it may seem hes handing it back the 
adviser told the associated press 
he is aware of the irony in the fact that handing power to the 
most disagreeable political opposition will consolidate the 
democratic process he has dedicated his life to building 
the adviser an old friend and fellow founder of the christian 
democratic party sees duarte almost daily 
he described how duarte has had to lie in an oxygen tent wasted 
by dehydrating vomiting and diarrhea like the ulcers in duartes 
mouth they are brought on by chemotherapy 
the 63yearold engineerturnedpolitician is likely to be 
remembered as crucial to a gradual and difficult replacement of an 
authoritarian semifeudal system of government with an incipient 
democracy 
but he approached the end of his term and his life burdened by 
failures and compromises that will weigh heavily as history 
deliberates its verdict 
duarte has terminal liver cancer since it was diagnosed in june 
1988 he has made periodic trips to walter reed army medical center 
in washington for treatment which leaves him bedridden 
his doctor jose luis saca told the ap the latest round of 
chemotherapy was particularly devastating duarte is given little 
to no chance of reaching his 64th birthday in november 
duarte considers himself to a great degree personally 
responsible for conditions permitting the unprecedented succession 
and sees it as a crowning achievement 
but he also considers cristianis republican nationalist 
alliance or arena an authoritarian antidemocratic party inclined 
to erode gains in human rights and civil liberties 
one must acknowledge president duartes democratic vocation 
said cristiani in an interview with foreign correspondents before 
taking office he has with his aptitudes and positions promoted 
democracy but i wouldnt go so far as to call him the father of 
salvadoran democracy 
a summation of duartes fiveyear term includes notable 
expansion of freedom of expression drastic reduction in 
politically motivated murders labor union pluralism and three 
nationwide elections judged free and fair by international 
observers 
but his two main objectives ending civil war and reviving a 
moribund economy remained as far from fulfillment as when he took 
office 
marxistled guerrillas have been waging a revolution against the 
usbacked government for nine years despite more than 35 
billion in economic and military aid from washington the rebels 
continue to dominate territory in the north and east 
though the 7000 insurgents are outnumbered eighttoone by 
security forces they have demonstrated the capacity to attack 
major garrisons and keep the army on the defensive in much of the 
massachusettssized country 
the economy is a shambles el salvador would be virtually 
bankrupt without international help production of the major export 
crops coffee sugar and cotton has declined sharply along with 
private investment and the standard of living 
health care potable water and primary education are little more 
than dreams for most of the rural population corruption and 
nepotism within duartes administration are widespread 
the judiciary is all but completely ineffective though death 
squad activity has declined politically motivated assassins 
continue to murder with impunity 
duarte aware of the gravity of his disease offered in last 
years stateoftherepublic address a balance sheet on his 
presidency 
the will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day 
more stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents the 
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route 
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims he 
said 
a highranking us diplomat who has been in el salvador for 
most of duartes term remarked he didnt work miracles so he 
has taken a lot of knocks some fair and some not he was not a 
great administrator he merged the party and the government and 
surrounded himself with some unscrupulous people but he must be 
credited with instituting the democratic system itself his great 
legacy is this transition the rest pales by comparison 
ignacio ellacuria a roman catholic priest who is rector of the 
prestigious central american university said duarte never 
realized what little real power he had hes not a false man but 
he is a man who is selfdeceived his hands were completely tied by 
the united states and the armed forces 
obviously he has governed amid much danger and difficulty 
the fmln was against him private enterprise was against him the 
media were against him arena was against him so he had to take 
refuge in the armed forces and the united states said ellacuria 
the fmln are the spanish initials for the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front 
ellacuria harshly criticized duarte for presiding over a junta 
in 198182 the years of most ferocious repression during which 
death squads and the military were blamed for abducting and 
murdering up to 700 suspected leftists each month 
duarte accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument 
that if he were not there on the junta there would be more 
that is a measure of this mans ambition for power

a 7yearold boy mutilated in a sexual 
attack is acting as if nothing is wrong after his release from the 
hospital he wants to return to school and get a new nintendo game 
his mother says 
people shocked by the attack have donated about 200000 to help 
the boy resume a normal life 
its a miracle helen harlow the childs mother said 
wednesday after he was released from mary bridges hospital 
the fact that hes healing so rapidly and that his spirits are 
so high and that the trauma doesnt seem to have made any kind of 
mental block is something else she said in an interview with 
kingtv in seattle 
he was raped and choked may 20 by a man who lured him into the 
woods while the boy was riding his bike the childs penis was cut 
off in the attack 
earl kenneth shriner who authorities said has a history of 
violence against young people has been charged in the assault 
ms harlow said her son who has a different last name is eager 
to resume a normal life and wants to go back to school 
hes not looking at this as a problem hes just looking at it 
as how it is and now lets get on with life wheres the next 
nintendo game i needed zelda one not zelda two 
ms harlow added that she wants to do what she can to make 
sure this kind of thing never happens again and to thank everybody 
thats been so wonderful 
officials said wednesday that people have donated 200000 to a 
trust fund and the hospital waived 12000 in bills in addition 
the state crime victim compensation fund most likely will pay up to 
150000 for his remaining medical and counseling bills 
the state pays up to that amount for anyone who is an innocent 
victim of a felony or gross misdemeanor said mark mcdermott who 
administers the program 
the boys mother has said neither she nor his father have 
medical insurance to cover the child 
police detective stan mowre who led the fundraising effort 
said details of how the community cares trust fund will be 
administered are being worked out but he said all moneys will 
go for expenditure of the boy for education and medical bills 
just how much the boys medical and counseling care will cost 
over his lifetime remains a big question doctors say the boy will 
need reconstructive surgery to rebuild his penis and he already 
has begun seeing a mental health counselor 
throughout the state people have dug into their pockets at elks 
meetings grocery stores and taverns to help mail stuffed with 
letters checks and cash has arrived by the bucket at pacific first 
federal savings banks james center branch said manager jim 
bichsel 
the mail run peaked tuesday when the bank received 1500 checks 
and letters said debbie anderson personal banking representative 
there also have been two offers of computers and a trip to 
disneyland 
its kind of fun bichsel said theres a sense of unity 
among the staff to get it done for him its part of their 
contribution

both sides in the abortion battle are squaring 
off over a morning after abortion pill that is available in 
france but not in the united states 
officials of national right to life said they are prepared to 
encourage a boycott of products distributed by an american 
affiliate of the french manufacturer of the pill if there is an 
attempt to license the drug in the united states 
and on the other side leaders of the national organization for 
women and the fund for the feminist majority call such tactics 
medical mccarthyism and are preparing to lobby federal health 
officials and commercial drug companies to start american testing 
of the abortion pill 
the drug called ru486 is now being used for about 15 percent 
of the elective abortions in france and is being studied for the 
treatment of certain diseases ru486 has not been approved by the 
food and drug administration for distribution in the united states 
now president molly yard charged at a thursday news conference 
that the right to life organization is intimidating american 
pharmaceutical firms from attempting to license or test the drug in 
this country 
it is a total insensitivity on the part of right to life to be 
working to keep this drug out of the united states said ms 
yard we intend to organize people to see to it that we get ru486 
into this country 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority 
said that a campaign against ru486 by the right to life 
organization has put a chill on research and caused american 
drug companies to avoid investing in the abortion pill 
we intend to visit the pharmaceutical industry leaders and ask 
them to rise above this medical mccarthyism said ms smeal we 
believe it is their moral and scientific responsibility 
mccarthyism is a term that refers to the use of unfounded 
accusation to intimidate and threaten it originates from 
anticommunism hearings conducted by sen joseph mccarthy rwis 
in the 1950s 
richard glasow a spokesman for the national right to life 
acknowledged that his organization discussed a boycott with 
officials of hoechstrouselle the american affiliate of 
rousseluclaf the french company that makes ru486 
we asked them to not bring the abortion pill to the us 
said glasow we pointed out to them that we have encouraged 
members to boycott another company that makes drugs used in 
clinical abortions 
he said hoechstrouselle officials said they had no plans to 
market ru486 in the united states 
glasow added we didnt threaten hoeschstrouselle with a 
boycott we just said that was a possibility 
he said an international antiabortion group to which the 
american organization belongs has instituted a boycott in europe 
against products made by affiliates of rosseluclaf 
olivia gans also an official with right to life said her 
organization is opposed to ru486 because we have concerns about 
its safety to women in addition to the fact that it destroys the 
baby 
ms yard said that ru486 in addition to use for abortions has 
shown promise in the treatment of a variety of diseases 
including breast cancer glaucoma a disease that can cause 
blindness endometriosis a pelvic disease that can cause 
infertility in women and cushings sydrome a disease of hormone 
imbalance 
though ru486 has been referred to as a morning after 
abortion pill ms smeal said the drug is used in france only under 
medical supervision 
in a typical case she said a woman seeking an abortion is 
examined at a clinic to confirm her pregnancy and then takes three 
200 milligram pills of ru486 two days later she returns to the 
clinic for an injection of prostaglandin a hormone sometime after 
the shot the fetus is expelled the patient returns to the clinic 
two weeks later for a followup examination 
use of ru486 is limited to the first seven weeks of pregnancy 
ms smeal said that the only side effect to ru486 is bleeding in 
less than 1 percent of the patients who have taken the drug

the bush administration is urging congress to 
think twice before cutting taxes that finance a catastrophic 
illness insurance program for millions of older americans 
until government can get a better estimate of how much the 
surtax will bring in and how much catastrophic coverage will cost 
treasury would not consider it prudent to alter the premium 
assistant treasury secretary john g wilkins told the senate 
finance committee on thursday 
the panel and the house ways and means committee are considering 
several bills to repeal or delay the surtax which was enacted less 
than a year ago the new law is under heavy fire from many older 
americans 
many say they do not need the coverage because they have private 
insurance others complain they cannot afford the surtax which 
this year is 15 percent of a medicare beneficiarys federal income 
tax of 150 or more about 40 percent of older people pay the 
surtax the maximum tax is 800 per beneficiary 
unless congress makes some changes cautioned rep harris 
fawell rill there is going to be a popular revolt the likes 
of which havent been seen since a massive mail campaign led to 
repeal of withholding of taxes from interest and dividends in 1983 
efforts to change the catastrophic law gained momentum recently 
when sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance 
committee disclosed government forecasts that the new tax will 
bring in more than had been estimated just a year ago he raised 
the possibility of cutting the tax 
during the five years ending in 1993 the congressional budget 
office now estimates the surtax is likely to bring in about 10 
billion more than is expected to be spent for catastrophic benefits 
however administration officials cautioned that the surplus may 
never exist because the new program of catastrophic drug benefits 
starting in 1991 could cost far more than previously estimated 
we cannot recommend a reduction in premium surtax revenue at 
this time knowing that the drug benefit faces financial difficulty 
in the near future said louis w sullivan secretary of health 
and human services 
the committee got lots of advice to the contrary from members of 
congress and from organizations representing older americans 
the seniors of america are angry are growing more angry 
daily and their numbers are growing as new questions about this 
act materialize said daniel l hawley of las vegas president of 
seniors coalition against catastrophic act if this act is not 
repealed beginning in 1990 there will be the largest turnover in 
congress in its history 
lovola burgess of albuquerque vice president of the american 
association of retired persons said that organization the 
largest representing seniors would prefer another financing 
method but believes the benefits are important enough to justify a 
lessthanperfect tax 
but if congress changes the tax she said it should do so by 
reducing the surtax rate below its 15 percent level using 
congressional budget office estimates of the projected surplus she 
said the rate could be cut to 105 percent this year the 28 
percent level scheduled for 1993 could be cut to 196 percent 
this option affects the largest number of beneficiaries 
from those paying the least to those paying the most ms 
burgess said although it would not reduce the number of people 
paying the surtax it would cut the number paying the maximum 
amount 
over 20000 arizonans have contacted me since passage of the 
final act sen john mccain rariz told the committee not 
more than 10 have indicated their support 
sen carl levin dmich sponsor of a bill to require 
upperincome americans of all ages to pay for the program said the 
the elderly are unwilling to pay the surtax 
they dont understand why they are the only group in our 
society which is being asked to subsidize another part of their 
group levin said

house republicans who oppose president bushs 
effort to make savings and loan banks put more of their own money 
at risk will have another chance to fight that provision of the 50 
billion industry bailout bill 
as majority leader thomas foley dwash moved thursday to 
speed the bill to the house floor for action next week lobbyists 
said three house republicans were planning to fight its capital 
requirements 
the bill would make some 500 cashpoor savings and loan banks 
come up with 13 billion in new capital by 1995 
foley told rep joe moakley dmass acting chairman of the 
house rules committee that he wants the panel to act on the 
legislation next tuesday so that the full house can begin 
considering it next wednesday 
but lobbyists said rep jimmy quillen of tennessee ranking 
republican on the rules committee was working with reps thomas 
ridge rpa and henry hyde rill on spearheading a movement to 
thwart bushs plan for making sampl owners put up more of their own 
money 
ridge tried unsuccessfully to defeat the new capital 
requirements in the house banking committee and hyde last week 
failed on a 1717 tie vote in the house judiciary committee to 
delay the new capital requirements for 18 months 
as approved by the banking committee the bill would make 
cashpoor sampls either raise new capital to act as a buffer between 
future loan losses and federal deposit insurance funds or require 
the institutions to shrink in size 
under current regulations sampls can operate without their owners 
having any of their own money at risk bush and others have blamed 
that lax standard for the magnitude of the current crisis which 
has created an estimated 35 billion to 55 billion hole in the 
governments deposit insurance fund 
the house bill would require sampl owners to put at least 150 of 
their own money at risk by june 1990 for each 100 of federally 
insured deposits they loan out by 1995 that capital requirement 
would climb to 3 for every 100 in loans 
meanwhile another house committee on thursday rejected as 
voodoo accounting bushs plan to prevent the 50 billion that 
the government will borrow for the bailout from swelling the 
federal deficit 
on a 2215 partyline vote with only one democrat supporting 
bushs plan the house government operations committee approved 
including the immediate 50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout 
as part of the federal budgets for this year and fiscal 1990 and 
1991 
the house ways and means committee took a similar posture 
earlier as the sampl measure wound its way through several house 
committees with shared jurisdiction over parts of the complicated 
legislation 
the senate has already passed its version with democrats 
falling 12 votes short of defeating bushs financing mechanism 
which would raise the deficit by only 45 billion over the three 
years but cost taxpayers a like amount in higher interest charges 
rep john conyers dmich the government 0perations 
committees chairman said bushs approach creates a windfall for 
wall street in which wealthy purchasers of the bonds benefit at the 
expense of taxpayers 
borrowing from the term voodoo economics bush once used to 
describe president reagans theory that lower taxes would reduce 
the deficit conyers called the administrations sampl plan voodoo 
accounting designed only to hide the true costs of the bailout from 
the american people 
the only democrat on the committee to vote in favor of bushs 
financing plan was rep doug barnard of georgia a former banker 
assistant treasury secretary david mullins accused democrats of 
using the sampl crisis in a backdoor way to fight the 
nonewtaxes agreement between bush and congress to reduce the 1990 
fiscal budget deficit to 100 billion 
this has nothing to do with sampls he said the questions 
is whether we maintain in a new administration the budgeting 
discipline of grammrudman the real issue is creating a waiver 
process for new spending 
including interest costs on the borrowing the bailout will cost 
an estimated 285 billion to 330 billion over the next 30 years 
making it the largest in the nations history 
the general accounting office estimates that at least 70 percent 
of that money or approximately 1000 for every man woman and 
child in the country will come from taxpayers

house speaker jim wright still denying the 
ethics charges against him is painting himself as a victim of 
political retribution and of a desire to accomplish too much too 
fast in congress 
in a 1hour luncheon with reporters and in a series of 
television interviews on thursday an unrepentant wright said he 
decided last weekend to resign from congress because he expected 
the ethics committee to recommend he be reprimanded a move which 
likely would have cost him his speakership 
to fight that recommendation would have been too politically 
costly and tied the house in knots for a long time to come he 
said so i decided that is one of those things that i cant 
change 
wright said he believed majority leader thomas foley dwash 
the man who will succeed him is better suited to heal the wounds 
caused by the ethics fight 
he does have a temperamental advantage in the sense of being 
more cautious reasoned less hurried wright said i was 
probably obsessed with the notion that i had a limited period of 
time in which to make my mark on the future that was one of my 
attitudes perhaps a failing 
in the interview wright was by turns jovial and emotional 
offering an unusual selfanalysis and portraying himself as seeking 
to restore peace to the chamber he had plunged into turmoil during 
his stormy 2year tenure 
he reached back to memories of his adolescence in dallas when a 
football coach persuaded him to join the school debate team and he 
became interested in woodrow wilsons ideas for the league of 
nations 
from that time i didnt want to do anything except to come to 
congress and to use whatever influence i could to help create the 
basis for a more peaceful world wright said his voice breaking 
he paused a moment to regain his composure and added 
you get so selfrighteous about these things i guess you 
think your way is right so you get very determined and you try to 
make things happen in a way that you believe in your finite 
judgment is best and maybe you are not the possessor of infinite 
wisdom maybe the other guys have got good ideas too 
wright dated his misfortunes from nov 13 1987 when he 
attended a meeting between nicaraguan president daniel ortega and 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo in washington during 
which the cardinal agreed to carry a peace proposal to the reagan 
administrationbacked contra rebels 
from that moment there was nothing but hostility from the 
administration wright said there was a determination on the 
part of certain people in the other party to see to it that i was 
removed 
wright came in for criticism that he was trying to usurp the 
foreign policymaking prerogatives of the executive branch but won 
praise from democratic liberals who opposed the contra policy 
the texas democrat did not allude to his ethics problems during 
the interview preferring to dwell on what he saw as the highlights 
of his 34year house career he sat in his private dining room 
decorated with the us and texas flags and a set of longhorns over 
the door 
wright announced his resignation in a house speech wednesday 
after a yearlong investigation that led to charges that he 
improperly accepted gifts and sought to evade house outside income 
limits 
he said he hoped his tenure as speaker would be remembered as 
a time when we began to turn from our preoccupation with military 
might to a recognition of the longdeferred agenda of building and 
rebuilding america 
and he added if ive made any contribution to peace in the 
world then thats the thing of which id be proudest 
he said he made up his mind to resign during a weekend getaway 
with his wife betty at a friends lodge in the blue ridge 
mountains of virginia but he said he had decided early this year 
that he would not seek another term in congress and had told the 
majority leader foley to get ready to be speaker 
he said he had received calls from his home district of fort 
worth urging him to stay and fight the charges they didnt 
understand the climate in washington they didnt realize the 
deadly destruction this entire episode had wrought the wicked 
forces it had set in motion between democrats and republicans in 
the house

the president of a savings and loan and several of 
the companys senior officers were charged thursday with 
misapplying funds to make campaign contributions to members of 
congress 
a federal grand jury here returned a 33count indictment 
charging patrick g king former president of vernon savings and 
loan association with conspiring with other senior vernon officers 
to commit fraud 
the scheme allegedly involved reimbursing vernon officers 
approximately 55000 for political campaign contributions to 
candidates for state and federal office said fbi special agent 
woody specht 
the indictment charges that the scheme involved contributions in 
1986 to texas republican gubernatorial candidate tom loeffler and 
the 1986 texas tribute an organization that donated money to 
several politicians including house speaker jim wright of fort 
worth us sen alan cranston dcalif and us rep jack kemp 
rnew york 
but the indictment emphasized that there were no allegations 
whatsoever that any of the candidates or campaign organizations 
knew that the contributions were coming from vernon or were 
otherwise illegal 
wright under fire for alleged ethics violations announced his 
resignation as speaker wednesday 
cranston was serving on the banking committee at the time of the 
donations the indictment said 
the indictment which charges king with conspiring with other 
senior officers to defraud the federal home loan bank board and to 
misapply vernon funds and enter false statements in its books and 
records was announced by the dallas bank fraud task force 
the task force is a multiagency group which brought the charges 
as part of the us justice departments ongoing investigation of 
suspected fraud in the texas banking and savings industry 
in effect the indictment charges that officials contributed 
to campaigns but were then reimbursed through various methods like 
through payroll accounts expense accounts specht said they 
were getting the money back 
the indictment shows that bank officials made contributions 
and then false entries were made et cetera to conceal the fact 
that funds were really paid for political contributions he said 
vernon which had offices in vernon texas and dallas was 
closed by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation on 
nov 19 1987

sperm cells can be used to introduce 
foreign genes into animals a discovery that could make it much 
easier to produce genetically engineered animals according to a 
study published today 
a team led by dr c spadafora at the institute of biomedical 
technology in rome reported that mouse sperm cells incubated in a 
solution with segments of foreign dna could capture the dna 
molecules 
in the experiment these spermatozoa then were used to fertilize 
mouse eggs in vitro many of the newly born mice incorporated the 
foreign dna into their genetic material the doctors wrote in the 
june issue of journal cell 
of 250 mice 30 percent showed evidence of the foreign dna 
dna an essential component of all living matter contains the 
bodys genetic code and transmits its hereditary pattern 
the scientists also did comparable experiments with frogs and 
sea urchins indicating that the ability of sperm to capture 
foreign dna is widespread among species 
the production of transgenic animals or those carrying a 
foreign gene had previously been accomplished only by injecting 
dna into singlecelled embryos 
the researchers said the results suggest broad applications for 
the use of sperm in producing many types of genetically engineered 
animals the findings also imply that sperm could be a natural 
point of entry for foreign dna which has possible implications for 
evolution and the transmission for disease the journal said 
if confirmed by others this publication will be a cornerstone 
in biology max birnstiel of the research institute of molecular 
pathology in vienna wrote in an accompanying editorial 
birnstiel said the research is important not only because the 
technique promises to do away with the laborious and technically 
demanding needle work for producing transgenic animals but also 
because of its potential usefulness for introducing commercially 
important features into such animal species that have so far proved 
difficult to deal with or refractory to present day technology 
until now gene transplantation in animals has been used mainly 
to create special breeds for research into diseases such as cancer 
and aids

restoring public confidence in japans government 
would be a formidible task for anyone in the wake of the recruit 
co scandal that toppled prime minister noboro takeshita 
for foreign minister sousuke uno it could be an impossible one 
in giving its blessing today for uno to succeed takeshita the 
governing liberal democrats have picked an experienced politician 
who was the partys second choice 
party leaders first tried to persuade masayoshi ito 75 to take 
the job but ito refused citing poor health at age 66 and 
dissatisfaction with the partys handling of reforms 
few leaders within the scandalridden party sang the praises of 
uno indeed many put forward lastminute alternatives to his 
nomination 
many fear he cannot win public confidence in the government 
shaken by the influencepeddling recruit scandal that forced 
takeshita to step down and led to charges against 17 politicians 
bureaucrats and businessmen 
analysts have speculated that party bosses who are too tainted 
by the financial scandal to take the post now settled on uno as an 
interim leader who will allow them to exert influence and not 
derail their future aspirations 
even the conservative yomiuri shimbun japans largest 
newspaper described uno who has been foreign minister since 1987 
only as a reasonable choice 
some party leaders would have preferred that the successor to 
prime minister takeshita come from the junior ranks in order to 
revitalize the party but uno was chosen to maintain party 
harmony yomiuri said in an editorial 
former prime ministers zenko suzuki and takeo fukuda suggested 
group leadership and expressed fears uno may be too weak to steer 
the conservative party to victory in parliamentary elections this 
summer 
support for the liberal democrats has fallen to the lowest 
levels ever largely because of the scandal 
the recruit co a publishing and information services 
conglomerate is accused of winning government favors by handing 
out millions of dollars in political donations and underpriced 
stock 
though uno himself is untainted by the scandal he is closely 
allied with former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone the scandal 
developed during his 198287 tenure 
uno said today that he would quit nakasones political faction 
however their previous close ties damaged unos reputation and 
they almost cost him the party nomination analysts say 
but supporters say unos highranking cabinet posts in a country 
striving for a stronger international role have made him a familiar 
figure to the japanese public 
uno has headed the ministry of international trade and industry 
the defense agency and the science and technology agency he is a 
10term member of the lower house of parliament from shiga 
prefecture in western japan 
born aug 27 1922 into a wealthy family in shiga uno fought 
in world war ii and served on the asian mainland before being taken 
prisoner by soviet troops in northern korea he and his wife 
chiyo have two children a son and daughter

an education department crackdown on schools 
with soaring loan default rates is drawing praise from lawmakers 
and passing marks even from the trade schools that will be most 
affected by the more stringent policies 
schools turning out extremely high percentages of delinquent 
borrowers will face an escalating series of corrective and punitive 
actions under new regulations announced thursday by education 
secretary lauro cavazos 
cavazos also said his department will take administrative steps 
and submit a package of legislative proposals to congress as part 
of a strategy to ease the default problem which is expected to 
cost taxpayers 18 billion this fiscal year 
there are some unscrupulous and uncaring institutions out 
there who are taking advantage of a program designed to help our 
students not financially shackle them cavazos said he said 
such schools promise to educate but deliver only a debt 
the prime targets of the crackdown are forprofit vocational 
schools which have an average default rate of 40 percent compared 
to 20 percent for community colleges and about 10 percent for other 
types of institutions the top 10 schools on a list released by the 
department were all trade schools with default rates topping 80 
percent 
officers of two major proprietary school associations called the 
cavazos approach definitely preferable to the plan advanced a year 
ago by his predecessor william bennett 
bennetts plan called for punitive proceedings against all 
schools with default rates above 20 percent cavazos said that 
would have affected 2500 schools and been impossible for the 
department to administer 
under his approach schools must have default rates over 60 
percent to trigger proceedings to limit suspend or terminate their 
participation in the huge student loan program those at 40 to 60 
percent will have to reduce their rate by 5 percent a year to avoid 
triggering the proceedings the system takes effect jan 1 1991 
less draconian steps such as default management plans delayed 
loan disbursements and prorata refunds will be required at lower 
levels 
stephen blair president of the 1250member national 
association of trade and technical schools called the cavazos 
regulations thoughtful and reasonable they tailor remedies to 
the situation were confident they will make a difference they 
will substantially reduce the defaults 
jim phillips executive vice president of the association of 
independent colleges and schools a group of business schools 
operating at 1100 locations said a positive feature of the new 
regulations is their delayed implementation 
secretary cavazos at least is giving the institutions 
enough time to first of all be forewarned about whats coming and 
second of all to do something about it if they can he said 
my concern is the latter whether there is anything else 
these institutions can do to solve what is still more of a social 
problem than an education problem phillips added referring to 
the high proportion of lowincome innercity academically risky 
students served by proprietary schools 
at his news conference cavazos said that type of problem would 
be considered on a casebycase basis there is not an 
absolute cutoff we are going to work with these schools 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee called the cavazos package a more 
constructive approach than the one taken by bennett and said he 
would work with the department 
but hawkins said he would look very carefully at the 
departments legislative proposals in order to make sure our 
efforts to deal with the student loan default problem do not 
excessively punish privately owned schools and other institutions 
of higher education with a high percentage of poor and minority 
students 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate education 
subcommittee and sponsor of a default reduction bill that passed 
the senate in march said cavazos had taken a solid step 
forward with his package 
cavazos is asking congress to enact a number of reforms his 
legislative proposals would require lenders to offer student 
borrowers graduated repayment schedules and bar schools from using 
commissioned recruiters it also would require prorata refunds at 
highdefault schools for student grants as well as loans and 
authorize guarantee agencies to withhold defaulters wages up to 
10 percent of disposable pay 
in addition the department wants lawmakers to require those 
without a high school diploma or its equivalent to pass an 
independently developed and administered abilitytobenefit 
test before enrolling in a course of study currently the schools 
write and administer the test themselves often after a student is 
enrolled 
administrative steps are to include more frequent program 
reviews audits and investigations by education department staff 
and expanded fraud detection through a tollfree hotline 
some 46 million students are expected to borrow money under the 
student loan program in fiscal 1989 the program is projected to 
cost 5 billion this year with 37 percent of the money going to 
cover defaulted loans 
according to the education department the 10 schools with the 
nations worst default problems based on rates for students who 
were required to start paying back loans in 1986 are 
the sawyer school of business center line mich 938 percent 
kalamazoo beauty academy kalamazoo mich 895 percent 
cambridge business college detroit 86 percent 
paynepulliam school of trade detroit 855 percent 
chicago school of automatic transmission 847 percent 
odessas college of beauty gary ind 838 percent 
maryland institute of technology baltimore 833 percent 
midsouth school of beauty memphis tenn 829 percent 
jeromes school of beauty culture new orleans 822 percent 
americo technical careers new orleans 818 percent 
the department developed its list from statistics gathered from 
guarantee agencies for loans in each state 
george lamb supervisor of the student loan program in michigan 
disputed the 938 percent default rate attributed to the sawyer 
school and said his agency may have transposed some data in 
november 1987 when the department issued its first default list 
sawyer had a 7088 percent default rate among students required to 
start repayments in 1985 according to education department 
spokesman tom lyon

the nuclear regulatory commission citing a 
long lag in promised improvements at a florida nuclear plant said 
it might consider closing the twinreactor station later this year 
the commission raised the possibility of such an extraordinary 
step after announcing thursday that the no 3 and 4 units at the 
turkey point nuclear station near florida city fla would be 
kept on its watch list of troubled plants 
as a result of its regular sixmonth review of all 110 licensed 
us nuclear power plants the commission took four reactors off 
the watch list added two others and expressed deep concern that 
turkey point has been on the list for three years 
turkey point is the only plant in the nation to appear on the 
nrcs category 2 watch list each time since the list was 
started in 1986 plants in this category are allowed to continue 
running but only with increased nrc supervision 
the commission said thursday it was adding a third resident 
inspector at turkey point to beef up oversight 
regulators also said they were keeping the tennessee valley 
authoritys browns ferry 1 2 and 3 reactors on their category 
3 watch list which is reserved for plants that are shut down and 
cannot restart without special nrc approval 
the pilgrim plant near plymouth mass and the peach bottom 
units 2 and 3 near lancaster pa were moved up to category 2 to 
reflect the fact that they have been allowed to restart both will 
continue to receive special nrc monitoring until they demonstrate a 
sustained improvement in operations the commission said 
the regulators also announced that two nuclear reactors owned by 
virginia power co had been added to the watch list in part 
because of increased violations of nrc rules just last month the 
utility was fined 500000 the sixth largest fine since the 
commission was created in 1975 for violating safety regulations 
the surry no 1 and 2 reactors are situated near newport news va 
the watch list includes four other operating reactors calvert 
cliffs no 1 and 2 of annapolis md and nine mile point no 1 
and 2 of oswego ny 
victor stello the commissions chief of operations told a 
commission meeting were very disappointed that the turkey 
point reactors has remained on the problem list for three years 
without showing a clear improvement trend 
stello said without explicitly suggesting that turkey point be 
forced to close that more drastic nrc action might be required 
unless the plants owner florida power amp light co made faster 
progress in solving the problems 
three of the five commissioners made similar remarks 
i dont know how long the commission can continue to monitor 
turkey point with increased resources said lando w zech jr 
the commission chairman 
i think the florida power amp light organization should 
recognize that the commissions patience is wearing very thin he 
said adding turkey point has not shown us much 
kenneth carr a commission member said in a tone of incredulity 
that he found it interesting that while turkey point had failed 
to get well after three years of intensified nrc monitoring 
most nuclear plants that had been forced to shut down because of 
operating problems had managed to recover in two years 
we might have done them a favor by forcing turkey point to 
close he added 
spokesmen at florida power amp light did not return a reporters 
telephone call 
earlier this week the company said it had achieved vast 
improvements at turkey point over the past year it was 
responding to a report by an antinuclear group public citizen 
that ranked turkey point no 3 as the worstrun nuclear plant in 
the country it rated the turkey point no 4 unit as 10th worst 
the four reactors that were removed from the nrc watch list 
thursday are sequoyah no 1 and 2 of chattanooga tenn fermi2 
of newport mich and fort calhoun of omaha neb

congress wont be rushing into drought relief 
legislation this session the way it did last year say the chairman 
of the senate agriculture committee and a republican colleague 
sens patrick leahy dvt and rudy boschwitz rminn said 
thursday the drought that has devastated winter wheat in some key 
states doesnt appear to be a problem yet to other crops 
after a press conference on an unrelated topic the senators 
said the dry weather problems this year have not reached the 
emergency proportions of 1988 
we will take the appropriate steps but not precipitously 
said leahy in reference to the dry spell that hit kansas and nearby 
states hard during early spring 
im very concerned about winter wheat he said but i 
dont want to move until we see about present crops 
rains have been heavy in recent days in farm states but they 
didnt come soon enough to save most of the winter wheat crop which 
the agriculture department this week called mostly fair to poor 
in kansas the wheat looks poor to very poor the department 
said harvesting of the crop is under way in california georgia 
oklahoma and texas while the wheat is still growing elsewhere 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and begins to sprout in 
early spring but shortage of spring rain particularly in kansas 
has devastated the crop 
sen bob dole rkan has introduced legislation that would 
extend the 1988 drought relief law to this years winter wheat 
crop but no further action has been taken on the bill 
leahy said he would ask agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to 
brief members of the agriculture committee and other senators 
interested in drought legislation soon 
yeutter after touring iowa drought areas earlier this week 
said we have to be careful we dont overestimate the problems 
and respond in a way that just isnt called for under the 
circumstances 
the house agriculture committee last week passed drought 
legislation that would extend the 1988 law to many crops besides 
winter wheat the bill has not been voted on by the full house

advocates for the popular federal nutrition 
program known as wic say the government should spend 150 million 
more on it next fiscal year for the poor people who should be 
getting help but arent 
about 75 million women infants and children are eligible but 
48 percent are not participating in the program said robert fersh 
executive director of the food research and action center who held 
a press conference thursday to announce the results of two studies 
of the program 
our central finding is that young children those between the 
ages of one and five are the least likely to receive the benefits 
of wic special supplemental food program for women infants and 
children he said 
in general lowincome children tend to be shorter and 
lighter and are more likely to suffer from impaired iron status 
and anemia he said poorer iron status is associated with 
poorer performance on standardized tests 
he said the number of people who participate is dependent on the 
amount of money congress spends on the program 
the federal budget resolution for fiscal 1990 passed by congress 
in a compromise with the white house calls for spending a total 
2158 billion on wic including the 150 million fersh wants in it 
but the details of the budget are not worked out and the 
agriculture department is facing a requested 1 billion in cuts and 
the wic program is part of agriculture

republican strategists are urging gop 
lawmakers to make hay out of the ethics mess in the house of 
representatives by claiming it shows democrats have held power 
there for too many years 
the democrats in the house have grown arrogant with their 
unchallenged power says a memo circulated quietly among 
republican lawmakers this week by the national republican 
congressional committee 
the committee produced the paper as a political script for 
republican congressmen in the ethics drama unfolding in the house 
house speaker jim wright dtexas announced his resignation 
wednesday following a yearlong ethics probe less than a week 
earlier majority whip tony coelho dcalif resigned rather than 
subject the democrats and his family to an investigation of his 
100000 junk bond purchase 
the national republican congressional committee raises funds 
produces briefing papers and videos provides polling research and 
a wide array of other services aimed at helping gop lawmakers 
polish their political image house democrats and both parties in 
the senate maintain similar committees 
in some respects the briefing paper resembled dozens of others 
turned out by the committee in this case however it made 
explicit a gop strategy of exploiting the ethics mess for political 
advantage 
power tends to corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely 
it quoted the 19th century historian lord acton it cautioned 
against falling in with what it described as a democratic tendency 
to blame the fall of wright and coelho on ethical mccarthyism 
and character assassination 
this is absolutely false it said jim wright and tony 
coelhos falls were character suicides 
it called the resignations of two of the top three democrats in 
the house the bitter fruit of 35 years of democratic control of 
that body 
why did two prominent intelligent members of the democratic 
leadership get into this bind it asked at another point 
because there may have been a feeling of invulnerability when 
you can abuse the rights of the minority for as long as they 
have there could well be a feeling that you can do what you want 
ethics be damned 
committee spokesman john buckley said he was the author of the 
document and that it was meant primarily for the eyes of republican 
congressmen obviously it wasnt intended to be provided to a 
reporter he said 
he said the gop was fully prepared to take advantage of the 
revelations about democrats but he denied there was any special 
campaignstyle effort to dig up new dirt 
house democratic leader thomas foley of washington who is 
expected to become the next speaker of the house called for 
conciliation thursday but some of his followers were in a mood to 
fight fire with fire politically 
democrats are trying to act with restraint declared rep 
gary ackerman dny but there comes a time when people are 
going to push back and push back awfully hard

the house republican leader is joining 
democrats in condemnation of leaks about a federal investigation of 
rep william gray a democrat running for majority whip 
rep bob michel rill said thursday that news stories were 
apparently based on information from justice department 
investigators and the office of the us attorney in philadelphia 
in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh michel said he 
was protesting possibly illegal leaking of information damaging 
to a member of congress 
it is just hard to imagine anything more irresponsible 
michel said he said that if the justice department cannot complete 
a successful investigation into the leaks thornburgh should 
weigh very seriously grays request for an independent counsel 
to investigate the leaks 
gray of pennsylvania chairman of the house democratic caucus 
issued a statement thursday denying that he employed any 
noshow workers on his congressional office payroll or on the 
house budget committee which he chaired until january 
government sources speaking only on condition they not be 
named said there is a preliminary inquiry into allegations of 
employment practices and expenditures on grays staff including 
allegations that the lawmaker hireda ghost employee news 
stories based on anonymous sources revealed the investigation on 
wednesday 
justice department spokesman david runkel said we have 
confidence that this matter can be investigated here in this 
department 
grays statement thursday said there are and were no ghost 
noshow or absentee employees on my house or committee 
payrolls 
the pennsylvania democrat has asked thornburgh to appoint an 
independent counsel to investigate the leaks and the motivations 
of this socalled investigation arranged to occur just as i was 
seeking a leadership position in the democratic party 
he called thornburghs promise to have an inhouse investigation 
insufficient and added there is nothing to substantiate 
these unfounded charges told by cowardly anonymous sources that 
there was any employee impropriety 
meanwhile attorney lezli baskerville said thursday she has 
never been a noshow employee of congress and described herself 
as a workaholic who always arrived early and left late 
ms baskerville read a statement denouncing what she called a 
smear campaign against her and gray and criticizing past news 
coverage by the associated press 
ms baskerville was mentioned by name this week in several news 
accounts that said justice department investigators were interested 
in employees who worked for gray while he was budget committee 
chairman 
ms baskerville said she has heard absolutely nothing from 
justice or the fbi gray on thursday released an affidavit from 
her in which she described the work she did for him 
ms baskerville said she was the first to arrive at the office 
and the last to leave in a series of shortterm jobs for members 
of congress

kate prinsley admits she underestimated florence 
nightingale the mother of modern nursing before becoming curator 
of the worlds first museum of nightingalia 
i always thought she was very dull a simpering victorian 
said ms prinsley whose forte was museums not medicine i had 
no idea that she was i think a very shrewd woman a real 
operator i had no idea she was quite so tough 
for those with only faded schoolbook recollections of the lady 
with the lamp the florence nightingale museum has a tale to tell 
opened three months ago it recounts often in her own words 
how a coddled girl defied her parents for a career in which she 
laid the foundations of modern nursing and instituted public health 
reforms that changed hospitals worldwide 
her work in statistics still amazes bureaucrats she became an 
expert on india without ever going there she wrote 200 books and 
major papers and kept working into her 90th and last year 
she was much more than a nurse says patricia mowbray a 
nightingale expert the horrors of the hospitals would have gone 
on unchanged if shed been just a nurse 
the museum is at londons st thomas hospital home of the 
nursing school nightingale founded in 1860 among items on display 
are her medicine chest and a replica of the lamp she carried in the 
crimean war hospitals where she did her most famous work improving 
conditions for the wounded and sick 
what a comfort it was to see her pass one soldier wrote 
we could kiss her shadow as it fell and lay our heads on the 
pillow again content 
born in 1820 the moody florence was interested in the sick from 
an early age but nice girls did not become nurses in those days 
the profession was considered disreputable her parents refused to 
let her take it up and she studied nursing in secret 
trust me help me give me your blessing she pleaded in 
a letter to her family they did not reply 
not until she was 33 did she get a real nursing job as 
administrator of a small london hospital called the institution for 
the care of sick gentlewomen in distressed circumstances 
nightingale reorganized it so thoroughly that when word of the 
horrendous conditions at the crimean warfront reached england she 
was asked to lead a nursing expedition 
not a sponge nor a rag of linen not anything have i left 
she wrote in 1854 soon after her arrival at the dank barrack 
hospital in scutari turkey 
but within a month she had organized proper kitchens repaired 
many of the four miles of wards ordered soap and a screen for 
operations because she said when a soldier due for an amputation 
sees his comrade die today under the knife it diminishes his 
chances the museum recreates the scene 
florence nightingale came home two years later in poor health 
but a national heroine poems and songs were written for her and 
44000 pounds today worth more than 16 million was raised for 
what would become the nightingale school of nursing 
she shunned publicity and spent most of the rest of her life as 
a recluse bedridden for many years she never married having 
turned down the man she loved for the sake of her calling 
but from her home she barraged the government with proposals for 
hospital reform for helping the sick and poor and for the army 
she calculated that more soldiers died in peacetime from poor 
hygiene than in war and urged such innovations as ventilation 
clean linen and plants to lift patients spirits 
her 1859 notes on hospitals begins it may seem a strange 
principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital 
that it should do the sick no harm 
in fact says ms prinsley florence nightingales work was so 
precise and detailed that health researchers still study it 
the museum also operates as a research center and a trust that 
awards grants to nurses in britain and abroad

dixon terry a defender of family farms 
who became a power in democratic politics died doing what he loved 
working the fields friends said at his funeral 
about 1000 mourners including the rev jesse jackson and sen 
tom harkin diowa filled greenfield united methodist church on 
thursday the crowd overflowed to the lawn outside tears flowed 
freely 
he departed doing a good thing with his shoes on said 
jackson no man conquered dixon terry 
terry 39 died sunday after baling hay on his dairy farm 
outside this southwest iowa town he was struck by lightning while 
riding on a hay rack and died on a rolling hill where the view 
extends for miles 
if he could have picked the place im sure this is what he 
would have picked the rev david ostendorf said 
if he told me once he told me a hundred times that all he 
wanted to be was a farmer ostendorf told mourners later 
ostendorf said terry frequently told him that he found life as 
an activist trying and that he much preferred devoting time to 
family and farm 
jackson returned to this town where his iowa presidential 
campaign was headquartered this time to eulogize terry and 
declare we will not forget our cause 
in the center of americas heartland rests iowa said 
jackson in the center of iowa in its heart rests greenfield 
in the heart of greenfield there stood a giant of man dixon 
terry 
jackson recalled his campaign and the help he got from terry 
saying all of that explosion came from a germ of a seed planted 
in the still of the night in this church by dixon terry 
terry graduated from radcliffe high school in 1968 and attended 
iowa state university where he pondered getting an advanced degree 
and becoming a professor 
but he got caught up in the civilrights and antiwar movement 
and dropped out of school after 2 years he worked as a garbageman 
and grew his red hair past his shoulders he returned to the 
radcliffe area to work on his familys farm then he bought a farm 
near greenfield in 1977 
jay howe a greenfield lawyer and democratic activist recalled 
meeting him for the first time in 1980 
my first impression wasnt entirely positive howe said 
during a eulogy as he noted he was turned off by terrys 
wirerimmed glasses and his long red pony tail 
but after getting to know terry howe was impressed by terrys 
community involvement his devotion to his family and his political 
leanings 
terry was founder of the iowa farm unity coalition and head of 
the national family farm coalition 
he forged an alliance among church labor and farm groups to 
draw attention to farmers financial problems and he served as a 
delegate to the 1984 democratic national convention where he 
founded a coalition to push farm issues in the partys platform 
terry attracted a lot of attention in 1987 when he invited 
jackson to speak in greenfield as his first campaign trip of the 
1988 race 
to be sure not everyone agreed with terry who some considered 
a radical and troublemaker and harkin recalled political battles 
he fought with terry 
he could cut through the baloney and blue smoke of politics 
said harkin he understood politics is about power and his 
lifelong goal was to give farmers more power 
he cared about his family and community he saw that true 
independence was not possible unless farmers joined together 
farm activists and friends also honored terry 
he was a man of extraordinary talents and ability who fought a 
war within our own country said gary lamb of the iowa farmers 
union he fought that war as well as any man ive ever known 
this gentle giant 
friends said terrys farm was being tended by neighbors and 
since terry left behind a 300000 debt on the farm a fund had 
been set up for his survivors his wife linda and 17yearold 
daughter willow and 13yearold son dusky and the troubled 
family farm 
from the altar jackson made a pitch for the fund directly 
addressing mrs terry 
we will make sure you do not lose your farm we have an 
obligation to dixon

with the texas influence in washington waning 
as house speaker jim wright prepares to leave congress the states 
other powerful allies say theyre ready for some heavy lifting to 
fill the void 
fortunately texas is blessed by having many spokesmen in 
washington including the president and cabinet officers and agency 
heads says sen phil gramm rtexas so this is clearly a 
setback but if everybody works hard i believe we can still get the 
job done 
wright resigned wednesday in an emotional speech in which he 
denied the findings of the house ethics committee which charged he 
violated house rules of conduct in 69 instances 
sen lloyd bentsen a democrat said wrights loss means a 
heavier burden for him as chairman of the senate finance committee 
because of its broad jurisdiction 
where i could count on jim wright to pick up that part over 
there on the house side along with the members of the texas 
delegation he had an extra bit of muscle as speaker so itll be 
up to the rest of us to make up for that said bentsen who 
chairs the senates most influential committee 
rep jim chapman dtexas said weve lost an important 
spokesman for our agenda which means the rest us of us have to link 
together work a little harder and make it happen 
chapman says texas will be losing the vigilant eye of someone 
who could spot and stop the late hour mischief that can occur in 
this place or the possibility of late hour mischief 
wright also was able to restore a battered piece of texas 
legislation to its original state as it neared a final vote in the 
house chapman said 
the speaker has a tremendous influence in that process and can 
influence that process chapman said 
anytime i would go to him with something for my district or 
texas i always had a friendly ear and that helped he never turned 
his back he always gave you effort and you felt it not just a 
token effort he swung hard when he swung said rep ralph hall 
dtexas 
hall also bemoaned the loss of former sen john tower of texas 
whose nomination as secretary of defense was rejected by the senate 
amid allegations of conflict of interest womanizing and excessive 
drinking 
at the beginning of the year we had the secretary of 
commerce the president and two of the best us senators in the

richard gephardt is banking on his national 
reputation and youthful appeal as a new generation congressman 
in seeking democratic support to become the next house majority 
leader 
gephardt who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1988 said in 
an interview thursday that he is encouraged by the backing he 
has received so far from democratic colleagues 
the feedback has been positive but im surely not prepared to 
say that weve done it said gephardt 
the 48yearold missourian is running against rep ed jenkins 
dga for the no 2 leadership post to replace rep thomas foley 
of washington who is expected to become house speaker next week 
the leadership scramble which had been taking shape behind the 
scenes boiled into the open this week with the announcement by 
house speaker jim wrights resignation announcement 
gephardt publicly launched his campaign with a letter to 
democrats an appeal for change that stressed his background as one 
of the new breed of american politicians who have risen to power in 
the postwatergate era 
john kennedy said in 1961 that it was time for a new 
generation of americans to lead our country gephardt wrote 
now i believe it is time for a new generation of members to lead 
the congress 
he noted that like himself twothirds of current house members 
have been elected since 1978 and he described the democrats as a 
young and vibrant majority jenkins 56 also was elected in 
1978 and serves with gephardt on the house ways and means committee 
gephardt said he would not seek the 1992 presidential nomination 
if he becomes majority leader and said in the letter he would 
devote all of my energies to the work of the house 
some democrats were annoyed at gephardts prolonged absence from 
the house during last years presidential campaign when he was 
head of the party caucus the no 4 leadership job he served four 
years in that post 
gephardt said he had been seriously considering another run for 
the white house but decided to seek the house post because it was 
the best way to tackle a wide range issues before the country 
i am not going to use a house leadership position as a 
stepping stone to something else gephardt said 
i havent said this about 92 because i thought it was 
necessary to get elected but because i believe that you cant do 
two things at once of this magnitude you cant be an effective 
majority leader and be running for president its just that 
simple 
gephardts allies contend he would serve as an articulate 
spokesman for the party in the television age of soundbite 
politics he earned a name for himself as an early advocate of 
politically attractive issues such as tax reform and a champion of 
a gettough trade policy which became the centerpiece of his 
presidential campaign 
i think i have learned how to put together coalitions in the 
house so we can reach consensus in the congress and be able to 
assert a policy said gephardt i also have learned something 
about conveying an issue to voters in the country at large 
gephardt also is viewed as one of the partys few potential 
leaders who have been certified by a presidential campaign as free 
of any ethical problems that could cause democrats further 
embarrassment 
he said he decided to jump into the leadership race over the 
weekend after learning from news accounts that rep tony coelho 
dcalif the majority whip was resigning from the house in order 
to avoid a lengthy investigation into his own personal finances 
before that he had decided not to challenge coelho for the post 
because of their friendship and instead was considering running for 
whip the no 3 leadership job

the house democrats are trying to elect new 
leaders in an atmosphere of suspicion that shows few signs of 
abating despite the resignation of speaker jim wright 
rep thomas foley dwash certain to replace wright as speaker 
in an election scheduled for tuesday said he hoped to return the 
house to a mood of mutual respect and conciliation between the 
parties 
wright in a luncheon with reporters said there has to come 
an end there must come an end to the use of ethics as a 
political weapon do i believe thats going to happen overnight 
because i said it no i do not 
democrats had hoped wrights resignation which followed the 
resignation of the no 3 democrat rep tony coelho of california 
also because of controversy over personal finances would put the 
ethics issue behind them 
so they were angered thursday about news reports that the 
justice department was checking personnel practices in the office 
of rep william h gray iii of pennsylvania the fourthranking 
house leader and now candidate for coelhos slot in the coming 
succession 
the democrats very clearly believe this is a concerted 
planned coordinated effort it is a continuation of the 1988 
campaign i think there is certainly a feeling now that the white 
house is accountable said rep steny hoyer dmd a member of 
the democratic leadership 
house minority leader bob michel rill sent a letter to the 
justice department decrying the leaks in the gray case 
but republicans who caucused thursday to discuss ethics 
otherwise made clear they saw no reason to let go of the issue with 
which they have been battering the democrats for months 
rep newt gingrich rga who launched the ethics investigation 
which eventually brought down wright said thursday he was angry 
at the tone of wrights speech before the house on wednesday 
wrights calling it mindless cannibalism that had engulfed 
him was an insult to the ethics committee and every decent person 
in the house it was not mindless it was very serious said 
gingrich who as the house minority whip is michels next in 
command 
gingrich said while justice department leaks of the case 
involving gray were wrong the political parties could police 
each other by checking into possible wrongdoing by the 
opposition jim wrights a symbol of how sick the congress has 
become he said 
while some clearly remained in a confrontational mode others 
said the point of deepest angst had passed with wrights 
resignation 
rep charles schumer dny said the speakers announcement 
was a catharsis 
rep byron dorgan dnd called on those couple of dozen 
members who have been badmouthing the house to stopi think 
its time for the members of this house who dont want to serve 
here to leave he said 
with foley running for speaker rep richard gephardt dmo is 
promising to stay and serve if hes elected majority leader 
gephardt ran for president in 1988 but is promising to stay in the 
house and forego another attempt in 1992 
gephardt who is battling rep ed jenkins dga for majority 
leader said in a letter to colleagues thursday that he was not 
interested in wallowing in rumor or engaging in partisan intrigue 
he wrapped himself in foleys coattails pledging to work with 
his popular colleague to install a new generation of leaders in 
the house 
the race for majority whip includes gray who is now the 
chairman of the house democratic caucus david bonior the chief 
deputy whip and rep beryl anthony dark the chairman of the 
democratic congressional campaign committee rep henry waxman 
dcalif was also assessing his chances 
will bill gray be able to hold his troops thats the 
question said schumer alluding to the bad publicity gray had to 
explain to jittery democrats so far there arent many 
defections 
while election of a new speaker by the democrats and the full 
house has been scheduled for tuesday no date has been set for 
democrats to choose their party leadership posts 
lawmakers said it would most likely occur a week or more after 
the speakers election

elevenyearold larry banister ii is 
acknowledged to be the most precocious promoter in this old gold 
mining community now that his efforts in behalf of kids day have 
begun to hit pay dirt 
and this definitely is a gold letter day for the blond 
curleyhaired boy from dahlonega not only is today his 11th 
birthday and the last day of the school term but thanks to larry 
its also children appreciation day in juneau alaska 
larry has a personal copy of the proclamation issued by juneau 
mayor bruce botelho 
hes one of the mayors i wrote asking him to proclaim a kids 
day said the talkative fifth grader with no doubts about being 
promoted to sixth grade 
what larrys really interested in promoting at the moment is 
kids day during the past year or so he has written hundreds of 
letters to politicians across the country asking them to set aside 
a special day to honor kids 
i got the idea a couple of years ago on grandparents day 
he said as he lounged on a couch in the office of his familys 
mortuary 
we were told at school that it was grandparents day he 
recalled i said to myself theres a mothers day and a 
fathers day even a grandparents day so why not have a day 
honoring children after all were the hope of the future the 
ones who are going to have to clean up all this mess the older 
generation is leaving us 
not being one to mess around himself he sat right down and 
began his letter writing 
i wore out three typewriter ribbons and used up all my dads 
stationery he said i got the names and addresses of the state 
legislators from my grandfather who was the county coroner at the 
time and i used my world alamanac to get the zip codes of all the 
big cities and sent those letters in care of the mayor 
it wasnt long before his efforts paid off dahlonega officials 
proclaimed oct 15 as kids day officials in nearby dawsonville 
followed suit on dec 6 
gov joe frank harris fell into line with a statewide kids day 
on dec 8 
larry said hawaii county hawaii declared may 19 to be kids 
day but georgia is the only state ive gotten so far 
what hes shooting for is a national kids day maybe even an 
nonpaid holiday honoring kids he badgered his congressman 
democratic rep ed jenkins into offering a resolution last year 
but the proposal failed 
this year however a similar resolution was offered by rep 
joseph p kennedy iii dmass the proposal which would have the 
second sunday in october national childrens day was approved by a 
voice vote in the house on may 9 and was sent to the senate 
judiciary committee 
a spokesman in kennedys office said the congressman was 
influenced by his 8yearold twin sons who thought there should 
be a day honoring children 
larry said he doesnt care what date is chosen but he wants it 
to be called kids day 
its a punchier name he said adding hell go to washington 
to lobby the senate if the resolution doesnt get action soon 
his mom joyce banister said she wouldnt be surprised at 
anything her son does 
were real proud of larry she said hes always reading 
or playing with his computer he also likes soccer but what he 
really likes is politics 
larry whos sure hell have his own political career someday 
has even tried to enlist president bush although he hasnt been 
able to reach the president 
however i have heard from more than 150 state legislators 
around the country he said almost all of them told me they 
liked my idea for a kids day though one old sour puss did tell me 
it wasnt necessary because every day is kids day he did admit 
though that he probably sounded like a parent

eastern airlines will pay 31 million to 
several of its benefit plans to settle a case in which the 
government alleged the carrier illegally tapped employee funds to 
pay corporate expenses 
the bankrupt airline could face up to another 55 million in 
bills to cover the costs of audits it agreed to conduct for the 
past three years as well as through 1994 
eastern still operating a skeleton schedule three months into a 
strike by its machinists union entered into a consent agreement 
with the labor department on thursday without admitting or denying 
it violated its duties under federal pension laws 
the cashpoor airline issued a statement saying the alleged 
technical violations were discovered after a 1987 internal audit 
and that it voluntarily brought them to the attention of the labor 
department 
because eastern has filed for court protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law the settlement will 
have to be approved by a bankruptcy court in new york 
the labor department complaint alleged that beginning in 1977 
eastern violated its trust responsibilities through an informal 
arrangement in which it used insurance commissions earned by its 
welfare plans to offset actuarial expenses of the company it also 
alleged that eastern paid its remaining corporate actuarial 
expenses from assets of its pension plans 
specifically the complaint said eastern violated federal 
pension laws by 
using 21 million in commissions generated by insurance 
policies of the welfare plans to offset what it owed to a company 
known as mercermeidingerhansen inc for corporate and 
pensionrelated work the welfare plans funded entirely with 
employee contributions provide travel and longterm disability 
insurance to eastern workers 
causing definedbenefit plans to pay for actuarial services 
related to easterns corporate affairs including 250000 for work 
unrelated to the benefit plans 
receiving excessive fees for administrating the travel accident 
plan from 1975 to 1987 
failing to file reports required by the government for the 
travel accident plan 
under terms of the order eastern must pay into escrow accounts 
675285 for the disability plan and 18 million for the travel 
accident plan also the company must pay another 591713 to seven 
of its 11 defined benefits plans 
eastern also agreed to pay up to 800000 a year for annual 
audits between now and 1994 and up to another 15 million for 
audits covering the past three years 
results of those audits are to be included in reports eastern 
must file for the next five years demonstrating its compliance with 
the pension laws the agreement requires eastern to hire a third 
party acceptable to the labor department to prepare the reports 
eastern also was permanently barred from using assets of 
employee benefit plans to pay for corporate expenses 
mercermeidinger which was not a party to the case agreed in a 
side letter to establish a compliance unit responsible for 
implementing a program to assure that it does not allow violations 
of the pension laws the complaint did not cite the company but 
alleged eastern had an informal arrangement with mercermeidinger 
that led to the alleged violations

a union representing 365000 postal workers 
says its members will slice up any sears roebuck and co credit 
cards they hold and boycott the retail giant unless it removes mini 
post offices from 11 of its stores 
the american postal workers union said thursday it also was 
considering asking for a nationwide labor boycott of sears if it 
ignored the demand 
we view this as a menace to postal jobs and postal workers and 
the general public union president moe biller said in a 
telephone interview sears today kmart tomorrow walmart the 
next day and jc penney after that then the time would come when 
they say we dont need any post office retail windows 
the sears pilot program began in october biller said he has 
complained privately to the postal service and sears but was 
mounting a public campaign now because postal officials informed 
him last week as many as 100 more of the instore counters are 
planned 
a sears spokeswoman said the chicagobased retailer planned to 
continue the pilot program at least through its oneyear 
anniversary in october but said he knew of no expansion plans 
postal service spokesman ralph stewart said when the program 
began the agency said it would add more postal counters in sears 
stores if the experiment proved successful but he said he was not 
aware of any current plans to add more 
in a publication mailed apwu members this week biller urged the 
postal workers to sign and mail a form letter addressed to sears 
chairman edward a brennan 
your companys pilot postal venture with the usps is nothing 
less than an attempt to replace us with a lowwage nonunion work 
force the letter said it is a classic example of how 
unionbusting managers use privatization to try to crush trade 
unions for the benefit of profiteers 
the 11 postal counters in sears stores now are confined to the 
chicago area and madison wis the counters are run by nonunion 
sears employees 
we feel the issue is one between the union and postal service 
management sears spokeswoman mary jean houde said we do 
regret of course that the postal union feels it necessary to 
threaten this action 
in a statement the postal service said the units at sears and 
6000 like them nationwide largely in neighborhood drug and 
convenience stores were designed to benefit consumers 
they are helping us provide greater convenience to a very 
broad segment of the public often during hours that post offices 
are not open the statement said we believe it represents the 
best interests of our employees and we want to assure them that 
nothing about these efforts is a threat to their job security

a new jersey senator is urging the federal 
government to assess the impact on the environment at home and 
abroad when undertaking development projects saying failure to 
do so goes against bush administration claims 
the president seems unable to take the simple action of 
ordering federal agencies to consider this and other global 
environmental issues in their impact statements sen frank 
lautenberg dnj said this failure undercuts the 
administrations claims to be moving aggressively and to be taking 
a leadership role in addressing the consequences of global 
warming 
during a hearing thursday on reauthorization of the national 
environmental policy act lautenberg noted the bush administration 
was failing to act on its stated intention to target worldwide 
environmental threats 
lautenberg brought before his superfund subcommittee two 
reauthorization bills stepping up consideration of environmental 
impact when federal actions are involved 
the first bill introduced earlier in the day by lautenberg and 
sens dave durenberger rminn and john chafee rri would 
strengthen the power of the council on environmental quality a 
body that advises the president the amended measure also would 
authorize the council to issue regulations assuring environmental 
impact statements address such global issues as ozone depletion and 
the greenhouse effect 
the second measure introduced earlier in the session by sen 
steven d symms ridaho would require multilateral banks such as 
the world bank to conduct environmental assessments before 
undertaking foreign projects 
a alan hill chairman of the council on environmental quality 
which advises the president on environmental matters said he was 
unsure whether the council should be responsible for actions on 
global warming 
i dont know if its the best to deal off an issue to the 
council he said its up to the president to make one place 
the coordinating body 
hill who leaves his post in june after eight years said he 
believed the united states should cooperate with other nations to 
press banks for environmental impact statements on foreign 
development projects such as construction of dams 
if we stand up alone our chances of success are less if we 
all get together its the bigger wallet he said 
michael mccloskey chairman of the sierra club testified that 
the council on environmental quality should be strengthened 
we believe it is urgent that the president revive ceq and we 
hope he will ask for the resources needed to rebuild its staff to 
between 40 and 50 people we hope too that the congress will 
provide the funding for this 
mccloskey said the council which shrank in manpower and impact 
in the past decade but should assume the lead role in devising 
initiatives for the president on global climate changes ozone 
forest losses pollution and management of public lands 
however edwin l johnson director of the developing countries 
staff for the office of international activities of the 
environmental protection agency objected to such requirements 
which could be interpreted as outside interference from the united 
states 
he said some changes in the legislation leave the bill still 
open to criticism by the multilateral development banks and 
borrowing nations as a unilateral imposition of us standards

difference and what a difference it made wright dtexas said 
his eventfilled life seemed to mirror the bestcelebrated traits 
of americans ambition honest toil optimism for the future and 
compassion 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine said peppers 
death marks the passing of an era in american history 
to the 101st congress from the early days of the roosevelt 
administration when the energies of the federal government were 
turned to the tasks of dealing with a nation onethird illhoused 
illclothed and illfed claude pepper never forgot his duty as 
an elected official to fight for the common welfare mitchell 
said 
pepper is only the 27th american to lie in state in the rotunda 
and only the second to have his casket open as had army gen

into the rotunda by members of the four armed services and placed 
on a wooden catafalque draped in black velvet with silk cord and 
fringe 
peppers family members of congress and his staff encircled the 
open casket for the service 
many of those filing past peppers casket had personal memories 
of the lawmaker while others claimed only to benefit from his 
lifelong battles for social security and other pensions 
catastrophic health insurance and other laws aimed at helping the 
poor and the elderly

the interior department is ordering strict 
fire control for national parks and wilderness areas saying last 
summers let it burn policy was impractical and 
unprofessional 
a joint directive embracing a task force report was issued 
thursday by interior secretary manuel lujan and agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter whose department has jurisdiction over 
national forests 
there have been sizeable fires in national parks and forests 
already this spring in a number of states including texas florida 
wyoming and colorado 
summer fire conditions are being watched very closely said 
george berklacy a spokesman for the national park service he 
added however that climate and other conditions give no 
suggestion that the fire season will be anywhere near as 
devastating as last year 
the task force which was called to review federal fire 
management policies after last summers fires at yellowstone had 
concluded that there are environmental benefits to allowing 
controlled fires but that greater assurances must be shown that a 
fire cannot get out of control before it is allowed to burn 
the interior department endorsed all 15 recommendations of the 
task force including one which called for stronger fire management 
policies and a ban on even controlled fires until the improvement 
management plans are put into effect 
department spokesmen said all 26 national parks that have major 
fire prevention programs are preparing the tighter fire management 
programs outlined by the task force and no controlled fires will be 
allowed to burn in a park until the improved programs are in place 
if a fire occurs at yellowstone it will be fought immediately 
and be put out said berklacy he said he doubted that the 
prohibition against controlled or prescribed fires will be 
lifted this summer in any of the parks 
there has been a moratorium on controlled fires in federal parks 
and wilderness areas since last august as a result of the 
controversy that erupted after the fires at yellowstone 
while the new federal fire policy continues to endorse the let 
it burn philosophy in theory it calls for tighter controls on 
such fires including more stringent monitoring to lessen the 
likelihood of a fire raging out of control 
once the improved fire management programs are put into effect 
officials at parks may allow some fires to burn under strict 
control the department said but among the added precautions are 
that a senior official at each park must closely monitor such a 
fire and certify in writing daily that adequate resources are 
available to ensure that the fire will remain within prescribed 
boundaries and conditions 
if these conditions cannot be met the fire shall be declared 
a wildfire and suppressed said the department 
the task force whose recommendations were broadly endorsed 
thursday by the interior department was assembled last september 
after the worst fire season ever at yellowstone national park 
during the summer more than 200 fires seared an estimated 13 
million acres of the park and surrounding national forests 
local officials sharply criticized the federal government for 
failing to bring the fires under control and put some of the blame 
on the longstanding let it burn policies 
many scientists have defended the practice of allowing certain 
fires to burn unless they threaten human life homes or villages 
they argue that such fires are part of a natural cycle rid the 
forest of brush and fallen trees that may cause more severe fires 
in the future and in fact cause less damage than many people 
might expect

the man known here as robert p clark was 
a quiet hardworking churchgoing man 
so neighbors were shocked when fbi agents came looking for him 
thursday saying he was john e list and was wanted for the 
slayings of his family nearly 18 years ago 
i dont know what a guy whos killed five people is supposed 
to look like but he was not that person said pat ferguson who 
lives two doors from the man she knew as clark in this richmond 
suburb 
the agents didnt find list at home but arrested him later at 
the richmond accounting firm where he worked 
he was charged with fleeing to avoid prosecution he faces five 
counts of firstdegree murder in new jersey for the 1971 shooting 
deaths of his mother wife and three children in westfield 
the fbi said list 63 was identified by his fingerprints he 
was ordered jailed pending a monday bond hearing 
the arrest which resulted from tips from viewers of the fox 
television program americas most wanted stunned neighbors and 
coworkers of the balding bespectacled accountant 
you talk about an average neighborhood this is it said 
ferguson who described clark as a good neighbor 
he worked hard in his yard went to work every day went to 
church every sunday the guy was so average ferguson said 
clark and his wife delores moved into the area last july from 
colorado neighbors said they had not yet gotten around to 
painting their name on the rustcolored mailbox in front of their 
small blue ranch house 
joseph and jacqueline stefano said the clarks were good 
hardworking people who did not like to talk about their past 
we thought they were normal people like us mrs stefano 
said 
the two families did odd jobs for each other and exchanged books 
and videotapes stefano said an american flag hanging in front of 
the stefanos house was a gift from clark he said 
clark often would call up and recommend a particular movie or 
television show stefano said one of his picks was americas 
most wanted but stefano missed the program the week list was 
featured 
the clarks had been married since 1983 mrs stefano said mrs 
clark had told her that clarks first wife had died and that he had 
no children from either marriage 
clark just seemed like a very very nice fellow said a 
woman who worked with him at the maddrea joyner kirkham amp woody 
accounting firm she said she would hold him up to my husband as 
a model because i heard him talk to his wife on the phone he would 
say how much he loved her 
another coworker said clark even had a fraternal order of 
police sticker on his car

prices on the tokyo stock exchange dropped sharply 
friday while the us dollar declined against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average closed at 3366742 falling 
31393 points or 092 percent 
the dollar finished trading at 14180 yen 072 yen below its 
finish on thursday it opened at 14212 yen and ranged between 
14132 and 14215 yen during the day 
a trader with mitsubishi bank in tokyo said the dollar fell as 
speculative investors sold it for profittaking 
japanese investors sold the dollar today more than we have 
expected but most of them are making position adjustments he 
added speaking on condition of anonymity 
the majority of market players avoided major moves ahead of the 
us jobless report the trader added the united states is to 
announce the nations unemployment rate for may later friday in 
washington 
on the stock exchange the index started to fall as investors 
waitandsee mood became stronger said nikko securities dealer 
yoshio shimoyama 
the nikkeis early gain was just a rebound effect from 
yesterdays plunge and the market today was lacking buying 
incentives he said 
market players avoided buying issues ahead of the release of the 
jobless report shimoyama said 
although the dollaryen rate which has been investors major 
concern has stabilized pretty much now they are more concerned 
about the jobless rate he said

candidates for governor shalt not take the 
lords name in vain on live television or theyll answer to their 
mothers 
jesus christ blurted out former state attorney general cary 
edwards frustrated at repeated interruptions from state sen 
gerald cardinale during a debate for the republican gubernatorial 
nomination 
that night edwards mother called to chide him about the 
outburst 
mom if you had to sit up there with those guys youd invoke 
the lords name too edwards said he told her 
edwards fellow candidates also have had their embarrassing 
moments and comic interludes 
us rep james courter told viewers of a gop debate two weeks 
ago of his seven or ninepoint plan to combat drugs within a 
minute he upped the ante to an 11point program leaving advisers 
shaking their heads 
assembly speaker chuck hardwick briefly turned the verbal 
warfare into a physical contest when he seized courters wrist 
preventing the obviously startled congressman from gesturing 
cardinale a dentist tried to show hes a man of his stripe in 
illustrating his opposition to abortion 
i believe as a scientist that this thing we call a fetus has 
the same genes and chromosomes as you and i have he said what 
distinquishes you and me from a zebra is those genes and 
chromosomes and you will never be a zebra as long as you have 
those genes and chromosomes and neither will i 
perhaps the most humbling exchange came offcamera when state 
sen william gormley asked his 12yearold son if he planned to 
watch one of the debates 
but dad pleaded the younger gormley its up against 
unsolved mysteries 
the candidates have fired carefully crafted oneliners aimed at 
grabbing air time and scoring hits on one another 
hardwick called edwards a general custer in the losing war 
on drugs 
edwards called hardwick a legislative santa claus who makes 
politically profitable promises to everyone but fails to say how he 
will pay for them 
any chicken can pass a bill without a funding source 
gormley chimed in 
courter said state lawmakers have created the auto insurance 
crisis so asking them to fix it is like someone with a stiff neck 
asking the boston strangler for a massage 
the rollicking republican exchanges have grown so heated that 
the raucous debate continued into commercial breaks during a taping 
last week 
and you thought republicans were boring gormley said 
the televised democratic exchanges have been much tamer but 
frequently featured assemblyman alan karcher and princeton mayor 
barbara sigmund ganging up on frontrunner james florio 
viewers may still be scratching their heads over us rep 
florios answer when asked whether he would agree to a third 
televised debate 
well i will make a determination as to what it is that im 
going to be able to do at any particular time to be able to 
communicate my message out there that leaves a situation wherein 
you have the opportunity to go talk to people and if you have that 
opportunity you should take it said florio who has been 
accused by his two opponents of dodging them on the campaign trail 
he said he would look forward to future forums but added i 
will give you an answer at the appropriate time as to was it is 
were doing at the time were conducting the debate 
his campaign the next day offered this translation i dont know 
florio later agreed to two more debates 
the democrats also have grabbed their share of catchy sound 
bites 
karcher charged florio you are the boss in south jersey and i 
think any one who would not believe that would have also to believe 
in the tooth fairy and the easter bunny 
florio asked to promise to refrain from negative campaigning 
said i dont start street fights but i dont walk away from 
them 
sigmund who contributed numerous flippant comments said of 
president reagans professed love of local governments while he cut 
state aid 
ive heard about love from sweettalking men for a long time 
and id rather have the money

the coast guard commandant said exxon is 
making progress in cleaning up its huge oil spill off the alaskan 
coast but the states top conservation official said a lot more 
work needs to be done 
im seeing a massive project that appears to be well run 
adm paul yost said thursday after touing prince william sound 
beaches 
the states commissioner for environmental conservation said 
exxon has increased its effort but is not through gearing up for 
the job 
we think theres a long way to go both inside and outside 
prince william sound dennis kelso said 
meanwhile a rule went into effect thursday requiring alcohol 
tests for skippers and other tanker crew members who might operate 
oilladen vessels through the sound shipping companies are to hire 
contractors who will administer the tests 
the requirement is part of an interim set of state rules 
established after the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 in 
the sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil its 
captain joseph hazelwood failed sobriety tests administered more 
than 10 hours after the accident the vessels third mate was 
operating the ship when it ran aground 
yost making his fourth visit to contaminated beaches as a 
chilly rain fell was accompanied by otto harrison exxons general 
manager in valdez and coast guard vice adm clyde robbins the 
federal onscene coordinator of the cleanup 
during a visit to homer on wednesday yost said the company 
almost certainly will miss its sept 15 deadline for oil cleanup 
robbins said exxon has been doing a good job logistically in the 
sound but perhaps should be prodded to do more on southcentral 
alaska beaches outside the sound 
exxon has the money and means to get the job done robbins said 
and that leads him farther away from the idea of federalizing 
the cleanup some critics of exxons performance contend the 
government should take over the project 
at smith island one of the most heavily oiled beaches and one 
that drew the most effort early in the cleanup rocks sand and 
gravel remained coated with oil thursday and an oily sheen washed 
off the shore 
exxon officials classified the beach as environmentally 
clean that means birds seals and otters are not picking up more 
oil from the beach harrison said 
he said crews have cleaned 20 miles of beach inside the sound 
and about 50 miles outside state officials said more than 700 
miles were contaminated exxon has said it will be able to clean 
just over 350 miles 
yost was confronted by residents wednesday when he visited some 
coastal communities of southcentral alaska people were angry that 
he called exxons logistical work good he said 
after a meeting with state and exxon officials later thursday 
yost said that more work needs to be done but he is impressed by 
the technology being used in the cleanup 
its a disaster that doesnt lend itself to restoration very 
quickly or very easily and there will not be a complete 
restoration this summer either in prince william sound or probably 
outside of prince william sound yost said

actor dustin hoffman received mixed reviews today 
after his british stage debut as shylock in shakespeares play 
the merchant of venice 
while the production won cheers thursday night from a 
celebritystudded firstnight audience at londons phoenix theater 
critic irving wardle wrote in the times of london today 
all the clamorous hype and slavering expectation is a poor 
preparation for the modest shylock who arrived on the phoenix stage 
last night hoffmans is much the most genial shylock that i 
have seen 
what does not come off are the directly emotional climaxes 
which strain his voice to the limit and substitute rhetoric for 
his particular and priceless capacity for expressing the secrets of 
a mans mind through lowkey unguarded utterance 
michael billington said in the guardian although mr 
hoffmans humorous approach pays handsome dividends it also 
means a loss of the tragic dimension what it lacks is any 
strong sense of the characters inveterate malignity 
jack tinker wrote in the london tabloid the daily mail 
without being great he is most certainly good 
lester middlehurst writing in today another tabloid said 
hoffmans shylock is fascinating 
the production was by sir peter hall who directed the national 
theater in london from 1973 until last year 
hoffman agreed to the part of shylock but said after studying 
the play that he found it very antisemitic critics agreed today 
however that hoffmans portrayal had reversed this traditional 
view 
the manifest aim is to show him shylock as a good man 
driven beyond endurance by his bestial treatment from the 
christians wardle wrote 
the actor who won the oscar this year as best actor for his 
performance in rain man is said to receive 6 million dollars 
for each film but the british domestic agency press association 
said hoffman is getting paid 3140 a week for three months in the 
play 
the firstnight audience included dame peggy ashcroft joan 
collins and exbeatle paul mccartney

actor paul newman has beaten a 41000 tax 
bite on income from the sting 
newman won the tax dispute when the california supreme court 
rejected the states claim for a greater portion of newmans income 
from the movie 
in unanimously denying a hearing sought by the state franchise 
tax board the justices on thursday let stand a lowercourt ruling 
that counted the time an actor spent on call as work time for 
apportioning income 
a nonresident such as newman who performs personal services in 
california for part of a year is taxed according to the portion of 
the total working days spent in the state if onethird of the 
working days are spent in california for example onethird of the 
income from the project is taxable by the state 
newmans case involved a dispute over the definition of working 
days in filming the sting which won an academy award for best 
picture newman spent 30 days in california in 1973 25 of them 
filming and five on call and 24 days outside california only 
two of them filming 
in their tax returns newman and his wife joanne woodward 
described 54 days as working days and apportioned 30 or 555 
percent to california but the tax board said only the 27 days of 
actual filming should count as working days and 25 of them or 
926 percent were attributed to california 
justice jack goertzen said in the decision that newman was 
required to report for work by his studio at any time during the 
period he was on call and could not take any conflicting jobs 
newmans press agent warren cowan did not answer telephone calls 
for comment on thursday 
deputy attorney general richard nielsen who represented the tax 
board said the ruling could work against actors 
every actor that spends his time in california not doing 
anything if hes under contract to somebody else in another state 
california could pick up his income nielsen said whether the 
board will pursue something like that i dont know

expensive stateoftheart weapons such as 
the f16 jet fighter or the m1 battle tank would be redistributed 
rather than destroyed if an agreement on arms reduction in central 
europe is reached with the soviet union bush administration 
officials say 
addressing concerns expressed thursday by members of the senate 
armed services committee the officials said the cuts proposed by 
bush in nato and warsaw pact forces can be accomplished by 
destroying older weapons 
we have enough of the older weapons that can be destroyed 
without destroying newer weapons said air force gen robert t 
herres vice chairman of the military joint chiefs of staff 
sen alan dixon dill declared it doesnt make sense to 
destroy 20 million f16 fighters at a time when our reserve and 
guard units are still flying 1960s vintage f4 fighters 
but herres said that will not be allowed to happen 
we propose to redistribute new equipment such as f16s and 
m1 tanks he said we have no intention of destroying them 
our obvious target will be older equipment 
he also said there is nothing in the bush proposal to prevent 
nato or the soviets from modernizing the military forces that 
remain after reductions 
meanwhile defense secretary richard cheney said in an interview 
published in the washington post today that the united states might 
wind up stressing lighter equipment for land forces to ease rapid 
deployment if bushs proposals for armed forces reductions in 
europe are accepted 
cheney said the proposed ceiling of 275000 troops for both the 
united states and the soviet union in europe might raise other 
questions such as whether ships would be better than aircraft for 
reinforcement from the united states in war 
though the proposal makes military sense cheney said he was 
worried that congress would try to double or triple the presidents 
proposed reduction of 30000 us troops maybe eventually we can 
talk about those numbers but not now he said in the post 
interview 
herres and under secretary of defense paul wolfowitz commented 
as a broad bipartisan cross section of the committee praised the 
bush proposal as a potentially historic breakthrough that could 
sharply reduce the prospects for war in europe 
chairman sam nunn dga hailed the bush proposal as taking 
an innovative approach and said it will reduce the dangers of 
war in europe while posing the possibility of creating future 
savings that could eventually help the united states deal with the 
budget deficit 
the bush proposal calls for 
reductions in tanks armored troop carriers and artillery in 
the area from the atlantic to the ural mountains that will require 
far deeper cuts by the soviet union and its allies than by the 
united states and nato 
reductions of 15 percent below current levels of helicopters 
and landbased combat planes in the atlantic to the urals zone 
a ceiling of 275000 on us and soviet ground and air force 
personnel in the zone a ceiling which would require a reduction of 
some 325000 soviet troops to achieve 
speeding up the pace of negotiations and the implementation of 
an agreement to accomplish the reductions by 1992 or 1993 about 
four or five years sooner than the time table suggested by the 
soviets 
herres and wolfowitz said the plan does not set a rigid 
timetable which might trap the united states into accepting a bad 
agreement contrary to us security interests 
and wolfowitz said it will require verification procedures far 
more intrusive than any so far put into effect for any other arms 
control arrangement 
several committee members declared and the administration 
witnesses agreed that no attempt should be made to cut defense

weve got to be very careful of not getting out in front of

sousuke uno became japans prime minister friday 
and pledged political reforms to clear the air of a scandal that 
has decimated the top ranks of the longgoverning liberal 
democratic party 
the 66yearold former foreign minister also sounded a tough 
note about trade problems with the united states saying 
washingtons use of its new trade law to force concessions from 
japan was like negotiating with your fists up 
the conservative party was to get a new leadership roster and a 
new cabinet was to be installed in an effort to wipe the slate 
clean of the recruit influencebuying scandal before a national 
election for half the upper house of parliament expected within 
two months 
the scandal erupted a year ago ruined many careers and forced 
prime minister noboru takeshita 65 to resign and take 
responsibility for a widespread loss of trust in politics 
the two houses of the diet japans parliament met separately 
friday afternoon and elected uno prime minister on the strength of 
the liberal democrats large majorities 
in the house of representatives uno got 285 of 477 votes with 
japan socialist party chairwoman takako doi receiving 139 eiichi 
nagasue of the democratic socialist party 26 and kenji miyamoto of 
the communist party 25 two votes were ruled invalid 
the upper house of councillors gave uno 124 of 220 votes with 
ms doi capturing 65 miyamoto 17 and nagasue 9 five ballots were 
blank officials announced 
the recruit scandal had a great impact and i understand what 
it means to be chosen as prime minister in such a situation uno 
said i would like to promise to carry forward political reforms 
with all my loyalty and strength 
many within the party objected to uno because he is a senior 
member of the faction of former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
the scandal involving bribes and cutrate sales of stock in a 
subsidiary of the recruit co information conglomerate developed 
during nakasones 198287 administration 
but in his acceptance speech uno said he was resigning from the 
nakasone faction taking one of the steps recommended by a party 
panel on reform 
factional rivalry within the party is regarded as one reason why 
large amounts of money are needed in japanese politics because 
factional leaders must help finance their followers political 
activities 
nakasone resigned from the party because of the recruit scandal 
but he retained his seat in parliament and analysts expect him to 
retain his influence 
takeshita announced april 25 that he would resign but the 
search for a replacement took more than a month because of the 
recruit scandal which reached the top levels of politics business 
and the bureaucracy uno agreed on wednesday to take the job 
although uno was endorsed by takeshita and the partys power 
brokers a rebel candidate 68yearold lawmaker ganri yamashita 
was put forward thursday by young party hawks who favor more 
military spending yamashita is a former defense agency chief who 
had tried to put forward an alternate candidate when the party 
chose takeshita as its leader in october 1987 
there was no official count at fridays meeting attended by 341 
of the partys 436 diet members instead those present stood in 
response to a call for support of uno 
yamashitas supporters complained of a lack of democracy and 
demanded a ballot but the leadership said the conference was 
called only to endorse the decision made behind closed doors by the 
partys executive council 
the majority of the party wants to find a candidate 
peacefully said ryutaro hashimoto the party deputy secretary 
general and we took it into consideration that it has to be 
someone who has currency in international society japan must make 
contributions in international society and we have decided to 
recommend sousuke uno 
the new prime minister will have a major task in convincing the 
japanese public that the liberal democrats will retool the 
political style that let politicians and aides accept huge taxfree 
profits through the purchase of prelisted shares in 1986 in the 
recruit subsidiary 
three cabinet members resigned in connection with the recruit 
scandal and 14 people including two former vice ministers were 
arrested on suspicion of bribery or securities exchange law 
violations 
takeshita apologized friday for his role in the scandal which 
has stained the top ranks of politics business and the bureaucracy 
considering the burning anger among the japanese people and 
also some facts around me in relation to the stock scandal i 
thought it is most appropriate for me to resign if it would help to 
pursue policital reforms he said in a short somber speech 
i would also like to apologize to the public for all the 
troubles due to my lack of discretion he said 
many of the liberal democrats top leaders were ineligible to 
succeed takeshita because they are tainted by the recruit scandal 
party power brokers finally turned to uno after elder statesman 
masayoshi ito repeatedly refused the job

it was like plowing through a whodunit that took 
five years to read and finding out there was no last page 
a 500000 treasure hunt that drew lovers of mystery and money 
ended last week with no payoff and no solution 
no one has been able to decipher the code that leads to a 
fortune promised in the story titled treasure in search of the 
golden horse the yarn was released in 1984 as a book videotape 
and laser disc 
the book and film project was developed on the heels of such 
best sellers as masquerade which offered prizes to readers who 
solved the mystery 
readers and viewers of treasure had until midnight may 26 to 
figure out the clues go to the site and dig up the treasure a 
small statue of a horse made with a kilogram of pure gold inside 
the statue is a key to a safe deposit box containing an annuity 
that will pay 25000 a year for 20 years 
according to the book the trove is hidden in a public place 
accessible roundtheclock somewhere in the united states 
because nobody has found it thats that declared thomas 
conlon one of three people who knows the solution 
conlon president of dl blair a sales promotion company that 
conducts contests for large corporations acknowledged thursday 
that his offices have been besieged by callers who had tried for 
years to figure out where the golden horse was stashed but he said 
there was no promise no suggestion in the sponsors 
advertising or in the products that the sponsor produced that said 
nonwinners would ever get the solution the only thing we can do 
is follow the rules exactly to the letter 
in most national contests names of winners are announced but 
not their submissions according to professionals in the field 
with treasure the rules said the prize if unfound goes to 
a charity and all the public is entitled to know is which charity 
the charity is big brothers and big sisters of america 
david davison assistant executive director of the 
philadelphiabased youth service organization said an official of 
the charity would dig up the golden horse this summer 
besides physically unearthing the horse the charity official 
must agree never to reveal where it had been buried conlon said 
the other people who know the secret are sheldon renan a los 
angelesbased writer who developed the project and wrote the story 
of the treasure hunt and paul hoffman who constructed the codes 
and clues hoffman is a magazine editor in new york and writes a 
brainteaser column under the name dr crypton 
renan said he is bound by the rules against disclosure hoffman 
did not return calls for comment 
intravision the company formed to promote treasure does 
not know the solution of the codes and clues its new head todd 
demann said he wished conlon would reveal it 
weve been getting tons of grief about it said demann 
ive been speaking to treasure hunters for two years im 
frustrated and disappointed that nobody found it im also 
disappointed that were not going to get the location i think 
thats very unfair 
demann said he had no figures on how many people bought tapes of 
treasure which in addition to selling at 5995 a copy was 
shown on cable television 
warner books producer of the print version ran off 147000 
copies to sell at 1295 
the codes and clues are contained within a story about a girls 
search for the stolen statue of a horse that her father made for 
her 
one disappointed amateur sleuth joann smith of northridge 
calif said she has been trying to find the treasure for five 
years 
my son who was in eighth grade got me involved mrs smith 
said hes graduating from high school next week its been a 
long time and i would just like to know the solution

a hospital in parkers prairie has tacked up 
posters resembling old west wanted signs around the state offering 
a 5000 reward to anyone who can round up a family practitioner 
half the 5000 bounty will be paid when a doctor signs a 
contract the rest will be paid when the doctor completes a year of 
work 
these are drastic times for hospitals and i feel i have to 
take drastic measures said administrator james talley who is 
searching for a second family practitioner for the 21bed hospital 
in the town of about 1000 people 175 miles northwest of 
minneapolis 
if he finds me two physicians i could double that talley 
said 
even 10000 is cheap when you consider going through a 
professional placement agency theyll charge you 30000 to 
40000 easy he said 
talley hasnt heard from any doctors since posting the reward 
offers a week ago at hospitals banks and stores in the twin cities 
and elsewhere in central minnesota hes also arranged to have the 
midwest telephone co mail posters to 4000 customers with their 
monthly bills 
its got a picture of a doctor examining a patient above that 
it says reward just like a wanted poster that you saw years ago 
with the cowboys said talley who ripped the poster edges like 
theyre burnt around the sides to give them an old west look 
rural minnesota is faced by a general shortage of doctors 
created by the fact that country doctors are on call more often 
more physicians are becoming specialists and there are fewer 
medical school graduates said talley secretary of the rural 
health alliance an organization of eight country hospitals 
parkers prairie district hospital had three family practitioners 
until recently talley said after 14 years the first doctor left 
in 1987 to work in a larger clinic the second moved to a bigger 
town after serving in a rural area for five years to have his 
student loan forgiven 
the remaining family practitioner has been at parkers prairie 
more than 20 years and has a couple of hobby farms in the area 
talley said 
his ties to the community are quite strong if i could find 
some other doctor like that it would be a great thing its 
beautiful country he said 
on the back side the wanted posters emphasize the areas many 
lakes water sports and location within 10 miles of two state parks 
while three family practitioners would have to be on call more 
often than urban doctors every third day compared with every 
eighth or 10th day the hospital would guarantee them twin cities 
wages talley said starting pay would be 50000 to 75000 
annually and the hospital is offering a rented home at 250 a 
month for the first year

for a soviet system that has stressed order and 
control above all else the inaugural meeting of its new congress 
has been a lesson in the untidiness of democracy and the people 
love it 
in a week of nationally broadcast sessions that have captivated 
soviets the 2250 members of the congress of peoples deputies 
have been learning by trial and error that basic rules of procedure 
and basic tools such as microphones can be as important as 
debate itself 
we were the first country in the world to send a man to space 
and our president is counting the votes in the hall with his 
fingers complained one deputy moldavian writer ion drutse 
gone are the strict order and decorum that marked previous 
incarnations of the soviet parliament over 70 years of communist 
rule however dull those sessions were the agenda was clear and 
the speakers had a clear purpose to sop up to the leadership 
some deputies are impatient with the new disorder and one said 
monday the session was marred by a lot of messing around about 
procedural matters such as how long speakers should be given the 
floor 
another said that with the peoples hopes raised the meeting 
would begin to solve some of the countrys most pressing problems 
it had become a congress of unused opportunities the deputy 
oleg v chernyshev said some deputies had suffered intoxication 
with the air within the kremlin walls 
not even the length of the session is known it was originally 
scheduled to end wednesday but could last at least a week longer 
more than 500 deputies have signed up to speak and the list 
keeps growing so far only about half have taken the floor 
the agenda of the congress also was never clearly spelled out 
in the first four days the deputies elected a president mikhail 
s gorbachev heard his report on the state of the union chose a 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov and a smaller lawmaking body 
but aside from a speech expected by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
the remaining agenda is unclear so the debate has wandered from 
the sad state of soviet libraries to sharp criticism of members of 
the ruling politburo including gorbachev 
at times deputies pop up from their seats to shout at speakers 
or presiding officers some demand to speak from the stage others 
prefer just to stand and shout only a couple of microphones were 
set up on the huge floor for deputies to raise points of order 
they were installed late and are only used ocassionally 
why did we put up microphones to decorate the room deputy 
alexei yastrebov asked sarcastically 
some presiding officers have lost their tempers 
you sit down the chairman of thursdays session ukrainian 
boris y paton shouted to one deputy who walked onto the stage 
uninvited 
gorbachev intervened on several occasions to calm the hall 
long delays and confusion have marred voting and several 
deputies have complained their legislative proposals were not being 
distributed to the congress 
electronic voting equipment was never needed for previous 
incarnations of the soviet parliament because votes were almost 
always unanimous but substantial opposition has surfaced in the 
new congress 
drutse in a speech thursday charged that party leaders 
intentionally did not have voting equipment installed 
this has happened because the apparatus wants to control the 
voting he declared 
lukyanov was also criticized for not having prepared rules of 
procedure for the congress in advance he said this was not done 
because presiding officers thought it more democratic if the 
deputies themselves set procedure 
but even when procedures are set they are often violated after 
much wrangling intitially the congress decided to allow each 
speaker 15 minutes 
gorbachev complained on wednesday no sooner had this rule 
been set than it was broken

parents accused of forcing their baby 
to drink acid seemed like average people but apparently had 
devised a scheme to collect money in a bogus product tampering 
case an investigator said 
ive never seen a case that is as heinous or violent its 
beyond imagination said detective johnie phelps jr 
shelia smith 26 and ricky irby sr 27 have been charged with 
murder in the death of quinten irby who was 3 months old in 1984 
when he was taken to a hospital with acid burns in his mouth and 
throat 
associate judge harry hartel thursday ordered the parents held 
in lieu of 1 million bond each they are to be arraigned 
wedenesday 
phelps a 14year veteran of the north chicago police 
department investigated the case and knew smith and irby casually 
because they lived in the same neighborhood as phelps father 
they were just two average people well known in the 
neighborhood with good reputations said phelps ricky always 
seemed to be a nice guy real personable 
neither had been in trouble with the law he said until a lake 
county grand jury indicted them on murder charges wednesday 
the parents said quinten had ingested tainted baby formula and 
he lingered near death for more than two years unable to eat 
drink speak or breathe on his own 
the baby died aug 26 1986 
irby filed a lawsuit in august 1987 charging negligence against 
the baby formula maker abbott laboratories of north chicago and 
the grocery store where he said the formula was bought 
irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago 
phelps said money probably was the motive for the poisoning 
both parents were unemployed they never married and lived in 
separate homes a few blocks apart in a neat bluecollar 
neighborhood in this community of 47000 on lake michigan 
ms smith lived with her mother and the couples 8yearold son 
ricky jr irby lived with his parents 
after quinten was taken to the hospital may 31 1984 tests 
revealed that an open can of baby formula contained a large amount 
of acid while an unopened can was uncontaminated said irby 
prosecutors filed a petition alleging that quinten was an abused 
child said assistant states attorney matthew chancey but backed 
off when much of the evidence cans of formula a baby bottle and 
nipple were lost by the illinois department of public health 
a break came last november when the us supreme court ruled in 
an arizona case that evidence lost accidently does not bar 
prosecution

market players were adjusting their positions before the us 
announces its jobless rate said a foreign exchange dealer at the 
bank of tokyo on condition of anonymity 
the united states is to announce the nations unemployment rate 
for may later today in washington 
a strong trend toward buying swiss francs that began earlier 
this week also is pulling buyers away from the yen the dealer said 
the swiss national bank has said it will introduce a floating 
rate system which investors see as favorable to the swiss currency 
the dealer said the yen will remain weak until the confusion 
plaguing japanese politics settles down 
a major bribery scandal which resulted in the resignation of 
noboru takeshita as prime minister has created an air of political 
uncertainty for months 
the dealer said he did not expect todays official selection of 
former foreign minister sousuke uno as japans new prime minister 
to have much effect on the market 
however uncertainty about uno and how he will deal with the 
scandal was keeping some buyers away from the yen 
people do not know uno abroad the dealer said 
in the stock market political concerns also discouraged 
investors said noboru ohsuga chief portfolio manager for daiwa 
investment trust and management co 
in a gradual retreat the market has closed lower in five of the 
last six trading days due to profittaking and a shift by investors 
away from domestic demandrelated issues and toward hightech

a student whose extraordinary memory has 
enabled him to memorize 35000 digits of an equation and pick up 
a few bar bets along the way is the subject of a 157000 federal 
study a newspaper reported today 
srinivasan mahadevan a graduate student from india at kansas 
state university in manhattan is trying to become the fourth 
person to remember the first 100000 digits to pi the 
theoretically infinite computation that measures the ratio of the 
circumference of a circle to its diameter he has already memorized 
the first 35000 digits of pi 
only three cases of such ability to remember have been 
documented in 200 years one of those people became insane when he 
became unable to forget anything and his reasoning processes 
drowned in a flood of facts 
to find out what makes mahadevan tick the federal government 
has awarded a 157000 grant to kansas state the wichita 
eaglebeacon reported 
the answer may shed light on how other people remember things 
were hoping to find insights into the average intelligence 
too said rod vogl a graduate assistant in charge of 
administering tests 
four students with average memories also are being studied as a 
control group and so far they havent fared well against 
mahadevan a test involves flashing one number on a screen per 
second or speaking one number per second and seeing how many 
the students can remember the average score is seven or eight and 
anything above 10 is considered exceptional mahadevan typically 
tallies about 38 if he sees the numbers about 50 if hears them 
of course thats under clinical conditions vogl says mahadevan 
usually scores much better as many as 105 in the friendlier 
atmosphere of the manhattan watering holes where he has been known 
to win some astounding bar bets 
the 30yearold native of mangalore india thinks heredity and 
his childhood environment both played significant roles 
it runs in the family he said my father knows all 37 
plays and 150 sonnets of william shakespeare by heart so i think 
there is a genetic basis for it

a simulated nuclear blast 
destroyed scaleddown versions of bridges homes and a forest in a 
test to show what happens to military and civilian equipment during 
and after a large explosion 
the pine trees model bridges and and structures were among 
hundreds of items placed at various distances from ground zero 
where 2440 tons of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil were detonated 
thursday 
it will take months for scientists to evaluate the results said 
navy cmdr jr lund of the defense nuclear agencys test 
directorate 
the agency sponsored the test called misers gold and designed 
to determine the effects of air blast and ground shock on such 
things as bunkers underground shelters and radar it was the fifth 
in a series of nonnuclear explosions the agency has set off since 
1976 
seven of about 180 test trees remained after the explosion the 
walls of the buildings facing the blast site looked as though a 
giant fist had torn through them 
one of two small model bridges collapsed the other was severely 
damaged 
no one is going to be driving over that bridge lund told 
reporters during a drive through the 120acre test bed about two 
hours after the blast 
some of the military equipment used in the blast included a 
helicopter tanks parts of navy ships and some foreign vehicles 
the equipment including three soviet military vehicles was 
covered immediately after the blast to hide the damage 
lund said it would be possible for other countries to fly 
overhead and photograph the damage 
we dont want other people to know how much damage it caused 
to our equipment or theirs he said 
thursdays blast had a simulated equivalent of a 4kiloton 
nuclear bomb the bomb dropped on hiroshima japan had a force of 
13 kilotons 
lt col david barber who helped design the test bed said the 
fallout from the explosion sounded like rain on the tin roof of the 
george mcdonald ranch house barber watched the explosion from the 
house two miles from ground zero 
it knocked one guys hat off in the house said barber 
his own hat speckled with dust pellets from the fallout 
lund said the cost of the experiment was 76 million to 78 
million

three michigan trade schools may not 
survive a federal report listing them as having the nations worst 
studentloan default rates according to school officials 
this could put us out of business said joseph belliotti 
jr vice president of the saywer school of business in this 
middleincome detroit suburb he said a us education department 
report stating that 938 percent of sawyer students who were due to 
start repaying loans in 1986 failed to do so was inaccurate 
officials at other trade schools with high percentages of 
delinquent borrowers said federal penalties could discourage 
schools from serving lowincome students 
were the schools of last resort these people have been shut 
out of the entire school system said ted jakub president of the 
cambridge business college of detroit which had a loandefault 
rate of 86 percent they cant go to the community colleges the 
only place theyve got to go is a school that will show interest in 
them 
education secretary lauro cavazos announced thursday that 
schools with extremely high percentages of delinquent borrowers 
will face an escalating series of corrective and punitive actions 
under the new federal guidelines schools with default rates 
above 60 percent could be barred from the governments student loan 
program starting jan 1 1991 and schools with 40 percent to 60 
percent of their students failing to pay back loans must reduce the 
figure by 5 percent a year or face the same penalties 
the four schools with the highest default rates were from 
michigan 
officials at sawyer expressed shock at having the nations 
highest student loandefault rate since the federal figure was 
more than twice the rate reported by the state of michigan which 
administers the schools guaranteed loan program 
based on loans from 1975 through april 30 sawyers cumulative 
default rate was 3839 percent according to george lamb 
supervisor of claims and collections for the michigan school loan 
guarantee program 
nobody from the state wants to talk to the feds and no one 
from the feds wants to talk to the state said sawyer 
administrator mike shiner who questioned how the federal figure 
was calculated 
the school trains about 300 students in office skills a 
sixmonth secretarial course costs 3900 
officials at other trade schools with high default rates said 
the income levels of the students they serve should be taken into 
consideration 
we have quite a few lowincome less advantaged students 
through here said jessica murray coowner of the kalamazoo 
beauty academy in kalamazoo which had the secondhighest default 
rate nationally 895 percent i think that always should put 
some credence into the fact that our default rate is going to be 
higher 
she added we have no recourse to collect loans nor to 
enforce payment i think weve become a little bit of a scapegoat 
at the cambridge business college of detroit we deal strictly 
with the innercity minorities jakub said 
some of our students go to work after graduation some do not 
go to work because of the welfare system he said they find 
the welfare benefits equal to what they earn out there 
federal sanctions could force the cambridge school which has 
about 200 students out of business jakub said 
the fourth michigan school on the federal list the 
paynepulliam school of trade in detroit had a default rate of 
855 percent

dustin hoffman heard cheers for his british stage 
debut as shylock in shakespeares the merchant of venice 
but while he won approval from the openingnight audience in 
londons phoenix theater the critics today gave him mixed reviews 
in side curls and skullcap hoffman gave shylock humor a 
passion for revenge and a tortured dignity when he loses all it 
was a far cry from raymond babbitt the autistic savant he plays in 
his current hit film rain man wrote reg evans of the british 
domestic news agency press association 
in the times of london irving wardle was less enthusiastic he 
wrote all the clamorous hype and slavering expectation is a poor 
preparation for the modest shylock who arrived on the phoenix stage 
last night 
lester middlehurst in the tabloid today found hoffmans 
shylock fascinating 
the production by sir peter hall also starred british actress 
geraldine james as portia 
when hoffman heard that hall was forming his own company he 
asked for a role they decided on shylock a part hall said at the 
time was for a great jewish actor who can use his jewishness in 
the play 
hoffman 51 won an oscar early this year for his role in rain 
man he also has starred in the graduate midnight cowboy

five recruit executives including its founder and former 
chairman hiromasa ezoe have been arrested on charges of bribery 
and securities law violations 
ezoe 52 started an employment information magazine in 1962 
eventually branched out into real estate and finance and built a 
large conglomerate considered one of japans most innovative in the 
fastgrowing services sector 
in japan where companies compete fiercely to attract topgrade 
employees and where job mobility is increasing specialized 
employment information is big business shiny highrises with large 
recruit logos dot tokyos expensive business districts and a 
variety of recruit magazines can be found on almost any newsstand 
in order to influence legislation and get other favors 
prosecutors say ezoe sold millions of dollars worth of stock in 
the recruitcosmos real estate company at bargain prices to 13 
legislators from japans ruling liberal democratic party four 
opposition lawmakers and about 140 influential businessmen and 
government officials purchasers of the stock reaped large profits

house majority whip tony coelho returned 
to his home district insisting nothing is hanging over him besides 
his already revealed purchase of 100000 in junk bonds that led to 
his resignation 
some say this is not the type of mistake to do what you are 
doing coelho told reporters late thursday on his first visit to 
the district since his startling resignation announcement 
there is no other issue involved he said its just that 
i set a high standard i made a mistake im willing to live with 
it and its time to move on 
pressed again about whether any other undisclosed financial 
dealings could prove embarrassing he responded 
i just answered that and dont care to answer it again 
he said he decided to quit congress for fear he would be 
ineffective because questions about his financial deals would 
overshadow his work 
i felt for the next two years i would be answering no 
questions except my personal finances and my ability to represent 
would not be there coelho said everybody is replaceable 
myself included 
coelhos announcement last week that he will resign from 
congress on june 15 his 47th birthday surprised many observers 
who felt he had not been that severely damaged from disclosures 
about his investment in a 100000 junk bond for which he put up no 
money of his own 
still coelho said he didnt want to put his family or the 
democratic party through a protracted controversy over his finances 
during thursdays news conference coelho said if you are a 
harddriving partisan politician and you like to make a 
difference if you make a mistake as i admitted i did it is 
difficult to do what you want done 
he contended that his junk bond purchase was legal and news 
reports that he is subject to a criminal investigation for owing 
back taxes are false 
even though allegations are untrue you cant take them back 
once they are printed coelho said 
with his wife phyllis and two teenage daughters at his side 
coelho said he wears a mickey mouse watch to remind myself never 
to take myself personally that seriously during the last 10 years 
i always thought personal power was not that important power is 
important to get things done 
coelho whose youthful hope of becoming a priest was stopped 
when he learned he had epilepsy said he has no regrets about 
leaving congress 
i have tremendous inner peace he said

failure to take medication is the leading cause 
of organ rejection among kidney transplant patients three months 
beyond surgery a study shows and thats a particularly bitter 
pill for doctors 
its obviously very important in transplanting because the 
consequences can be fatal and its wasted money and effort said 
dr robert schweizer professor of surgery at the university of 
connecticut 
noncompliance appears to be highest among patients younger than 
20 blacks hispanics and lowincome individuals regardless of 
race said schweizer who conducted the study 
any transplant surgeon with 20 years experience has cases 
that break your heart said dr paul peters chairman of surgery 
at the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas 
schweizer said in a report being presented today before the 
american society of transplant surgeons that failure to take 
medication was noted among 47 of 260 patients or 18 percent who 
received kidneys at hartford hospital from 1971 to 1984 
patients who suffered organ rejection or died within three 
months of surgery were excluded from the study 
an average of four years passed before the errant patients 
stopped taking their medication and exhibited organ rejection 
schweizer said transplant patients must take drugs every day of 
their lives to keep their bodies natural immune sytem from 
rejecting the organ 
a subsequent study conducted from 1984 to 1987 found 30 of 196 
kidney recipients or 15 percent failed to take their medication 
schweizer said an average of two years passed before organ 
rejection was noted 
eightytwo kidney recipients were evaluated from 1987 to 1988 
following staff efforts to boost compliance only two refused to 
take their medication or 24 percent schweizer said 
liver and heart recipients were included in the third study 
three of the 13 liver patients were repeatedly noncompliant 
two of whom died schweizer said three of the 50 heart recipients 
did not take their medication one of whom died the other two 
showed evidence of rejection 
reasons for not taking medication included psychiatric 
disorders alcoholism concern over appearances and a feeling of 
invincibility schweizer said the ability to buy the medication 
was irrelevant since the government covers the cost 
rehabilitation following an organ transplant is so spectacular 
that patients feel so well it is difficult for them to understand 
why they have to keep taking medicine he said 
just telling them doesnt necessarily get the message 
across said dr j wesley alexander president of the american 
society of transplant surgeons sometimes it takes a fairly 
dramatic event like the loss of a kidney and going back on 
dialysis 
when that happens at the university of cincinnati where 
alexander works patients are told they must wait a year or so 
before returning to the transplant waiting list 
it seems unfair to other patients to let somebody have a 
transplant if theyre not going to follow the rules and take their 
medication he said it denies somebody else 
as of monday 14993 people were awaiting kidney transplants in 
the united states according to the united network for organ 
sharing

the food riots have subsided but 
argentinas currency continues sliding in blackmarket trading an 
indication the economic crisis that prompted looting in the major 
cities is worsening 
on thursday police arrested six leaders of the small leftist 
workers party on orders from a federal judge who accused the party 
of spurring riots in argentinas four largest cities 
fourteen people died 80 were arrested and more than 2000 
arrested 
looters many of them women and children have been sacking 
stores and eating food on the spot in the nationwide unrest despite 
a state of siege the government declared on monday 
provincial officials across argentina set up soup kitchens 
froze supermarket prices for basic foods and medicine and 
coordinated charity collections of food and clothing 
the austral argentinas currency continued its free fall 
against the dollar sliding in blackmarket trading to 2301 or 24 
percent less than the rate of 1751 set two days ago by the central 
bank foreign exchange houses refused to sell dollars at the 
official price 
the devaluation of the austral 70 percent monthly inflation and 
unemployment has pushed prices of basic commodities beyond the 
means of many in this beef and grainexporting nation a budget 
deficit and a 59 billion foreign debt have also been cited as 
causes for the rioting 
government employees in several provinces threatened to strike 
for higher pay bakers in buenos aires refused to sell bread at the 
official price and stores continued to mark up products 
the government of president raul alfonsin admitted after 
lootings began that poverty had widened during the economic crisis 
of the past several months but authorities claim slum dwellers 
were encouraged to rise up by agitators who also attacked police 
the workers party candidate for president in may 14 elections 
jorge altamira said his party did not encourage the looting and 
such allegations by the government amount to ideological 
persecution 
we were in favor of better salaries food returning suspended 
and fired workers to their jobs and a general strike 
altamira saud 
arrested with altamira were five other party leaders including 
the partys vice presidential candidate gregorio flores in the 
elections won by carlos menem and the peronist party formal 
charges were not immediately disclosed 
federal judge gerardo larrambebere of the buenos aires suburb of 
moron ordered the arrest of the workers party leaders and the 
search and closure of their offices in the metropolitan area 
larrambebere said his order was based on prima facie evidence 
showing that party activists encouraged in large measure rioting 
in towns under his jurisdiction including san miguel where four 
people were killed and moreno where three others died 
in the capital and the northern city of rosario 14 people died 
since monday the interior ministry said thursday evening in its 
first official tally preliminary reports from police and hospitals 
had put the death toll at 16 
before they subsided alfonsin had declared a state of siege 
several thousand paramilitary police were sent to rosario bombs 
exploded in buenos aires and a supermarket in the western city of 
mendoza was set ablaze by a firebomb 
former president arturo frondizi publicly urged alfonsin to 
resign immediately and hand power over to presidentelect 
menem who is due to take office on dec 10 
the concern of the immense majority of the argentine people is 
that menem assumes his functions with every possibility of 
success and six more months of alfonsins unfortunate 
administration stand in the way of that frondizi said

engineered drug that can help reduce anemia in patients suffering 
from kidney failure and may also benefit cancer and aids patients 
the drug approved by the food and drug administration thursday 
is a copy of a natural human protein erythropoietin which 
stimulates the body to produce red blood cells 
lack of those cells which carry energygiving oxygen around the 
body is known as anemia and since the kidneys produce 
erythropoietin patients with kidney failure often develop anemia 
food and drug commissioner frank young said that in addition to 
about 95000 kidney patients who should benefit from the new drug

opec ministers gathered today to discuss 
whether they should increase oil production in the face of surging 
prices that have pushed the cost of a barrel of oil 40 percent 
higher since november 
theyre keen to keep revenues up said fergus macleod an 
analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london the underlying mood 
is dont rock the boat 
the ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries were kicking off their talks at an afternoon 
meeting of an eightmember committee 
their formal strategy sessions will begin monday when they open 
their midyear ministerial meeting at opec headquarters in vienna 
the ministers task is to set pricing and production levels for 
the final half of the year 
analysts predicted tough bargaining during the discussions 
they will come to an agreement in the end said pierre 
terzian editor of the parisbased oil publication 
petrostrategies but it will be rather difficult 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer confirmed reports 
that he intended to suggest scrapping the cartels benchmark price 
of 18 a barrel he declined to elaborate 
the saudis were earlier reported to have wanted to revive a 
plan unveiled briefly late last year for setting a minimum price 
of 15 a barrel 
the production accord that runs from january to june has set an 
output ceiling of 185 million barrels a day for the producer 
nations its price target is 18 a barrel 
the agreement was worked out in november in an effort to curb 
opecs overproduction and lift crude prices 
prices have surged this year a gain attributed not only to the 
cartels output cuts but also to accidents in oilproducing areas 
the supply of oil has been reduced to the world market although 
analysts have reported a pickup in opec output in recent weeks 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
has soared from 1234 a barrel in november to 1767 a barrel last 
week it ran up above the cartels benchmark earlier in the year 
but has slipped a bit since then 
west texas intermediate the benchmark american crude was 
trading at 20 a barrel 
nick antill analyst at the london brokerage county natwest 
predicted producers would raise their daily output ceiling by a 
million or so barrels up to 195 million barrels 
opec reported last week that 12 of its members supplied 1754 
million barrels a day in international markets in april just above 
the supply target of 1751 million barrels 
total production by the dozen was 1847 million barrels a day in 
april it said 
figures for the unied arab emirates were not available 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq

over things the superiority of spirit over matter the roman 
catholic leader said 
before us lies the duty of opening a new christian chapter in 
history in response to the many challenges of a changing world 
christians understand what is at stake the history of our own 
century clearly shows that where no transcendent norm is 
acknowleged people are in danger of surrendering themselves to 
forces which take command of society without concern for 
individuals and their freedoms 
the papal tour of scandinavia opened thursday with a frank 
exchange between the pope and norways top lutheran bishop who 
urged the roman catholic leader to view scandinavias dominant 
religion as an equal 
the fivecountry 10day tour is the first ever by a pope to 
this region where the protestant reformation vanquished 
catholicism four centuries ago 
the meeting between john paul and bishop andreas aarflot of oslo 
followed a reception by sparse crowds in this country of only 
27800 roman catholics 
john paul was scheduled to travel later in the day to tromsoe 
more than 200 miles north of the arctic circle for a late prayer 
service 
aarflot and the pope exchanged speeches in english and applauded 
each others remarks in an hourlong meeting in a hall richly 
decorated with tapestries and portraits of norwegian royalty 
in his speech aarflot said there were many signs that the roman 
catholic church is breaking away from what many observers and 
historians would call its isolation and selfsufficiency through 
the centuries 
but he said much more needs to be done as far as lutherans were 
concerned in his response john paul pledged that the quest for 
unity was an irrevocable part of the catholic churchs life 
but he added catholics and protestants must acknowledge that 
we cannot yet proclaim a common faith in the mystery of the 
eucharist and of the church 
the catholic position on eucharistic sharing is not meant to 
offend our partners in dialogue he said adding that the 
eucharist is only to be shared by those in full communion with one 
another 
with only 200000 catholics in the five countries or less than 
1 percent of the population john paul was not expected to draw 
sizeable crowds as he has been used to during many of his 42 
foreign trips in his 10year papacy 
scandinavian attitudes also contrast with rome on issues such as 
abortion contraception and divorce all prohibited by church 
teaching 
a leading oslo newspaper the tabloid dagbladet published a 
caricature thursday depicting the popes miter in the shape of a 
condom 
norways prime minister gro harlem brundtland said she 
discussed the problem of fighting aids among other issues in talks 
thursday the vatican is opposed to the use of condoms to protect 
against the spread of the disease and views the issue mainly as a 
problem of sexual morality

hordes of mosquitoes out for blood have descended 
on new england this spring zapping beaches and family barbecues 
and sending residents running for shelter 
these mosquitoes are especially aggressive herbert 
maxfield field director for the massachusetts center for disease 
control said thursday they come at you with full intent of 
getting your blood 
arthur doty chairman of the mosquito control district for the 
vermont towns of brandon leicester and salisbury said mosquitoes 
were plaguing the region in greater numbers than hed seen in 30 
years 
weve got an epidemic he said 
stung by the attack citizens in one vermont town rallied for a 
remedy calling on state lawmakers to pay for mosquito control 
the onslaught is probably the result of heavierthannormal 
rainfall in april and may maxfield said it may have brought 
about the hatching of the eggs and now those adults are on the 
wing he said 
id say for this time of year its as bad as its been in 
recent memory said david struble an entomologist with maines 
department of conservation and disease management 
university of vermont entomologist gordon nielsen said springs 
sudden eruption this year also was to blame for the buzzing hordes 
temperatures went to 90 and it just had a telescoping 
effect he said the heat stimulated the simultaneous emergence 
of dozens of different species of biting insects that usually 
appear in sequence he said 
the situation in vermonts southern addision and northern 
rutland counties is so severe that 150 demonstrators gathered 
wednesday in brandon to protest the legislatures failure to fund 
mosquito control 
residents said the biting insects constitute a disaster and one 
speaker suggested summoning the national guard 
the towns of brandon leicester and salisbury bordered on the 
west by 20000 acres of swamp want the state legislature to fund 
a 200000 study and larvae control program 
graham walden who attended the demonstration said state 
officials must realize this is not a joke this is a very serious 
economic problem 
some people have used the phrase a prisoner in your own 
home because all of the things one normally enjoys at this time 
of year are a nightmare to complete walden said who covers 
himself with insect repellent three times a day when he walks his 
dog 
in connecticut the state department of health services chief 
mosquito fighter surveyed sections of the states coastline 
paul capotosto said in one landing bite test a person stood 
in a wooded spot for five minutes and received more than five bites 
and theres more bad news 
theodore andreadis an entomologist at the connecticut 
agricultural experiment station in new haven said just as the 
current crop of mosquitoes begins to die off in two months another 
round of larvae is likely to hatch given sufficient rainfall in 
june and july 
the outlook is fairly grim he said

interest and penalties the orlando sentinel reported in todays 
editions 
i dont owe taxes bakker said when shown a copy of the 
lien ive always paid my taxes its a part of the plot to 
destroy jim and tammy 
the tax lien is only the latest in a series of setbacks for the 
televangelists who recently moved to orlando 
bakker is to stand trial in august on charges of fraud in 
connection with his former praise the lord ministry bakker his 
wife and an aide also have been ordered to pay 76 million to ptl 
as part of a judgment in a suit that accused them of misusing 
ministry funds 
the lien filed in orange county prevents the bakkers from 
selling any property without irs permission said jackie bracey an 
irs public affairs officer in greensboro nc 
the bakkers have been taping their jim and tammy show at an 
orlando shopping center since may 8 they are leasing space at the 
center and renting a home in an exclusive subdivision

judgments in states where it believes the bakkers and former top

federal health officials say an aids education 
program targeting intravenous drug users in sacramento calif has 
reduced practices that increase the risk of transmitting the aids 
virus 
the centers for disease control reported thursday that 23 
percent of the intravenous drug users interviewed in sacramento in 
1986 said they did not share needles or usually or always 
sterilized their paraphernalia 
the report said the figure climbed to 41 percent in 1988 after 
the education prevention and testing program was begun 
drug users testing negative for the human immunodeficiency virus 
hiv that causes aids were encouraged and paid to return after 
four months for followup testing the study said 24 percent did so 
and all continued to test negative of those returning 57 percent 
reported using safer shooting techniques 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the 
bodys defenses against disease leaving a person prey to 
lifethreatening infections and certain cancers 
the virus that causes the asyet incurable disease is passed 
mainly through sexual contact shared hypodermic needles 
contaminated blood and blood products and from infected mothers to 
offspring 
the cdc report described the gains in the sacramento program as 
modest but said such programs are important in reducing the 
risk of transmitting the aids virus 
worcester mass has begun a similar program in jails where 
needleusers are concentrated 
the cdc said the sacramento program recruited drug users from 
drug treatment programs jails public hospitals and a county 
testing and counseling site the city of 330000 has an estimated 
8000 intravenous drug users 
it often takes years from the time of exposure to the virus 
until diagnosis of the disease so the study measured only 
behavior not the number of aids cases among participants 
in worcester the cdc said surveys showed that 70 percent of 
the jail inmates who used intravenous drugs had never been in a 
rehabilitation program seventyseven percent of those describing 
themselves as recent needle users said they had shared needles 
the study there showed that more than half of the recent needle 
users at treatment clinics and rehabilitation programs had been in 
jail recently and that among recent needle users recruited in jail 
for the study 83 percent had been in jail before 
the worcester program illustrates the potential impact of hiv 
prevention programs on intravenous drug users in correctional 
institutions the cdc report said 
it said the highest instances of positive testing for the aids 
antibody among needle users are in new york city and puerto rico 
between 45 percent and 60 percent 
the report said the high rate indicates the potential for rapid 
transmission of the virus to uninfected needle users 
the report said results similar to those achieved in sacramento 
may be more difficult to achieve in larger cities with larger 
numbers of drug users

clr james a caribbeanborn political 
historian marxist philosopher novelist political activist and 
cricket writer has died at his home above a bookshop in south 
londons largely black brixton district colleagues said he was 88 
the london newspaper the independent hailed james in an obituary 
today as probably the most versatile and accomplished 
afroamerican intellectual of the 20th century 
writer and television producer tariq ali said james died 
wednesday no cause of death was stated and obituary notices made 
no mention of any family members 
frail with white hair lean features and a quavering voice 
james exercised a considerable influence over independence 
movements in africa and the caribbean after world war ii 
his support for marxist revolution and sharp criticism of 
opponents contrasted with his softspoken charm eloquence and 
gentle manner 
cyril lionel robert james was born at tunapuna near port of 
spain trinidad in 1901 and like his father became a teacher 
educated at queens royal college one of the exbritish 
colonys top schools he had an encyclopedic knowledge of english 
literature and history and a command of latin and ancient greek 
he left trinidad in 1932 at the urging of fellow trinidadian 
learie constantine later lord constantine who was then a 
professional cricketer and became a political leader in britain 
james went to stay with constantine at nelson in northwest 
england and published his first book life of captain cipriani 
soon after his arrival 
the book about a trinidadian politician agitating on behalf of 
working class people there was financed by constantine 
with the support of british cricket writer neville cardus james 
began to write about the game for the northern england newspaper 
the manchester guardian he later wrote books about the game which 
had been a passion with him since boyhood days 
moving to london later in the 1930s he became a marxist and 
involved himself in leftwing political causes of the time 
his close colleague at that time was fellow trinidadian george 
padmore a former member of the 3rd communist international or 
comintern founded in moscow 
padmore had been head of the comintern department responsible 
for what it called negro propaganda but in 1935 he broke with 
soviet leader joseph stalin and came to london where he produced a 
journal dedicated to african emancipation that james edited 
james bestknown book the black jacobins was published in 
1938 with the rise of fascism and the 1936 italian invasion of 
ethiopia in mind it told of black revolt in haiti against french 
rule during the french revolution at the end of the 18th century 
in a shift of political views james came to reject stalins 
brand of communism siding instead with stalins exiled rival leon 
trotsky james and trotsky met in 1939 in mexico trotsky was 
assassinated there the following year at what is thought to have 
been stalins instigation 
soon after publication of the black jacobins which won wide 
acclaim james went to the united states having established a 
close relationship in london with the black american singer and 
political activist paul robeson he and robeson worked together on 
african and negro issues 
james spent 15 years in america addressing books and articles 
on political issues to small black marxist and labor groups 
he was expelled from the united states in 1953 during the 
anticommunist campaign headed by the late sen joseph mccarthy and 
again became involved in the african independence movement 
james returned to trinidad in 1958 at the invitation of dr eric 
williams the chief minister to edit his partys newspaper and 
later became secretary of the west indies federal labor party 
but he differed with williams left trinidad and in the 1960s 
and 1970s was permitted back into the united states for a series of 
college lecture tours 
he later returned to live in britain where a group of admirers 
mostly young and black gathered around him heralding him as a 
trotskyite sage his writing meanwhile inspired numerous young 
intellectuals in the caribbean 
funeral arrangements were incomplete

a jewish settlement on the west bank dropped 
plans today to force palestinian laborers to wear tags reading 
alien worker after the us state department strongly 
criticized the idea as undemocratic 
also today israeli media reports said the army may restrict the 
movement of west bank settlers suspected of vigilante acts against 
palestinians 
the reports came hours after troops stopped dozens of residents 
of the jewish settlement kiryat arba from raiding the nearby arab 
village of halhoul to avenge stonethrowing attacks on israeli cars 
on thursday kiryat arba settlers reportedly entered halhoul 
shooting at homes and smashing windows of cars and houses 
in another development peace crusader abie nathan was charged 
with supporting terrorist organizations because he met in september 
with plo chief yasser arafat in tunisia and france 
nathan could face up to three years in prison for violating a 
1986 law that bars israelis from meeting with members of terror 
organizations israel considers the palestine liberation 
organization a terror group 
nathan called the law ridiculous and said he has met arafat 
repeatedly since september im ready to meet anybody including 
satan himself if i find an answer to questions that can save the 
life of one person nathan told the associated press nathan 61 
said the charges apparently were filed so many months after his 
first meetings with arafat because of what he described as the 
lynching mood in this country 
leaders of the jewish west bank settlement of ariel today 
reversed an earlier decision to force palestinian laborers to wear 
alien worker badges 
the new regulations say temporary workers both arabs and jews 
will undergo a security check when entering ariel and then be 
issued a card reading security permission to enter ariel said 
mayor ron nachmann he said workers can carry the cards in their 
pockets 
the initial decision would have required only arab workers to 
wear tags it drew strong criticism and raised comparisons with the 
yellow star of david that jews were forced to wear in nazi germany 
on thursday richard boucher a spokesman at the us state 
department denounced the practice as offensive 
in our view this one settlements requirement of badges for 
palestinian workers is incompatible with democratic values 
boucher said 
nachmann rejected the criticism they us officials 
continue to insult us by calling us obstacles to peace and 
occupiers he said 
washingtons longstanding middle east policy calls for israeli 
withdrawing from the occupied land in exchange for peace us 
officials have repeatedly said the settlements are an obstacle to 
such a solution 
the army refused comment today on reports that it may restrict 
the movement of certain jewish settlers from kiryat arba and the 
west bank towns of hebron and nablus who are suspected in taking 
part in vigilante raids on arabs 
such restrictions would mainly affect a small group of followers 
of the antiarab kach movement in the three areas the newspapers 
yediot ahronot and al hamishmar reported settlers have stepped up 
vigilante attacks in recent weeks firing wildly in arab villages 
in one raid a 13yearold palestinian girl was shot to death by 
settlers 
also today an army officer was sentenced to 14 days in a 
military jail for opening fire illegally while dispersing a protest 
march at the tulkarem refugee camp this week the army said

many of the nations top editorial 
cartoonists feel theyre beating around the bush 
whether ultraliberal or archconservative they were awfully 
gloomy for people who draw funny pictures for a living as they met 
thursday for their annual convention 
the reason after eight halcyon years with president reagan and 
company they said they face what may be the toughest challenge of 
their careers lampooning president bush 
many of the 175 members of the association of american editorial 
cartoonists eulogized the reagan era as a banner decade for 
cartoonists and worried openly that bush will be bad for business 
i think george bush is like mister rogers neighborhood 
said dick locher who won a pulitzer prize in 1983 for his 
conservative editorial cartoons in the chicago tribune hes soft 
and gentle and warm and i dont see a hell of a lot going on 
there 
reagan was such a character walter handelsman a cartoonist 
with the scranton pa times said wistfully im not having as 
much fun now im doing more local issues 
still randy wicks of the newhall calif signal sees some hope 
for the bush years 
well miss ronald reagan but george bush has possibilities 
he said his lack of charisma is probably an angle well all 
use 
and many cartoonists who listened to panel discussions and 
participated in a cartoon jam said one bright spot exists 
vice president quayle 
i love dan quayle said signe wilkinson of the philadelphia 
daily news hes the ultimate republican affirmativeaction hire 
affirmative action for dumb rich white kids 
others agreed 
george bush will be the first president to be eclipsed by his 
vice president predicted jack higgins of the chicago suntimes 
who won this years pulitzer for editorial cartoons 
lee judge a cartoonist since 1981 for the kansas city star and 
the kansas city times said dan quayles wonderful hes an 
idiot you know the worse things are going for the country the 
better things are for cartoonists 
but quayle has drawbacks for cartoonists judge said people 
like quayle with even regular features are hard to draw he 
said he doesnt have michael dukakis eyebrows 
some conservative cartoonists had another complaint ambivalence 
because their favorite candidates win office 
ive had eight rotten years as a cartoonist since ive had a 
guy in office that i like said dick wright of the providence 
journal but i had four great years with jimmy carter all that 
guy had to do was get up in the morning

as american tom sutherland marks his 
fourth year as a hostage in lebanon his wife says the bush 
administration has a chance to solve middle eastern problems that 
got him there 
i live with enormous hope but no expectations said jean 
sutherland who was to attend a ceremony today at iowa state 
university in ames where she and her husband first met 
mrs sutherland said a new administration represents a prospect 
for change in how the us approaches the kaleidoscope of problems 
affecting lebanon 
the bush administration has a chance to do something new after 
coming out of eight years in which you have had policy set 
especially after irangate when things were put on hold she said 
sutherland dean of agriculture at the american university of 
beirut and a former iowa state student was abducted on june 9 
1985 
mrs sutherland said she and her husband were aware of the risks 
involved in deciding to go to beirut five years ago and she feels 
no bitterness or anger toward the us governments handling of the 
hostage situation 
i felt that the integrity of our choice really rests on the 
fact that we cant ask anybody to get us out of it mrs 
sutherland 
i think the issue for our government is that the hostages are 
a symptom and symbol of what is wrong in that area and in the 
world she said that is something the government needs to get 
a grip on and deal with 
mrs sutherland has continued to live in beirut teaching in a 
special english program at american university she said remaining 
there made her feel close to her husband and gave her a sense of 
continuing their life together 
the ames native said the isu ceremony where bells will toll 48 
times for each month sutherland has been in captivity is special 
to her and her husband 
we really appreciate how people have stuck in there for all 
these years and offered us their care and concern its been a 
lifeline for us she said well stick in there even if we do 
go in with no expectations we still hope that this year is a 
decisive one 
before coming to iowa she had visited her husbands family in 
his native scotland she will spend the actual anniversary of his 
captivity in fort collins colo with her daughters 
what im doing is an odyssey for tom said mrs sutherland 
i think ill be going back to beirut and taking back all the 
strength and all the friendships from here 
there are eight other americans still held hostage in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was captured march 16 
1985

the attorney for kendall l truitt the sailor 
who was mentioned in connection with the investigation of the uss 
iowa disaster says he will ask the us navy today to clear his 
clients name 
attorney ellis rubin of miami said he also would announce other 
demands which he plans to make of the navy 
we demand somebody in a uniform getting on television or radio 
and the print media and explaining to the country that this was an 
unfortunate accusation that leaked out and that the navy is 
apologizing and is also clearing the record of this hero rubin 
said on nbcs today program 
truitt appearing this morning on the same program was asked 
whether he believes his reputation has been irreparably damaged 
he replied i think its certainly damaged were going to be 
trying to get it cleared here shortly we still want an apology 
from the navy 
rubin said he had not received word from the navy about whether 
its investigation of the april 19 explosion had cleared truitt abc 
news however quoted pentagon sources thursday as saying that the 
naval investigative service had ruled out involvement by truitt a 
gunners mate 3rd class who survived the explosion 
abc said navy investigators had been unable to reach any 
conclusion about what caused the explosion which killed 47 sailors 
navy spokesman lt cmdr james kudla said thursday night he 
could not comment on the matter because the investigation has not 
been reviewed by navy officials 
truitt had been named as a beneficiary of a lifeinsurance 
policy of his friend clayton hartwig 25 who died in the blast 
truitt said last month he wanted the navy to apologize for 
leaking information that implicated him in the explosion news 
reports based on unidentified sources had said investigators were 
exploring the relationship between truitt and hartwig 
truitt has repeatedly denied being involved with the blast he 
and rubin have suggested the explosion may have occurred when an 
inexperienced sailor pushed bags of gun powder too quickly into the 
breech of the gun

some trucks are doing double duty of 
the most distasteful kind hauling food to market in the east and 
returning to the midwest filled with garbage for landfills a 
newspaper reported 
food truckers at plazas on interstate 80 in pennsylvania tell of 
going to midwest landfills with 20 or more tons of baled garbage on 
their return runs the centre daily times reported 
in recent weeks a reporter from the newspaper saw many 
tractortrailers and refrigerator trucks either carrying or being 
loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station in 
pennsylvania and being unloaded at a large ohio landfill 
the fact that garbage is moving in dry vans and refrigerator 
trucks that sometimes also carry food is something thats becoming 
increasingly apparent said dave pointon of the national solid 
wastes management association as an association we feel it is 
unhealthy unaesthetic and unappealing but right now theres 
nothing on the books to prohibit it 
the us department of agriculture prohibits the hauling of meat 
and poultry products in any vehicle that has carried inedible 
cargo and the us food and drug administration requires 
interstate carriers of all other food products to provide clean and 
sanitary vehicles 
but truck drivers said it was easy to get around those 
regulations and officials said it was difficult to catch violators 
the newspaper reported 
one truck from michigan said the use of deodorizers and coffee 
grounds combined with a quick sweep can fool federal authorities 
and workers on food loading docks the newspaper reported sunday 
the story was reprinted today in the philadelphia inquirer 
it boggles the imagination manfred kroger professor of 
food science at pennsylvania state university told the daily times 
last week the implications of food contamination are tremendous 
its like shipping milk to alaska and bringing back oil in the same 
truck 
trucking association officials said they know nothing of the 
practice but drivers said dispatchers have been routinely steering 
them to solidwaste transfer stations in philadelphia allentown 
and bloomsburg and jersey city nj for the last year or two 
the executive director of the alexandria vabased interstate 
truckload carriers conference terry turner said last week that he 
knew nothing about the hauling of food and garbage in the same 
trucks but he did say trucking companies are rushing to get cargo 
to avoid returning empty from the east 
the east coast consumes so much more than it produces that 
truckers trying to come out of there either cut rates run empty 
or haul what they can haul a truck either makes money or it 
doesnt stay on the road he said 
according to the newspaper truckers and solidwaste industry 
representatives say backhauling garbage is burgeoning because of a 
lack of government and other regulations a dwindling number of 
garbage disposal sites in the east and economic competition in the 
trucking industry 
a food industry spokesmen was astounded when he heard of the 
practice 
it would be the worst imaginable publicity for our products to 
be in any way associated with garbage dumps or landfills said 
dennis madsen of the washingtonbased national american wholesale 
grocers association the trend in our industry is to get more 
backhauls but certainly not garbage im sure our membership 
would think this abhorrent

minister and he pledged reforms to clear the air of an 
influencepeddling scandal that has decimated the top ranks of the 
governing liberal democratic party

up 
the conservative party also got new leaders and uno chose a new 
cabinet in a bid to wipe the slate clean of the recruit 
influencebuying scandal before elections for half the upper house

the scandal surfaced a year ago ruined many careers and forced 
prime minister noboru takeshita 65 to resign and take 
responsibility for a widespread loss of trust in politics 
the two houses of parliament met separately today and selected 
uno as japans 18th postwar prime minister on the strength of the 
liberal democrats majorities in each chamber 
in the lower house uno got 285 of 477 votes with japan 
socialist party chairwoman takako doi receiving 139 eiichi nagasue 
of the democratic socialist party 26 and kenji miyamoto of the 
communist party 25 two votes were ruled invalid 
the upper house gave uno 124 of 220 votes with ms doi 
capturing 65 miyamoto 17 and nagasue 9 five ballots were blank 
officials announced 
earlier the liberal democrats endorsed uno to succeed takeshita 
as party president 
officials said uno will follow his predecessors policies toward 
the united states but will not soften his tough response to 
washingtons designation of japan as a potential target of us 
trade sanctions for supercomputers satellites and lumber 
uno is behind no one in appreciating the importance of 
usjapan relations foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
told reporters 
the 20member cabinet that uno selected was far from completely 
new at least six members of takeshitas administration retained 
their posts or took other portfolios 
the new chief cabinet secretary masajuro shiokawa 67 was 
asked after he announced the lineup whether he had any connection 
with recruit he said his office had given a blank signed receipt 
to another liberal democrat shintaro abe in 1982 and abe used it 
to spread a donation from recruit among several receipts so that a 
single large donation would not have to be reported 
to be honest with you i dont really remember what it was 
shiokawa said it was all a long time ago and it was done by my 
secretary and the secretary has left my office 
uno today pledged political reforms to create the party anew 
and clear the air of the scandal that has decimated the top ranks 
of liberal democrats 
the recruit scandal had a great impact and i understand what 
it means to be chosen as prime minister in such a situation uno 
said i would like to promise to carry forward political reforms 
with all my loyalty and strength 
asked at a news conference about his reform program uno gave no 
specifics 
uno has served as director general of the defense agency 
minister of interational trade and industry and foreign minister 
three of the most important cabinet posts 
but he has not held two of the traditional jobs on the route to 
the prime ministership the finance portfolio and the party post 
of secretary general and he has no independent power base within 
the party 
some observers expect him to be an interim prime minister 
perhaps only until the upper house election in july 
a key to his survival will be his political reform program and 
the opinion of it by voters who now give the liberal democrats 
recordlow popularity rankings 
recruit an information services and publishing conglomerate is 
accused of trying to buy influence with political donations and by 
letting politicians and their aides buy unlisted recruit stock 
shares which rose in value when placed on the market 
takeshita and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone are among 
those linked to such deals the scandal took place during 
nakasones 198287 administration 
prosecutors finished their probe of the recruit scandal last 
week without indicting any toplevel politicians seventeen people 
including businessmen bureaucrats and elected parliamentarians 
have been charged with bribery or violations of laws on political 
donations 
in his acceptance speech uno said he was resigning from the 
nakasone faction taking one of the steps recommended by a party 
panel on reform 
the reform measures also called for those tainted by the recruit 
scandal to be barred from cabinet or party leadership posts 
nakasone resigned from the party because of the recruit scandal 
but he retained his seat in parliament and analysts expect him to 
retain his influence 
many of the liberal democrats top leaders were ineligible to 
succeed takeshita because they are tainted by the scandal party 
power brokers finally turned to uno after elder statesman masayoshi 
ito repeatedly refused the job

the man who unplugged his comatose son from 
a lifesupport system at gunpoint six weeks ago has been released 
from a hospital after being treated for a violent reaction to an 
illegal drug officials said 
rudy linares a 23yearold house painter was discharged 
thursday afternoon after undergoing a series of medical 
evaluations said diane lux a spokeswoman for macneal memorial 
hospital in berwyn 
linares was admitted to the hospital early thursday after 
paramedics and police handcuffed him and forcibly transported him 
there from his home police said he was not immediately charged 
but authorities said he could face drug or parole violation charges 
mr linares told one of the officers hed taken some bad 
pcp said steve zalas cicero deputy police superintendent he 
was kind of combative pcp or angel dust is a street drug that 
can induce a state similar to schizophrenia when asked why he took 
the drug linares told officers what would you do if your son 
just died according to zalas 
linares lawyer daniel coyne said linares was not a drug 
abuser but tried the drug purely as an experiment the drug 
had been given to him by a friend the lawyer said 
doctors reported that linares had not suffered an overdose but 
merely a bad reaction and that pcp cocaine and alcohol were 
in his blood coyne said 
in april linares was charged with murder after he pulled a 
handgun in a hospital where his 15monthold son samuel was being 
kept ordered staff from the room and then unhooked the boys 
lifesupport system he held the boy who had been in a coma for 
nine months after choking on a balloon until he died 
the incident sparked a widespread debate over the ethics of 
keeping comatose patients with little chance of recovery alive and 
the proper role of family members and medical and legal authorities 
prosecutors decided not to pursue the murder charge after a 
grand jury refused to indict linares on may 19 linares did plead 
guilty to a misdemeanor gun violation and was sentenced to a year 
of probation and psychological counseling if deemed necessary 
cicero police filed no charges against linares in connection 
with thursdays incident but a spokesman for the states 
attorneys office said prosecutors were looking into linares 
admission that he used illegal drugs 
assistant states attorney scott nelson said any violation of 
law would be a violation of linares probation

venise lynette morris 28 
both pleaded guilty in february to charges of soliciting an 
undercover police detective to kill their estranged husbands 
victor shuman the detective who posed as the hired gun said 
outside court that east promised him 10000 from an insurance 
policy he believed to be worth 35000 morris gave him a 1000 
check and promised to pay him 4000 more after collecting on a 
10000 policy he said 
morris told probation officers she wanted someone to kill her 
estranged husband michael 41 because he was acquitted by a jury 
of molesting her 7yearold daughter

mayor tom bradley took actions on three 
projects that stood to benefit drexel burnham lambert while holding 
personal investments through the firm a newspaper reported today 
bradley approved drexels exemption from a sewer law in a 
stillunbuilt 230 million development made a video sales pitch 
for a 269 million drexel deal and gave final authority to allow 
drexel to be lead underwriter on a 190 million city bond issue 
the herald examiner reported 
the report comes as supporters of the embattled mayor say they 
fear his plans for the city could be stalled by lengthy 
investigations of his personal finances 
but the mayors wife ethel bradley told the los angeles times 
her husband is determined to remain in office despite any damage to 
his political career all they are out to do is to try to tear 
down his reputation she said in an interview appearing in 
todays editions 
bradley reelected to an unprecedented fifth term in april is 
facing the biggest political crisis of his career various city 
state and federal authorities are investigating his ties to drexel 
and two banks 
bradley refused to comment thursday on his reported actions on 
the three drexel deals drexel spokesman steve anreder said he 
couldnt locate a company official to comment 
the mayor has held an investment worth from 10000 to 100000 
with drexel since 1979 he said the firm has been his broker in 
other unnamed stock investments 
while holding these investments the mayor asked the city 
council to exempt the pershing square centre associates project 
brokered by drexel from the citys growthlimiting sewer law 
the city council approved the exemption last year the project 
was one of only a handful of downtown developments to receive such 
an exemption 
david houk pscas chief executive said his firm hired drexel 
in 1987 he said its role in the project had nothing to do with the 
exemption and that he did not believe the mayor knew drexel was 
used 
the amount of money drexel earned from its involvement in the 
project could not be immediately determined psca has filed for 
bankruptcy and the projects future is uncertain 
in 1984 bradley appeared in a 12minute videotape commissioned 
by drexel to persuade limited partners to buy 100000 interests in 
angelus plaza one of the countrys largest senior citizen rental 
projects it was not known how much money drexel earned on that 
deal 
in that same year bradley approved a council action allowing 
drexel to join the citys housing bond underwriting team 
drexel became the lead underwriter of a 190 million deal to 
build 1916 apartments the largest housing bond issue ever in the 
city the firm earned 633333 on the deal city officials said 
some of the bradleys strongest supporters say his problems may 
jeopardize downtown redevelopment and hamper other city projects 
it is important to have a closure of the issue an array of 
the facts and take whatever action that has to be done and get it 
behind us said ray remy president of the greater los angeles 
chamber of commerce and a former deputy mayor to bradley

developers today announced they would build an 
office building on stilts to preserve the remains of the historic 
rose theater where william shakespeare is believed to have debuted 
as an actor 
but protestors who have waged a campaign to save the partly 
excavated theater condemned the plan as worse than expected 
the 10story office building would stand 22 feet above the 
elizabethan theaters remains and be supported by steel girders 
the developers said 
the theaters remains would be on view from entrances on three 
sides of the office building they said 
the governmentapproved plan for the site south of the thames 
river would cost 158 million more than the initial plan and would 
reduce some office and parking space the developers said 
the remains of the 16th century theater were discovered nearly 
six months ago during demolition to prepare for the office 
building the rose is the only elizabethan theater ever uncovered 
shakespeare is thought to have made his debut as an actor at the 
rose in 1592 and to have acted there in his own play henry vi 
the modified development plans were announced by property 
company imry merchant developers and the government agency english 
heritage after a vocal preservation campaign by 3000 actors 
lawmakers and local residents at one point actors staged an 
allnight vigil to protect the site from bulldozers 
simon jenkins an english heritage official said the rose 
has been saved and people will come and see it it has not been 
cheap for imry but we have achieved our objective and the theater 
is safe 
however anthony grayling a committee member of the rose 
theater campaign said our reaction is of very deep 
disappointment the plans are worse than expected because they 
threaten to destroy parts of the theater which hasnt yet been 
excavated 
the developers will be going blindfold into something everyone 
recognizes to be of tremendous architectural cultural and 
historical significance grayling said 
the developers were submitting a planning application for the 
scheme to local southwark council today he said no date was set 
for work to begin

the story about the fish that got away 
has a new twist tom foshee says he lost 500000 head of channel 
catfish when they swam off in rising flood waters 
the natchitoches parish fish farmer said this week that all but 
about 10 of the 160 acres of catfish ponds he has in production 
were flooded when heavy rains topped the levees 
we can handle a heavy rainfall but this was probably a once 
in a 100year deal he said of the floods that hit his catfish 
farm last month 
foshee also had to drain the flooded ponds to get rid of bass 
crappie gar carp and various other species brought in by the high 
water those fish feed on young catfish 
he said the flooding will cost him about 250000 
foshee said he has some catfish left so were still able to 
operate but right now were mainly running the hatchery trying to 
get as many young ones as we can

andrei d sakharov accused today of insulting the 
soviet army and heckled by his colleagues in the new congress said 
he was proud of the exile he endured for opposing the afghan war 
and wears it like a medal 
his comments before the congress of peoples deputies came in 
response to deputy sergei chervonopisky of the komsomol communist 
youth organization who accused the 1975 nobel peace prize winner 
of unprecedented badgering of the army which completed its 
pullout from afghanistan in february 
chervonopisky demanded an explanation of an interview sakharov 
gave in canada in which he was quoted as saying that soviet pilots 
killed soldiers they could not save from being captured by afghan 
guerrillas 
the hall gave the komsomol leader a standing ovation when he 
finished then heckled sakharov 
sakharov who endured his punishment in the closed city of gorky 
for opposing the soviet military intervention that began in 
december 1979 took the podium in his defense but he was obviously 
shaken by the attack and stammered as he spoke deputies took 
advantage of pauses when he stumbled over words to mock him and try 
to cut him short 
the 68yearold physicist said the afghan war was a criminal 
adventure that cost 1 million afghan lives 
we have to cleanse ourselves of this terrible shame he 
said i spoke out against sending soviet soldiers to afghanistan 
and for this i was exiled to gorky i am proud of this exile in 
gorky i wear it like a medal 
sakharov denied he intended to insult the army but he added 
that charges soldiers killed their comrades in afghanistan were 
under investigation and that no one could call his statements an 
insult until the truth is determined 
but after he finished speaking several deputies hurried to the 
microphone to denounce the dean of the soviet human rights movement 
before the session recessed for lunch 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev former soviet military chief of 
staff said charges that soviet soldiers were instructed to kill 
their comrades to prevent capture were a blatant lie 
members of the ruling communist party politburo in the kremlin 
palace of congresses stood along with others and applauded when 
tursun kazakova of tashkent declared that sakharov should be 
ashamed of himself you have insulted our entire army our entire 
nation all of our boys who gave their lives she shouted at him 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov a politburo member told reporters 
later i dont think you can use such secondhand information as 
he explained to cast such a shadow on people thats unacceptable 
inadmissible 
col gen boris t gromov former commander of the soviet force 
in afghanistan said i regard sakharovs accusation on this 
question as the basest lie 
besieged by reporters after the session sakharov said i am 
sorry i didnt tell the whole truth about the soviet crimes in 
afghanistan the napalm the bombing 
asked about the reaction to his remarks he added it was a 
performance i think it was a contrived reaction 
i can bear it he added 
the new congress which has been conducting nationally broadcast 
debates since may 25 remains in session with no indication when it 
will adjourn it is the first competitively elected congress in 70 
years of communist rule 
also today the communist partys powerful central committee was 
ordered to convene after more than a week of parliamentary sessions 
in which the partys seven decades of supremacy came under repeated 
attack 
well evaluate how the work of the congress is going said 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev who confirmed the central 
committee would meet later today 
the call for a meeting of the policymaking central committee 
came as members of the partys ruling politburo rejected 
suggestions that the party surrender power or give up its 
constitutional monopoly 
one source said the committee would discuss the convening of the 
new standing legislature the supreme soviet which was elected 
last week and is expected to gather for the first time saturday 
meanwhile the chief of the kgb said the supreme soviet should 
have full authority over his agency and use us congressional 
oversight as its model 
we are decidedly in favor of this the new york times quoted 
vladimir a kryuchkov as saying in todays editions and as far 
as the creation of a commission is concerned i think well borrow 
some of the experience of the americans 
the central committee meeting comes after more than a week of 
extraordinary public criticism in the new congress 
party maverick boris n yeltsin a central committee member 
called for an immediate transfer of power from the communist party 
to the congress 
he charged that president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
perestroika or restructuring had failed and that living 
conditions had declined 
the 2250member congress is the heart of gorbachevs plan to 
strengthen the government and limit the party in daily policy 
decisions but the party remains enshrined in the soviet 
constitution as the leading force in society and no other parties 
are legal

members of 18 roman catholic churches closed or 
targeted for closing as part of a reorganization plan have sued the 
archdiocese of detroit the lawsuit filed thursday in wayne county 
circuit court seeks an order allowing 16 of the churches to remain 
open beyond the june 30 closing deadline so they can appeal 
cardinal edmund szokas decision to the vatican 
it also wants circuit judge james hathaway to reopen an internal 
grievance process that archdiocesan officials allegedly blocked 
earlier 
the churches are among 30 that have been closed or scheduled to 
close as the detroit archdiocese seeks to reduce overhead costs and 
cope with a priest shortage and other problems 
two of the parishes already are closed mary ann waterman one 
of five attorneys who filed the lawsuit said she hoped both could 
reopen 
jay berman a spokesman for the archdiocese said the lawsuit 
represented harassment of szoka he said lawyers for the 
archdiocese would seek to have the suit thrown out because it 
violated constitutional principles of churchstate separation 
well go through all of this and money will be spent on both 
sides that could be better used elsewhere and the outcome is 
obvious before either side starts it he said

a store clerk who chased a suspect in a 
pursesnatching and then shot him in the back was freed from jail 
when a prosecutor declined to bring charges but referred the case 
to a grand jury 
the suspect david adams 22 was in critical condition today in 
methodist hospital with a bullet lodged in his spine and police 
said he may be permanently paralyzed the shooting occurred 
wednesday evening 
james e mason a clerk at a supermarket was released from jail 
thursday after marion county prosecutor stephen goldsmith said he 
would not immediately file criminal charges a grand jury will 
consider whether mason should be charged 
in 1985 the us supreme court ruled that police officers may 
not use deadly force to stop fleeing suspects if the suspects do 
not seem to be dangerous but goldsmith said the law is a little 
bit confusing in this area as it applies to private citizens 
police said a 68yearold customer at the supermarket was in her 
car while her husband brought out the groceries when a man grabbed 
her purse and ran away the husband asked store employees for help 
mason ran inside and told coworkers to call police then chased 
the suspect about 10 blocks in his car shot the man in the back 
and then returned the stolen handbag to its owner he said later 
that he thought the man was pulling out a weapon but no weapon was 
found he also said he told the man to stop 
mason was originally charged by police with battery and 
recklessness with a deadly weapon and held overnight in a a 
citycounty lockup on 15000 bond he was freed when the 
prosecutor decided not to bring charges for the time being 
police said mason did not have a license to carry a firearm 
however no criminal charges have been made on that issue

secret documents deeding the baltic 
nations to the soviet union were destroyed by the nazis but a 
microfilm copy survived and has been inspected by the soviets 
officials said today 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who visits west germany 
in less than two weeks has called for an inquiry on the shadowy 
nonaggression pact between adolf hitler and josef stalin and the 
subject could come up during his visit 
challenging gorbachevs policy of glasnost independent groups 
have pressed the kremlin to admit it has been lying for more than 
40 years in claiming the three baltic republics voluntarily sought 
soviet annexation 
west germanys information minister hans klein said the 
original nonaggression pact signed by the wartime foreign 
ministers vyacheslav molotov of the soviet union and joachim von 
ribbentrop of nazi germany survives in the west german foreign 
ministry archives 
but klein and a foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog 
said the secret protocols added to the pact to pave the way for 
soviet takeover of estonia latvia and lithuania were deliberately 
destroyed by nazi officials in the last days of world war ii 
however a microfilm copy of this and other documents was 
preserved by a diplomat chrobog told reporters at a news 
conference 
the protocols to the treaty signed on aug 23 1939 deeded the 
baltic states to the soviet union and allowed nazi germany to 
invade poland a week later 
the officials said they did not know details of who preserved 
the microfilm that was returned to the west german archives in the 
1950s but they contended the documents shown on the microfilm are 
probably the originals 
its not just presumable we believe that it is authentic 
klein said when asked how bonn could be sure it had an accurate 
copy of the protocols i cannot imagine how or why anyone at that 
time would reproduce the documents and then make a microfilm of 
them 
klein said two soviet historians traveled to bonn a few weeks 
ago to examine the documents contained in the microfilm including 
a map that shows the territories divided between the two nations 
chrobog was asked to detail the statements included in the 
secret protocols but declined saying their contents were 
wellknown and had for years been made available to qualified 
researchers 
gennady i gerasimov soviet foreign ministry spokesman said in 
moscow in august that the kremlin has no copy of the secret 
protocols 
soviet officials had asked the west german government about west 
german records on the agreement in an ongoing effort to shed light 
on the events leading up to soviet occupation of the baltic in 1940 
the socalled molotovribbentrop agreement has come under close 
scrutiny over the past year as soviet reforms have allowed open 
discussion about the controversial takeover and prompted an 
official investigation 
at gorbachevs urging the newly assembled congress of peoples 
deputies on thursday ordered an inquiry into the events leading up 
to soviet annexation of the baltic states 
an official estonianlanguage newspaper voice of the nation 
published segments of the secret protocols aug 1011 disclosing 
in print for the first time that the baltic takeover was engineered 
in collusion with the germans

a chinese sailor suffering from 
appendicitis was airlifted from a ship 700 miles off san francisco 
in a dramatic 12hour rescue by the air national guard officials 
said today 
guo jil 19 was in stable condition today after undergoing an 
appendectomy at stanford university hospital where he arrived late 
thursday said nursing supervisor darlene murphy 
the sailors arrival at the hospital ended a rescue operation 
that began at about 1030 am thursday when a coast guard c130 
transport plane from sacramento dropped three paramedics into the 
water near the ship said coast guard petty officer richard 
lieberman in san francisco 
the team was taken aboard nearly four hours later and stabilized 
guo until an air national guard helicopter flew in three hours 
later and made the airlift lieberman said 
the c130 was sent first because it could get medics to the ship 
faster than the helicopter which had to refuel several times 
the coast guard first received word of the stricken mariner 
wednesday when his ship the xiang cheng en route from china to 
panama was about 1100 miles southwest of san francisco 
the team had to wait until the ship was about 700 miles from 
land before beginning the rescue which is usually undertaken no 
more than 600 miles from shore lieberman said

the city and state often fail to see eyetoeye 
and this time its costing 309000 because tunnel links intended 
to connect a city and a state building dont line up 
its very embarrassing said john c hill a city architect 
its like the railroad to nowhere not meeting or a bridge 
misaligned in midspan because contractors at either end screwed up 
professionals arent supposed to make mistakes like this 
hill said thursday 
the city hired contractors to build half of the pedway tunnel 
and the state had its own contractors handle the other half to link 
the two downtown buildings city hall and the state of illinois 
center 
the outcome the states portion is 9 inches lower than the 
citys segment it also is off by 8 inches horizontally 
chicago planners gave the state an elevation of 22 feet 4 
inches below ground level but the state didnt comply with the 
specifications hill said 
frank j conroy project executive for the state said the 
misalignment was the citys fault 
they gave us an elevation to meet and we were right on the 
money its the citys problem its not my problem conroy 
insisted 
despite blaming the state the city has picked up the 309000 
tab for the corrections which include an extra stairway and an 
added elevator stop 
the tunnel which has been delayed for various reasons for the 
past four years is scheduled to open in september

amtrak trains dumped untreated restroom and 
other wastes as they passed over a creek dousing fishermen below 
said state officials who charged the rail service with three felony 
counts of littering 
it is just unfair for people out enjoying the river to be 
sprayed with effluent assistant state attorney dennis bayer said 
state officials said amtrak was charged with dumping wastes as 
trains crossed trestles at buffalo bluff and rice creek a 
tributary of the st johns river 
commercial littering is a thirddegree felony under state law 
and carries a maximum 5000 fine 
federal regulations governing amtrak supersede state laws 
governing the discharges from toilets and holding tanks on the 
trains amtrak spokesman clifford black said thursday 
i submit that the alligators in the st johns river produce 
more effluent in the st johns river than an occasional amtrak 
train he said 
bayer said amtrak should comply with state laws and will be 
arraigned on the charges before a circuit judge in palatka later 
this month he said his office had received complaints from 
fishermen who were doused by the discharge

a sudanese government plane bombed a 
landing strip in southern sudan as a un flight unloaded famine 
relief supplies a un official said today 
several civilians were injured in the attack thursday at the 
rebelheld city of torit said john usher a spokesman for the un 
childrens fund 
in kenya meanwhile sudans foreign minister said his 
government will begin peace talks with the rebels june 10 without 
requiring any conditions for the negotiations 
unicef is spearheading operation lifeline sudan a campaign to 
deliver food to southern sudan where 100000 people are facing 
starvation because of a famine caused by the war 
a un flight had landed on the air strip at torit and was 
delivering supplies when the sudanese bomber attacked said usher 
as the sudanese bomber turned to make its second assault the 
un plane took off and escaped safely three civilians on the 
ground were injured including a woman whose legs were mangled 
according to un reports 
the 132 million aid project seeks to distribute food to remote 
areas before villages and refugee camps are cut off by rains in the 
next few weeks 
last year about 500000 people died of warinduced starvation 
and disease 
unicef director james grant called in sudans un ambassador 
amin m abdoun to protest the attack grant said later that based 
on his discussions with sudanese prime minister sadel mahdi he 
believes the attack was not ordered by top government authorities 
grant requested an investigation of how and why the bombing took 
place and wanted assurances it would not be repeated 
in nairobi kenya sudans foreign minister sidahmen elhusain 
said he had no knowledge of the bombing except what he had heard on 
news reports he called it an isolated incident 
torit fell to the rebel sudan peoples liberation army on feb 
26 and has become a major redistribution center for operation 
lifeline sudan 
the sudan peoples liberation army is fighting for autonomy for 
the three southern provinces which are populated mainly by 
christians and animists 
the moslemdominated government based in khartoum has attempted 
to impose islamic law on the nation 
peace talks between the government and the sudan peoples 
liberation movement are to begin june 10 in addis ababa ethiopia 
elhusain said there would be no conditions set on the talks he 
brushed aside rebel complaints that the government still has not 
met an earlier peace accord that called for abolishing the 
countrys strict moslem legal code 
the foreign minister spoke at a news conference during a visit 
to neighboring kenya which he said was meant to brief president 
daniel arap moi on the peace process and seek his help 
abolishment of the moslem code is one of the primary aims of the 
rebels but elhusain said the purpose of the addis ababa talks was 
to work out a means of achieving that and other goals 
a previous pact between the government and the rebels on nov 16 
called for elimination of moslem law the lifting of a state of 
emergency and a permanent ceasefire in the 6yearold civil war 
elhusain said mahdi is in support of the november accord and 
is pushing it fully he said the government would make a 
serious genuine consistent effort to end the conflict

president bush arrived home 
today after his foreign policy debut on the european stage leaving 
us allies cheering his leadership at the nato summit and bringing 
a message of hope for the american people 
we have a great and historic opportunity to shape the changes 
that are transforming europe the president said in this 
period of historic change the nato alliance has never been more 
united never been stronger 
on his return from london bush was greeted at pease air force 
base by a crowd of about 2000 people including hundreds of 
flagwaving schoolchildren 
buoyed by positive reaction to his disarmament proposals bush 
told the crowd i am now returning from europe with a message for 
the american people a message of hope 
we must get to work now to end the cold war the world has 
waited long enough he said 
bush will spend the weekend at his oceanside retreat near here 
at kennebunkport maine returning to washington late sunday 
the president arranged separate meetings monday with his cabinet 
and with democratic and republican congressional leaders to assess 
the results of his weeklong tour of rome brussels bonn and 
london and the prospects for negotiated reductions in conventional 
nato and sovietled warsaw pact forces 
we will spare no effort to achieve agreements that will reduce 
the risk of war and strengthen the foundations for peace said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
bush capped his trip thursday night by having dinner with 
british prime minister margaret thatcher at 10 downing street 
afterward bush declared nato is strong we are showing a very 
solid front 
as bushs black limousine pulled away mrs thatcher approached 
reporters and said were very much together 
asked if soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was trying to 
divide the nato alliance mrs thatcher said he wouldnt 
succeed nato is strong and the alliance is firm 
were not going to have our defenses undermined she added 
in a dinner toast the prime minister assured bush you always 
will be able to count on britain when there is danger when you 
need us thats why the relationship is so special 
bush called mrs thatcher a prime minister who holds the reins 
of history 
he noted it was in this very city that a little more than a 
century ago karl marx died leaving behind ideas that were to bear 
his name 
a succession of british prime ministers and american presidents 
worked to stem marxism at full tide bush said now we can 
explore possibilities for peace that would have seemed widely 
unrealistic just a handful of years ago 
we seek to free europe from the shadow of soviet military 
power he said 
the farewell dinner attended by a phalanx of british 
celebrities and sporting stars capped a week filled with praise 
from western allies for americas new president 
the final day of bushs trip was filled with colorful pageantry 
before dinner with the prime minister the president and his 
wife barbara went to buckingham palace for lunch with queen 
elizabeth ii 
when bushs limousine pulled up to the redcarpeted grand 
entrance of the palace bush jumped out but nobody opened mrs 
bushs door until the queen frowning and shaking her head raised 
her voice and said open it 
a us secret service agent complied immediately and mrs bush 
wearing an emerald green dress emerged smiling as though nothing 
had happened 
earlier in the day denis thatcher the prime ministers 
husband gave mrs bush a gallant kiss on the hand when he greeted 
her at 10 downing street 
when photographers clamored for a repeat a playful mrs bush 
clasped denis thatchers hand and planted a kiss on it 
bushs staff was buoyant about positive reviews of the 
presidents performance 
i hope that it might put to rest some of that speculation 
about bush being too timid said secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
it is important i think that an american president be seen 
to be leading the alliance he said 
with thatchers support bush won approval of a nato communique 
against early negotiations to reduce or eliminate shortrange 
nuclear missiles in europe he also got an endorsement of his 
proposal for reducing american and soviet combat troops in europe 
to 275000 each 
european newspapers gave bush high marks although many noted 
that he acted only after gorbachev dominated the public opinion 
stage for months with his disarmament proposals 
in amsterdam the leftleaning dutch de volkskrant said the 
image of george bush as a president lacking a vision on the 
development of the peace and disarmament process in europe must be 
corrected 
the times of london an independent daily wrote that bush has 
proved an important point this week that he can change up a gear 
when the international going demands it 
but the independent swiss daily le matin said bushs optimism 
may be unfounded this charm operation runs the risk of rapidly 
getting bogged down in the details of the vienna negotiations 
over conventional forces in europe it said 
bush spent his final day polishing relations with thatcher 
there are strains over us military aid to argentina which fought 
and lost a war with britain earlier this decade over the falkland 
islands 
washington and london also are at odds over south asian boat 
people about 750 are arriving daily in hong kong and the 
thatcher government would like to stem the flow and send some back 
to vietnam and cambodia

bombs were set off thursday by members of rebel chittagong hill 
tribes who oppose local elections scheduled this month

about 4000 killings since the violence began 
last month president hussain muhammad ershad offered the rebels 
amnesty and ordered elections for semiautonomous administrative 
councils in the chittagong region which encompasses about 5200 
square miles of hilly jungle on the border with india

to neighboring india in the past two weeks to escape violence they 
fear will break out during the election

the crowd cheered for ferdinand marcos 
as the youthful presidential candidate waved to his supporters 
trouble is it wasnt marcos at the campaign rally more than 20 
years ago 
it was jesus quevenco an affable man with such an uncanny 
resemblance to marcos that the former president called him 
brod or brother 
quevenco 65 said he acted as a standin for his famous 
lookalike during marcos successful 196465 presidential campaign 
appearing at rallies and meetings where marcos was not expected to 
speak 
the best part he said was getting the table of his choice at 
the best restaurants and squiring marcos wife imelda the worst 
part was getting mistaken for marcos years later when marcos 
popularity plummeted 
quevenco no relation to the former president said a politician 
friend introduced him to marcos in 1964 during a political rally on 
negros island at the time marcos a senator was campaigning for 
the nationalist party nomination for president 
marcos went on to win the presidency on nov 9 1965 he held 
office until he was ousted and forced into exile in hawaii in a 
popular uprising in february 1986 
the first time we met we just looked at each other said 
quevenco marcos said you are a dead ringer for me 
for several months during the campaign quevenco passed himself 
off as marcos at social and political functions whenever the 
presidenttobe was tired or unable to attend because of schedule 
conflicts 
quevenco said he did not receive any money for his services 
at one appearance quevenco played his role so well that his 
aunt rushed to him and asked to sit beside the president 
auntie im not marcos quevenco said he told his befuddled 
relative who are you she responded im your nephew he 
replied 
during a visit to the marcos family in manila quevenco said 
marcos brother pacifico jokingly introduced him to marcos 
mother josefa as our illegitimate brother 
according to quevenco mrs marcos removed her glasses stared 
at him and asked by whom 
after marcos was elected president quevenco said he stopped 
being a standin preferring to run his insurance business in the 
town of silay 300 miles southeast of manila 
quevenco said his wife thelma was afraid of the risks to her 
husband if he continued to pose as the controversial president 
the resemblance was both a boon and a bane 
when he was doing well i was proud quevenco said but 
when he was doing badly i got the beating 
during one visit to manila quevenco and his friends showed up 
at the playboy club announced that the president had arrived and 
demanded that a table be cleared immediately 
the staff complied 
but in 1972 when marcos popularity was low quevenco said he 
was nearly lynched when student protesters spotted him on a manila 
street and began shouting its marcos its marcos 
i was afraid he said i ran down the street ducked into 
a department store got rid of my coat bought a pair of glasses 
and slipped away 
quevenco says he has fond memories of the former president who 
is now critically ill in hawaii and under us indictment in 
connection with his alleged theft of millions of dollars from the 
philippine treasury 
marcos successor corazon aquino has barred marcos from 
returning home 
quevenco said he is neutral on the issue

a defense consultant and a former navy 
engineer received 26month sentences today for their roles in a 
bribery scheme to obtain secret bid information to help two private 
companies obtain lucrative pentagon contracts 
consultant william a parkin 65 and former navy senior 
engineer stuart berlin 51 were also fined 25000 apiece by us 
district judge claude hilton for their roles in the scheme to help 
teledyne industries inc and hazeltine corp obtain contracts 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica acknowledged at the 
separate sentencing proceedings that both parkin and berlin had 
fully cooperated with the justice departments continuing 
investigation of pentagon procurement fraud 
but aronica said that the receipt of bribes by berlin is 
perhaps the most serious offense that a government official can 
commit it is a violation of the public trust it is a corruption 
that is motivated by nothing more than his own greed 
berlins defense attorney leonard greenbaum noted that berlin 
had actually received less than 5000 in the conspiracy because he 
was shortchanged at the outset by parkin and others 
berlin whose voice cracked during a brief statement to the 
judge called his crime the worst mistake that i ever made in my 
life 
aronica said that parkin played a key role in the bribery 
conspiracy because he dealt directly with the defense contractors 
aronica noted that parkin expected to obtain 272000 in illegal 
consulting fees to buy information from berlin that would help the 
two firms bid on government contracts 
parkins role as front man and the individual to whom the 
money was to be paid kept the conspiracy afloat aronica said 
nine days after sources say he tried to commit suicide with an 
overdose of sleeping pills parkin 65 pleaded guilty on march 27 
to charges he indirectly paid bribes to berlin for information to 
help his corporate clients get lucrative contracts 
after his guilty plea parkin was a star witness against two 
teledyne industries inc executives who were convicted in april of 
conspiracy in connection with the scheme to obtain inside 
information on a contract to provide radar test gear to the 
military 
berlin 51 also testified at the trial admitting that he took 
thousands of dollars of bribes from defense consultants in return 
for information that would help private companies bid on lucrative 
contracts 
parkin and berlin could have faced maximum possible sentences of 
25 years in prison fines up to 750000 for their crimes 
parkin himself a former navy employee admitted he took 50000 
bribes during a 10year period when he worked for the government 
before 1983 
the two pleaded guilty to participating in a bribery scheme with

state of bulgaria then spent 17 months in prison and two years in 
internal exile for resisting the change 
ismet ismailogllu was renamed ilko ilzev panov his right leg 
and back are scarred marks he says he suffered during a police 
attack for his resistance to the name change 
the two attending a human rights conference here are among 
hundreds of ethnic turks expelled last month by bulgaria for 
resisting an assimilation campaign 
the campaign went into force in 1984 it reportedly includes 
banning the use of the turkish language in public closing mosques 
and razing turkish cemeteries in short wiping out any trace of 
the moslem turkish minority 
now everyone has an identity card with a bulgarian name 
said a turkish delegate to the paris conference speaking on 
condition he not be named officially the turks no longer 
exist 
bulgaria is becoming a prime target at the monthlong conference 
on the human dimension the first of three such meetings mandated 
in january during a session of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
the united states and other countries are expected to demand 
that bulgaria account for what turkish foreign minister mesut 
yilmaz has called one of the gravest human rights violations of 
our time 
bulgaria has repeatedly denied charges it oppresses its turkish 
minority estimated to number 900000 to 15 million in a total 
population of 9 million president todor zhivkov said such reports 
are a campaign of slander concocted by turkey and western 
groups 
the plight of ethnic turks in bulgaria has been gaining 
attention since early may when unrest over the assimilation 
campaign broke out official bulgarian reports say three people 
died last weekend in clashes but reports from deported ethnic 
turks put the death toll at about 30 
amnesty international says about 100 ethnic turks have died 
since the assimilation campaign began 
six expelled bulgarian turks are attending the paris conference 
they are demanding that bulgaria restore the rights of ethnic turks 
to practice their cultural heritage or at least allow them to 
freely leave the country 
habib ibisoglu a former member of parliament from the port city 
of varna said he left bulgaria as a tourist in 1986 and never 
returned 
i wanted to speak of turkish problems in bulgaria and they 
wouldnt let me he said i left to speak on the outside 
mumin gencoglu president of the federation of balkan turks and 
associations for emigres and refugees says various turkish groups 
took in about 500 expelled bulgarian turks in may those expelled 
often arrive in turkey without money possessions or family 
bulgaria is my country but i wasnt happy there miss 
ibrahimoglu said in an interview bulgaria was for me like an 
artificial mother it wasnt my real mother i was a secondclass 
citizen 
miss ibrahimoglu 30 a language student from the village of 
kliment near the northeastern town of shumen said she was given a 
new name and identity card on march 12 1985 
i wanted to leave bulgaria after this she said through an 
interpreter arrested in bucharest romania in front of the turkish 
embassy she was returned home tried for leaving the country 
illegally and sentenced to prison in sliven 
we worked the food was terrible and when they caught me 
speaking turkish with other women i was put alone in a cell she 
said 
she then spent two years in internal exile in a town 250 miles 
from her village when the two years were up she joined a human 
rights group which she says was the reason she was expelled feb 3 
she now lives in turkey with her mother and brother who were 
permitted to leave with her 
ismet ismailogllu expelled may 25 raises the leg of his pants 
to show fresh wounds from what he says are the jaws of a police 
dog other marks run down his back the remnants of a beating he 
says he received may 22 when military police raided his district in 
kurdzhali in southern bulgaria 
ismailogllu 35 who worked as an accountant at a government 
cooperative was secretary of a solidarity and human rights group 
for ethnic turks 
all the members of the association were beaten he said 
after the raid they were forbidden to leave their homes so we 
didnt even know if someone next door was dead or alive 
i will try now to love turkey as my country he said

jim wright will lose a number of privileges 
when he steps down next week as house speaker but one benefit will 
remain intact his pension 
gone will be the access to limousine service gone will be the 
use of a separate staff the texas democrat however can expect to 
receive a handsome pension for as long as he lives 
the annual pension is based on an average of the lawmakers 
three highest salaries multiplied by 25 percent and then 
multiplied by his years of service 34 in wrights case according 
to the house clerks office 
although wright plans to resign as speaker on tuesday but not 
give up his house seat until later this month the difference of a 
few weeks will have little effect on his pension 
the national committee on public employee pension systems 
estimated that wrights average salary was 108333 and his pension 
in the first year will be 86666 the committee calculation is 
based on a maximum pension of 80 percent of the average salary but 
it could go higher under the house clerks formula which says it 
can be up to 80 percent of the last salary which in wrights case 
was 115000 a year 
if wright lives another 17 years which the committee based on 
the 1988 life insurance fact book he would receive a cumulative 
total of 147 million factoring in a costofliving increase of 5 
percent the cumulative pension will be 224 million 
the office of personnel management will handle the pension 
though his pension wont be effected by the few weeks wright is 
just a member of the house rather than its speaker his life 
insurance coverage is based on his salary which drops from 
115000 to 89500 
but the change will likely be minor since wrights time as 
simply a house member will be less than a month said michael 
mccauley of congress watch a public interest group 
wrights health insurance is not tied to his salary and wont be 
affected

the manufacturer of alar announced today it is 
taking the chemical off the market immediately in this country 
because of the furor over its use in apple products and public 
concern about its health effects 
in announcing the decision the uniroyal chemical co insisted 
that the chemical is safe but said it has become the focus of a 
needless controversy that is severely harming the apple industry 
and causing doubt and confusion about the safety of americas 
food supply 
the environmental protection agency has concluded that 
daminozide as the chemical is technically called causes cancer 
and earlier this year urged that it be taken off the market 
alar is a growth regulator that enhances the appearance of 
apples and increases their shelf life the epa estimates that it is 
being used on 5 percent to 15 percent of the apple crop 
apple growers applauded the decision by uniroyal 
this action is most welcomed since it will allay any 
remaining concerns consumers may have about small levels of alar in 
apples and apple products said larry davenport executive 
director of the processed apples institute 
the apple industry in recent months has urged that alar be taken 
off the market because concern about its use has caused sharp drops 
in apple and apple product sales 
james a wylie vice president and general manager of uniroyal 
chemical told a news conference that its customers who have 
purchased alar are being notified that they may return the product 
and be reimbursed 
the decision applies only to us sales of the chemical it 
would not effect uniroyals sale of alar outside the united states 
including in some countries such as chile whose apple products are 
exported to the united states 
daminozide is a safe product it has been used safely for 20 
years and with great benefit to american consumers said wylie 
he accused critics of alars use as waging a fear campaign that 
has no justification 
the chemical has become the focus of a needless controversy 
that is causing doubt and confusion about the safety of americas 
food supply a needless controversy that is hurting the apple 
industry and the american public said wylie 
many growers have stopped using the product since concern about 
it health effects gained widepread attention earlier this year 
wylie although not providing any specific production figures said 
sales of alar in the united states have dropped as much as 75 
percent 
earlier this year a report by the natural resources defense 
council a private environmental group concluded that young 
children are particularly at risk from alar and a variety of 
pesticides used on fruits and vegetables because they consume large 
amounts of apple products other fruits and vegetables 
although government officials maintained that levels of alar in 
apples are safe many parents questioned whether they should 
continue to provide apple products to their youngsters school 
districts in a number of major cities for a time stopped providing 
apples in school lunch rooms 
janet hathaway an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the uniroyal decision represents a capitulation to 
public opinion but that consumers could continue to be exposed to 
the chemical because it will continue to be sold outside the united 
states including in countries that export apple products to the 
united states

iraqi troops have resumed the forced 
evacuation of thousands of ethnic kurds a kurdish rebel leader 
said today calling for international help to stop the relocations 
all 10000 people who live in the northern iraqi town of 
twasoran were forcibly evacuated by iraqi troops on wednesday 
according to a statement attributed to guerrilla leader masoud 
barzani and read to the associated press by a spokesman who 
insisted on anonymity 
on thursday iraqi government troops supported by tanks entered 
the town of qala diza to begin its enforced evacuation but the 
people resisted the deportation order and went on a general 
strike the statement added 
the whole region is now in a state of high tension and we 
feel that the army will massacre the civilian population it said 
worldwide criticism earlier this year apparently forced the 
iraqi government to announce it was shelving a plan to forcibly 
move the kurdish population from qala diza and nearby villages to 
crush the protracted kurdish struggle for autonomy or independence 
the baghdad government originally had set april 25 as the 
deadline for moving the kurds out of qala diza 15 miles west of 
the iranian border before razing the city 
the same kurdish spokesman said last month the iraqi authorities 
had distributed leaflets and forms to the kurdish population of the 
region saying they would be transported to unknown destinations 
within 20 days 
the tough kurdish warriors known as peshmerga or those who 
face death were supported by iran during the war with iraq and 
managed to seize control of large areas of their rugged mountain 
homeland 
but the iraqi army has cracked down heavily on them since the 
aug 20 ceasefire in the persian gulf war in a bid to crush the 
rebellion 
the scale of the new displacement program is alarming as it 
involves the destruction of the remaining rural district towns in 
kurdistan and the forced resettlement of nearly 300000 people 
said the barzani statement 
it added that the affected people will be interned in camps 
and towns located outside traditional kurdish areas in southern 
iraq 
we appeal in the name of humanity to the un 
secretarygeneral governments and national and international 
organisations to intervene 
an estimated 500000 kurds have been forcibly moved from their 
mountain villages within the past three years mostly to tent camps 
in the sweltering southern desert near the kuwaiti and jordanian 
borders diplomats reported 
more than 4000 kurds were killed last year in an iraqi poison 
gas attack on the city of halabja an incident that caused an 
estimated 100000 kurds to flee to neighboring turkey and iran 
as many as 3000 villages have been razed in an effort to cut 
off the guerrillas from their supporters the diplomats added 
iraqi officials admit they have carried out largescale 
relocations among the kurds but they deny kurdish claims of 
genocide and have said the moves were for security reasons and to 
provide the kurds with modern homes 
there was no comment on todays report by officials in baghdad 
but iraqs ambassador to paris abdul razzek alhashemi denied 
kurds were being forcibly evicted from their villages the official 
kuwait news agency reported today 
kuna monitored in nicosia quoted the envoy as saying all 
people in villages along the iranian border were asked to move to 
more secure areas he said kurds are being resettled in model 
villages within their autonomous area and are not being moved to 
other districts of the country the agency said 
the kurds who have been fighting the baghdad government for 
decades recently formed an alliance known as the iraqi kurdistan 
front to unite six groups barzani signed his appeal on behalf of 
this front the spokesman said 
there are about 20 million kurds living mainly in iran iraq and 
turkey with small pockets in syria and the soviet union

something was very fishy when the boxes said 
it was orange roughy and government inspectors said it was mere 
smooth oreo dory 
the food bank that got it for free just said thanks 
the justice department acting under orders from us district 
judge paul a simmons turned over 248 cases or about three tons 
of frozen fish fillets to the greater pittsburgh community food 
bank on thursday 
acting us attorney charles d sheehy said the fish was seized 
by us marshals april 3 because it was mislabeled as expensive 
orange roughy when it was actually lessexpensive smooth oreo dory 
he said the two fish look and taste alike 
assistant us attorney amy reynolds hay said food and drug 
administration agents were tipped in march that the mislabeled fish 
was being stored for an unidentified shipper at the new federal 
cold storage warehouse in pittsburgh she said it arrived feb 10 
government officials filed a civil forfeiture complaint against 
the shipment on march 30 charging that the fish had been 
mislabeled in interstate commerce a violation of the federal food 
drug and cosmetic act 
when no one claimed the fish simmons ordered it forfeited to 
the government and donated to a food bank officials said 
sheehy said the mckeesportbased food bank supplies nearly 300 
food pantries shelters soup kitchens homedelivery programs and 
community sites in allegheny county 
sheehy said new federal cold storage waived its charges when it 
learned the fish was being donated to charity

chinas most prominent dissident astrophysicist 
fang lizhi said friday he believes conservatives soon will crack 
down on liberal intellectuals and possibly arrest him 
but fang said he believes six weeks of prodemocracy protests 
will benefit china for the first time students 
intellectuals and ordinary people know they have the right to 
criticize the government the scientist said in an interview 
before the demonstrations for a freer society began in 
midapril only a few chinese dared criticize the communist 
government publicly fang led the way with scathing remarks about 
marxism and calls for democratic change in this oneparty state 
his outspoken criticism resulted in his purge from the communist 
party in early 1987 during a campaign against bourgeois 
liberalization or support for western liberal ideals 
he upset chinese leaders so much that they prevented him from 
attending a banquet given by president bush during his trip to 
beijing in february 
chinese conservatives led by senior leader deng xiaoping again 
have called for a fight against bourgeois liberalization in 
their power struggle with moderates which broke out as a result of 
the protests 
deng and some other leaders always want to crack down on 
liberal intellectuals fang said he said he did not know of any 
arrests yet but estimated theres a 50 percent chance hell be 
jailed 
fang said he has kept a low profile to prevent the government 
from accusing him of being behind the protests which led to the 
imposition of martial law in beijing 
last month government spokesman yuan mu questioned fangs 
patriotism and said the role mr fang wants to play in the 
current disturbances will be decided by his words and deeds 
an effigy of fang marked with the word traitor was torched 
at a government rally wednesday just outside beijing 
for me personally its a joke fang said the burning of 
the effigy failed to stir up the rally which quietly ended minutes 
later 
but the professor added that the tactics were reminiscent of the 
red guards who terrorized the country during much of the 196676 
cultural revolution 
if society keeps quiet orderly and nonviolent i think 
im safe fang said if the government organizes some chaos 
like the red guards then im in danger 
fang believes that although conservative leaders want a strong 
crackdown there is little support for such a move even among 
rankandfile party members 
fang believes china will benefit from the uprising despite the 
apparent ascendancy of hardliners in the power struggle he drew an 
analogy with poland where martial law could not quash the 
solidarity trade union 
the people dont believe in deng he already lost his face 
fang said 
the demonstrations show that chinese believe they are entitled 
to rights such as a free press and freedom of speech fang said 
while marxist orthodoxy demands the communist party guide the 
people there is now a widespread feeling that government must 
serve the people he added 
we need the older generation of the leadership gone like 
deng fang said if they leave the situation will be better 
it means more democracy

the greek orthodox church of cyprus lost 
spiritual treasures when four sixthcentury byzantine mosaics were 
removed from a church in northern cyprus a church abbot testified 
the mosaics are at the center of a legal battle pitting the 
church and the greek cypriot government against indianapolis art 
dealer peg goldberg who purchased them for 11 million last 
summer 
the church claims the early christian mosaics were ripped from 
the walls of the church and smuggled out of the troubled 
mediterranean island nation 
the church wants the mosaics back because they are our 
spiritual treasures abbot paul of macheras testified in us 
district court thursday the trial resumed today 
they were once put up on the wall and they were sanctified 
through the prayers and holy literature they are a part of our 
sacred life 
the bearded abbot wearing a flowing black headdress and robe 
and carrying a black staff topped with gold said the archbishop 
had never allowed the mosaics to be removed from the church of 
panagia kanakaria 
the church is in an area controlled by a turkish breakaway state 
recognized by no countries other than turkey most greek cypriots 
have left the area since it came under turkish control in 1974 
athanasis papageorghiou acting director of cypriot antiquities 
said the removal of the mosaics was part of a widespread pattern of 
looting in churches in northern cyprus 
judge james e noland accepted the pretrial deposition of 
ronald faulk a los angeles attorney who helped arrange the 
purchase of the mosaics in switzerland 
faulks deposition said aydin dikmen a turkish national living 
in germany agreed to sell the mosaics for 350000 
dikmen was paid 350000 and faulk received 80000 robert 
fitzgerald an indianapolis art dealer who brought goldberg into 
the deal got the remaining 650000 said faulk who represents 
fitzgerald 
fitzgerald testified today that goldberg obtained a bank loan of 
12 million to buy the mosaics and he was paid 300000 for his 
role in the deal in addition he will receive almost a quarter of 
the profits if goldberg is allowed to sell the mosaics he said 
goldbergs bill of sale listed a purchase price of 1080000 
according to court records 
the mosaics pieced together by an unknown artist about 525 
ad are representations of christ as a boy the apostles james 
and matthew and an archangel 
they are among only a handful of byzantine icons surviving from 
the first centuries of christianity experts say 
goldberg has offered to sell the mosaics for 20 million to the 
j paul getty museum in malibu calif

canadas reported aids cases have passed 2700 as 
it prepares to hold the fifth annual world conference on the fatal 
disease 
although the number is a fraction of the 94000 in the united 
states the much smaller population of 26 million puts canada in 
the upper tier of countries on a per capita basis 
leaders of aids community groups in major cities contend that 
years after acquired immune deficiency syndrome became known the 
federal government still has not developed a a coherent national 
strategy 
were now in 1989 weve known about aids since 1982 said 
richard burzysnki executive director of the canadian aids society 
we should have been planning years ago 
the fifth international conference on aids runs from sunday 
through next friday in montreal and will bring together more than 
10000 scientific government and community leaders last years 
meeting was in stockholm sweden 
canadas federal policy for civil servants announced in may was 
presented as an example of how the government can act effectively 
it includes confidentiality and a statement that people with the 
disease are not health risks to others under normal working 
conditions 
the toronto globe and mail called the policy a triumph of 
common sense it said health minister perrin beatty acted not 
merely to soothe a lobby group but because to do nothing would 
amount to setting off a ticking bomb 
in canada the number of reported aids cases reached 2736 at 
the end of may and 1564 of the victims had died according to the 
federal center for aids the center says the total of cases is 
doubling every 18 months and unofficial estimates put the number 
of canadians infected at 50000 
just five years ago the number of cases was 331 and 283 had 
died 
burzysnki whose organization lobbies in ottawa for 39 aids 
community groups across the country said much of the 
responsibility for health and education rests with provincial 
governments 
he said the efforts vary widely and what is needed from the 
federal government is the political will to galvanize the 
diverse levels and groups into an effective campaign 
margaret duckett an aids expert at mcgill universitys center 
for medicine ethics and the law in montreal said providing 
information on how to prevent the disease is not enough 
you need a range of messages and you need people talking 
onetoone she said in that theres been relatively little 
occurring in canada 
nearly 90 percent of aids cases are in ontario quebec and 
british columbia which have canadas largest cities toronto 
montreal and vancouver 
about 81 percent of the known cases are attributed to a risk 
factor of homosexual and bisexual activity 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring 
dr alastair clayton director of the federal center for aids 
said the government has tried to promote educational programs and 
finance community groups needed to carry them out 
theres never enough money to do all the things one wants 
he said by telephone from ottawa my job is to try to balance the 
funding 
a fiveyear budget of 167 million 139 million us beginning 
in 1986 is divided among education support for community groups 
research and health and social services 
canada isnt much of an example the countrys record is 
pretty abysmal said tim mccaskell of aids action now which led 
a campaign for more liberal licensing of drugs for the disease 
national health insurance covers everyone but does not include 
medicine housing or the other living costs that can accumulate 
rapidly for aids victims 
people with aids become poor very fast said stephen 
manning executive director of the aids committee of toronto 
his organization has new quarters a fulltime staff of 25 and a 
budget of 13 million 1 million us about threequarters of 
the money in grants from various levels of government 
it started six years ago above a poultry store

seven brothers who struggled to remain 
together after their mother died and their father abandoned them 
will be given their grandfathers farm as a result of a probate 
agreement 
the agreement filed in hall county probate court last week 
provides the 74acre farm of cecil okelley in tadmore to the 
seven grandsons 
a problem arose when okelleys widow mary evelyn filed last 
year for 16000 in support from her husbands estate when 
okelley died in 1985 he left an overdrawn checking account and an 
overdue note on the land so there was no way to pay mrs okelley 
without selling the farm 
the agreement sells the farm to a trust fund set up for the 
seven okelley brothers by benefactors touched by their plight the 
fund which has exceeded 100000 will make back payments and will 
provide 4000 to mrs okelley 
the boys mother died in 1983 of a brain tumor telling the 
oldest terry okelley that her last wish was for the brothers to 
remain together 
they stayed with their grandfather until his death left them in 
the hands of thomas okelley their alcoholic father he stripped 
the farm of its chicken houses and lumber then left and was 
convicted of abandonment 
the brothers then aged from 17 to 7 tried to tough it out 
alone on the ranch but lost all they had when the converted trailer 
they lived in burned 
benefactors built a fourbedroom house for the boys and an 
anonymous donor gave property next to their farm a chicken house 
on that land later burned killing 3500 birds investigators 
blamed arsonists but no arrests were made 
terry okelley now 21 lives with his wife and infant son in a 
house on the donated chicken farm he works in a carpet mill 
two boys live in the house that was built for the brothers two 
live with relatives and the youngest two are in a boarding school 
in rome ga 
terry okelley remains the legal guardian for his brothers who 
still are minors

the senate picked its way today through a 33 
billion bill aimed at financing agencies whose treasuries are 
running dry but also toting provisions spreading federal largess 
to lawmakers pet projects 
as they finished work on the bill for the week senators voted 
by voice to allow the shipment of up to 12 million in food aid to 
haiti 
most forms of us assistance to the caribbean nation have been 
prohibited by law because of human rights abuses in the country 
but sen bob graham dfla the provisions sponsor said 
resumption of aid would be a recognition of progress that has 
been made by the haitian government 
on a voice vote the senate added a provision urging the 
agriculture department to buy more apples to help sagging sales 
caused by findings that alar a growth enhancer sprayed on some 
apples can cause cancer the measure was sponsored by sens brock 
adams dwash and slade gorton rwash whose home state is one 
of the nations leading apple producers 
senate leaders had hoped to complete work on the measure 
thursday and begin negotiations next week with the house which has 
already approved a 37 billion rendition of the bill the 
legislation covers the final four months of fiscal 1989 
but the senate spent much of its nearly 14 hours of work 
thursday debating an assortment of amendments aimed at boosting 
federal antidrug initiatives by as much as 18 billion all of 
them failed by wide margins as lawmakers heeded bush administration 
warnings that inclusion of the drug funds would pump up the federal 
deficit and could spark a veto of the entire bill 
when are we going to end this effort to pile more money into 
this bill for drugs a frustrated senate appropriations chairman

remembering numbers is a piece of pi for 
srinivasan mahadevan 
mahadevans extraordinary memory has allowed him to memorize the 
first 35000 digits of pi the theoretically infinite computation 
of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter 
mahadevan a graduate student at kansas state university in 
manhattan is trying to become the fourth person to remember the 
first 100000 digits of pi and is the subject of a 157000 federal 
study at kansas state university 
researchers hope to find out how mahadevans amazing memory 
works the answer may shed light on how other people remember 
things 
were hoping to find insights into the average intelligence 
too said rod vogl a graduate assistant in charge of 
administering tests 
four students with average memories are being studied as a 
control group they can usually remember seven to eight numbers 
that are flashed quickly on a screen or spoken anything above 10 
is considered exceptional mahadevan typically tallies about 38 if 
he sees the numbers about 50 if hears them 
thats under clinical conditions vogl says mahadevan usually 
scores much better as many as 105 in the less inhibiting 
atmosphere of the local watering holes where he has been known to 
win some astounding bar bets 
the 30yearold native of mangalore india thinks heredity and 
his childhood environment both played significant roles my 
father knows all 37 plays and 150 sonnets of william shakespeare by 
heart so i think there is a genetic basis for it 
only three cases of the ability to remember 100000 digits of pi 
have been documented in 200 years one of those people became 
insane when he became unable to forget anything and his reasoning 
processes drowned in a flood of facts

ohio republican rep donald e lukens said 
today that despite calls for his resignation by gop leaders he 
will stay in congress while he appeals his conviction a week ago of 
having sex with a 16yearold girl 
if i have caused pain and embarrassment to my family friends 
or supporters i apologize lukens said in a statement released 
at his capitol hill office but i refuse to allow the lies and 
deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin me i am now fighting 
for my life 
lukens statement contended his accuser had a 10year record 
of psychological problems and illegal activity but the court 
refused to listen to the evidence 
my legal counselors assure me that prospects for a reversal in 
my case are excellent only at that time will i make my final 
decision regarding any future political activity he said 
lukens 58 was convicted may 26 of a misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor following 
a fiveday trial in franklin county domestic relations court a 
jury found lukens guilty of having sex with a girl at his columbus 
apartment nov 6 when she was 16 
ohio republican party chairman robert bennett and gop leaders 
from lukens home district on thursday urged lukens to resign from 
congress and from the republican state committee 
meanwhile a columbus television station reported thursday that 
a teenage girl said she also had sex with lukens in 1985 when she 
was 15 
wsyxtv said the girl identified only as paris had been 
sought by the grand jury to testify in lukens case but was not 
found the station said lukens paid the girl for sex on five or six 
occasions 
franklin county prosecutor michael miller told the ap the girl 
interviewed on television had refused to cooperate with the 
investigation that led to the charges against lukens he said he 
didnt plan to reopen the investigation 
a conviction of a misdemeanor does not prohibit a congressman 
from remaining in office or seeking reelection 
but state gop chairman bennett said he informed lukens office 
thursday that he will not be on the partys ticket in 1990 he said 
he spoke with lukens wednesday night and conferred with party 
leaders in the congressmans western ohio district before making 
the decision 
i think he is a bad apple for the republican party bennett 
said he has lost the support of the entire republican leadership 
of his district 
don birgel chairman of the butler county gop in lukens 
district said lukens should resign because a party is known by 
the leaders it keeps 
lukens wasnt bitter at party leaders but doesnt plan to take 
their advice said william jarrell lukens chief of staff 
this is a move where the party distances itself from 
lukens they have their own pressures they have to react to 
jarrell said congressman lukens came into politics as as a 
fighter and right now he is fighting for his life

sousuke uno became japans new prime minister 
friday and pledged to make a clean start after months of a 
bribery scandal that shook the establishment and soiled the image 
of the governing liberal democratic party 
parliament approved uno early in the day ending the partys 
fiveweek search for someone unblemished by the scandal in which 
recruit co is accused of trying to buy influence with cutprice 
stock and huge campaign donations 
he had been foreign minister and replaces noboru takeshita who 
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal 
in a suggestion of a tougher line on trade policy uno told 
reporters the american use of threats to gain trade concessions 
from japan was like negotiating with your fists up 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said however that 
the new administration would practice consistency and 
continuity in foreign policy 
uno 66 said political reform would be his first priority 
his party in power since it was formed in 1955 has sunk to an 
alltime low in opinion polls because of the scandal it needs a 
boost before elections this summer for half the upper house but 
unos initial appointments were unlikely to provide one 
ryutaro hashimoto his choice for party secretarygeneral told 
reporters friday he had received 24 million yen 17000 in 
198586 from recruit co a data and publishing conglomerate 
his new chief cabinet secretary masajuro shiokawa said he had 
given a blank signed receipt to another liberal democrat who 
divided a large donation from recruit among several such receipts 
to get around reporting requirements 
analysts said the appointments indicated a continuation of 
takeshitas policies 
at least six ministers in the 20member government that uno 
installed friday are carryovers from takeshitas cabinet and 
several others served in previous administrations 
the cabinet appeared to be carefully balanced among the various 
liberal democratic factions despite a reform committees 
recommendation that the faction system be abolished 
factional divisions within the party based more on personal and 
financial allegiances than political philosophy are widely blamed 
for creating the competition for funds that led to the scandal 
at a news conference uno rejected opposition demands for a 
general election and said as head of the party id like to 
devote myself entirely to the party and political reforms 
he said the scandal has had a dramatic effect on our party i 
would like to take this opportunity to reflect on this development 
so we can make a clean start in politics and regain the confidence 
of the people 
money that party members improperly received from recruit will 
be returned to the people he said but did not indicate how that 
would be done 
of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cutrate 
stock offered by recruit 13 were liberal democrats 
uno is said to have avoided involvement in the scandal in part 
because he was not an aggressive fundraiser 
opposition leaders and some liberal democrats criticized the 
choice of uno because he belongs to the party faction of former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone during whose administration in 
198287 the recruit scandal developed 
nakasone has resigned from the party but retained his seat in 
parliament and analysts expect his influence to continue 
uno is from shiga prefecture in western japan where his family 
owns a brewery stores in tokyo have begun promoting uno honke a 
family brand of rice wine and report brisk sales

attorney general richard thornburgh said today 
that any justice department employees found to have leaked 
information about an investigation into the office of rep william 
gray dpa would face the risk of being fired 
they have no place in the department of justice thornburgh 
told the senate judiciary committee 
thornburgh came to capitol hill to discuss the role of the 
american bar association in the judicial selection process 
but chairman joseph biden ddel immediately asked thornburgh 
about a report that fbi agents visited gray concerning an 
investigation involving his office 
thornburgh said he has requested the no 2 man in the justice 
department edward dennis to investigate how the information 
reached the news media 
he will have available to him whatever resources are necessary 
to pursue these reports thornburgh said 
the attorney general said that if the perpetrators were 
discovered it was likely that they will be fired immediately 
thornburgh was critical of our friends in the news media for 
airing reports of the investigation he also said he wished that 
journalists would help find the leakers 
its extremely difficult to pursue these investigations 
without the cooperation of those in the news media he said i 
can say without fear of contradiction that if we did have the 
cooperation of the news media in these investigations every leaker 
in town would be gone before sundown 
thornburgh said it was possible that there may have been 
criminal conduct involved in unauthorized disclosures in the news 
media he did not elaborate on that theme 
prompted by biden thornburgh promised to report back to the 
judiciary committee on the results of the investigation and tell 
the panel what methods it had used to come up with its findings 
biden urged thornburgh to assign the investigative task to the 
departments office of professional responsibility 
he noted that dennis formerly was a us district attorney in 
philadelphia and said he would not advise putting mr dennis a 
fine honorable man in the position of having to investigate 
people he hired 
at one point in the proceedings thornburgh described the news 
media as aiders and abetters of unauthorized disclosures of 
sensitive information he told reporters in a hallway later 
though it was perhaps an illchosen word

northwest loggers spruced up more than 100 
logging trucks for a parade past the tony shops of seattles fifth 
avenue hoping to gain city dwellers support for an industry beset 
by environmental concerns 
the problem with loggers in washington state is we have this 
lumberjack image said bill pickell head of the washington 
contract loggers association you mention loggers are coming to 
town and you scare people to death were business people not 
big dumb oafs 
entire logging families turned out for todays parade with the 
children deputized to hand out ribbonbedecked douglas fir 
seedlings as the convoy rolled through downtown seattle 
drivers leaned on the airhorns as about 125 vehicles moved 
briskly down two lanes of the threelane avenue the trucks 
including log lumber firewood and chip haulers were cleaned and 
shined and adorned with signs such as support the timber 
industry and lumber for 17 million new homes 
several hundred people mostly passersby paused to watch the 
parade and were met on the sidewalks by timber supporters with 
leaflets placards and the free trees 
keep my dad off the street save his job read a sign 
carried by one teenage boy 
a logging equipment company pledged a flatbed truck bearing a 
log skidder a machine that drags cut logs to a loading area 
weyerhaeuser co the giant forest products concern said it was 
sending a truckload of lumber 
management of the regions forests has become an important 
issue as shown by the recent court fights to prevent logging in 
areas inhabited by northern spotted owls 
the loggers association which is helping sponsor the parade 
hopes to show urban residents that a threat to their industry is 
also a threat to seattles economy pickell said 
weve got to bring our story to the urban areas where the 
consumers are and the votes are pickell said the seattle area 
enjoys a quality of life which is permeated by the timber 
industry 
nearly 40000 people statewide worked in the lumber and wood 
products industry in 1987 said marc blegen a program coordinator 
with the state employment security department 
timber interests have vowed to fight federal lawsuits by 
environmentalists that would bar logging of old growth timber in 
areas inhabited by spotted owls the us fish and wildlife service 
has proposed that the owl be listed as a threatened species and 
some 165 timber sales on forest service lands in washington and 
oregon have been halted while the courts consider the issue 
the timber industry has accused environmentalists of spreading 
misinformation about the owl to halt all logging of the huge 
ancient trees 
john cloninger of the small town of startup has made a living in 
timber since 1946 and said hes watched it deteriorate and 
deteriorate now its gotten to be so that people cant make a 
living 
cloninger pledged two of his eight log trucks to the parade he 
said he wanted to show that loggers are regular folks with concerns 
about their livelihoods who have been given a bad rap as poor 
forest managers 
what a lot of people dont understand is that loggers are 
environmental people when i get loose from work i take my 
horses and go to the mountains

paul casella wants his mtv only with 
poetry 
with the production of his first poetry television videotape 
casella hopes to popularize poetry through ptv 
its a pretty blatant ripoff of music television which is so 
common now its an adjective unto itself casella said but 
poetry can be so cool it just doesnt get out anywhere 
casella 24 attending the writers workshop at the university of 
iowa is hoping that will change his 50minute ptv video which he 
spent four months putting together is a collection of 35 poems by 
15 other members of the graduate writers workshop 
as poetry is read words designs and images swirl onto the 
screen some poems are illustrated by videotape some show nothing 
but a closeup of the poet with different lighting projected in the 
background 
some of the poets puff on cigarettes others use profanity one 
reads in spanish 
casella who has an interest in cinematography designed most of 
the background graphics and lighting occasionally collaborating 
with the authors he said it only cost 162 to make the tape some 
of which was paid for by a grant 
mtv works because the music and the video complement each 
other you can sit back and watch he said here my biggest 
conflict is that its so easy to make an image look good its so 
easy to make it look interesting but you have to pay attention 
too i dont want to take away from the poems 
casellas ptv video went on sale this week for 10 at the 
prairie lights bookstore in iowa city it is scheduled for three 
airings this month on the universitys campus channel which can be 
seen in iowa city solon cedar rapids and north liberty 
casella has sent copies of the video to dartmouth cornell and 
colgate universities the university of chicago the university of 
californiasanta barbara and on michigan public television with 
hopes that they will air it 
the ptv idea was spawned in 1987 when casella then a student at 
dartmouth college won third place at the poetry film festival in 
san francisco with a 25minute blackandwhite video of readings 
from 16 companions 
for ptvs theme casella borrowed a quote from author kurt 
vonnegut who once taught at the iowa writers workshop were in 
great trouble now that television can tell stories better than we 
can 
diana beeson campus channel program director said ptv is one 
of the most original concepts in programming ive seen in a long 
long time 
poetry is a very intimate medium and so is television this is 
one of the things that makes ptv so engaging she said 
casella sent a copy to the arts and entertainment network 
brooke bailey johnson vice president of programming and 
production wrote back that ptv was an interesting and 
challenging concept but the networks schedule was set for 
198990 
casella who is already planning a sequel said he is reluctant 
to send the videotape to mtv because theyd edit the hell out of 
it

voters who gave the troubled rancho 
seco nuclear plant a reprieve last year decide next week whether 
the utility passed its probation or should be shut down 
critics of the ranch fearful of nuclear accidents and angry 
at a 400 million repair cost and rising utility bills want to 
close the 15yearold plant permanently but supporters say the 
plants bad days are over since it has gotten new management 
the managers of rancho seco acknowledge they face a difficult 
task in convincing the public the plant can operate safely and 
efficiently the greatest challenge we face today is 
perception says joseph firlit chief executive officer at rancho 
seco 
residents of sacramento county and parts of neighboring placer 
county will vote on the proposition tuesday though the vote is not 
binding on the municipal utility that owns rancho seco a majority 
of the utilitys elected board members have said they will follow 
the will of the people 
the nuclear industry fearful that closing one of the few 
publicly owned plants in the nation could strengthen the hand of 
critics of privately owned plants elsewhere have raised 580000 
to push for its continued operation oppoenents have raised 
111000 according to the latest campaign reports 
critics dismiss arguments that the plant has been transformed 
since the 1985 overcooling accident that caused a 27month outage 
weve spent enough on rancho seco and weve given it its 
chance says peter keat one of the municipal utility board 
members who favors the shutdown 
since its restart in april 1988 the plant has again been nagged 
by a series of mechanical problems that has shut it down or forced 
cutbacks in power production overall since restart the plant has 
run at about 47 percent of its operating capacity 
last june shortly after the restart voters narrowly granted 
the plant a probationary period allowing it to operate pending 
another vote this year 
continuing problems show the plant has flunked probation say 
representatives of campaign california an environmental group 
formed by assemblyman tom hayden and his wife jane fonda that has 
pushed for the plants closing 
plant spokesmen kerry shearer however says the plant has won 
praise from the nuclear regulatory commission for improvements 
since the accident and that the restart last year was one of the 
smoothest in the nuclear industry 
supporters also point to an offer from two companies involved 
with creating rancho seco bechtel power corp and babcock amp wilcox 
are seeking a contract from the municipal utility district under 
which they would share in management responsibilities and risk 
losing part of their fees if the plant runs poorly 
the campaign at times has strayed from the issues to items 
such as the driving records of workers for the campaign to keep 
rancho seco open and haydens protest against the vietnam war 20 
years ago 
a poll commissioned by the sacramento bee late last month 
indicated that 462 percent favored closing the plant 365 percent 
favored keeping it open and 174 percent hadnt formed an opinion 
the overcooling accident in december 1985 was the most serious 
of the many problems that have plagued the 913megawatt plant since 
it was built at a cost of about 375 million it opened in 1974 
the plants control room was rattled by a chorus of alarms as 
operators futilely fought to halt a rapid temperature drop in the 
nuclear reactor vessel 
federal investigators said a power outage to control room 
instruments and employee errors allowed the steel vessel to cool 
180 degrees in 24 minutes well beyond the 100degreesperhour 
limit designed to prevent cracking of the vessel and a leak of 
cooling water that could trigger a reactor meltdown 
the vessel did not crack but two workers were exposed to a low 
level of radiation and the plant vented a small amount of 
radioactive steam into the air the plant got new managers and 
stayed shut for more than two years until the utility convinced the 
nrc that it had sufficiently upgraded safety and employee training 
but critics of rancho seco calling it a costly and dangerous 
liability gathered enough signatures to put the measure on the 
local june 1988 ballot to permanently shut the plant which was 
narrowly defeated 
an alternate measure was put on the ballot by the utilitys 
governing board calling for the probation period instead of an 
outright shutdown that measure narrowly passed leading to the 
vote next week

consultant william l parkin and the 
former navy engineer he bribed were given 26month prison terms 
friday for illegally scheming to help two companies get lucrative 
pentagon contracts 
parkin 65 and stuart e berlin 51 were each fined 25000 
and ordered to serve two years of supervised probation following 
their release from prison they each could have received up to 25 
years in prison and fined 750000 
berlin who choked back sobs before us district judge claude 
hilton imposed the sentence said his crime was the worst mistake 
that i ever made in my life he added the last year has been a 
living hell for me 
the judge said both defendants who have cooperated with the 
justice departments operation ill wind investigation of 
pentagon procurement fraud since pleading guilty could serve their 
time in minimumsecurity prisons 
parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed berlin to 
provide secret navy bid information that would help teledyne 
industries inc and hazeltine corp of long island ny obtain 
lucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the pentagon 
berlin who admitted from the witness stand in april that he 
took thousands of dollars in bribes while he worked for the navy 
was sentenced for taking nearly 5000 in bribes in return for 
giving parkin the bid information 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica acknowledged that both 
men who had testified at the trial of two teledyne executives who 
were convicted for their roles in the conspiracy are cooperating 
with the justice departments investigation 
aronica said berlins receipt of bribes is perhaps the most 
serious offense that a government official can commit it is a 
violation of the public trust it is a corruption that is motivated 
by nothing more than his own greed 
parkins role as front man and the individual to whom money 
was paid kept the conspiracy afloat aronica said the prosecutor 
said corrupting of a public official is reprehensible especially 
for a former government official 
parkin himself a former navy employee admitted that he had 
taken 50000 in bribes over a 10year period when he worked for 
the defense department 
court documents indicate that after opening a private consulting 
business in 1983 parkin became the center of a massive bribery 
scheme involving efforts to trade and sell confidential pentagon 
information to help companies bid on contracts 
aronica told the judge that parkin arranged to be paid 272000 
in consulting fees from teledyne and hazeltine that he agreed to 
split with berlin and others to obtain confidential bid information 
defense attorney leonard greenbaum urged the judge to take into 
account that berlin received less than his share of the bribe money 
because he was shortchanged at the outset by parkin and fred 
lackner 
lackner a los angeles defense consultant is awaiting 
sentencing for his role as gobetween from parkin to berlin 
what he got was less than 5000 greenbaum said 
parkin and lackner agreed not to tell berlin the full amount of 
the money they were to split thereby arranging to take larger

the imperiled lenin shipyard where solidarity was born a union 
spokesman said friday 
barbara piaseckajohnson heir to the johnson amp johnson 
pharmaceutical fortune told shipyard officials and solidarity 
leader lech walesa on thursday that she intended to form a joint 
venture with the yard said piotr konopka walesas spokesman 
the government announced six months ago that it planned to close 
the yard because it was not profitable 
but walesa said the decision was politically motivated and 
promised to find a way to save the yard where solidarity was 
founded during a strike in 1980 the government said it would not 
block a plan to restructure the yard if financial support could be 
found 
under the joint venture the yard would continue to build ships 
with the goal of making a profit for mrs piaseckajohnson and the 
shipyard konopka said 
mrs piaseckajohnson said in a telephone interview that she was 
very pleased with the talks 
i think it is a good time to invest in poland said mrs 
piaseckajohnson who lives near princeton nj the shipyard has 
a great potential to produce wonderful ships and i thought it would 
be a great thing to do the shipyard workers are wonderful 
the partners would form an enterprise called the gdansk shipyard 
co ltd in which she would hold 55 percent of the shares and the 
shipyard 45 percent konopka said 
he said the enterprise plans to obtain the necessary guarantees 
to operate from the polish finance minister and begin operating on 
jan 1 
solidarity was formed in the shipyard after an 18day strike

an official newspaper exposed friday the 
27yearold secret of how soldiers killed a score of strikers in a 
blaze of gunfire secretly buried them and hid their bloodstains 
under a thick coat of cement 
recollections published by the youth newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda marked the anniversary of the 1962 strike over food 
shortages in the southern city of novocherkassk and for the first 
time officially confirmed rumors circulating for decades 
i heard the massive fire of submachine guns as a result of 
the use of firearms 22 or 24 people were killed including a boy 
of school age recalled the regions former assistant military 
commander retired lt gen matvey k shaposhnikov thirty people 
were wounded 
the next morning i found out that the dead were secretly 
buried he said shaposhnikov said he opposed the action and was 
kicked out of the communist party in 1968 for trying to expose it 
a simonov a teacher told the paper that after the massacre 
they tried to wash the blood from the square for a long time 
first with fire engines then other ways with brushes and at last 
called in a steamroller and laid a thick layer of pavement 
soviet officials long denied soviet dissidents and western 
sources reports of the massacre and their charges that at least 70 
people were killed 
komsomolskaya pravda displayed the story over half its back page 
with commentary from three legislators saying it is fitting to 
report on the bloodshed as the newly elected congress of peoples 
deputies meets 
the inaugural session of the first competitively elected soviet 
congress has included unprecedented criticism of the communist 
party and government and forced open discussion of such issues as 
the 1940 seizure of the baltic republics and recent ethnic violence 
in the caucasus republics 
in contrast to the secrecy surrounding the novocherkassk 
killings a national outcry followed the militarys violent 
dispersal of proindependence protesters in tbilisi georgia in 
april where 20 people were killed 
long lines for food and protests of official mismanagement 
caused the novocherkassk strike the paper said 
lines at the stores for meat and oil grew before your eyes 
it said 
but the more alarming the situation became the louder sounded 
the fanfare promises of rapid success and the rapid approach of 
communism 
nikita s khrushchev the soviet leader at the time denounced 
stalinism and eased his pervasive repression while promising rapid 
economic progress 
instead workers were faced with poor living conditions 
relatively high rents and nothing to buy in the stores 
finally they struck at the budenny locomotive factory the 
regional communist party chief identified in the paper only as 
basov arrived to calm them but ended up complaining to a meeting 
about how difficult his life was recalled factory engineer s 
yelkin 
hooligans began throwing bottles at him and we decided to get 
basov out of there we helped him slip out of a window and into a 
car 
strike organizers were arrested the next morning but other 
factories went on strike and the military was deployed with tanks 
and armored personnel carriers 
at the same time shaposhnikov recalled thousands of people 
waving red banners began marching in the city center they were 
halted and scattered by gunfire from soldiers 
komsomolskaya pravda said two senior moscow officials anastas 
mikoyan and fr kozol were dispatched to novocherkassk and 
organized the aug 14 trial of the most active strike organizers 
seven people were sentenced to be shot the newspaper said 
a review of those criminal cases a careful impassionate and 
just analysis of them is our obligation to the truth it 
concluded

unemployment fell slightly to 52 percent last 
month but job growth sputtered to a threeyear low the government 
said friday in a report laden with evidence of economic slowdown 
the labor department said civilian joblessness fell from aprils 
rate of 53 percent with a decline in the number of people looking 
for work offsetting an anemic expansion of nonfarm payrolls 
financial markets reacted favorably to the report which 
immediately renewed speculation among economists over whether the 
federal reserve is ready to relax its tight hold on credit in the 
face of a slowing economy 
are they going to ease on the basis of this report alone no 
i dont think so said lyle gramley chief economist for the 
mortgage bankers association and a former fed governor 
only 101000 new jobs were added to the economy last month the 
lowest monthly total since 84000 in march 1986 and well below the 
average monthly gain of 275000 jobs for 1987 and 1988 the average 
monthtomonth gain over the last three months has slipped to 
160000 
it suggests to us that were going to have either slow growth 
or no growth in the second half of the year said merrill lynch 
chief economist donald h straszheim this slowdown is not a 
statistical fluke it is an event 
this is a rather weak report on employment but i dont see any 
indications of recession said gramley 
the economy certainly does not appear to be headed nearterm 
for a recession said allen sinai of boston co economic advisers 
inc 
there was a bit of good news on inflation as average hourly 
earnings increased just 01 percent last month on a seasonally 
adjusted basis after shooting up more than 06 percent from march 
to april 
but coming on the heels of a report showing firstquarter unit 
labor costs rose 66 percent on an annual basis analysts said the 
encouraging wage data in the unemployment report was not enough 
evidence to say inflation was waning 
the slowdown in payroll expansion was essentially across the 
board with declines in the goodsproducing industries and gains on 
the serviceproducing side well below robust 1987 and 1988 averages 
construction payrolls fell by 14000 and manufacturing jobs by 
18000 according to the labor departments survey of business 
establishments overall the goodsproducing sector lost 33000 
jobs last month 
growth in the serviceproducing sector offset some of those 
losses but was sluggish nonetheless including the slowest 
monthtomonth gain in service jobs 65000 in six years 
wholesale trade added just 2000 jobs last month and retail 
trade 17000 while governments expanded their payrolls by 32000 
workers the government said 
the labor department said the average privatesector 
nonagricultural workweek fell 03 hours to 346 hours the average 
factory workweek also fell last month slipping 02 hours to 41 
hours while average overtime fell an equal amount to 38 hours 
those could be further signs of slowing growth but the labor 
department cautioned that they also could reflect adjustments from 
april when the data was skewered somewhat because formulas for 
seasonal influences did not take into account that easter holidays 
fell in march this year instead of april 
the unemployment rate declined despite such sluggish job growth 
because the government said there were 49000 fewer people in the 
civilian labor force last month the number of unemployed americans 
who were actively seeking jobs fell 151000 to 639 million last 
month 
the government said the number of parttime workers last month 
who wanted to work full time fell by about 300000 to 48 million 
declines in the unemployment rate were reported for both white 
and black adult men while joblessness soared among black women and 
black teenagers 
unemployment among white adult men fell from 4 percent to 36 
percent in may while the rate dropped among black men from 10 
percent to 94 percent 
for white women the unemployment rate last month was unchanged 
at 41 percent while for black women it shot up from 88 percent to 
95 percent 
unemployment for black teenagersclimbed from 262 percent to 
284 percent the rate among white teenagers was 112 percent 
down from 115 percent 
among hispanics unemployment dropped from 83 percent to 79 
percent said the government which does not provide a gender or 
age breakdown for hispanics 
a separate calculation that includes military personnel 
stationed in the united states put may unemployment at 51 percent 
down from 52 percent 
the report included a number of revisions to previous data 
because of several annual steps the department takes in an effort 
to increase the accuracy of its surveys those changes included a 
reduction of 595000 in the governments estimate of job growth in 
the last two years

a member of the senate armed services 
committee on friday suggested reducing us forces stationed in 
south korea and requiring the japanese to foot the full bill for 
keeping american troops in japan 
the united states can no longer sustain a disproportionate 
burden of maintaining a common defense for the free world said 
sen carl levin dmich he is chairman of the armed services 
subcommittee on conventional forces and alliance defense 
in an interview with reporters levin also proposed deferring 
the funds for construction of a new base in crotone italy to 
house the 401st tactical wing 
last year the united states accepted spains demands that the 
air force withdraw its 72 f16 jet fighter bombers approximately 
3600 troops and 600 civilians from torrejon de ardoz just east of 
madrid 
italy has agreed to provide a new home for the wing at a cost 
for the nato allies of about 830 million the united states is 
expected to pay about 26 million 
it makes pure common sense to defer the authorization and 
appropriation for a new base when it may turn out those troops are 
going to be gone from europe altogether levin said referring to 
president bushs proposal this week to cut nato and warsaw pact 
forces 
during the 40th anniversary meeting of the alliance bush 
proposed a ceiling of 275000 on us and soviet ground and air 
force personnel which would require a reduction of about 30000 
us troops and about 325000 soviet troops 
levin said he will make his proposals in the form of a sense 
of the senate resolution which reflects the senates sentiment 
but has no legal authority 
specifically levin is proposing that the bush administration 
discuss with south korea a timetable for a mutually acceptable 
partial reduction of our forces and a plan to replace the 
us commander who has operational control over korean forces with 
a south korean general 
the michigan democrat estimated that the more than 40000 us 
troops could be reduced to about 10000 
levin also suggested that japan pay the total cost for 
stationing us troops there and pick up part of the tab for basing 
troops elsewhere in asia currently japan pays for between 60 and 
70 percent of the total cost or about 25 billion levin said

gourmet ice cream king joey crugnale didnt see 
any future in chopped ham and pickle sandwiches 
old women called up and implored him to reconsider after a 
wearying morning of shopping they wanted to come in to baileys 
peel off their white gloves and have a dainty sandwich or a hot 
fudge sundae as they always had done 
but crugnale had made a fortune with a yuppie trendy gourmet 
ice cream chain called steves named for a chap crugnale had 
bought out and had begun a yuppie trendy gourmet pizza chain 
called bertuccis 
so he decided to ignore his older customers and apply the trendy 
formula to baileys a 116yearold chain of candy and ice cream 
stores that had invented the hot fudge sundae reportedly kept 
files on the preferences of prominent customers and supplied 
chocolates to three us presidents 
it didnt work as a sadderbutwiser crugnale himself admits 
now the chains new owners who bought him out last fall are 
trying to bring it back 
while he was owner in 1987 and 1988 crugnale eliminated the 
traditional sandwiches chopped ham and pickles peanut butter and 
bacon datenut bread and cream cheese he made the stores brighter 
airier more modern instead of dark and cool with mahogany and 
marble he fired many longtime employees 
joey crugnale he didnt like old things so he just threw 
them out said frank wyman jr a former baileys owner 
crugnale bought the seven stores and a candy factory in january 
1987 for a reported 15 million when he sold it 20 months later 
for an undisclosed price it was down to two stores both in the 
suburbs 
i think the company lost its focus and it became more of a 
luncheon stop as opposed to an oldfashioned candy store and ice 
cream parlor said one of the new owners michael mazzaferro 
we want to restore it to its roots 
while they are not ready for rapid expansion mazzaferro and his 
two brothers whose family has been in the candy business for 
decades said they hope soon to reopen stores in boston and 
cambridge perhaps through franchising 
baileys dates to the 1870s but its most famous history was 
written in this century sarah dow bookkeeper for founder john 
bailey took over his shop in 1900 when he retired and is credited 
with inventing the hot fudge sundae 
she put 6 ounces of ice cream in a fiveounce dish and poured 
1 ounces of hot fudge on top of it and it dripped down onto the 
silver dish wyman said with reverence beautiful concept 
beautiful product 
later baileys supplied mailorder chocolates to theodore 
roosevelt calvin coolidge and john f kennedy joe kennedy the 
late presidents father was one of those who kept his candy 
preferences on record at the flagship store at the edge of the 
boston common which had lost its lease and gone out of existence 
before crugnale bought the chain 
crugnale 37 who built steves ice cream from one store to a 
chain of 26 before selling out in 1983 says his experience before 
he bought baileys made him overconfident 
i thought i was superman i did steves i could do 
anything he said 
though humbled by his failure with baileys crugnale has 
bounced back by expanding bertuccis into a chain of 12 pizzerias 
in massachusetts and rhode island 
baileys was a mistake from the beginning he said but 
im not ashamed of it i learned a lot from it

a microfilm of secret protocols 
detailing how nazi germany and the soviet union colluded to seize 
poland and the baltic states has survived and is in west german 
archives officials said friday 
information minister hans klein told reporters the film has been 
inspected by two soviet historians investigating the soviet unions 
1940 annexation of estonia latvia and lithuania 
foreign ministry officials said the nazis destroyed documents 
deeding the baltic nations to the soviet union but that an 
unidentified diplomat saved a copy on microfilm 
on thursday the new soviet congress approved a kremlin inquiry 
into the nonaggression pact that paved the way for the takeover of 
the independent baltic states and the nazi invasion of poland 
independent groups challenging soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to prove the sincerity of his reforms are pressing the 
kremlin to admit it has been lying for more than 40 years with its 
claims that estonia latvia and lithuania willingly joined the 
soviet union 
gorbachev himself requested bonns help last fall when he met 
with chancellor helmut kohl and asked if the west germans had a 
copy of the secret protocols 
klein told reporters friday the original pact signed aug 23 
1939 by the wartime foreign ministers vyacheslav molotov and 
joachim von ribbentrop remains in bonns foreign ministry archives 
but the secret protocols detailing the baltic takeover and 
polish invasion were destroyed by nazi officials in the last days 
of world war ii klein said 
however a microfilm copy of this and other documents was 
preserved by a diplomat foreign ministry spokesman juergen 
chrobog said 
the officials said they do not know who preserved the microfilm 
or why 
its not just presumable we believe that it is authentic 
klein said i cannot imagine how or why anyone at that time would 
reproduce the documents and then make a microfilm of them 
klein said two soviet historians traveled to bonn a few weeks 
ago to examine the documents which include a map showing the 
territories divided between the two nations 
chrobog declined to detail the statements included in the secret 
protocols 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
said in moscow in august that the kremlin has no copy of the 
protocols 
the socalled molotovribbentrop agreement has come under close 
scrutiny over the past year as soviet reforms have allowed open 
discussion 
it freed german troops to attack poland in september 1939 the 
germans agreed not to defend the baltics to which they were 
closely allied leaving the soviets to seize eastern poland attack 
finland and then take the baltic states in july 1940

members of the washington apple industry 
applauded the decision by uniroyal chemical co to voluntarily 
withdraw alar from food use 
the middlebury conn company announced friday in washington 
dc that it would immediately remove the farm chemical labeled as 
a possible carcinogen until final test data is reviewed by the 
environmental protection agency and a final regulatory decision is 
reached 
they are darn late in getting to this point said john 
mcalister of tree top inc the nations largest apple juice maker 
weve been after them for a long time and consumer confidence has 
been affected 
we should be hopeful and expect this will be the beginning of 
restoring consumer confidence said mcalister whose company has 
suffered a sales drop of more than 20 percent since the alar 
controversy began in february 
ironically a strong stand against alar use was reportedly a 
major factor in the forced resignation of tree top president dennis 
colleran earlier this week colleran called for a ban on alar 
apparently angering some of the juice cooperatives growers who 
supported use of the growth regulator that enhances the appearance 
of apples 
sales of supermarket apples also have slumped dramatically 
costing growers an estimated 100 million nationwide this year 
it wont make any difference for this year but it certainly 
should help us as far as sales for next years crop is concerned 
said bill dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association which 
charts apple sales 
dewitt reported friday that outofstate apple shipments for the 
week ending thursday were down 22 percent from the week before 
but he said that was primarily due to a short work week caused 
by the memorial day holiday 
shipments totaled 863000 42pound boxes down from 11 million 
the week before during the same week last year shipments totaled 
964000 boxes 
of much greater concern to growers are the 12 million boxes left 
in storage including an unknown number of alartreated apples that 
retailers do not want 
the inventory is 33 million boxes above last year at this time 
alar the marketing name for daminozide was labeled a possible 
carcinogen by the private natural resources defense council in a 
february report the findings have been disputed by uniroyal and 
the federal government has pronounced apples safe to eat for the 
time being 
the epa was one of the agencies involved in pronouncing apples 
safe but in a separate action it said it plans to ban alar next 
year although pending tests could affect that decision

rep donald e buz lukens rebuffing calls 
for his resignation announced friday that he intends to stay in 
congress while he fights to overturn his conviction of having sex 
with a 16yearold girl 
i refuse to allow the lies and deceit of one delinquent 
individual to ruin me i am now fighting for my life the ohio 
republican said in a statement released by his office 
lukens 58 and divorced was convicted may 26 of contributing to 
the delinquency and unruliness of a minor a misdemeanor the 
franklin county ohio jury found him guilty of having sex with the 
girl at his columbus apartment last november 
lukens said in his statement that his accuser had fantasies of 
getting even with the establishment 
but the court refused to allow him to bring up evidence he 
wanted to present to raise doubts about her reliability the 
conservative lawmaker said 
my legal counselors assure me that prospects for a reversal in 
my case are excellent he said only at that time will i make 
my final decision regarding any future political activity he 
said 
vowing to prove his innocence he declared i am not a 
quitter 
lukens statement made no mention of a report thursday by a 
columbus television station that another teenage girl said she 
also had sex with lukens in 1985 when she was 15 the station said 
lukens paid the girl for sex on five or six occasions 
wsyxtv said the girl identified only as paris had been 
sought by the grand jury to testify in lukens case but was not 
found franklin county prosecutor michael miller told the 
associated press that the girl had refused to cooperate with the 
original investigation and he did not plan to reopen it 
conviction on the misdemeanor charge does not automatically 
preclude lukens from serving in the house or seeking reelection 
however ohio state gop chairman robert bennett said lukens will 
not be on the partys ticket in 1990 he said he informed lukens 
office on thursday night and spoke with lukens and party officials 
from his western ohio district before making that decision 
i think he is a bad apple for the republican party bennett 
said he has lost the support of the entire republican leadership 
of his district 
don birgel chairman of the butler county gop in lukens 
district said lukens should resign because a party is known by 
the leaders it keeps 
his case has come amid the current ethics storm on capitol hill 
and some republicans who have been using the ethics issue to beat 
up on democrats have expressed concern privately that his staying 
could hurt their efforts 
house republicans currently have no announced plans for taking 
up the matter in their conference nor has the house ethics 
committee announced an investigation 
lukens is currently in the second term of his second stint in 
congress he also was in congress for two terms from 1967 to 1971

the senate set its sights friday on finishing 
a 33 billion dire emergency spending bill next week after the 
legislation bogged down under a load of amendments 
in about three hours friday lawmakers worked their way through 
several noncontroversial amendments ranging from resuming food 
aid to haiti to financing university of wyoming research of last 
summers fires at yellowstone national park the session followed a 
nearly 14hour day thursday 
the senate then recessed until tuesday when it will consider 
several proposals likely to spark lengthy debate they include 
provisions delaying the start of catastrophic care programs for the 
elderly and repealing a tax law regulating employee benefit 
programs 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
has shown impatience with the pace of work on the bill after 
another senator thanked colleagues for coming to the floor for 
debate byrd responded thats where we ought to be were 
getting paid for it 
the socalled dire emergency spending bill first requested by 
president bush in march is designed to finance agencies running 
low on funds for fiscal 1989s final four months 
it includes 12 billion for costofliving benefit increases 
and health care for veterans 892 million for loans for college 
students and money for foster care food stamps the expenses of 
fighting last years western forest fires and other programs 
but as routinely happens with spending measures the legislation 
has attracted provisions that has little to do with programs 
running out of money and much to do with lawmakers seeing a chance 
to help their states or favorite causes 
thus the senate approved a provision friday urging the 
agriculture department to buy more apples to help an industry hurt 
by findings that alar a growth enhancer sprayed on the fruit can 
cause cancer the measure was sponsored by sens brock adams 
dwash and slade gorton rwash who represent one of the

a group backing independent status for puerto 
rico told a senate panel friday that changing the islands nearly 
100yearold relationship with the united states will be as 
delicate a procedure as major surgery 
i have sometimes compared this process to two siamese twins 
you just cant pull the machete and cut them apart you have to 
do very careful surgery which is what we are trying to do said 
ruben berrios martinez president of the puerto rican independence 
party 
thats why we refer to it as a transitory state said 
berrios who was testifying for the second day before the senate 
energy and natural resources committee which is considering 
legislation to provide the mechanism for a referendum allowing 
puerto ricos voters to decide the territorys future political and 
economic status 
the panel also heard testimoney from carlos romero barcelo 
president of the prostatehood new progressive party and 
commonwealth gov rafael hernandez colon 
the united states gained sovereignty over the island in 1898 
after the spanishamerican war and it became a us commonwealth 
in 1952 puerto ricans are us citizens who pay no us taxes and 
cannot vote for president but are eligible for military service 
the island gets about 6 billion in aid from the federal government 
annually 
the islands three major political parties have proposed 
maintaining its current status as a us commonwealth territory 
with enhanced authority becoming the nations 51st state or 
establishing an independent republic 
should the referendum results favor independence the prip has 
proposed that a joint transition commission composed of 
representatives from the us government and an independent puerto 
rico manage the orderly transfer of power 
it seems to me that the transition should be a puerto rican 
affair said d bennett johnston dla chairman of the senate 
panel 
however both johnston and the committees ranking republican 
james mcclure of idaho insisted that details on matters including 
citizenship migration taxation judicial jurisdiction of ongoing 
cases and election challenges defense trade currency finance 
and public debt must be worked out in advance of a proclamation of 
independence and subsequent constitutional convention proposed by 
the prip 
it is inconsistent with independence to have dual 
citizenship said johnston in response to another prip proposal 
fernando martin vice president of the independence party said 
such questions were very important political issues that 
congressional and party staffs would have to iron out to be 
included in any legislation on puerto ricos status 
mcclure said he was concerned that us military and security 
interests were guaranteed in any independence arrangement 
under independence your government could change we have 
to find a way in which we can make foreign military power denial a 
permanent part of any plan he said 
we ought to guarantee roosevelt roads for a period added 
johnston 
the roosevelt roads naval base on puerto rico is the largest in 
acreage in the world outside the continental united states 
the energy panel plans three days of public hearings on the 
island later this month to further fine tune its referendum 
legislation but johnston said thursday at least four other 
committees in the senate would have jurisdiction over various 
sections of any final bill

actor paul newman has beaten a 41000 tax 
bite on income from the sting 
newman won the tax dispute when the california supreme court 
rejected the states claim for a greater portion of newmans income 
from the movie 
newmans case involved a dispute over the definition of working 
days while filming the sting newman spent 30 days in 
california in 1973 25 of them filming and five on call and 24 
days outside california only two of them filming 
in their tax returns newman and his wife joanne woodward 
described 54 days as working days and apportioned 30 or 555 
percent to california but the tax board said only the 27 days of 
actual filming should count as working days and 25 of them or 
926 percent were attributed to california 
justice jack goertzen said in the decision that newman was 
required to report for work by his studio at any time during the 
period he was on call and could not take any conflicting jobs

his catchy televised campaign video makes 
fun of his ears and calls them disquieting 
its not your typical political message but former government 
spokesman jerzy urban a man poles love to hate is carrying out 
his fight for a parliament seat with his trademark style of 
combining irreverence selfmockery and sarcasm 
the point man for seven years in the governments propaganda 
campaign against the solidarity trade union urban was among the 
first polish officials to announce his candidacy in sundays 
elections for parliament and the new senate 
despite eight years of loyal service to the communist 
authorities justifying martial law and belittling lech walesa as 
the former head of a former union urban now information 
minister is running as an independent 
it is the kind of provocative behavior that irritates much of 
polands population but keeps people tuned in to see what he will 
do next 
facing urban for the warsaw seat is popular actor andrzej 
lapicki who has received solidaritys endorsement the opposition 
says its polls show lapicki ahead by 7to1 
but the outcome could be much different because of the large 
number of ballots expected to be cast by poles abroad whose votes 
all are counted in the district 
there are about 140000 eligible voters in the district itself 
and some 600000 abroad many may feel compelled to vote the 
government way because they work in embassies or as contract 
workers in communist or middle eastern countries 
poles got to know urban when as the governments spokesman he 
conducted weekly news conferences that were televised nationwide 
he was promoted to head state television and radio the day 
solidarity became legal again april 17 
in the early days of his campaign urban used coupons in 
official newspapers to collect the requisite 3000 nominating 
signatures angering the opposition he also managed to get letters 
printed and inserted into most mailboxes in his district 
his distinctive appearance makes him easily identifiable 
he is a small round man with a perfectly circular bald pate and 
distinctively large ears a humorous music video on urban that 
appeared on state tv which urban controls delighted in calling 
attention to his ears 
as a popular singer sang refrains of strange ears had he 
strange hears had he viewers could see urban as a child 
teenager and young man circles drawn around his ears on the 
photographs made them look even larger 
everyone knows who i am urban said at a campaign meeting 
with students 
the first few editions of the new opposition newspaper gazeta 
wyborcza contained so many articles concerning urban that one 
letter writer opposed to urban felt compelled to remind editors to 
avoid urbanophobia 
a longtime journalist and satirist who was associated with prime 
minister mieczyslaw rakowskis liberal party weekly polityka urban 
became government spokesman in 1981 he gave his first news 
conference the day martial law was imposed in december of that year 
as government spokesman urban frequently cited polling data 
showing more than half the population disapproved of him but that 
his news conferences were the highest rated weekly show on 
television 
ryszard straus a longtime aide in the government spokesmans 
office said urban believes polls showing him behind are 
exaggerated 
in a country where many of the rulers are gray and humorless 
urban stands out some argue that he is provocative to draw public 
ire that otherwise might be directed at others

the recruit scandal scuttled many careers and 
toppled a government but authorities said friday that the man 
first investigated for alleged participation will not face charges 
the yokohama district prosecutors office announced it will not 
indict hideki komatsu former deputy mayor of kawasaki on bribery 
charges kyodo news service and television reports said 
officials could not be reached for comment friday evening 
komatsu who was fired as deputy mayor two days after the asahi 
published its story also could not be reached 
the recruit scandal emerged last summer when the asahi shimbun 
newspaper reported that komatsu allegedly had bought stocks in a 
real estate firm before they were offered publicly and sold them at 
a huge profit after they were listed 
reporters were tipped off by police who said they were 
investigating komatsu 
he was sold stock in recruit cosmos a subsidiary of the 
conglomerate recruit co apparently to sweeten a land deal in 
kawasaki just south of tokyo

critics have dismissed it as trash tv tv 
tabloid journalism or mediainspired vigilantism 
but because of americas most wanted a suspect in the 
drugrelated tortureslaying of 12 persons in mexico was nabbed in 
arizona in april last month an escapee from a california jail 
charged with jewel theft and kidnapping was caught in rapid city 
sd 
and this week an 18year search for john e list wanted in 
connection with the shooting deaths of his mother wife and three 
children in westfield nj ended in richmond va after the case 
was featured on the fox television program on may 21 and prompted 
some 300 phonedin tips 
this ratings mainstay of the fledgling fox network has turned 22 
million sunday viewers into bloodhounds responding to televised 
mug shots and dramatized reenactments of crimes with up to 5000 
phonedin tips every week 
since americas most wanted first aired 15 months ago 79 of 
the 154 fugitives profiled have been captured and 48 were the 
direct result of viewer tips said michael linder the programs 
executive producer 
tv fare like this is a long way from the ed sullivan show 
the sunday sine qua non of a generation ago after 67 episodes 
americas most wanted has attracted both strong supporters and 
detractors 
citing the programs success in drawing attention to fugitives 
los angeles county officials last february began circulating 
descriptions and photographs of wanted criminals among all county 
employees 
the fbi despite initial skepticism is now a firm supporter of 
the tv program and has cooperated with producers on a number of 
cases including the list case 
the fbi has told us that there is no way to estimate the 
number of americans alive today because of americas most 
wanted said linder in an interview 
there is a benefit that goes beyond simply arresting 
fugitives these are among the nations most violent criminals 
capturing them means prevention of murders and other serious 
crimes he said 
the international association of chiefs of police in arlington 
va gave americas most wanted an excellence in media 
award last october 
but the american civil liberties union has raised questions 
about the programs fairness 
our worry is that the program portrays the actual crime prior 
to an indictment or conviction in a way that suggests guilt said 
colleen oconnor national director of public education it has 
the effect of validating the accusation that could preempt the 
right to a fair trial in some cases 
it would be one thing if the show only functioned like an 
electronic post office billboard she said but its quite 
another if the content of a program describes something as true 
that could be debatable 
linder said his show has not proven prejudicial to criminal 
defendants 
in every case that has gone to court local prosecutors and 
lawyers have been able to agree on juries that hadnt see 
americas most wanted he said 
others have questioned whether the program leads to neighbors 
snitching on neighbors causing authorities to harass innocent 
persons 
replied linder we tell our viewers they can call anonymously 
but fully 65 percent are willing to leave their numbers for 
followup by law enforcement investigators people are not using 
this show to bother their neighbors

gunmen tied up 17 sinhalese and shot 
them to death in a series of attacks nationwide that appeared to be 
orchestrated military officials said friday 
the bodies of eight young men their hands tied behind their 
backs were found thursday by workers at a plantation in the 
central sri lankan city of beragala the officials said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
beragala is 45 miles northeast of colombo 
four bodies were found thursday in the southern town of matara 
72 miles south of colombo and five bodies were found in kurunegala 
district 36 miles northeast of the capital they said 
they said all the men were killed in similar fashion but did not 
give details 
independent sources said the executions were carried out by 
progovernment vigilante groups that previously killed members of 
an antigovernment sinhalese extremist organization the sources 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the ultranationalist sinhalese militants are opposed to the 
governments peace overtures to tamil rebels who are fighting to 
set up an independent nation in the countrys northern and eastern 
areas 
meanwhile police in colombo fired tear gas shells friday to 
stop about 500 moslem demonstrators from marching to the indian 
high commission or embassy 
the marchers were protesting the alleged inaction of indian 
peacekeeping troops during clashes between moslems and tamil 
militants in eastern sri lanka last month at least 12 people died 
in the clashes 
the peacekeeping troops are stationed in the northern and 
eastern regions to enforce law and order under the terms of an 
indiabrokered peace accord of july 1987 that aimed to end the 
tamil rebellion 
tamils mostly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people and claim they are discriminated against by the 
buddhist sinhalese majority in jobs and education 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population and dominate the 
government and the military moslems make up 7 percent of the 
population 
the nearly 7yearold tamil separatist campaign has claimed more 
than 9000 lives at least 3500 people have died in the sinhalese 
backlash

gambling games have been sprouting like 
corn in iowa in less than a generation the state has launched 
highstakes bingo a lottery dog and horse racing and now 
riverboat gambling 
experts on gambling addictions say iowa will harvest a bumper 
crop of compulsive gamblers as a consequence 
theres no question some people are going to lead disastrous 
lives some families will be broken up some parents will cash in 
their individual retirement accounts said henry lesieur 
associate professor of sociology at st johns university in new 
york 
lesieur and other experts on compulsive gambling gathered in des 
moines this week for the states fourth annual conference on the 
subject all agreed that the number of problem gamblers is bound to 
increase as exposure to gambling increases 
in the early 1970s iowa law didnt permit gambling and the 
state attorney general made headlines by raiding the north buena 
vista church picnic and confiscating bingo paraphernalia since 
then the state has allowed high stakes bingo three parimutuel 
dog tracks and a horse racing track and staterun lotteries 
beginning in 1991 it will also allow casinostyle gambling on 
riverboats 
yes riverboat gambling will create jobs but these other 
things are going to happen too said lesieur 
the experts said pathological gamblers will find ways to lose 
money even if gambling is not legal but they also said that 
incidents of problem gambling accelerate when states promote 
gambling in the name of economic development 
if there was no legal gambling the problem would still be 
significant said david gardner spokesman for the atlantic city 
casino association but he said casino owners are realizing they 
have a role in helping prevent gambling addictions 
rachel volberg a researcher for the policy research associates 
said iowas rate of problem gamblers is less than half that of 
three eastern states where gambling has a much longer tradition 
but she said the rate will grow rapidly 
a survey of 750 adults in february she said showed that 17 
percent of iowans can be classified as problem or pathological 
gamblers that compares to 42 percent in new york and new jersey 
and 39 percent in maryland 
she said iowas rate was low because legalized gambling is 
relatively new it takes many years to develop into a problem 
gambler she said adding that studies show people who ask help to 
recover from compulsive gambling have been betting for an average 
of 23 years 
id say that if i came back in 15 years and did a prevalence 
test wed find the numbers had doubled said ms volberg 
im not an advocate of prohibition she said its not a 
question of pushing things back in pandoras box the vast majority 
of people do it in control and enjoy it

twelve blacks convicted of 
involvement in the mob killing of a black police officer were 
sentenced on friday to prison terms of up to eight years and parole 
fourteen defendants in the highly publicized case were sentenced 
last week to hang 
only one of the 26 defendants was found to have physically 
contributed to the death of officer lucas sethwala who was stoned 
and set on fire on nov 13 1985 in paballelo a black township 
outside upington in a remote area in northwestern south africa 
one defendant was convicted of attempted murder and the other 24 
of murder under the doctrine of common purpose which holds 
individuals responsible for the actions of a crowd if they are part 
of the group 
the day of the killing about 3000 blacks gathered on a soccer 
field in the township to protest rent increases and other actons by 
township authorities 
police dispersed the crowd and most went home peacefully about 
300 however regrouped and attacked sethwalas home according to 
testimony 
judge jan basson said the killing was politically motivated and 
part of a conspiracy to attack township authorities 
of the 12 people sentenced friday two were sentenced to eight 
years in prison and four to six years the others received 
suspended sentences 
defense lawyers have said they will appeal the case

a new biological technique should simplify the 
slow and difficult task of shifting genes between creatures and 
perhaps help scientists create healthier fastergrowing farm 
animals experts said friday 
if its true it will make life easier said dr richard 
hynes of massachusetts institute of technology 
the new method uses natures own gene carrier spermatozoa to 
piggyback foreign genes from one animal to another 
scientists at many labs have already become adept at shifting 
genes using other techniques and they have created animals with 
many unique properties never envisioned by nature 
such socalled transgenic animals may have many virtues 
engineered into them such as leaner meat resistance to disease 
and faster growth or they might produce human proteins in their 
milk for use as medicines 
in the new method sperm were incubated with foreign genetic 
material or dna in a test tube some of the sperm captured the 
foreign genes when these sperm fertilized eggs they passed along 
the hitchhiking genes which became part of the new animals 
permanent genetic code 
if sperm will really carry dna in it will make it easier than 
all the trouble we have to go through now to get genes in said 
hynes if it makes something easy that is now difficult then 
lots of people will do it 
the technique was developed by dr corrado spadafora of the 
institute of biomedical technology at the university of rome a 
report on the work was published in fridays issue of the journal 
cell based in cambridge mass 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal dr max birnstiel 
of the research institute of molecular pathology in vienna wrote 
that if confirmed by others this publication will be a 
cornerstone in biology 
experts said the work also suggests that sperm may be a natural 
point of entry for foreign genes this may help explain how 
genetically controlled traits could have passed between animals 
over the course of evolutionary change 
when used in mice researchers were able to transfer bacterial 
genes that produce an enzyme of 250 mice born from treated sperm 
30 percent showed the presence of the foreign genes 
the scientists checked for the mices ability to produce the 
bacterial enzyme and also found that the new genes appeared to be 
passed on to later generations of mice 
dr mario capecchi of the university of utah said that when used 
in lab mice the new technique is a lot simpler and cheaper but 
probably no more efficient than the current technique which 
involves microscopically injecting foreign genes into onecell 
embryos 
i dont think it will affect mouse biology but where it may 
have a big advance is where people are making transgenic domestic 
animals such as cows and sheep capecchi said 
he said the current methods dont work particularly well in 
these large animals and the new technique may be more effective 
although that has not been tested yet

house speaker jim wright relaxed in his office 
friday as other democratic leaders jockeyed for inside position in 
the race to move ahead in the power structure after wrights 
resignation takes effect 
hes taking calls he didnt have much time to take them 
yesterday said mark johnson the texas democrats press 
secretary 
wright who announced wednesday that he would step down as 
speaker upon selection of his successor spent thursday doing 
interviews with reporters 
he planned a relaxed weekend but planned to join the 
congressional delegation traveling to miami on sunday for a 
memorial service honoring rep claude pepper dfla who died this 
week 
wrights reign as speaker is expected to end tuesday the day a 
democratic caucus has been scheduled to nominate a new speaker 
almost certainly the current majority leader thomas s foley 
dwash 
republicans also planned to meet tuesday to nominate minority 
leader bob michel rill as speaker 
but there was no known opposition to foley among the democrats 
who hold a strong majority in the house and it was a given they 
will their own nominee rather than the republican nominee when the 
full house votes tuesday after the separate party caucuses 
even among republicans foley is wellliked and regarded as 
showing much more courtesy to the minority party than wright foley 
said this week he wanted to turn the house away from the partisan 
bitterness of the past few months and get legislators back to work 
legislating 
president bush returning from europe on air force one was 
asked friday about talk of a political war in the house 
i dont like it he replied 
but the president a former house member himself declined to 
offer advice on the new democratic leadership team the last 
thing they need is advice from the executive branch about how to 
proceed bush said 
while foley appears headed toward certain election several 
candidates are vying for the other democratic leadership slots the 
voting for those positions probably will take place no sooner than 
a week after next weeks speaker election 
reps richard gephardt dmo and ed jenkins dga are 
competing for foleys position of majority leader gephardt is a 
member of the democratic leadership who ran unsuccessfully last 
year for the partys presidential nomination jenkins is a popular 
member of the more conservative wing of the party 
the no 3 democratic leadership slot majority whip is being 
vacated by rep tony coelho dcalif coelho recently acknowledged 
that he failed to report a loan from a savingsandloan whose chief 
executive helped set him up in a junk bond deal and said hes 
quitting congress instead of enduring an ethics investigation like 
the one that felled wright 
rep william h gray iii dpa currently no 4 in the 
leadership was considered likely to move up to coelhos slot hes 
been fighting to maintain support since news reports this week 
based on unnamed sources that the justice department was 
conducting a preliminary investigation into personnel practices in 
his office gray insists that he is not a target of investigation 
and attorney general richard thornburgh has promised an 
investigation into the leaks that resulted in the news accounts 
rep david bonior dmich the chief deputy whip and rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee also were campaigning hard for the whips post 
rep henry waxman dcalif an influential member of the house 
energy and commerce committee was checking his chances in that

jewish settlers on friday attacked and beat 
israeli peace activists trying to deliver food and medicine to 
palestinian children in gaza strip refugee camps in the west bank 
soldiers reportedly shot and killed a palestinian teenager 
also friday israeli media reported the army plans to restrict 
the movement of settlers in the west bank suspected of taking part 
in vigilante raids on palestinian communities 
the developments followed a raid monday by jewish settlers on a 
palestinian refugee camp a 13yearold girl was shot to death in 
the rampage 
an israeli court in kfar saba near tel aviv on friday ordered 
five jewish seminary students suspected in the rampage jailed 
pending further investigation 
the seminarys spiritual leader rabbi yitzhak ginsburg 
justified the slaying and said the blood of jews and nonjews 
cannot be equated 
we have to recognize that jewish blood and the blood of a goy 
are not the same thing he told israel radio every law that is 
based on equating goys and jews is completely unacceptable 
zevulun hammer the minister of religious affairs condemned 
ginsburgs statement he said jewish commandments forbid the 
spilling of innocent blood regardless of a persons religion 
at least 70000 jewish settlers live in 130 enclaves in the west 
bank and gaza strip which israel seized from jordan and egypt in 
1967 about 17 million palestinians live in the territories 
the peace activists mostly from the coastal city of haifa were 
met at the armycontrolled erez junction checkpoint entrance to the 
gaza strip by about 100 jewish settlers carrying israeli flags 
the settlers tried to stop the activists from unloading their 
gifts of powered milk and rice and several fistfights ensued 
one activist was seen with blood running down his face the

the presbyterian church must tackle such 
complex issues as the effect of medical technology on the quality 
of life if christians are to face the uncertainties of the future 
a prominent educator told church leaders friday 
there is no question that the 21st century will be different 
from the 20th roger heyns told a symposium of the presbyterian 
church usa 
for example he said it is probably not intelligent to resist 
technological development it is possible however to question 
whether the determination to prolong life regardless of the 
quality of that life is a desirable consequence of our 
technological capacity to do so 
heyns former chancellor of the university of california at 
berkeley and later president of the american council on education 
was the keynote speaker for continue the journey symposium on 
the future being held this weekend on the eve of the churchs 
201st general assembly 
the weeklong assembly begins tuesday and will involve 622 
voting delegates and an estimated 10000 participants and observers 
overall 
the church which traces its roots in the new world back more 
than 400 years has nearly 3 million members its first general 
assembly marking the beginning of a new church organization in a 
young nation was held in philadelphia in 1789 
among the items on the agenda for the voting delegates is the 
selection of a new church moderator or head 
in his speech heyns said the future holds instability and 
uncertainty because of current domestic problems of enormous 
complexity such as aids homelessness and the continued presence 
of an inequitable distribution of wealth 
the church has both a conservative and a radical role to 
play in dealing with such problems he said because the church 
must help form moral standards equal to the changes that will come 
to do that he said churches must stay in touch with reality by 
listening both to god and to people 
they get into serious trouble when they get out of touch with 
either he said 
he also said the values set through the church must be flexible 
for the church to be vital and relevant the subject of what 
is important to conserve and what is important to change must be 
under constant study and lively debate he said

attorney general dick thornburgh threatened 
friday to fire justice department leakers but also criticized the 
news media as aiders and abettors in publicizing unauthorized 
information on a controversial story 
he expressed the wish that journalists would share with federal 
officials the names of their sources on the story and said that if 
reporters would name anonymous sources every leaker in town 
would be gone before sundown 
thornburgh on capitol hill to testify on another matter was 
questioned about possible leaks leading to recent stories saying 
rep william grays office personnel practices are under justice 
department scrutiny 
gray of pennsylvania the fourthranking house democrat has 
complained vigorously about leaks and has asked for appointment of 
an independent counsel to look into the matter 
the attorney general has rejected that demand but he told the 
senate judiciary committee he has appointed the no 2 man in the 
justice department edward dennis to seek the source of 
unauthorized disclosures 
he will have available to him whatever resources are necessary 
to pursue these reports thornburgh said he said that if the 
perpetrators were discovered it was likely they will be fired 
immediately 
thornburgh described our friends in the news media as 
aiders and abettors in the case but later said that was 
perhaps an unfortunate choice of words 
he raised the possibility that criminal laws may have been 
violated in the release of word about the investigation but said 
the news media appeared to be merely exercising their rights under 
the constitution 
thornburgh declined to say what laws may have been violated but 
did not rule out the possibility of prosecuting the leakers 
its extremely difficult to pursue these investigations 
without the cooperation of those in the news media he said i 
can say without fear of contradiction that if we did have the 
cooperation of the news media in these investigations every leaker 
in town would be gone before sundown 
asked later what he meant by cooperation thornburgh said 
consenting to be interviewed and disclosing the source of the 
leak 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press took strong issue with thornburghs words 
about reporters and anonymous sources 
news gathering is protected by the first amendment and to say 
that this is something the news media should not be engaging in is 
trampling on the first amendment she said 
what i find so troubling about his remarks is the notion that 
the news media has a responsibility to keep the governments 
secrets for the government thats the antithesis of what is the 
news medias responsibility 
he is trying to do what the reagan administration did so 
brilliantly to make it appear you are unpatriotic if you dont 
cooperate with the government on these investigations kirtley 
said 
thornburgh was on capitol hill to report to the judiciary 
committee on a longrunning dispute with the american bar 
association over judicial selection 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel however immediately 
asked him about published reports of an investigation into 
personnel practices within grays office 
the reports based on news leaks surfaced as gray is running for 
the house leadership post of majority whip 
urged by biden thornburgh promised to report back to the 
judiciary committee on the results of his deputys investigation 
and to tell the panel what methods had been used 
biden urged thornburgh to assign the investigative task to the 
departments office of professional responsibility 
he noted that dennis formerly was a us district attorney in 
philadelphia where gray is the congressman and said he would not 
advise putting mr dennis a fine honorable man in the position 
of having to investigate people he hired

a transplant surgeon said friday hes devised a 
way to maintain kidneys in trauma victims for several hours after 
their hearts stop a plan that could ease the organ shortage but 
one thats sure to spark controversy 
its clearly something we have to start looking at as a 
source because there is no other solution said david anaise 
clinical associate professor at the state university of new york at 
stony brook 
anaise proposes tapping into the pool of patients who die in 
accidents but are not sustained by respirators as are some 
braindead victims currently the sole source for transplant 
organs by the time relatives of unsustained trauma victims are 
notified it usually is too late for organ donation 
organs quickly deteriorate and thus become useless for 
transplantation unless they are chilled and flushed with 
preservatives 
anaise said trauma victims kidneys could be maintained in their 
bodies for up to five hours if solutions were pumped into the 
organs via a catheter 
with nearly 15000 people awaiting kidney transplants in the 
united states the need for more organs is acute according to 
anaise he estimates the number of kidney donors could double if 
kidneys automatically were maintained in trauma victims while 
family consent was being sought 
last year kidneys were offered from the families of 3867 
victims nationwide according to the united network for organ 
sharing the kidneys of 966 percent of them or 3737 actually 
were transplanted 
the university of wisconsins dr folkert belzer developer of a 
new solution that has improved organ preservation said he doubts 
many kidneys would be obtained from trauma victims whose families 
cannot be reached immediately 
anaises plan is technically feasible belzer said since 
similar methods were used to a limited extent during the 1970s the 
results then were not encouraging 
some doctors worry about the ethical and legal ramifications of 
maintaining kidneys for transplantation without family consent 
its certainly not as invasive as going ahead and removing the 
organs said dr j wesley alexander president of the american 
society of transplant surgeons but you do have to make an 
incision from that standpoint it is invasive 
other experts fear a backlash against the traditional donation 
system at this time its not the way were accustomed to 
said howard nathan executive director of the delaware valley 
transplant program in philadelphia if a plan like that were 
implemented it would take some time to get the medical community 
and public used to that type of procedure 
anaise is prepared for resistance although he has permission 
from university hospital in stony brook to try the procedure 
provided there is family consent or a signed donor card he wants 
to familiarize his colleagues and the public with the idea before 
he proceeds 
the public may say this is horrible those kidneysnatchers i 
came to the emergency room for a checkup and ended up being a 
donor he said 
anaise emphasizes the procedure would not be implemented until 
patients are pronounced dead 
nothing will be done until the time that normally an orderly 
would have come to pick up this body and take it to the morgue 
he said 
anaise said at the transplant societys annual meeting that he 
would attach a catheter to patients without heartbeats for flushing 
preservatives into their kidneys and removing blood from the 
organs chilled solution then would be pumped from an ice bucket 
through two tubes inserted into the abdomen to keep the kidneys 
cold 
the only marks on the body would be a 2inch incision in the 
groin area from the catheter and two small stab wounds in the 
abdomen anaise said 
basically you have a nonmutilated body he said 
if relatives decide against donation they can take it the 
body and bury it and the mortician will tell you thank you you 
did basically what a mortician would have done anyhow

sen robert c byrd dwva urged the bush 
administration friday not to arm noncommunist guerrillas in 
cambodia secretly but rather to seek an accord with congress on an 
open us policy there 
there is much at stake here and it seems inadvisable to engage 
in secret deals secret policy secret aid and repeat the mistakes 
of the very recent past byrd told the senate 
a policy review is clearly in order said byrd the former 
majority leader who now chairs the appropriations committee 
if we are to reengage in southeast asia let us do so he 
said but let us do so only after thorough open debate with 
discussions of options and the careful formulation of a new us 
policy in concert with other nations that wish to bring longterm 
peace and stability to cambodia 
vietnam announced last april 1 that it will end its 10year 
occupation of cambodia and withdraw all of its military forces by 
next sept 30 
american and asian policy makers fear that in the resulting 
vaccuum forces of the radical khmer rouge may regain power and 
resume the massacre widely believed to have claimed ther lives of 
more than one million cambodians during their 19731978 rule 
during the years of the vietnamese occupation the united states 
has helped in the international effort to feed the estimated 
300000 refugees on cambodias border with thailand and since 
1985 has provided some nonlethal aid to noncommunist factions in 
the country 
byrd noted published reports this week that the bush 
administration is considering mounting a covert operation to supply 
noncommunist forces in cambodia with rifles and other weapons 
a principal beneficiary of such aid would likely be prince 
norodom sihanouk a previous ruler of the country who is seeking a 
leading role in the government of postoccupation cambodia 
but some congressional leaders fear that military aid will fall 
instead into the hands of the khmer rouge which is allied with 
sihanouk in efforts to topple the vietnamesesupported government 
byrd said that us hopes for an independent sovereign and 
noncommunist cambodia cannot be achieved through secret arms 
transfers 
it is inconceivable to me how anyone could think that a new 
military aid program in southeast asia could be successful or 
sustainable without building a strong national concensus to support 
it byrd said 
there is no short cut no easy back door which can circumvent 
and make unnecessary the building of a knowledgeable consensus for 
new longterm us policies in a region which has been purposefully 
bereft of such policies since our involvement in vietnam ended so 
catastrophically he said 
southeast asia is fraught with too many memories too much sad 
history too much spilled blood for the united states to back into 
a commitment with no sense of where that commitment may lead he 
said 
byrd said that the current situation in cambodia suggests that 
active inventive international diplomacy mgiht be considered 
and might be fruitful 
an active american diplomatic role might well find a receptive 
audience and that is an option that i believe would find the 
greatest amount of support from the american people byrd said

president alfredo cristiani in 
his first full day in office called friday for a regional effort 
to end his nations leftist revolution and said it was as crucial 
as dismantling the nicaraguan rebels 
also friday insurgents denied they owned a huge arms cache 
displayed as materiel captured from rebels the exhibition is 
psychological warfare they said 
jose napoleon duarte the staunch us ally who retired after 
five years as president traveled to washington for cancer 
treatment friday duarte 63 is dying of liver cancer 
and the armys monthly duty orders published friday show a key 
clique of colonels consolidated its power 
cristiani leader of the rightist arena party gave a press 
conference in the presidential palace 
he said the nineyear salvadoran revolution is a regional 
problem and should be dealt with in the context of the 1987 
esquipulas ii regional peace plan 
under the plan the five central american presidents agreed in 
february to promote the demobilization of contra rebels based in 
honduras 
cristiani acknowledged the contra plan has a head start we 
have no problem with that going ahead but we would like to see 
equal treatment given to the salvadoran problem and progress there 
too 
he reiterated accusations that nicaraguas leftist regime helps 
arm the salvadoran rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
nicaragua says it provides only moral support to the guerrillas 
known as fmln 
cristiani said he will bring up the issue of alleged nicaraguan 
intervention during a central american summit tentatively scheduled 
for july 
we hope that nicaragua will cut its links with the fmln he 
said 
the armed forces tuesday exhibited nearly 400 sovietdesigned 
ak47 assault rifles 50 sovietmade grenade launchers and piles of 
other munition military spokesmen called it the biggest logistical 
blow to the rebels in years 
but the insurgents on their clandestine radio said it was a 
show staged to implicate nicaragua and ensure continued us 
military aid el salvador receives more than 1 million a day in 
us economic and military assistance 
according to the armys june orders the graduating class of 
colonels known as la tandona consolidated its power retaining 
or gaining command of seven of the eight army brigades the 
colonels are not likely to modify significantly the current 
strategy of low intensity conflict 
the selection of cristianis defense minister deeply divided the 
armed forces last week 
cristiani and other senior arena party officials favored 
hardline air force commander gen rafael bustillo according to 
military and political sources col rene ponce in charge of the 
joint chiefs of staff also aspired to the portfolio 
because their rivalry threatened to split the armed forces 
sources said gen humberto larios was chosen as a compromise 
candidate but he is considered a stopgap 
bustillo who it is thought would escalate the conflict sharply 
if he had charge of defense reportedly is supported by key 
colonels who do not belong to the tandona 
ponce leads the tandona and command changes announced 
friday make it likely he eventually will win the contest for the 
defense ministry which is expected to change hands in about six 
months

to persuade the us government to lift its ban on president kurt 
waldheim traveling to the united states a ministry official said 
friday

1987 after the world jewish congress said it had evidence that 
implicated the former united nations secretary general in war 
crimes during world war ii 
the us justice department said in december 1987 that it had 
evidence of waldheims complicity while he served as a junior 
officer in the german army in yugoslavia in world war ii 
waldheim who was elected president in 1986 has denied all the 
charges 
members of austrias coalition government are divided over 
whether it should press the united states to lift the travel ban 
chancellor franz vranitzky visited the united states less than a 
month ago and saw no reason to raise the issue in a meeting with 
government officials said a spokesman on condition of anonymity 
but a foreign ministry official said there is a plan to hand 
president bush a letter through ambassador friedrich hoess in which 
the new administration is once more given the austrian viewpoint on 
this topic 
the ban was imposed during president reagans second term in 
office 
the foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the letter did not contain new arguments it was to 
be delivered in the next few days the official said 
vranitzky is chairman of the socialist party foreign minister 
alois mock until recently headed the conservative austrian peoples 
party 
an international commission of historians appointed by the 
austrian government issued a report in february 1988 that said 
waldheim was in close proximity to some war atrocities knew 
they were going on and made no attempt to stop them 
the us justice department has said its evidence shows 
waldheims complicity in the deportation of jews from greek islands 
to concentration or death camps the execution of allied prisoners 
and the execution of hostages and other civilians

argentina because the new regime is antisemitic the 
immigration minister said friday 
rabbi yitzhak peretz the minister told a new conference 
growing numbers of argentine jews had approached the jewish agency 
in buenos aires

menem was elected last month and is scheduled to take office in 
november 
the daily jerusalem post quoted jewish agency officials as 
saying they expect immigration from argentina to double this year 
to about 3000 but the newspaper said the main reason was the 
severe economic crisis not antisemitism 
argentinas currency has lost all but a fraction of its value 
and inflation is about 70 percent a month at least 14 people were 
killed in food riots this week 
many jews planning to immigrate to israel cant afford a plane 
ticket to another country and we have to help them with basic needs 
such as clothes and suitcases the newspaper quoted a jewish 
agency official as saying 
the demand for agency assistance to leave argentina has been so 
great that applicants must wait three weeks before even meeting 
with a staff member the official was quoted as saying

states during the past year and went to iraq to join the fight 
against ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime leaders of irans

her last name to protect relatives still in iran 
she said khomeini is the hitler of our generation and i am 
going to fight him along with her 31yearold husband toraj they 
have two daughters 5 and 10 years old 
she said she and her husband would join the iraqbased national 
liberation army the fighting arm of the peoples mujahedeen and 
expected to meet friends who had already joined that force 
i know personally dozens of them from orange county calif 
who went to iraq to fight khomeinis government she added 
i will do anything that they need of me anything to help the 
national liberation army free my people and overthrow khomeini

number of exiles who have left america 
the national liberation army has an estimated 15000 fighters 
jafarzadeh said when the iranians arrive in iraq they undego 
training for weeks or months depending on their skills and the 
tasks they will carry out they then are placed in various army 
units and the assignments are not based on what country they came 
from he said 
the national liberation army established in 1987 conducted an 
offensive last july called eternal light and claimed two 
iranian border cities were captured 
it said its fighters then withdrew and asserted that during the 
campaign they killed or wounded 55000 iranians and suffered only 
1000 casualties 
iran said it trounced the opposition army killing or capturing 
thousands irans ambassador to the united nations said iran 
sustained 40000 casualties 
londonbased amnesty international and a un human rights 
investigator said iran embarked on a wave of executions of 
political prisoners after that campaign with most of the victims

two police officers were indicted friday in a 
wideranging corruption probe for allegedly defrauding the city of 
money earmarked for undercover drug buys and confidential 
informants 
former vice squad officers shelton roberts and james whitaker 
jr also were charged with allegedly obstructing courts in the 
district of columbia by filing false affidavits in support of 
search warrants in drug investigations in addition they were 
accused of obstructing a federal grand jury investigation of their 
alleged illegal activities 
information compiled in the probe against a dozen other former 
vice squad officers has been turned over to the police department 
for appropriate administrative action said us attorney jay 
stephens his office announced the federal grand jury indictments 
stephens said the referrals were made because his investigation 
didnt establish sufficient credible evidence to prosecute the 
other police officers 
the lengthy investigation focused on the citys 4th police 
precinct vice unit 
indictments against roberts and whitaker say they defrauded a 
confidential police fund set up to pay for narcotics purchases and 
to pay informants 
roberts and whitaker allegedly forged and falsified police 
documents saying that in many instances the controlled buys 
werent made or informants didnt receive the money as claimed by 
robert and whitaker 
in 1986 and 1987 roberts was involved in 121 alleged forgeries 
while whitaker was involved in 87 the indictments said 
as a result of allegedly falsified affidavits the us 
attorneys office said in 1987 that it would dismiss 300 to 400 
pending drug cases in order to preserve the integrity of the 
criminal justice system 
in addition the indictments say that roberts and whitaker made 
falsely sworn affidavits to support issuance of search warrants in 
drug investigations 
the affidavits recounted drug buys that didnt take place and 
provided facts supporting the reliability of informants that were 
untrue the indictments said 
roberts was charged with six counts of obstruction of the 
federal investigation while whitaker was charged with two counts of 
obstructing it 
a 167count indictment was returned against whitaker and a 
161count indictment was returned against roberts

andrei d sakharov told a hostile soviet congress 
friday that the soviet unions criminal adventure in 
afghanistan was a shameful episode that cost 1 million lives his 
outraged colleagues denounced him as a liar 
you have insulted our entire army our entire nation all our 
boys who gave their lives tursan kazakova of uzbekistan shouted 
at the noted human rights activist drawing a standing ovation from 
other members of the congress of peoples deputies 
sakharov defended his statements saying he wears his seven 
years in exile for criticizing the war like a medal 
for eight days the 2250member congress the centerpiece of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs political reforms has met in the 
kremlin to hear a litany of complaints about national economic and 
social woes and barbed critiques of the ruling communist party and 
gorbachev 
but none of the proceedings matched the sudden fury directed at 
sakharov a member of the new congress and the 1975 nobel peace 
laureate 
before the congress adjourned for the weekend deputy yuri 
karyakin advanced such heretical proposals as removing soviet 
founder vladimir i lenins body from the mausoleum on red square 
and inscribing the names of the millions of victims of the soviet 
secret police onto kgb headquarters in moscow 
the communist partys more than seven decades of supremacy have 
come under fierce attack at the congress the soviet unions first 
parliament chosen in contested elections and the partys 
policymaking central committee met friday night to evaluate the 
congress work 
in a terse dispatch tass news agency said the central committee 
recommended that politburo member nikolai i ryzhkov be retained as 
soviet prime minister a post to be filled by the countrys new 
legislature 
ryzhkov and the government ministries he heads have come under 
fire in congress for soviet ailments ranging from bad roads in 
siberia to the disastrous state of the countrys environment 
the storm over sakharov 68 began when a veteran of the afghan 
war demanded an explanation of comments the physicist has made 
about the red armys intervention in that country which began in 
december 1979 and ended in february under a unmediated accord 
the soviets were helping the afghan government in its war with 
moslem guerrillas 
to a loud ovation former soviet army maj sergei chervonopisky 
who lost his legs in the war took the rostrum at the congress to 
lambast sakharov for unprecedented badgering of the soviet army 
chervonopisky slowly rocking back and forth on his artificial 
legs demanded an explanation for an interview sakharov gave to the 
ottawa citizen which quoted him as saying soviet pilots were 
ordered to kill soldiers they could not save from being captured by 
afghan guerrillas 
the former majors emotional speech on behalf of the state 
the motherland and communism drew deafening applause which 
gorbachev joined vice president anatoly i lukyanov chairing the 
session did not want to let sakharov reply but gorbachev motioned 
with his hand to give the nuclear physicist the floor 
the war in afghanistan was a criminal adventure and its not 
known who bears the responsibility for this enormous crime that 
cost 1 million lives sakharov said 
even in the atmosphere of greater soviet openness such frank 
condemnation was astounding 
visibly flustered at the angry response sakharov stammered but 
continued we have to cleanse ourselves of this terrible shame 
i spoke out against sending soviet soldiers to afghanistan and 
for this i was exiled to gorky i am proud of this exile in gorky 
i wear it like a medal 
the figure of 1 million killed is commonly known in the west but 
not used in the soviet media which often portray soviet troops as 
the chief victims of the conflict 
gorbachev allowed sakharov to return to moscow from gorky in 
december 1986 after he spent nearly seven years in exile 
sakharov denied he had intended to insult the red army but said 
no one could call his statements an insult until the truth is known 
he said he had mentioned information in the interview he heard 
on foreign radios 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev former soviet chief of the armed 
forces general staff swept up to the rostrum to tell the congress 
that sakharovs charges were a blatant lie 
outside the kremlin palace of congresses col gen boris 
gromov the former soviet commander in afghanistan also accused 
sakharov of lying when our soldiers were killed there we lost 
even more people trying to recover their bodies but we got them 
said gromov 
the attacks on sakharov and sakharovs response were broadcast 
live and later repeated in part on staterun televisions evening 
news show vremya 
sakharov was surrounded by reporters as he left the kremlin 
hall and said he was sorry he hadnt been more explicit i 
regret i did not speak about all the crimes of the soviet army 
napalm the bombardment of schools and hospitals sakharov said 
there must be an investigation 
he called the attack on him a stagemanaged spectacle

the manufacturer of alar the apple chemical 
that stirred a national furor over a possible cancer risk to 
children said friday it is taking the substance off the us 
market immediately 
uniroyal chemical co continued to defend the chemical as safe 
but said continued use on apples is causing doubt and confusion 
about the safety of americas food supply 
apple growers and processors had pleaded for such action because 
fears about alar had drastically cut into apple industry sales 
the company said sales of daminozide which is marketed under 
the name alar would continue to about 70 markets outside the 
united states including some that export apples and apple products 
to this country 
however a spokeswoman for the international apple institute 
said most imported apples are green ones such as granny smiths 
which are not treated with alar 
supplies of the chemical held by us customers may be returned 
for refunds the company said 
the environmental protection agency said late friday it has 
reached agreement with uniroyal on a plan to monitor the removal of 
alar from the us market although there is no government ban on 
its use the epa said it also will notify foreign governments about 
agency concerns about alar 
the action taken by uniroyal will significantly reduce risk 
from exposure to daminozide said victor kimm the epas acting 
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances 
the epa has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food 
products because tests in laboratory animals have indicated the 
chemical can cause cancer final action on the proposed regulation 
is not expected until late 1990 
uniroyal has disputed the findings and james wylie company 
vice president said friday we want to emphasize that we have 
not changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide 
the epa estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the us 
apple crop is treated with alar a growth regulator that improves 
the apples appearance and gives it a longer shelf life 
wylie of uniroyal said at a news conference our voluntary 
action is taken to ease public confusion and we hope to let the 
proven scientific process work 
daminozide has become the focus of a needless controversy that 
is causing doubt and confusion about the safety of americas food 
supply a needless controversy that is hurting the apple industry 
and the american public he said 
the company indicated that it intends to resume selling alar if 
a government scientific review scheduled to be completed next 
year concludes the chemical is safe 
apple growers applauded the decision by uniroyal but some 
suggested that the company should have made the move much earlier 
the international apple institute estimates that growers have lost 
more than 100 million because of the apple scare over alar in 
recent months 
they are darn late in getting to this point weve been after 
them for a long time and consumer confidence has been affected 
said john mcalister of tree top inc the nations largest apple 
juice maker 
mcalister said in yakima wash that tree tops sales have 
dropped more than 20 percent since the alar controversy began in 
february even though tree top and other processors have said 
repeatedly they do not use alartreated apples 
this action is most welcomed since it will allay any 
remaining concerns consumers may have about small levels of alar in 
apples and apple products said larry davenport executive 
director of the processed apples institute 
many growers have stopped using the product since concern about 
its health effects gained widespread attention earlier this year 
wylie although not providing any specific production figures said 
sales of alar in the united states have dropped 75 percent during 
the past three years 
earlier this year a report by the natural resources defense 
council a private environmental group said young children are 
particularly at risk from alar and a variety of pesticides used on 
fruits and vegetables because they consume large amounts 
especially relative to their weight of apple products other 
fruits and vegetables 
although the government said the levels of alar in apples were 
not hazardous the private groups report prompted many parents to 
question whether they should continue to provide apple products to 
their youngsters school districts in a number of major cities for 
a time stopped providing apples in school lunchrooms 
janet hathaway an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the uniroyal decision represented a capitulation to 
public opinion but that consumers could still be exposed to the 
chemical because it will continue to be sold in countries that 
export apple products to the united states 
but maureen miklavic a spokeswoman for the international apple 
institute said exposure to alar from its use in other countries 
would be unlikely not only are most imports green apples and thus 
free of alar she said but imported apple concentrates are 
expected to be closely monitored by the processing industry for 
possible alar content 
congress is considering legislation that would prohibit the 
importing of alar treated apples

the washington representative of the arab league ambassador

the state department responding to press inquiries about 
maksouds statement said congress in 1987 prohibited the 
establishment of any plo office in the united states

thunderous applause greeted a police 
officer friday when he told a packed legislative hearing that the 
only cured sex offender he knows is the rapist he shot to death 
tacoma policeman stan mowre was among witnesses at a hearing 
where state senators unveiled legislation they said would crack 
down on violent sex offenders the measure was sparked by public 
outrage over the sexual mutilation may 20 of a 7yearold tacoma 
boy 
the child whose mother attended the hearing was raped choked 
and his penis severed in a wooded area near his home the boy was 
released from mary bridge hospital in tacoma on wednesday in 
satisfactory condition 
earl kenneth shriner 39 is being held on charges of attempted 
murder rape and assault in the attack on the boy he has pleaded 
innocent authorities say shriner has a history of sexual violence 
most sex offenders are incurable mowre told the state senate 
law and justice committee theres only one that i know that was 
cured and thats the rapist i shot and killed in the line of 
duty mowre said 
helen harlow the mother of the mutilated boy spoke briefly and 
calmly to the committee telling lawmakers that sex offenders need 
longer jail terms special facilities and long postrelease 
supervision 
the public has a right to know who these people are when they 
are released said ms harlow and repeat offenders are going to 
be harassed by the public as they should be that remark drew 
loud applause from the crowd 
she said she still didnt understand why the system failed to 
protect her child and why a man with a history of violence against 
young people was permitted to roam with no supervision 
officials have said that after shriner served a 10year prison 
term for assault authorities who considered him a sexual 
psychopath could not get him committed to the states systems for 
the mentally ill because his past was too violent and although he 
was diagnosed as mildly retarded his iq was too high to qualify 
him for homes for the developmentally disabled 
in testimony thursday before a house panel chase riveland head 
of the state department of corrections said people who suffer 
developmental disabilities and mental illness frequently fall 
between the cracks of the states criminal and health systems 
ms harlow and others applauded the proposed legislation which 
includes doubling prison sentences for firstdegree sexual assault 
involving mutilation to 12 years for a first offense and 
increasingly longer for repeat offenses 
it also provides for postrelease supervision from 10 years to 
life depending on the offenders record 
committee chairman kent pullen a republican who cowrote the 
measure said he wants a special session to pass the bill and 
appropriate money to pay for the estimated 500 additional offenders 
who would flood the already overburdened criminal justice system 
gov booth gardner a democrat said he was not opposed to a 
special session if the legislation was appropriate we want a 
solution that would stand the test of time not a solution that is 
just window dressing he said 
fridays hearing was as much a venting of outrage over sex 
crimes as a look at the proposed legislation 
lawmakers and one expert witness discussed whether castration is 
better than special drugs to quell offenders sexual urges which 
led one unidentified onlooker to stand and shout surgical is 
better 
im not mad as hell im enraged said ida ballisiotes of 
seattle whose daughter diane was raped and killed in september 
by a workrelease inmate who had been classified as a sexual 
psychopath 
i dont want to hear again that this person or that person 
fell through the cracks i want the cracks filled she said on 
the verge of tears our daughter was as innocent as that little 
boy im glad he lived she didnt

at their horse farm near lexington ky 
mrs bush asked if she had seen news photos of her kissing the 
hand of denis thatcher husband of the prime minister said im 
not going to be impulsive any more 
the bushes plan to return to washington on sunday after relaxing 
over the weekend at their kennebunkport home 
the centerpiece of the trip was the nato summit in brussels on 
monday and tuesday and bushs presentation there of a proposal for 
drastic reductions in eastwest conventional forces in europe cuts 
he said should come by 1993 
in addition the allied summit agreed to compromise settlement 
of a disagreement over shortrange nuclear missiles which are to 
be put on the negotiating table only after a conventional arms deal 
is completed the united states and britain were wary of 
negotiations west germany wanted them immediately 
bush said that compromise demonstrated the strength of nato the 
alliance has never been more united never been stronger he 
said 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
said everybody was happy the last meeting at nato was a real 
lovein 
we met the challenge bush said in his homecoming statement 
we agree to strive to hope for a europe that is whole and free 
 
ours is not an arrogant challenge to mr gorbachev it is an 
appeal in good faith the president said the summit was a 
triumph for the alliance a triumph of ideas most of all it was a 
triumph of hope 
bush said he was gratified by the response at home and abroad 
while keeping our defenses up and our eyes wide open we must 
press forward we must stay on the offensive we must get to work 
now to end the cold war the world has waited long enough 
scowcroft said verification of conventional arms cuts will 
present problems but that checking will be easier because the 
soviets would have to cut 10 times as many troops as the united 
states would 
scowcroft said the bush proposal does not assume the soviets can 
be trusted this is not built on trust he said trust is the 
last thing that comes between opposing sides it is built on mutual 
selfinterest 
he said the emphasis will move now to the strategic arms 
reduction talks which resume june 19 scowcroft said 
administration preparation for those negotations will be sharply 
accelerated now 
bush also will be shaping his proposals for clean air and 
environmental legislation sununu said that should be ready in a 
week or 10 days 
it will go to a house awaiting new democratic leadership with 
the coming resignation of house speaker jim wright bush issued a 
statement praising wrights achievements after the speaker 
announced his resignation in the face of ethics charges 
in response to a question on air force one bush said he is 
disturbed by talk of a political war between democrats and 
republicans in the house i dont like it he said 
but he declined to offer advice to lawmakers as they prepare to 
install a new leadership team 
the last thing they need is advice from the executive branch 
about how to proceed he said

a soviet satellite booster rocket reentered 
the atmosphere over the uscanadian border with no sign that any 
debris reached the ground a state department spokesman said friday 
the soviet news agency tass reported the launch wednesday and 
said in a later dispatch that the third stage of the proton rocket 
booster which had put three satellites into orbit descended over 
the uscanadian border 
there was no indication that any debris of any kind hit the 
ground said state department spokesman richard boucher he said 
the descent of such boosters is a routine occurrence and that they 
almost always burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground 
in a statement released later the department said us and 
soviet officials have been in contact about the matter but the 
agency did not identify which officials or at what level 
the soviets offered to address any us concerns which may 
arise regarding the matter the statement said 
capt thomas niemann of the us space command at colorado 
springs said the soviet rocket booster was tracked back into the 
atmosphere at 254 pm edt wednesday at 485 degrees north and 
about 96 degrees west which would place it over minnesotas border 
with canada 
command spokesman dugald gillies said the agency keeps track of 
7000 objects orbiting around the earth he said manmade objects 
fall out of orbit about once a day but rarely draw much attention 
unless the reentries occur over populated areas at night so they 
can be seen debris very rarely reaches the ground he said 
tass said the rocket launch was designed to test elements of a 
global space navigation system being created to track civil 
aviation aircraft and vessels of the soviet maritime and fishing 
fleets

statement by a filipino businessman convicted of defrauding the 
defense department 
the melbourne flabased company agreed to pay 200000 in

government arising from a longstanding investigation of fraud 
involving weapons sales to the philippines

a deputy galvanized the new soviet parliament on 
friday by proposing to restore citizenship to alexander 
solzhenitsyn and to inscribe the names of millions of stalins 
victims on the walls of kgb headquarters 
yuri karyakin an outspoken writer from moscow also proposed 
removing the body of soviet founder vladimir i lenin from its 
hallowed mausoleum on red square and burying it 
addressing president mikhail s gorbachev by name and the entire 
congress of peoples deputies karyakin demanded return our 
russian citizenship to a person who dared to speak the truth first 
about stalins system who was the first to call on himself and on 
us not to lie to the great writer of russia to the great humanist 
solzhenitsyn 
some of the 2250 deputies in the kremlins palace of congresses 
applauded the appeal by the 58yearold graybearded deputy from 
the academy of sciences 
solzhenitsyn wrote extensively about the bloody terror of 
dictator josef stalins rule from 19241953 but his most biting 
novels were never published in the soviet union 
he was branded a traitor and stripped of his citizenship in 
1974 expelled and now lives in vermont 
solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize for literature in 1970 is 
best known in the west for his books gulag archipelago one 
day in the life of ivan denisovich and cancer ward 
only one day in the life of ivan denisovich has been 
published in the soviet union but a literary journal plans to 
excerpt gulag archipelago a chronicle of stalins labor camps 
by years end 
no immediate reaction to the solzhenitsyn proposal came from the 
soviet leadership but on thursday vadim a medvedev a member of 
the ruling politburo said in an interview that solzhenitsyn was 
against soviet power and lenin and that gulag archipelago was 
antisoviet 
two deputies moscow populist boris n yeltsin and lithuanian 
communist party chief algirdas brazauskas said in interviews they 
supported karyakins call 
karyakin also said the secret police headquarters called the 
lubyanka should bear a reminder of those who suffered under stalin 
if we have not lost our memory if we have not killed our 
conscience then we must write on the building on lubyanka square 
the names of 40 million we do not know the exact figure who 
died because of and in connection with the orders of lubyanka he 
said 
a citizens group memorial is campaigning with gorbachevs 
backing for a monument to be built to stalins victims stalin 
killed millions through his forced collectivization of agriculture 
and executions of real or imagined enemies 
to a grumbling audience karyakin stood before a huge white 
statue of lenin and said lenin wanted to be buried beside his 
mother in st petersburg later renamed leningrad but his will was 
ignored and his body was placed in a stone mausoleum after his 
death in 1924 
lenins widow nadezhda krupskaya opposed putting lenin in an 
aboveground mausoleum where his body could be viewed but stalin 
and other party leaders overruled her 
yeltsin said he opposed the suggestion to remove lenins body 
and bury it in leningrad because the mausoleum is a symbol of our 
revolution and should not be touched 
in april members of the communist partys policymaking central 
committee condemned a similar suggestion 
millions of soviets visit the mausoleum each year to show their 
reverence to the founder of the soviet state

a jury convicted two men friday of 
robbing 286000 from a bank and threatening potential witnesses 
and one was found guilty of murdering a partner who the robbers 
feared would sell them out 
sentencing was set for aug 14 for john p mccoy of slaters 
branch ky and doyle david moore of lovely ky they were found 
guilty of being two of the four men who held up the matewan 
national bank branch at kermit on jan 3 1987 in what was 
described as west virginias biggest bank robbery 
during six days of testimony prosecutors relied heavily on 
harold d boonie runyon who pleaded guilty to conspiracy as 
part of a plea bargain and admitted taking part in the robbery 
runyon testified that he and mccoy described as the ringleader 
shot and killed another of the robbers russell davis atop a 
mountain in eastern kentucky after learning that davis met with 
federal officials in florida 
he was a threat to us runyon had said when he entered his 
guilty plea there was no reasoning with him we took him to a 
hill and shot him 
us attorney michael carey said the four robbers split the 
money evenly but that after davis was killed runyon and mccoy 
split his share no money has been recovered 
davis had met with federal officials shortly after the robbery 
about a counterfeit charge pending against him in kentucky carey 
said davis had told mccoy and runyon about the meeting then 
demanded the rest of his share from the bank robbery 
mccoy and runyon fearing davis would call attention to himself 
and get arrested killed davis to silence him carey said 
mccoy 43 was convicted of robbery conspiracy threatening 
federal witnesses and killing a potential government witness 
russell davis another of the robbers he faces up to life in 
prison and a 2 million fine 
moore 27 was convicted of robbery conspiracy to commit 
robbery and threatening a witness he was found not guilty of 
threatening another witness and of conspiring with mccoy to 
threaten others and was not charged in the death of davis he 
faces up to 40 years in prison and a 750000 fine 
before the trial began prosecutors said that the suspects 
plotted from jail to kill other potential witnesses people who 
had heard them discuss the crime and flee to the caribbean one 
potential witness died of undetermined causes last month but 
prosecutors ruled out foul play 
defense attorneys argued to jurors that the government witnesses 
were not to be trusted especially runyon because of his plea 
bargain runyon said under crossexamination that he pleaded guilty 
with the hope that he would avoid kentuckys electric chair for his 
role in killing davis 
they say boonie runyon had no reason to lie with over 2000 
volts of electricity flowing through his body after his head had 
been shaved that is a powerful motivator that is a powerful 
motivator to lie said j michael curtis representing moore 
west virginia doesnt keep records on bank robberies but 
officials said they could not remember a bigger one

pope john paul ii preached against a 
godless world friday and visited his northernmost flock in the land 
of the midnight sun 
in a city better known for nightclubs than devotion thousands 
of people braved a 39 degree chill and gray skies that hid the sun 
as the pontiff led evening prayers 
we are gathered this evening in the long bright twilight of 
the north in the light of the unsetting sun which so clearly 
symbolizes christ john paul said he wore a white overcoat and 
spoke in english 
tromsoe an island in a fjord surrounded by snowcapped peaks is 
at 70 degrees latitude 217 miles inside the arctic circle it is 
the northternmost outpost of the church with 680 roman catholics 
im surprised so many people came but we dont get many 
famous people here said a young woman in blue jeans and a ski 
jacket 
john paul spoke from a wooden altar erected in the market square 
beside a bronze statue of a whaler with a harpoon this codfishing 
center of 48000 people has 15 nightclubs and has been dubbed the 
land of the midnight fun 
on the second day of his scandinavian pilgrimage john paul 
first visited the bustling fjordside port of trondheim 
small but enthusiastic crowds lined the streets as he arrived on 
a clear crisp day a band played down by the riverside 
in an interview with norwegian television the pope said he felt 
at home in norway not like an outsider in an overwhelmingly 
lutheran country with only 27800 catholics 
he was asked asked why the church does not allow women to be 
priests and suggested the questioner read a document on women he 
issued this year it ruled out women priests because of tradition 
and because christ was a man 
in visiting norway the pope has stressed the long christian 
tradition in scandinavia before it broke with rome four centuries 
ago 
addressing an ecumenical prayer service and later a mass in what 
was the center of catholicism in prereformation scandinavia john 
paul mentioned st olav his son magnus the great and other early 
christians who played important roles in norwegian history 
as christians we proclaim a wisdom that recognizes and upholds 
the priority of ethics over technology the primacy of the person 
over things the superiority of spirit over matter he said 
before us lies the duty of opening a new christian chapter in 
history in response to the many challenges of a changing world 
christians understand what is at stake john paul declared 
the history of our own century clearly shows that where no 
transcendent norm is acknowledged people are in danger of 
surrendering themselves to forces which take command of society 
without concern for individuals and their freedoms 
meetings with lutheran leaders have been a high point of the 
norway visit producing frank exchanges on what separates lutherans 
from rome 
a 62yearold lutheran anne krigvoll said she traveled 50 
miles to see john paul in trondheim because though she has 
differences with him he too is interested in the real values 
the spiritual values 
the popes 10day tour moves to iceland on saturday he also 
will visit finland denmark and sweden before returning to rome 
next friday

andrei sakharov has defied the kremlin and the kgb 
secret police and on friday he faced a new kind of foe outraged 
representatives in the countrys new elected congress 
the raucous parliamentary fray carried on national television 
involved sakharovs condemnation of soviet actions in the war in 
afthanistan 
after the angry exchange the frail human rights activist told 
western reporters i can take it 
a veteran wounded in the war and now a member of the congress of 
peoples deputies demanded an explanation for a statement sakharov 
made in an interview with a western newspaper that soviet pilots 
in afghanistan were ordered to kill comrades in danger of being 
captured by rebels 
in a booming voice sergei chervonopisky accused sakharov of 
defaming the memory of the 15000 soviet soldiers killed in 
afghanistan 
there was thunderous applause in the kremlins palace of 
congresses for the passionate speech by the former paratroop major 
who lost both legs in the war and said his artificial limbs were so 
painful i wouldnt wish them on my enemies 
on a signal from president mikhail s gorbachev the 68yearold 
sakharov a member of the congress was given the floor to respond 
in a halting voice he repeated his criticism of the kremlins 
decision in december 1979 to send troops into afghanistan to help 
the marxist government the soviets withrew their forces last 
february under a unsponsored pact 
sakharov called the soviet unions conduct in afghanistan a 
war of annihilation against an entire people it was his 
outspoken opposition to the soviet intervention that led to his 
arrest in january 1980 and almost seven years in internal 
banishment in the closed city of gorky 
sakharov told the congress that in the interview mentioned by 
chervonopisky about soviet pilots he was repeating information he 
had heard on foreign radio stations and the allegations were being 
investigated 
many deputies reacted furiously shouting and clapping their 
hands to interrupt him 
when a woman elected from the central asian republic of 
uzbekistan took the microphone to shout that sakharov should be 
ashamed an overwhelming majority of deputies including members of 
the ruling communist party politburo rose in a standing ovation 
sakharov sat impassively in his chair as a series of deputies 
took the floor to denounce him or accuse him of lying 
sakharov told western reporters later that he had expected a 
hostile reception and he said he could have spoken better 
he expressed one regret not giving what he called a a more 
complete description of all the crimes of the soviet army in 
afghanistan 
sakharov a nuclear physicist won the nobel peace prize in 1975

state officials said friday they wont 
dismantle the worlds largest quilt stitched for the states 
centennial but a more troublesome question remains what do you do 
with an 800pound bedcover 
it is not an historical artifact today a hundred years from 
now it will be centennial commission member vern neff said 
before the panel voted 132 to keep the quilt in one piece 
leona tennyson 74 who with 7000 volunteers from across north 
dakota stitched together the quilt has sworn to fight to the 
end to keep her labor of love from being dismantled 
the quilt certified by the guinness book of world records as 
the worlds largest a year ago measures 85 by 134 feet 1 times 
as long and wide as a basketball court 
still the commission has no idea how the quilt will figure in 
its plans for the states 100th birthday celebration this year 
the giant bedcover which takes as many as 40 people to carry 
depicts each of the states 53 counties and 1358 townships it is 
being stored at minot state universitys athletic center 
some people say the quilt should be dismantled and returned to 
the counties that made its parts because it is unmanageable in its 
present form 
the state museum has turned it down but tennyson has pledged to 
find a permanent place to display her creation with or without the 
states help 
in voting to keep the quilt intact the centennial commission 
asked tennyson to set the conditions under which she will surrender 
it 
tennyson was unswayed friday by the commissions decision to 
keep the quilt in one piece 
i have said that from the start she said in a telephone 
interview from her home in antler i dont know what to say i am 
not going to say nothing about it until i can decide what is what 
we have plans here too for it 
state tourism director jim fuglie said the quilt simply was too 
precious to think about dismantling it may be the most special 
thing that comes out of this centennial fuglie said 
the adams county tourism committee was specific in its request 
to acquire the quilt 
our plans are either to cover the quilt with a layer of 
plexiglas or construct a series of catwalks which would allow 
viewers of the quilt to walk several feet above the surface of the 
quilt wrote jeff rotering a lawyer in hettinger 
hal gershman of grand forks a commission member suggested the 
grand forks city auditorium might eventually be available to 
display the quilt if the city builds a new civic center 
we envision the old auditorium being an arts center he said 
there have been plenty of ideas about what to do with the quilt 
since its plight was publicized said commission member woody 
gagnon one woman suggested wrapping it around the 19story state 
capitol in bismarck to save on heat bills he said

and the gems of brazil include both 
kelly calls the paintings the most complex and ambitious of 
heades career which might have made him famous in this country if 
they had been seen 
heade became interested in brazil through a friend who was a 
diplomat and an acquaintance of brazils last emperor pedro ii he 
also painted a view of rio de janeiro now in the pennsylvania 
academy of fine arts on the first of three trips he made to south 
america 
pedro was interested in natural history and the arts and kelly 
thinks he may have had something to do with the hummingbird idea 
heade took the paintings to britain to get colored lithographs 
made of them a dozen years before ornithologist john gould had 
exhibited 1500 stuffed hummingbirds at the london zoological 
garden queen victoria said it was impossible to imagine anything 
so lovely 
dickens wrote the most vivid colors of the painters palette 
cannot duplicate their evervarying tints 
heade made a try on canvas that kelly calls among the most 
original and beautiful works in 19th century american painting but 
he had to give up on the lithographs he could not get the colors 
he wanted the paintings were sold in london

an opposition politician said 
friday that president raul alfonsin should leave office before the 
december transition date because of social disintegration 
marked by food rioting 
fourteen people were killed this week when crowds looted 
supermarkets and grocery stores provincial and municipal 
authorities have taken emergency steps to feed the needy no 
violence was reported friday 
alvaro alsogaray an economist and leader of the centerright 
union of the democratic center said alfonsin should step down 
before dec 10 when he is scheuled to be succeeded by 
presidentelect carlos menem of the peronist party 
the peronists defeated alfonsins cetrist radical civic union in 
the may 14 national elections the union of the democratic center 
finished third 
alsogaray in an inteview with radio continental said 
argentinas road is well marked social disintegration 
dissatisfaction and anguish 
hyperinflation that understands nothing of politics will 
continue marching on its own and the new government will find 
itself confronted by a situation of great complexity 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 for a sixyear term 
following elections that ended rule by military dictators since 
1976 alfonsin was barred by the consitution from seeking 
reelection 
he has said he would consider stepping down before dec 10 and 
his party and the peronists have been discussing an early transfer 
of power but they have been unable to reach an agreement 
some cities and town set up soup kitchens for adults and hot 
lunch programs for students in an effort to head off further 
violence they also regulated supermarket prices of flour milk 
pasta and other basic products 
the nation remained under a state of siege but few looting 
incidents and no clashes with police were reported friday 
several thousand paramilitary police remained on duty in the 
northern city of rosario but businesses opened normally and 
schools resumed classes for the first time since the monday when 
rioting broke out 
earlier this week the countrys biggest labor union and the most 
influential business group suggested alfonsin step down early 
expresident arturo frondizi said alfonsin should resign 
immediately 
one of the biggest obstacles to an early transferofpower 
agreement is the economy which for may will register an alarming 
70 percent rate of inflation or higher the beef and 
grainexporting nation is also plagued by a budget deficit and a 
59 billion foreign debt 
almost daily the austral devalues against the dollar the 
official price set by the central bank on tuesday is 175 to 1 
however foreign exchange houses wont sell dollars at the price 
and black market traders demanded up to 330 to 1 on friday 
the rate as recently as feb 3 was 18 to 1 it was the plunge in 
value of the austral that fueled inflation and record interest 
rates and touched off the economic crisis 
the nations biggest farm groups also have little sympathy for 
alfonsin whose election in october 1983 replaced a brutal military 
dictatorship and was expected to herald a return to prosperity as 
well as democracy 
the crisis is the direct consequence of a failed political 
economy the rural society group of large ranchers said in a 
statement 
in an effort to ease economic bottlenecks caused by a weekslong 
shortage of austral bills the central bank issued 50000austral 
notes friday 
the austral was worth 120 when it was introduced in june 1985 
today it is worth less than a penny and the 50000austral note is 
worth 285 at the official rate it sells for just 151 on the 
black market 
also friday the united leftist front demanded the government 
lift the 30day state of siege declared monday and free the several 
hundred people who remain in jail after being detained for looting 
or allegedly provoking disturbances

vermonts house speaker says he isnt 
concerned that wrights wrongs may lead some to the wrong wright 
house speaker ralph wright says he was talking with an 
eighthgrader thursday about a program for troubled youths wright 
runs in bennington 
yeah ive heard of you you quit yesterday the boy told 
the vermont speaker 
no that was jim wright the speaker of the us house and no 
relation to ralph the cloud of ethics violations under which the 
texan quit has left vermonts wright hoping folks get it right 
for months now vermont newspapers have been running headlines 
saying wright under investigation speaker wright faces 
ethics charges wright denies wrongdoing 
and ralph wright said there undoubtedly are some vermonters who 
thought he was the one in trouble 
now with jim wrights resignation ralph wright refers to 
himself as the last speaker wright left in america the 
national conference of state legislatures confimed that ralph 
wright is now the only house speaker in the nation 
vermonts wright got a chuckle in april when someone sent him a 
clipping from a maine newspaper the washingtondatelined story 
with a headline about wright facing a troubling ethics inquiry was 
accompanied by a small photograph of the vermont speaker 
perhaps adding to the confusion are that both speakers are 
whitehaired have a distinctive manner of speaking frequently 
wear glasses and are said to be skilled political horsetraders and 
highly effective at moving their agendas 
sometimes the confusion has come in handy on a trip to 
washington late last year wright stopped by to see david karvelas 
the chief of staff for freshman rep peter smith rvt told that 
karvelas was in a meeting with other administrative assistants 
wright says he got a quick response when he sent word with a page 
that speaker wright was there to see karvelas 
aside from the name confusion ralph wright said of jim wrights 
resignation theres not a lot funny about it its sort of a 
tragic thing 
as for any connection that voters might draw vermonts wright 
said i dont know how much of that rubs off or lasts it 
probably doesnt amount to a hill of beans 
ill take responsibility for anything i do but not for 
anything done by somebody who by accident has the same name or the 
same title 
one of the questionable deals pointed to by the house ethics 
committee in the case of texas wright had to do with collecting 
unusually high royalties on a book sold mainly to special interest 
groups 
vermonts wright said he doubted he would ever get in similar 
trouble i wouldnt write a book he said nobody would be 
interested in reading it

strikeslowed eastern airlines said friday it was 
requiring nonunion employees to work more hours for the same pay 
cutting management pay by 20 percent and eliminating vacations for 
the rest of the year 
the austerity measures were announced as a federal bankruptcy 
judge in new york kept alive hopes by striking employees that the 
enfeebled airline might be purchased by a friendly investor they 
are backing with their own money 
at a hearing us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland gave the 
investor group led by chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie 
until 2 pm edt monday to further refine a revised buyout 
proposal based on discussions with the airline and its major 
creditors 
the proposal would make former defense secretary frank carlucci 
chairman of the airline easterns lead attorney harvey miller 
told the bankruptcy hearing carlucci would succeed frank lorenzo 
chairman of easterns parent texas air 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for eastern told 
lifland he was impressed by a new version of the plan under which 
easterns unions would give 210 million in concessions and risk 
175 million to 200 million of their wages over six months by 
paying out any excess over target expenditures set by the airline 
it is an insurance policy said dan ashby a pilots union 
spokesman its a goodfaith gesture to show we want to return 
eastern to profitabiliy 
eastern sought protection from creditors under the bankruptcy 
laws five days after pilots and flight attendants joined its 
striking machinists union march 4 virtually grounding the airline 
eastern officials said the austerity program for nonunion 
employees which they described as temporary would help eastern 
emerge from bankruptcy reorganization 
were going to be as tight as we can as lean as we can and as 
productive as we can during this period thomas j matthews 
senior vice president for human resources probably the term that 
best describes this is belttightening 
the miamibased carrier said the changes were needed because of 
financial difficulties created by the 3monthold strike and its 
bankruptcy proceedings 
eastern spokesman james ashlock described the changes as 
austerity measures aimed at satisfying creditors as the airline 
moves ahead with its plan to reorganize as a smaller carrier 
under the program fulltime agents and clerical workers will be 
scheduled 50 hours a week for 40 hours of pay through dec 1 
management also will work at least 50 hours a week 
salaries of corporate officers including eastern president phil 
bakes will be reduced 20 percent through the end of the year and 
10 percent for the first six months of 1990 
no vacations will be allowed through the end of the year and no 
vacation credit will be accrued from march to december of this year 
the companys proposals for pilots and flight attendants will be 
discussed when negotiations with the unions representing those 
groups resume next week matthews said 
eastern is operating with 4500 to 5000 employees most of them 
in management positions down from 30000 before the strike

some bible readers soon will be putting batteries 
in the good book an electronic version of the scriptures delivered 
by a new handheld computer 
it is lighter and smaller than most printed bibles and it 
allows you to find a particular passage in just seconds lisa 
goorfin marketing director for franklin computer of mt holly 
nj said friday 
the company introduced its new holy bible computer at the 
consumer electronics show in chicago this week 
the computer 56 inches square and weighing 13 ounces will be 
available around christmas for 299 in either king james or revised 
standard versions said ms goorfin it will include the old 
testament and the new testament 
the computer which took two years to develop operates on four 
aa batteries 
the holy bible can be read as a book or used to identify a 
specific scripture by typing in a few key words she said for 
example entering the words valley shadow death will prompt 
the computer to respond with the 23rd psalm 
the computer includes a thesaurus so that it can find the 
correct passage even if the user does not know the exact words used 
in the passage a phonetic spelling feature allows the user to type 
the word the way it sounds even if that spelling is incorrect 
the bible is the most popular book in the world and our new 
computer is geared to anyone who might read it said ms goorfin 
clergymen said the computer could help people study the bible 
and perhaps encourage interest in scriptures by the younger 
generation 
were in the 20th century and this makes the word of god 
relevant to a technological society said the rev donald sharp 
pastor of faith tabernacle baptist church in chicago it is still 
the good book 
the rev edward barrett pastor of immaculate conception 
catholic church in waukegan said he did not think the computer 
version of the bible would replace the written one but might help 
peoples understanding 
the rev duane pederson pastor of edison park lutheran church 
said it might take time for the electronic version of the bible to 
catch on in churches 
the image of the bible is a book he said for a preacher 
to stand up and hold a computer and read from it doesnt have the 
same kind of impact 
but gods word is larger than a computer chip or a printed 
page he added the vehicle of gods word makes no difference 
to me

three reputed drug gang members should be 
spared from the electric chair and sentenced to life in prison for 
murdering four people in a crack cocaine war a jury recommended 
friday 
the defendants all from miami were convicted thursday in the 
murders of three men and a woman whose naked bodies were found 
sept 20 at a home in suburban pleasant grove the attackers bound 
and gagged the victims before shooting them in the head and 
slashing their throats 
the jury that convicted the defendants after 10 hours of 
deliberations took 50 minutes to decide to recommend life without 
parole for at least 25 years for timothy red robinson 22 and 
michael mac coleman 27 each had been found guilty of four 
firstdegree murder counts 
six of the 12 jurors voted for the death penalty but that fell 
short of the needed majority 
the vote was 111 for the same life sentence in the case of 
darrell yoge frazier 25 found guilty of one firstdegree 
murder count and three counts of seconddegree murder 
circuit judge nicholas geeker is not bound by the jurys 
recommendations he set a sentencing hearing for july 25 so lawyers 
can make arguments to him 
assistant state attorney michael patterson would not comment 
the prosecutor had recommended death for all three defendants 
telling jurors it was a cold calculated premeditated crime for 
money 
mothers of all three defendants appealed to the jury for mercy 
of all the evidence and testimony ive heard nobodys 
testified darrell killed anyone his mother alma frazier told 
jurors i dont believe he could have killed anyone 
she revealed that another son bruce jit frazier 21 a 
fugitive in the case phoned her two months ago 
i told him to turn himself in ms frazier said everyone 
wants to see it come to an end its like a nightmare 
all three mothers said their sons had tough childhoods in 
miamis liberty city an impoverished black neighborhood agitated 
by racial disturbances four times in the 1980s 
mary robinson painted a picture of a chaotic family life 
raising seven children with little support from an abusive husband 
she eventually divorced 
dolly leverson said her son coleman was considered a top 
basketball prospect but dropped out of school after the 10th grade 
she said she did not believe he committed the murders because in 
previous brushes with the law he had always admitted his 
involvement but this time he has maintained his innocence 
coleman was the only defendant to testify during the sentencing 
hearing 
i still say i did not commit any crime as god is my 
witness coleman said he noted genetic tests failed to link him 
with the rapes of two victims one of whom survived the attack 
coleman and robinson were convicted of two rape charges each 
defendant also was convicted of one count of attempted murder six 
of kidnapping one of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine two of 
robbery and one of breaking and entering

iranian president ali khamenei on friday 
indicated a need to check population growth but he did not advocate 
birth control an issue that has sparked debate among irans 
moslem theologians 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted khamenei as 
telling thousands of people at the weekly prayer meeting in tehran 
dont make an excuse of the prophet mohammed if you want to 
have more children 
he said islam initially encouraged large families because there 
were only about 100000 people in the arabian peninsula where the 
religion was founded 
but this does not mean that for the rest of history every 
moslem family is obliged to have 8 10 or 12 children he said 
irna monitored in nicosia also said the government was trying 
to encourage people to use contraceptives but there is no national 
plan to reduce the birthrate irans annual population growth of 
37 percent is among the highest in the world 
the agency quoted khamenei as saying he would not reject or 
insist on birth control 
irna said irans population now exceeds 50 million and it is 
expected to double in 20 years 
supporters and opponents of birth control have debated the issue 
in the news media 
some theologians said the government could implement controls 
without violating islamic law they said the koran calls on people 
to achieve happiness and if contraception is a way to gain 
happiness it is permissible 
others arued that contraception is against the will of god on 
grounds the birth of a child is an act of god

us rep donald lukens decision to 
stay in office despite being convicted of having sex with a 
teenage girl drew mixed reactions in his hometown friday but did 
not surprise state political leaders 
i think its ludicrous on his behalf to think that the public 
still trusts him said ron shumard a republican from 
middletown the public trust and his behavior are not compatible 
for him to carry on that kind of office 
lukens said in a statement friday he would retain his seat as he 
fights the misdemeanor conviction of contributing to the 
delinquency and unruliness of a minor 
declaring i am now fighting for my political life the 
58yearold republican said he would not allow the lies and 
deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin him 
lukens who is divorced was convicted of having sex at his 
columbus apartment on nov 6 with a girl who was then 16 he faces 
sentencing this month in franklin county domestic relations court 
but is appealing the verdict 
i dont think he should be left in there at all said david 
lenharr of middletown who described himself as a democrat but said 
he has voted republican in the past he dont deserve to 
represent our district 
but joe ferguson another democrat said the congressman should 
not be forced to step down 
he aint done more than a lot of other guys have done 
ferguson said he just happened to get caught i dont hold that 
against him 
on thursday ohio gop chairman robert bennett and gop leaders 
from lukens district joined in a call for the congressman to 
resign 
i think he is a bad apple for the republican party bennett 
said he has lost the support of the entire republican leadership 
of his district 
bennett said the party has no power to forcehis resignation but 
can withhold its support if he seeks reelection in 1990 
rep chalmers wylie of columbus the senior republican in ohios 
congressional delegation repeated a call he made hours after 
lukens conviction last friday for lukens to do the gentlemanly 
thing and resign 
hes just prolonging the agony that cannot help the interest 
of the institution of congress or buz lukens wylie said 
wylie said he had been told by a house ethics committee member 
last week that the panel would take up the matter of lukens 
conviction wylie declined to identify the member 
donald birgel chairman of the butler county gop in lukens home 
county said lukens announcement was predictable 
the issue is the people of this congressional district want a 
certain morality level of all the political leaders eeverything 
involved in this case is not an acceptable level of morality for a 
congressman and thats why we feel he should resign 
birgel added however that calling for lukens resignation is 
the most distasteful thing ive ever had to do in my adult life 
its depressing

while thousands of republicans flock to bush 
administration jobs in washington workers on gov michael s 
dukakis presidential campaign have been scattered by their 
candidates defeat seven months ago 
most of the top staffers have landed jobs to match their 
experience but for some the job search has been frustrating 
on friday former campaign manager susan estrich was delivering 
the commencement address at wellesley college top aide john sasso 
worked for his sixfigure salary at a boston advertising firm and 
master fundraiser robert farmer was in the midst of his usual 
12hour day raising money for the democratic national committee and 
working for a top washington lobbyist 
some former aides however worry about the breakup of the 
dukakisdemocrat family they say more has to be done by the dnc to 
keep the troops who ran the campaign a viable force 
the republicans have a tradition of taking care of their 
own said leslie dach former communications director for the 
dukakis campaign i dont think you see that on the democratic 
side 
theres no feeling out there that the people who gave months 
or years of their lives to elect a democratic president should be 
helped or rewarded said dach who works as public affairs 
director for edelman public relations in washington dc 
washington harvard university and the dukakis gubernatorial 
administration appear to be the most common receiving grounds for 
former campaign staffers jack corrigan and stephen rosenfeld who 
held top campaign positions are back as top aides to the governor 
whose popularity has suffered in recent months mindy lubber who 
handled scheduling for the dukakis campaign is now press secretary 
jack weeks the gregarious exboxer who handled press and 
advance work for dukakis and rightly or wrongly was blamed for 
setting up the famous tank photo opportunity that went so badly 
now is an administrator for the state department of public works 
and former campaign spokesman mark gearan is back in his old job as 
the governors federal state relations liaison 
in washington paul tully who made headlines for his 
participation in the videotape incident that resulted in us sen 
joseph bidens withdrawal from the presidential primaries now 
works as a policy director for the democratic national committee 
sasso who left the dukakis campaign following the biden 
incident and then returned in the final months enjoys relaxing 
on sundays instead of rushing to get up early to read all the 
papers and watch all the sunday shows now i decide where my son 
robert and i should go fishing he said 
susan brophy who went from delegate coordinator for dukakis to 
congressional staffer for us rep byron dorgan dnd agrees 
that the losing party in a presidential race must struggle to keep 
its operatives involved for her own part brophy says she feels 
obligated to work for a democrat in the 1992 presidential race 
but i would never quit my job and go work on a presidential 
campaign again she said 
says dach there are only so many doughnuts you can eat and 
only so many leaves of absence you can get from your kids and your 
wife before you realize youve had enough 
estrich who is returning to her harvard law school 
professorship after a vacation at a mexican health spa was the 
first woman to manage a major presidential campaign she praised 
dukakis for giving women leadership roles in politics 
but the closer we got to november the fewer women in the 
room most of the old hands were male hands estrich said 
although campaign bigwigs have secure jobs others are finding 
some employers unimpressed with the dukakis campaign experience on 
their resumes 
i have friends still out of work who run into that attitude 
said one former staffer who asked not to be named it comes with 
the territory of being defeated it seems to put a tag on you

washington ap former first lady nancy reagan was welcomed 
back to washington for the first time friday with a shower of hugs 
kisses and friendly barbs about the good old days from friends 
and former staffers 
dressed in a signature red aldofo dress but arriving bit late 
without the crack advance team that had once plotted her every 
move mrs reagan attended an elegant afternoon tea party eager to 
catch up on the four months that have gone by since she and 
president reagan bid washington adieu 
ive got a big scoop for you ive gained four pounds the 
stillthin mrs reagan exclaimed to one reporter as she swept 
through the group of wellwishers 
mrs reagan was in washington to address a library of congress 
symposium on first ladies memoirs and she promised that her own 
book expected out in the fall will be a pageturner 
im going to say everything i couldnt say for eight years 
she vowed 
sporting her secret service nickname rainbow on her shoulder 
identification tag the former first lady worked the crowd of about 
100 with oldtime political savvy sharing lengthy hugs and 
animated conversations with many among them her former maid anita 
costelo 
she assured those present that she and the former president 
absolutely love their california life and that they are both 
wonderful 
but it is a different world with a mischevious grin mrs 
reagan confessed to a group of reporters i even miss you 
among those present was a long list of former staff members 
including first hairdresser robin weir chiefs of staff joe canzeri 
and jim rosebush social secretaries linda faulkner and mabel 
brandon press secretaries elaine crispen and jennefer hirshberg 
personal secretary jane erckenbeck speechwriter landon parvin and 
press aides wendy weber toler and betsy koons 
mrs crispen said the fest was partly devised as a reunion and 
partly to celebrate the first ladys july 6 birthday and who was 
counting which one 
her nebulous age in the white house in fact she will be 68 
next month was the stuff of gentle ribbing 
washington post reporter donnie radcliffe welcomed mrs reagan 
on behalf of her former press corps recalling those days when 
journalists bore in on her image as a clothes horse highpriced 
china purchaser and white house decorator extraordinaire 
who would have ever thought eight years ago wed be talking 
about the good old days ms radcliffe quipped evoking an 
energetic and affirmative nod from mrs reagan 
the reporter reminded mrs reagan that shed always acted your 
age when you could decide what it would be and of the times 
when you couldnt do a thing with your hair because it messed up 
your crown 
mrs reagans alleged influence in highstakes foreign policy 
wasnt ignored nor was her grand rivalry with soviet first lady 
raisa gorbachev 
ms radcliffe kidded mrs reagan that after her famous 
teteatete with soviet foreign minister andre gromyko the 
official had gone right home and told raisa about it which is 
why you became such good friends 
cbs white house correspondent jacqueline adams added that 
reporters really did miss mrs reagans backstage talents for 
dealing with troublesome white house appointees especially at 
the time of john tower 
at that mrs reagan laughed so hard she hid her face in her 
hands 
ms radcliffe also advised mrs reagan that the group had 
arranged a vip tour of the bush white house for her but we 
figured you didnt need any more pictures of you bouncing on the 
lincoln bed 
and the assembly had intended to get a present for her but 
they were all out of puppies ms radcliffe joked in a reference 
to a current preoccupation of the new first lady barbara bush 
after mrs reagan was presented with a small needlepointed 
pillow adorned with her rainbow nickname she assured the 
group 
ive missed all of you we both have its wonderful to be in 
our own home but if you miss us thats nice too

a previously unknown group claimed 
responsibility friday for a plan to shoot down a helicopter 
carrying christian army commander gen michel aoun to cyprus 
the march 14 organization announces its responsibility for the 
operation our six strugglers arrested in cyprus recruited 
themselves to accomplish said a statement delivered to the 
privately owned sohofia news agency in west beirut 
six lebanese were arrested in cyprus south coast tourist resort 
of larnaca on may 26 and on monday after two scuba divers came 
across two sovietmade sa7 missiles and their launchers in 
watertight packing off the coast 
aoun 54 who also heads a christian military cabinet in 
lebanons dual government had been expecting an invitation to 
attend last weeks arab summit conference in casablanca morocco 
he would have been likely to travel by helicopter from his 
blockaded christian enclave to larnaca to catch a flight to 
casablanca but the invitation never materialized 
the march 14 organization apparently was named after the date 
aouns gunners based around yarze pounded mostly moslem west beirut 
for the first time in one of the heaviest barrages unleashed during 
an 11week confrontation with syrian troops and druse moslem

a preliminary hearing in the cotton club 
murder case was halted friday after the star witness blurted out 
surprise details of defendants alleged confessions prompting 
defense attorneys to cry foul 
the witness william rider said two defendants bragged about 
killing producer roy radin and one of them said he enjoyed 
shooting the big fat jew 
the lawyers accused prosecutors of purposely hiding the 
incriminating statements which had to be disclosed under 
california discovery laws deputy district attorney david conn 
insisted that he had disclosed the gist of the statements but 
municipal court judge patti jo mckay said that was not enough 
she stopped testimony and ordered prosecution investigators to 
appear in court monday to reveak what they know about riders 
planned testimony if more is uncovered she said she would grant 
the defense a continuance to prepare 
rider whose previous disclosures triggered the filing of 
charges in the sixyearold murder is considered the prosecutions 
most important witness he ties defendants alex lamota marti and 
william molony mentzer to the actual killing and implicates chief 
defendant karen delayne greenberger 
the prosecution contends mrs greenberger a reputed drug 
dealer arranged radins murder after they fought about her share 
of profits from the cotton club she had introduced radin to 
former paramount pictures chief robert evans who was dealing with 
radin in his attempts to finance the film 
in riders earlier statements he also said he was told that 
evans was involved in the radin slaying 
rider who was chief of security for hustler magazine publisher 
larry flynt said he had hired mentzer and marti as bodyguards he 
said both men boasted to him in may or june of 1983 about the radin 
murder 
in june he said mentzer and marti brought him a newspaper 
article about the discovery of radins body said it proved they 
were telling the truth and offered more details 
mr marti said that in reference to mr mentzer getting the 
courage to shoot mr radin that he had to drink a bottle of wine 
before mr marti shot first and emptied his gun into mr radin and 
mr mentzer followed suit said rider 
what else did mr marti say asked deputy district attorney 
david conn 
just that he hated jews and he enjoyed shooting the big fat 
jew said rider 
judge mckay had ordered that every person entering the courtroom 
be searched before rider who is flynts former brotherinlaw 
arrived with his retinue of burly bodyguards 
the halt in testimony came on the same day that former tv star 
demond wilson contradicted his earlier testimony denying that 
radin had expressed fear of danger because of his involvement in 
the cotton club 
wilsons startling flipflop came moments before he ended three 
days on the stand after wilson left mrs greenbergers attorney 
edward shohat asked the judge to throw out the actors testimony 
youre dealing with a witness who would say anything thats 
convenient at the time he said but the judge denied the motion 
wilson the former star of tvs sanford and son was one of 
the last people to see radin alive he testified wednesday that 
radin a new york theatrical producer expressed fear for his life 
because of negotiations to finance the movie 
he asked me to follow and just watch and see if anything 
happened wilson said then he said that there might be some 
trouble he said that something might happen to him as a result of 
his association with the film thing the cotton club 
but wilson changed that account friday 
under rapid fire crossexamination by attorney david kenner 
wilson said i didnt hear him talk about the cotton club 
then he amended his remark saying i had heard him talk about it 
but it was a pipe dream he was talking about a film sometimes 
films werent even named 
also charged in the case is robert ulmer lowe who is fighting 
extradition in maryland

worked for more than 20 years as a director of clinical services 
said hospital spokesman james leach 
a mother and her three children were in another car that was hit 
by the steeple but left burbank hospital without being treated 
greene said 
a church spire atop the faith united church also toppled 
sending chunks of brownstone from the church flying into the 
street both churches are within 150 yards of each other on the 
fitchburg common 
fire officials said other people were trapped in cars by a maze 
of fallen wires in the center of this largely working class city of 
39000 people 45 miles west of boston 
a 19yearold man and a 24yearold man were treated and 
released for injuries sustained from debris flying in the air said

and wires in winds clocked at up to 80 mph declared a state of 
emergency said douglas forbes of the massachusetts civil defense

both sides in the abortion battle are squaring 
off over a morning after abortion pill that is available in 
france but not in the united states

encourage a boycott of products distributed by an american 
affiliate of the french manufacturer of the pill if there is an 
attempt to license the drug in the united states 
and on the other side leaders of the national organization for 
women and the fund for the feminist majority call such tactics 
medical mccarthyism and are preparing to lobby federal health 
officials and commercial drug companies to start american testing

of the elective abortions in france and is being studied for the

swept into power eight years ago promising 
radical changes for greece premier andreas papandreou is battling 
for his political survival in elections june 18 
the 70yearold leader is beset by allegations of widespread 
corruption among senior members of his ruling panhellenic socialist 
movement pasok and accusations that he failed to implement many 
socialist reforms he espoused when first elected in 1981 
hes also in the midst of divorcing his americanborn wife of 38 
years to take up with a former airline stewardess half his age 
but friends and foes alike admit that papandreou an economics 
professor in the united states before returning to political life 
in greece is far from beaten he still retains an oratorical flair 
and personal appeal that gave him 48 percent of the popular vote in 
1981 and 46 percent in 1985 
papandreou is banking on support from greeces rural areas 
where socialist policies have had more success than in the cities 
socialism democracy patriotism peace these were the goals 
of the popular movement in our country he told a recent rally 
pasok continues this popular movement today our enemy is not the 
left it is the right 
opposition parties claim papandreou has ignored many of the 
accusations against him and tried instead to polarize the 
electorate 
he has also skirted the issue of his personal life choosing 
instead to allow his livein companion 35yearold dimitra liani 
to accompany him on campaign trips 
papandreous open affair with ms liani has hurt his personal 
popularity but public interest in the relationship seems to be 
dying down 
people are tired about hearing about his personal life people 
want to talk about economic and social issues people want to know 
whats happening said theodoros pangalos deputy foreign 
minister and a member of pasoks executive council 
papandreou has said his affair with ms liani hurt his standing 
in the polls but added that he made it public because he was 
committed to the tall blonde 
i knew this would have a cost but it was not a passing thing 
it was a relationship it was a way of life he said in an 
interview with a greek newspaper 
he has also speeded up the divorce suit filed against his wife 
margaret 66 in hopes of having it over with and pasok sources 
say to marry ms liani before the elections 
he has been married to the former margaret chant of elmhurst 
ill since 1951 they have four children and two grandchildren 
one of the children 37yearold george papandreou is a pasok 
member of parliament mrs papandreou still lives in greece 
to improve his image and pick up support from leftist voters 
papandreou has also promised to submit any agreement in current 
negotiations on the future of four us military bases in greece to 
a national referendum if he wins the elections 
but economic problems and a seesawing foreign policy have eroded 
popular support for the socialists 
greeces response to international terrorism has also angered 
some of the countrys nato allies in december the government 
freed and put on a plane to libya a palestinian wanted by italy for 
a 1982 bomb attack against romes main synagogue that killed a 
child there have also been repeated delays in extraditing 
suspected terrorist to the united states 
allegations of involvement in a multimillion dollar scandal 
surrounding fugitive greek banker george koskotas has tested the 
premiers appeal 
koskotas fled greece in november after being indicted in a 200 
millionfraud forgery and embezzlement scandal koskotas the 
chairman of the bank of crete was arrested in the united states 
and is jailed in salem mass awaiting an extradition hearing 
he has alleged in interviews from jail that papandreou and other 
senior socialist officials were given millions of dollars in 
payoffs and authorized the looting of his bank 
papandreou in turn has accused the us central intelligence 
agency and the american establishment of trying to orchestrate 
his political demise 
the main conservative opposition new democracy party led by 
constantine mitsotakis has been hammering away at the governments 
handling of the koskotas scandal since it first surfaced more than 
eight months ago 
although new democracy leads pasok by about 7 percentage points 
in recent public opinion polls and is favored to win a majority in 
the 300member single chamber parliament political analysts say 
the 70yearold mitsotakis falls short against papandreou in 
popularity 
this stems from his failure to defeat papandreou in the 1985 
elections and from from his alleged involvement in a series of 
political intrigues in the mid1960s the socialists claim these 
intrigues paved the way for the 196774 military dictatorship

as spring moves toward summer some 
japanese farmers are tending rosebushes instead of transplanting 
rice seedlings in fields now in retirement after centuries of rice 
cultivation 
the governmentsubsidized shift from traditional rice into 
fruits vegetables and flowers has rescued some farmers whose 
fields were too small to provide a livable income from rice 
flooded rice paddies here in yamagata prefecture now are watery 
mirrors reflecting the steep mountains of northern japan 
even so japan still grows more rice than it eats and the 
farmers still have a long list of complaints chiefly foreign 
competition for one thing the united states is pressuring the 
government to allow the import of us rice which would cost 
japanese consumers less than their homegrown variety 
when i started farming when i was 18 i did not feel 
threatened that much by foreign competition said yuichi kuroda 
41 it has just been the last few years i have felt threatened by 
produce from abroad 
kuroda converted his 27acre farm from rice to tomatoes 
flowers organically grown spinach and other vegetables raised in 
plastic greenhouses and thus isnt worried about rice imports 
but when he goes to the supermarket he sees asparagus pumpkins 
and kiwi fruits from mexico the philippines and new zealand 
i do feel a lot of competition he said 
rice cultivation was relatively stable kuroda said as the 
government buys any farmers output at a subsidized price while he 
has to sell his own produce now at prices set by auction 
a few miles away masayoshi goto still grows rice he was in 
muddy boots as he supervised his 19yearold son naoto operating 
an ingenious machine that takes pads of rice seedlings feeds them 
into rows of wheels and plops them in neat lines in the flooded 
paddy 
the 11000 motorized transplanting machine though not in use 
by all farmers reduces the physical agony of bentover 
handtransplanting that causes farmers disease permanently 
bent backs seen on many older people in yamagata 
about 80 percent of rice farms in japan are 25 acres or 
smaller and the owners usually are parttime farmers with another 
steady job but goto owns 112 acres and harvests an additional 86 
acres of leased land making him a fulltime farmer 
he said the international pressure on rice had moved him to 
convert some land to cherry trees 
his son naoto is a student at an agriculture college and will 
take over the farm but goto said as a father i have second 
thoughts about telling my son to succeed to my farm 
asked how he would react if the government decided to permit 
some rice imports he said i dont want it to happen but if it 
does we would try to produce more topquality rice 
quality goes into growing cherries too 
kenjiro kikuchi 52 has converted half of his five acres from 
rice to cherries in the early 1970s and said he earned much more 
than before 
his trees thrive in tents of plastic over metaltube frames to 
keep rain from bruising the cherries the ground is covered with 
metallic foil to reflect light on to the bottom of the cherries so 
they ripen uniformly a heater in the tent keeps the temperature 
right kikuchi said only organic fertilizer was used 
the result a subtly delicious firm evenly red cherries that 
sell for 86 cents each the kind that wellheeled japanese buy in 
boxes of 100 as gifts 
such expensive produce has helped make yamagata a prosperous 
stable city of 250000 people 
greenhouses have altered the classic countryside supplanting 
rectangular rice paddies with an industrial look nowhere more 
evident than in a rosegrowing operation that burns old tires to 
heat the glassenclosed greenhouses 
kouji takeda 27 said his family had converted from rice to 
roses about 10 years ago when it seemed quite a risk but now i 
think it was a good decision now we make a better living 
his mother kimiko agreed from a womans point of view 
growing roses is more pleasant than growing rice

in the white house and probably in your house 
as well as on wall street and in academia the question is the 
same why dont americans save more of their paychecks 
if the japanese and italians can save doubledigit percentages 
of income why is it that american workers some of whom work 
second jobs and also benefit from working spouses saved on average 
less than 5 percent of their income last year 
the answer isnt made any clearer by results of a purdue 
university professors studies which show that families in which 
one or both spouses work a second moonlight job still are apt to 
have problems putting money away 
you would think that married couples where each spouse has a 
job should be able to get by comfortably without taking on extra 
work says professor a charlene sullivan but she says it 
isnt always so 
her studies suggest but leave unanswered an intriguing 
consideration it is difficult to tell from her research she says 
if households work extra hours to pay existing debts or if they 
take on extra work to raise living standards 
in analyzing data on 600 married couples sullivan found a 
tendency for some of those with dual and extra incomes to live 
beyond their means to feel they have too much debt and to say 
credit cards do more harm than good 
in such feelings is a suggestion that the savings problem lies 
as much in the psyche as in the paycheck as much in understanding 
human expectations as in understanding needs as much in the study 
of psychology as of economics 
but even greater insight into the phenomenon might be obtained 
by analyzing the ingenious american marketing techniques which day 
and night direct an incessant barrage of stimuli at the consumer 
buy buy buy 
the barrage conditions the targets makes them view themselves 
as buyers rather than savers evidence of this is reflected in such 
statements as i must turn in my car its four years old or 
this is our first house well move up to something bigger in a 
couple of years 
the dazzling image of a better life is forever before 
americans a new kitchen a better vacation an ingenious 
electronic gadget you simply cannot do without in fact a new you 
via vitamins and a health club membership 
of course this scenario doesnt fit millions of americans 
fighting to make ends meet on inadequate incomes they fail to save 
because medical care costs so much because rents are so high 
because food prices wont fall 
and it must be observed that the savings rate problem is more 
complex than it might appear involving such seemingly disparate 
matters as the us budget deficit federal reserve policy and the 
price of imported oil 
but it is obvious that for millions of americans the failure to 
save isnt because they earn so little but because they feel 
compelled to spend so much urged on by the everpresent reminder 
that a better life can be theirs 
now not later life is to be lived at this moment not in some 
vague and distant future once it was a fight to keep up with the 
joneses but these days even the joneses are made to appear stodgy 
by the latest magazine spread 
easy credit paves the road and brings the vague future from way 
out there to right here now crystal clear no longer need you 
apply for a loan the lender applies to you and even sends you his 
card 
accompanying it is a brochure that spreads the possibilities 
before your eyes in clear colorful dazzling irresistable 
perspective cars gadgets boats vacations now not later 
its buy buy buy and that means bye bye savings rate

hbos new anthology series tales from the 
crypt might be based on comicbook stories from the 1940s and 
1950s but it is definitely not for kids 
hbo in fact pitches the series as an adult anthology no 
doubt due to the rrated nudity language and violence 
the first three halfhour stories in the series premiering as a 
trilogy on saturday june 10 and running as separate films at 
various times in june and july are stylishly directed by top 
filmmakers robert zemeckis back to the future who framed 
roger rabbit walter hill 48 hours and richard donner 
superman lethal weapon 
the first in the trilogy the man who was death was 
directed by hill and stars bill sadler as a state executioner who 
decides to go free ance when the death penalty is outlawed by the 
supreme court 
zemeckis directed and all through the house a tasteless 
christmas eve horror story larry drake who plays the gentle 
retarded office assistant from la law is cast here as a 
homicidal escapee from an insane asylum roaming a suburban 
neighborhood dressed as santa claus and hatcheting residents 
donners offering is dig that cat hes real gone an 
amusingly nasty comedy about a bum joe pantoliano who is given 
the nine lives of a cat in a scientists experiment the bum 
ulric turns the gift into a lucrative circus act but and you 
can see this one coming a mile away he has a slight problem 
keeping track of how many lives hes used up 
in between the stories viewers are entertained by an unpleasant 
creaturehost the cryptkeeper a specialeffects creation of 
kevin yagher who created the freddy krueger makeup and effects for 
the nightmare on elm street movies 
the three stories were originally published by william m gaines 
in the comics haunt of fear tales from the crypt and vault of 
horror gaines is better known nowadays as the publisher of mad 
magazine 
of the three the most engaging is the man who was death 
probably because its deathpenalty motif is the most relevant on 
some other plane than sheer gory entertainment theres even room 
from some analysis of the storys symbolism towit the hypocrisy 
illustrated by the states use of the executioner who finds 
himself faced with the punishment he had onced meted out on behalf 
of the state just because he did what the state once paid him to 
do nah 
the script by robert reneau action jackson and hill has 
some clever if mostly vulgar dialogue when niles is canned by the 
prison system he talks to his bartender about the efficacy of 
televising executions if they put executions on tv itd be the 
highestrated show ever be nielsens through the roof other 
networks would start killin people just to compete pretty soon 
geraldo rivera be pullin that switch 
the piece has a filmnoir look and an appropriately haunting 
score by ry cooder 
dig that cat hes real gone also makes light of death 
in this case what happens to a man who is not affected by it he 
becomes careless 
the film has the slick look of donners hand and pantoliano 
empire of the sun shows a comic flar as the enterprising star 
of the circus attraction see ulric die kathleen york is nicely 
ditzy as his opportunistic girlfriend utlimately though seeing 
ulric die over and over for 30 minutes gets tedious and the 
predictable ending is no payoff 
zemeckis drew and all through the house the silliest of 
the three and the one with the least story being more in the style 
of the scary tale told round the campfire mary ellen trainor 
playing a vengeful housewife who becomes santas prey is a great 
screamer and the squeaky doors howling winds and invitingly open 
windows will cause the most jaded viewer to squirm a little 
and hey its summer with network television droning on in 
reruns being scared witless by tales from the crypt might be a 
suitable alternative to being bored silly

fans longing for a husker du reunion beware bob 
mould has never been happier 
it just comes to where you accept things the way they are 
explained the 28yearold guitarist who has released his first 
album workbook since the punk trio broke up in 1987 
when youre young you fight and rebel i just dont think i 
will be doing that in 20 years because i dont think i will be 
physically capable 
he would have a hard time maintaining the pace of his days in 
husker du the band emerged from st paul minn in the early 
1980s and captured a devoted audience with a string of powerful 
albums that displayed a manic desperate energy comparable to the 
early who 
mould who sings new day rising and ill never forget 
you like a drowning man going under for the last time is more 
reflective on workbook the songs range from the upbeat single 
see a little light to the angry poison years to the 
confessional sinners and their repentance mould even starts 
the album with a lowkey instrumental sunspots 
as you get older you get a little closer to real emotions 
he said its wonderful to express anger and frustration but 
there are other emotions there are a lot of different things out 
there 
mould was attending macalester college in st paul when he met 
drummer grant hart and bassist greg norton the three were soon 
jamming in nortons basement writing songs that mould thought were 
real abrasive and real fast 
their first album land speed record came out in 1982 and 
they maintained an exhaustive pace of recording and touring over 
the next few years the band prided itself on equality with all 
three members contributing material and stayed true to the punk 
spirit by remaining accessible to the public 
but after releasing the double album warehouse songs and 
stories hukser du bitterly parted ways with disputes over 
songwriting credits and accusations of drug abuse 
i think immediately upon my leaving i felt a great sense of 
release mould said you have to let go of things like that it 
became a situation where we could not work together again then you 
wonder what to do 
i think over the course of time you start bringing in certain 
elements of the group you know the others wont like i felt like 
that was getting a little frustrating 
he cited the difficulty in remaining committed to the sound that 
attracted listeners to husker du it was almost becoming the 
point where i had no emotions it was just a blur of white noise 
emotionally i was not attached to it because i no longer felt that 
way we were doing what people expected us to do 
after the breakup mould decided to spend some time alone 
working on songs that were for himself and not for public 
consumption he listened to classical music and became interested 
in incorporating the cello into his own writing 
its a very emotional instrument said mould who recruited 
cellist jane scarpantoni for the album the instrument has a very 
high frequency a very beautiful sound when i started looking at 
the material i was writing i saw the need for one more instrument 
to bridge those melodies the cello seemed best 
the cello is best heard on the haunting ballad sinners and 
their repentance which mould described as a meditation on 
feelings of guilt and responsibility 
i think its a situation where people get themselves into a 
predicament and do a shameful thing and immediately go into a 
repentance mode will it really be better you break down and cry 
and apologize profusely but will it really be better i think some 
things leave emotional scars and they dont really heal 
mould was especially pleased with poison years insisting he 
could never have written the song a few years ago 
i didnt have it in me he said theres something about 
the way it builds and lets go dynamically im pretty happy with 
it there are really powerful moments 
mould sees winning over husker du fans as his biggest problem 
he admits that audience expectations could make acceptance for his 
solo album more difficult 
this first record and this whole period will be a little 
tough people will see my name and trigger up the past and trigger 
up the present hopefully theyll give it a full listen my name 
has never been that big on a record its always been a group

by the typically bonedry account of sen alan 
simpson all the next speaker of the house need do is ask and the 
republicans will leave town 
for the charm of thomas stephen foley is so pure says simpson 
that he can tell you to go to hell and make you look forward to 
the trip 
simpson the assistant republican leader of the senate didnt 
say whether any one had ever received such an invitation from 
foley but no one denies that the foley a washington democrat 
knows how to move people if ever so gently a little at a time 
as house majority leader foley won nearly universal admiration 
from both sides of the aisle for his scholarly command of issues 
personal cordiality and the patience of job 
now as the likely successor to jim wright who is surrendering 
both his speakers throne and his house seat in the face of a 
wrenching ethics investigation the fatherly team player from 
spokane steps today into the job called the secondmost powerful in 
government 
though both trace their roots to franklin roosevelts new deal 
wright was a lone wolf foley a faithful companion among political 
peers the ambitious wright climbed through the ranks foley was 
lifted and nudged through them partly by his colleagues partly by 
political accident 
a tireless negotiator foley wields power through 
consensusbuilding and compromise by contrast wright acknowledged 
in his swan song to the house that he perhaps had been too 
partisan too insistent too abrasive too determined to have my 
way 
foley is no kneejerk liberal and wouldnt have lasted in the 
house if he were unlike most leaders whose seats are safe 
foley is from a distinctly republican and conservative district 
that has put him through many close elections 
though handpicked for the houses elite by wright and his 
predecessor former speaker thomas p tip oneill foley never 
shared their penchant for partisan chestthumping oneill admired 
foley most for qualities he admittedly didnt possess himself 
meticulous craftsmanship of legislation thorough command of the 
issues attention to organizational detail 
tom foley oneill once said in both exasperation and 
respect is a man who can see three sides of every issue 
sometimes more rep norman dicks dwash tells about the time 
that a colleague rushed to the house floor at the last moment and 
implored foley to tell him if there were any reasons he should vote 
against the bill 
the congenial foley laid out seven significant reasons 
dicks recalled and the member promptly voted no then just as 
the electronic tote board was switching off the fellow noticed 
foley had voted yes he was furious foley merely replied 
you didnt ask me for all the reasons why the bill is good 
when foley was first elected in 1964 younger members of 
congress were left with little to do but follow their leaders 
thats not how the house works today and foley is a beneficiary of 
the postwatergate revolt against the seniority system and the 
diffusion of power 
the reality is that in a modern participatory congress 
the responsibility of leadership and the necessity of leadership is 
to constantly involve members in the process of decision and 
consensus foley says 
according to rep pat williams dmont the troika of wright 
foley and soontoresign democratic whip tony coelho of california 
has worked like this jim the captain tony the oar drummer 
and tom the navigator democrats in the house and most republicans 
have great respect for the navigator 
foleys office furnishings reflect his leadership philosophy 
instead of the big imposing desk preferred by most members of 
congress foley has a coffee table surrounded by enough sofas and 
chairs to accommodate at least 18 visitors his belgian shephard 
alice can usually be found lounging on one of the carpets of 
vibrant blues and reds 
another part of foleys design for success comes from a lesson 
he says he learned from saint exuperys the little prince in 
which the old courtier advises his charge that the way to get power 
is to order people to do precisely what they wanted to do in the 
first place 
whatever the tricks of his trade the results are inarguable 
foley and his coffee table have been at the center of some of the 
most important legislation invariably compromises to emerge from 
congress in this decade 
just this year foley was host of the extraordinary talks that 
in midapril produced a budget agreement for the next fiscal year 
and he was pivotal in the bipartisan deal with the bush 
administration over central america policy 
a year earlier he chaired the economic summit sessions that 
followed the october 1987 crash of the stock market prior to that 
he engineered the final agreements on the grammrudman budget law 
and arms control policies shared by congress and the white house 
tom foley is just a very able capable individual says bob 
michel of illinois the house republican leader hes wellliked 
on our side and hes also recognized as a very formidable 
opponent one who will state the case well and is eminently fair 
hes a man of total integrity said senate republican leader 
bob dole rkan he knows the players knows the issues and 
this from rep henry hyde rill i wish he were a republican 
if he were he could be a presidential candidate 
in a recent poll of senior congressional staffers foley was the 
overwhelming choice as the most respected member of the house and 
a republican colleague has long had a foley for speaker button 
hidden in his desk 
throughout wrights travails foley brushed aside such talk 
still he acknowledged its like asking somebody in the army 
would you like to be general sure 
even that was something of a grudging confession from foley who 
has been criticized more than once for lacking both personal and 
partisan drive he came to washington in 1961 as an aide to sen 
henry m jackson dwash and likely would have served jackson 
until the senators death if the boss hadnt given him a swift kick 
into the elective current 
despite being urged by other state democrats to run for the 
house in 1964 foley had virtually decided against it when jackson 
and joseph drumheller a party bankroller blew up at him right at 
the filing deadline for passing the opportunity foley filed and 
no small thanks to lyndon johnsons landslide wrested away the 5th 
district seat which had been held by republicans for 22 years 
hes been reelected since surviving close tests in 1976 1978 
and 1980 in the sprawling district known as the inland empire 
stretching from the pine forests near the canadian border to the 
rolling wheat fields of the palouse near the oregon line it is an 
area where conservatism still runs deep where the pickup trucks 
are adorned with bumper stickers reading we dont brake for 
liberals

i dont have any trouble communicating with my constituency 
says foley you seldom get elected if your constituency doesnt 
like you if youre out of touch you will find out in the next 
election 
his voting record is mainstream democrat with consistently high 
marks from liberal and labor groups and low scores from the right 
but hes also earned an a from the national rifle association 
for his opposition to gun control legislation 
i can be partisan and hold the democratic position as well as 
anyone said foley my idea of partisanship is not making a 
deskpounding speech i dont think that persuades anyone 
besides he says its hard for one party to just run over the 
other i think whats done around here that has some lasting value 
usually has some element of bipartisanship about it 
foley inherited his knack for getting along with republicans 
from his father a democrat and lawyer who managed to win election 
first as prosecutor then as judge in conservative spokane he 
recalls with a grin that his gop neighbors treated the family 
almost as practitioners of a strange religion 
he says his childhood was comfortable but one in which his 
father took pains to make sure young tom understood the social 
upheaval of the great depression by showing him the shantytowns 
the long unemployment lines and people waiting for a handout at the 
back door of the hospital 
after graduating from the university of washington law school in 
1957 foley seemed destined to follow in his fathers footsteps he 
was a deputy city prosecutor for two years and an assistant state 
attorney general for another year but then jackson beckoned him to 
washington dc where he became counsel for the senate interior 
committee 
some democrats find him too fair says rep barney frank 
dmass he is a superb leader but in franks view its 
probably a good thing that there arent many others like foley in 
the leadership we might cross the line that divides a political 
body from a seminar he said 
foleys wife heather 48 a graduate of georgetown university 
law center has managed his office without pay since 1970 they 
have no children but she rarely travels with her husband staying 
behind to tend to the administrative chores 
neither is big on the party circuit foley 6foot4 exercises 
alone or takes long walks with dog alice to stay trim sometimes 
striding from his embassy row apartment to the capitol about 40 
minutes but unlike most of his colleagues he cares little about 
organized sports 
he is a fluent television performer blessed with handsome 
physical features a nearphotographic memory and a quick sense of 
humor the only thing unlike oneill or wright that he ever 
fires from the hip once braced with a question about a state 
prison inmate who challenged him in the democratic primary foley 
deadpanned that his opponent was running a guarded campaign 
his memory is a source for amazement among political circles he 
has been known to cite documents almost verbatim in legislative 
meetings and he almost never speaks from a prepared text during a 
visit to the soviet union his hosts were so impressed by his 
extemporized speeches that they speculated that his pocket 
calculator was really a miniature teleprompter 
some believe foleys destiny lies beyond the speakers office a 
couple years back former democratic national chairman robert s 
strauss declared theres no one in america republican or 
democrat more qualified for the presidency than tom foley 
dicks agrees saying if we had a parliamentary system foley 
would have been president a long time ago 
meanwhile many see him as just the right man to pull congress 
out of the partisan backwash from the john tower and jim wright 
battles hes the great conciliator said dicks hell debate 
people but he doesnt leave people bloodied

barry manilow who has had a devoted following 
since he first warbled mandy 15 years ago has more fans than 
ever today 
and now he can also count music critics as fans as he continues 
an extensive tour that began in november 1987 and will run through 
1990 
this is the first tour that the reviews have been consistently 
good said manilow whose monthlong engagement on broadway at 
the gershwin theater has been extended most of the time theyve 
been fair to awful it turned around all of a sudden but itll 
probably change back to them hating this new album its the kind 
they have always not liked 
the album barry manilow returns to what he does best big 
romantic pop ballads 
ive always been a misfit musically the 43yearold 
singersongwriter said in an interview i come from the kind of 
music that happened before rock n roll im not that old but i 
was not affected by the rock n roll that most people were being 
affected by i was affected by show tunes jazz and songs written 
by harold arlen and irving berlin because my parents reacted to 
that 
that type of person shouldnt draw big crowds and have hit 
records and i did the critics never were happy with that 
manilow doesnt like what he hears played on the radio these 
days the songs are about having a great party i have to 
believe there is more to all this work i do than just convincing 
people to have a great party i have to believe there are 
people who want to be moved by emotions 
his bundle of hits includes i write the songs tryin to 
get the feeling again this ones for you and i cant smile 
without you his new single is keep each other warm what he 
doesnt write for his albums arista records president clive davis 
selects for him he left arista in 198586 for rca and has since 
returned 
when i was away from arista clive continued to put songs away 
for me he knew wed get together again after i was sowing my wild 
notes manilow said 
when he returned to arista he and davis agreed hed do a swing 
album first then the current pop one 
i wasnt in favor of making a pop album he said i 
couldnt hear a space for my kind of pop music on the radio clive 
says theres a lack of this kind of music on the radio and it has 
to come back 
if this pop record takes off id be foolish not to follow 
that for awhile i cant predict the future but maybe ill do a pop 
album with a couple of jazz songs on it 
in 1984 manilow cut 200 am paradise cafe with some 
noted jazz musicians he calls it the highlight of his career 
im learning not to be attached to the results the reason we 
do things is to create something beautiful that youre proud of 
you hope people like it eight years ago i would live for 
wednesdays when chart information comes out now unless they call 
with the numbers i forget about them 
manilows autobiography sweet life adventures on the way to 
paradise was published in 1987 other writers praised its style 
and tone and manilow says proudly that it wasnt ghost written 
in the book he attacks nobody is frank about personality 
failings talks about being bette midlers musical director and 
about linda allen the movie set decorator with whom he lives and 
recounts finding out in 1981 that he only had 11000 in the bank 
investment advisers had lost the money manilow made in six years of 
superstardom he didnt lose the homes he owned in bel air and palm 
springs calif 
when i was told i didnt have any bread i went to work and 
worked harder than i ever worked before the singer said 
luckily i was able to pull it back together im still working 
at it you dont need to feel sorry for me but im not anywhere 
near where i should have been about 10 years ago 
after having that kind of good fortune to not have anything 
to show for it was a disgusting story there werent any criminals 
it was bad management and bad advice itll never happen again 
its a good lesson for all of us take responsibility for your 
life 
his relations with midler were never strained i wrote a song 
for her perfect isnt easy but its me which she sang as a 
pampered french poodle in oliver and company we were in the 
studio a couple of days together and had a good time 
the show hes doing on broadway also is organized as 
autobiography we wanted to make it a theatrical production as 
opposed to a pop concert fictitious story lines all felt 
contrived the only thing that felt honest was pulling pieces of my 
life out 
he hopes to write a broadway musical and star in it possibly 
about the life of danny kaye 
after he closes on broadway and before the tour resumes in the 
fall he plans to do nothing i dont know whether ill be able 
to do that im one of those overachieving jewish brooklyn guys 
who cant rest until theres 15 projects going at once 
im storing up on books he said i can chain myself to a 
chaise lounge and read ive got books on how to become a 
better person i want to read the works of jung i want to learn 
about a year ago i enrolled in a shortstorywriting course 
under an assumed name at the university of california at berkeley 
one of my fantasies is going to college i would be a great 
student i would be raising my hand every five minutes putting my 
two cents in

on a small patch of fertile ground in 
southern idaho the ihler family is quietly doing its part to 
change the way america farms 
when a growthregulating chemical called alar made headlines 
this year as a potential health hazard and grocers yanked apples 
from their counters the ihlers shook their heads with an 
itoldyouso smile 
when their potatofarming neighbors panicked at a recent 
government report questioning the safety of aldicarb a widely used 
insecticide the ihlers werent surprised 
agriculture is in the dark ages said rick ihler 
the ihlers brothers rick and terry and their father dick 
have preached for years that the path to agricultural enlightenment 
lies in organic farming suddenly people seem to be listening 
even in conservative regions like these irrigated drylands where 
new farming ideas run up against deeprooted traditions 
pesticides and chemical fertilizers which brought farmers here 
and across the country into the green revolution now are getting 
bad press 
consumers are clamoring for organic fruits and vegetbles a 
louis harris poll conducted in november for organic gardening 
magazine said 84 percent of americans said they would buy 
organically grown food if it was available and 49 percent would 
pay more for it 
more mainstream farmers jolted by consumers concerns rising 
chemical costs and depleted soils are taking a second look at a 
farming approach they once dismissed as a fad practiced by 
sandalwearing hippies 
the lesson from the ihlers holly farms is that organic farming 
can work but it doesnt come easy 
theyve had to fight not only insects weather and weeds but a 
firmly entrenched agribusiness establishment geared toward chemical 
dependence 
to farm organically is to buck the system rick ihler said 
recently taking a break from planting carrots on a windy day 
organic farming is still considered offthewall in idaho 
the ihlers made the switch to organic farming in 1981 they had 
been farming more than 4000 acres most of it on rented land like 
many farmers they depended on bank loans to make it from one 
harvest to the next 
we got fed up with it all we were doing was financing the 
bankers pocketbook rick said 
they shrank their operation back to the 103acre family farm and 
set about finding natural substitutes for the manmade chemicals 
they had been using 
we learned from trial and error rick said today they grow 
carrots peas onions barley hay potatoes radishes and beans on 
their irrigated acreage 
their methods range from lowtech to high from spreading 
composted sheep dung to dragging a highvoltage weed zapper behind 
a tractor they rotate crops sow nitrogenfixing plants such as 
peas and clover and use natural products such as kelp extracts and 
microfungi 
dick ihler 56 a tattooed korean war veteran who is clearly not 
part of the sandalwearing crowd nevertheless acknowledges talking 
to carrots and experimenting with pyramids and crystals as energy 
sources for the crops 
there are a lot of things you cant tell people because they 
wont believe you said rick 
not that they arent asking the ihlers have received calls from 
dozens of farmers wanting to know how to go organic organic 
farming trade groups around the country are being swamped with 
requests for information 
spurred by the recent pesticide scares mainstream trade groups 
and researchers also are pursuing ways to reduce farmers 
dependence on manmade pesticides and fertilizers 
yet organic farmers still are a tiny minority even in 
california where most of the countrys organic produce is grown 
organic farms make up less than 1 percent of the total 
in idaho the numbers are even smaller 
dick ihler grew up here but hes still trying to convince some 
neighbors he wasnt corrupted by the 16 years he spent in 
california before moving back to the fammily farm in 1972 
holly farms operates outside the traditional marketing and 
distribution system a typical idaho potato farmer for example 
must sell his spuds to one of a few big corporate processors the 
ihlers have had to cultivate their customers as carefully as their 
fields 
we tried to sell our carrots to a local hospital they 
couldnt buy them because of contracts with the big distributors 
the school system was the same dick ihler said 
holly farms now ships produce to 37 states customers include 
food cooperatives natural food stores and an organic babyfood 
maker in vermont 
we researched markets for five years before we ever planted a 
crop rick said 
holly farms uses a private certification program to back up the 
farms organically grown labels they keep daily logs of what 
is put on or in the ground if you spit on the ground you better 
write it down dick said 
they guard their property against errant chemicals used by 
neighbors when farmers upstream used fungicides on their fields 
the ihlers treated their irrigation water to remove the chemicals 
they complained long and loud enough to local crop dusters that the 
airplanes now make wide detours around their farm 
the work has paid off holly farms still operates under a 
bankruptcy order protecting it from a bank that tried to call its 
loans due so the ihlers are shy about giving figures on income 
but rick said their carrot crop alone which is about 60 percent of 
their business grossed 100000 last year 
the farm supports 14 people in three families it also employs 
18 seasonal workers and at least 50 at harvest time 
the farms reputation is growing with a 1200 percent increase 
in sales during the past five years rick said about 100 people 
visit the farm each year some of them pilgrims who camp out by the 
stream to soak up the farms energy high and drink carrot juice 
the ihlers praise organic farming yet warn it wont work for 
everybody 
even before the term organic was popular their family farm was 
relatively chemicalfree in contrast to much farm land which rick 
said has been propped up with chemicals for so long it has lost its 
natural resistance to pests 
what does a drug addict do when you cut him off from his 
heroin or cocaine he goes through withdrawal symptoms rick 
said the land is like a living being it goes through 
withdrawal too 
that and a lack of experience with organic methods have doomed 
more than one wouldbe organic farmer rick said so many farmers 
dont want to do any homework he said 
one secret of organic farming is caring as much about the foods 
quality as the consumer does rick said 
when they discovered that their carrot bags were labeled with an 
ink containing a potentially toxic chemical the ihlers recalled 
all their carrots 
our sales jumped 300 percent after that rick said people 
saw our concern about quality

its something of a cross between ripleys 
believe it or not and 60 minutes which may have inspired its 
name soviet televisions rapidfire news show 600 seconds 
which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the 
establishment has become immensely popular since it went on the 
air before mikhail gorbachev came to power such a program would 
have been unthinkable in the soviet union 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a lost bull roams a busy city street 
prostitutes woo foreign customers a holiday bombing rips off a 
mans legs 
these and other eyeopening images are flashing across soviet 
television screens as glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs 
drive for openness goes video 
traditionally the kremlin has used staterun television as it 
did other media to reach the masses with propaganda rather than 
programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just 
plain fun the airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on 
subjects such as the grain harvest the leadership still commands 
unlimited time and news shows spend a lot of time reporting lists 
of government leaders seeing each other off on trips 
but gorbachev is a more lively tv personality than his 
predecessors and frequently turns to television to make speeches 
and broadcast his streetside talks with people for the first time 
this winter parliamentary candidates debated each other on 
television 
western music videos are shown routinely space bridges 
bring the uncensored views of western studio audiences into soviet 
living rooms and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives 
soviets a glimpse of western lifestyles 
one trailblazing program which featured the offbeat stories 
about the bull the prostitutes and the bombing is 600 
seconds a fastpaced live show on leningrad television that has 
become a smash hit since its premiere in december 1987 
one avid fan of 30yearold anchorman alexander nevzorov said 
the program shows the soviet people what they were torn away from 
all their lives things that we learned to close our eyes to 
six days a week 15 million people in leningrad moscow and 
other regions can switch on their tv sets to catch up on the latest 
sensations from the soviet unions secondlargest city 
600 seconds the news magazine show fifth wheel the 
debate program public opinion and the music discussion program 
musical boxing ring make leningrad television among the most 
progressive in the soviet union reinforcing the reputation of the 
city built by peter the great as a window on the west 
600 seconds is like a cross between ripleys believe it or 
not and 60 minutes leningraders have nicknamed the show 
our city scandalmonger 
at 10 pm a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes 
of news reports read live by a studio announcer and videotaped 
reports presented rapidfire in a downtoearth style a digital 
clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the 
remaining seconds 
everything about the show sets it apart from ordinary 
broadcasts which are presented in formal language in detail and 
are visually dull 
the shows popularity is evident to the staff about 200 calls 
and dozens of letters a day pour into the tiny dingy room in 
leningrads tv center where two harried producers and nevzorov work 
under a crumbling portrait of lenin ironically no portrait of 
gorbachev whose glasnost policy made the program possible hangs 
on the wall 
nevzorovs irreverence surfaces in every broadcast he relishes 
stirring up the town with what he calls sensations the program 
consists largely of crime reports but also has a heavy dose of the 
bizarre such as a story about the citys dirtiest toilet 
in a recent broadcast 600 seconds took on one of the citys 
biggest department stores accusing its employees of selling highly 
sought finnish clothing under the table the store demanded a 
retraction but nevzorov told viewers later that police had 
investigated and that no excuses can be made 
the program has stopped reporting about dogs says producer 
kirill m shishkin because the staff was swamped with calls for 
days by people offering to adopt a canine after one broadcast 
reported the dogs owner had been killed in a car accident 
nevzorov the shows cocreator and main anchor races around 
this city of 49 million people all day to gather material for his 
mondaythroughsaturday broadcast relying heavily on tips from the 
public and police 
he has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go 
along with such status in the west no secretary no private 
office no chauffeurdriven limousine and a salary of only 475 a 
month 
adoring fans place flowers on his car and beg for autographs 
the soviet press has praised his pioneering style and colleagues 
say he has an uncanny sense of what will excite the public 
journalism students at moscow state university are studying his 
program as a model of how news should be reported on television 
but nevzorov rejects the label journalist he is a former horse 
trainer and tv scriptwriter and bristles when the word journalist 
is mentioned most soviet journalists he said could not come up 
with the stories he does and he doesnt agree with the western 
notion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalize 
the news 
he openly acknowledges that cooperatives the fledgling private 
businesses spawned by gorbachevs reforms are a target whenever 
we have the opportunity to nail them we do he says 
the public turns to 600 seconds to fight the soviet 
bureaucracy on one recent afternoon a caller asked the program to 
prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his 
apartment window 
600 seconds and other leningrad tv programs have helped lift 
the veil from subjects such as homelessness rape prostitution 
murder and robbery and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject 
privileges of the soviet elite one episode of fifth wheel for 
instance complained that elaborate government homes were being 
well maintained next to a childrens hospital that was a shambles 
but there are still forbidden themes nevzorovs boss alexander 
a yurkov said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are 
barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary 
edward a sagalayev head of soviet tvs information department 
who is fighting to reform soviet tv said reforms can be difficult 
i also have my bosses we have our minister he has his deputies 
and it is not always possible to overcome psychologically these 
traditions

the exodus from farm to city is good for no 
one says a congressman who is holding hearings this week on what 
congress can do to make rural communities more appealing 
in 1986 and 1987 more than 1 million people left rural 
america said rep glenn english dokla 
english has asked more than 40 organizations and individuals to 
testify before his house agriculture subcommittee on conservation 
credit and rural development 
the hearings beginning tuesday will continue through june 
later in the summer the committee will go on the road to hear from 
residents of rural areas 
unless action is taken virtually every citizen of the country 
will be forced to live in a metropolitan area english said 
that scenario is good for no one it would overburden our cities 
and suburbs as much as it would devastate our rural communities 
english said he wants the rural development legislation that 
emerges from the hearings to be part of the 1990 farm bill the 
measure that will determine the government farm policy for several 
years 
the difficulties plaguing rural america do not have a single 
focus he said our efforts are incomplete for example if we 
address capital investment issues but ignore those of education or 
rural health care 
the problem the government faces is money 
any new initiative on which we embark will have to bear those 
financing restrictions in mind said english 
he said the subcommittee will be looking at ways to use existing 
funds and resources better and find outside financing 
the bush administration wants to cut the agriculture budget by 
11 billion in the new fiscal year and has suggested that some of 
those cuts come in rural development programs like water and sewer 
grants business and industrial loans and community facility loans 
the issue of rural development is not new said bob bergland 
who was agriculture secretary under president carter and now heads 
the national rural electric cooperative association 
the out migration from rural areas ebb and flow that of the 
last two or three years is as bad as it was in the 40s and 50s 
bergland said friday 
bergland scheduled to testify before the committee thursday 
said that in the 1960s people were moving back to the farm in large 
numbers 
there was the flower children syndrome he said in reference 
to the era in which young people were rejecting the rat race of the 
business world in an effort to find a more peaceful life in nature 
at that time many people set up small farms bergland said 
he said the governments biggest role is in improving education 
and infrastructure road sewers water telephones electrical 
service in farm communities 
the high school drop out rate is as bad as urban ghettos 
bergland said and so is poverty he said 
the difference is you can see poverty in the cities but in 
the country its hidden over the next hill 
he said students who go to college dont come back to the small 
towns because they can make more money elsewhere 
we have an enormous brain drain he said when we start 
working on industry that has a limited work force its a problem 
he said the changing face of american agriculture has 
contributed to the problem 
we have 22 million farms and 15 percent of them produce 90 
percent of what is sold he said attrition is taking its toll 
there arent so many people going broke but there arent any new 
starts 
he called on the government to break this cycle of young 
people leaving rural areas 
he said the movement should start locally with help from state 
universities and coordination by the federal government

weak sales at many of the countrys biggest store chains in may 
suggests consumers have adopted a cautious attitude about spending 
a rise in interest rates over the winter led to increases in 
many adjustable rate mortgages which may be discouraging consumers 
from indulging in expensive goods that typically are bought on 
credit 
higher prices for gasoline may have crimped purchasing power a 
bit in may while some consumers may have decided to postpone 
shopping trips so they could replenish savings depleted when they 
paid tax bills in april 
sales tallies reported thursday varied depending on the type of 
retailer but industrywide results looked sluggish according to 
analysts 
i think they show the consumer is very cautious said carl 
palash senior economist at mccarthy crisanti amp maffei inc 
people are probably looking at their mortgage rates going up 
those who have adjustable rate mortgages and holding back on 
spending 
chains with a heavy emphasis on womens wear did better than 
general merchandisers sales at some generalmerchandise stores may 
have been hurt by abundant rainfall in the northeast during may 
womens apparel merchants have been reporting improving sales 
all year as fashions get a better reception than those of the past 
two years 
gains reported by several clothing retailers appeared better 
than they really were because mays sales were compared with last 
years relatively low volumes 
an analysis by drexel burnham lambert inc indicated most 
sectors of the retailing business took in less in may than in april 
the brokerage said its weighted average of 37 merchants sales 
at stores open at least a year rose 42 percent in may after 
aprils 7 percent gain 
drexels index of sales at 14 department stores and discounters 
rose 38 percent last month following a 69 percent april increase 
and its index of 12 specialty apparel and shoe retailers went up 
76 percent compared with 112 percent in april the specialty hard 
goods index which includes sales of electronics toys and 
furniture rose 34 percent vs aprils 3 percent rise 
the results thursday were from some of the biggest general 
merchandise chains in the united states plus apparel retailers 
monthly retail sales from the government are more comprehensive and 
include the take at other types of establishments such as auto 
dealers supermarkets and restaurants 
among those reporting were sears roebuck and co the nations 
biggest merchant which said sales in the four weeks ended may 27 
rose 53 percent to 25 billion from 238 billion in may 1988 
sales at stores open at least a year called same or comparable 
sales rose 31 percent 
retailers and industry analysts consider samestore sales a more 
accurate indication of a companys performance than totals that 
include sales at new stores not every retailer discloses results 
on this basis 
kurt barnard publisher of barnards retail marketing report an 
industry newsletter said sears results suggest customers are 
losing enthusiasm about the nationwide chains new lowpricing 
policy 
that does not augur very well for the success of their 
socalled everyday low pricing strategy said barnard estimating 
that the retail giant must maintain 5 percent samestore sales 
growth to keep its profits ahead of inflation 
sears introduced the strategy earlier this year in a bid to 
compete with fastgrowing chains such as walmart stores inc 
which regularly reports doubledigit sales growth 
walmart currently ranked no 3 said may sales rose 25 percent 
to 203 billion from 1988s 163 billion on a comparablestore 
basis sales increased 11 percent 
secondranked k mart corp reported a sales increase of 25 
percent for the four weeks ended may 24 to 219 billion from the 
previous years 214 billion on a comparablestore basis sales 
were off 06 percent 
k mart earlier had predicted its take would be disappointing and 
thursday attributed the weakness to sluggish demand for clothes 
especially ladies wear 
at jcpenney co premothers day sales of womens dresses and 
fine jewelry were strong but mens sportswear sagged total store 
and catalog sales edged up 17 percent to 102 billion in may from 
101 billion a year earlier samestore sales slipped 09 percent 
penneys sales growth was better after subtracting from last years

carl icahns sale of a record 4232 
millionshare block of texaco inc stock has fueled wall street 
speculation about the takeover strategists plans and whether they 
involve an old target usx corp 
trading in usx stock was halted near the close of the new york 
stock exchange session thursday due to too many buy orders and not 
enough sell orders after icahn sold his texaco stock usx finished 
the day up 262 at 3750 a share in nyse composite trading 
icahn ended his long and often bitter involvement with texaco by 
selling his 173 percent stake which made him the companys 
biggest shareholder for 49 a share or a total of 207 billion 
the block trade was the most expensive ever on the nyse according 
to catherine maroney a big board spokeswoman 
texaco closed down 212 at 49 a share 
we think the company has improved a great deal in a year and a 
half and we like to think we played a small part in helping them to 
do that but we felt it was time to move on and we wish the company 
and management well icahn said in a telephone interview 
icahn declined to comment further and it was not immediately 
known how he planned to use proceeds of the stock sale and from a 
special 8ashare dividend texaco paid all shareholders earlier 
this year under a wideranging restructuring 
outsiders have estimated icahn paid an average of 3660 a share 
for his stake giving him a potential gain of 1240 a share on the 
stock sale alone the stock sale plus the dividend puts icahns 
profit at more than 800 million calculating from an average 
share purchase price of 3660 
but there has been widespread speculation that icahn who 
already has a major stake in usx might make a play for the oil and 
steel giant he already has made one bid for usx a 72 billion 
offer that he abandoned in early 1987 after the usx board rejected 
it 
possibly heightening the speculation was the retirement 
wednesday of usx chairman david m roderick who led the company in 
its battle against icahn 
the company underwent a major restructuring under roderick 
including the writedown of 3 billion in mostly steel assets and 
the 10 billion acquisitions of marathon oil co and texas oil amp 
gas corp the 99 billion in revenue from those companies last 
year accounted for nearly twothirds of usx total revenue of 169 
billion and compared with 58 billion in steel revenue 
there was no answer at usx offices in pittsburgh when a reporter 
called for comment late thursday 
texaco spokeswoman anita larsen said icahns shares were bought 
by the investment firms shearson lehman hutton inc salomon 
brothers inc and goldman sachs amp co 
ms larsen said the shares remained under restrictions set by a 
january agreement between icahn and texaco which was aimed at 
ensuring the stock would not end up in the hands of a potentially 
hostile suitor 
ms larsen said texaco had no further comment on the sale 
icahn who is chairman of trans world airlines inc acquired 
about 24 million texaco shares from australian investor robert 
holmes a court after the 1987 stock market crash twa already owned 
59 million texaco shares and icahn further increased its stake 
following the purchases from holmes a court 
icahn complained that texaco management was not doing enough to 
raise the companys stock price and indicated he might mount a 
takeover of the company his threats complicated texacos attempt 
to extricate itself from bankruptcy proceedings and a 1035 
billion damage judgment it was ordered to pay pennzoil co 
texacos board rejected icahns later proposal for a 145 
billion buyout and he failed to unseat the board in a proxy fight 
at texacos annual meeting a year ago 
he also fought with texaco over the terms of its bankruptcy 
reorganization plan the company sought protection from creditors 
to avoid posting a multibilliondollar bond while it appealed the 
1985 pennzoil verdict which resulted from texacos acquisition of 
getty oil co 
after texaco emerged from bankruptcy protection icahn bickered 
with management over its plan to sell billions of dollars of assets 
and pay stockholders the special 8 share dividend or a total of 
about 19 billion 
these issues were resolved in the january standstill agreement 
which altered texacos poison pill takeover defense but also 
limited how icahn could sell his stock and barred him from making a 
takeover attempt against texaco for seven years 
thursdays texaco block trade was the secondlargest in terms of 
shares after the 1986 sale of 4879 millionshare block of 
navistar international corp that block sold for 10 a share or 
4879 million and previously had been the most expensive single 
block trade

tighter state controls on the insurance 
industry including full monitoring and comparative disclosure of 
prices for auto policies were proposed by an independent agents 
association and consumers groups 
in unveiling a national model thursday for state insurance 
departments the organizations called also for stricter ethics 
standards for regulators specified periods for the settlement of 
claims and the establishment of a nationwide computer network to 
share consumer complaint data 
the model forwarded to the governors of all the states was a 
joint project of the consumer insurance interest group an 
independent advocacy federation headed by esther peterson former 
consumer adviser to presidents lyndon johnson and jimmy carter and 
the national association of professional insurance agents also 
known as pia national 
the plan also was backed by the consumer federation of america 
the national insurance consumer organization and public citizen 
mrs peterson called it a yardstick that regulators and 
legislators can use to enhance the effectiveness of insurance 
regulation in their states 
pia national president david l ream said both consumers and 
insurance agents will benefit if minimum standards are implemented 
in all the states as a result consumers would be able to receive 
price comparison information more readily and agents would have 
greater assurance that the companies they place their customers 
business with are financially sound 
highlights of the proposal 
strengthen the size and quality of state regulatory agencies by 
allocating to their budgets at least 10 percent of the premium 
taxes insurers pay annually to the states most agencies now 
operate with much smaller budgets equivalent on average to 6 
percent of the premium taxes collected 
bar regulatory officials from entering the employment of 
insurance companies for one year after leaving their official 
positions 
draw up specified time periods in which claims should be paid 
and maintain and disclose complaint information by company and line 
of insurance 
conduct routine financial examinations of companies to make 
sure funds are available to pay claims 
maintain readily accessible price information on personal 
auto insurance so conumers can make onestop comparisons 
appoint independent consumer advocates or councils for advice 
on regulatory policies

the new york stock exchange has approved for 
trading a basket of 500 stocks and billed as the first of its 
kind in that it provides ownership of each of the actual component 
stocks 
units of the portfolio valued now at about 5 million apiece 
will include 126000 shares of stock reflecting those in the 
standard amp poors 500 stock index 
existing stock basket investments traded on the american and 
philadelphia stock exchanges represent the sampp index itself rather 
than the actual shares that make up the index 
the securities and exchange commission the federal agency that 
regulates the nations securities markets must approve the new 
instrument nyse officials said thursday they hoped it would begin 
trading in september 
nyse officials said their new stock basket to be called the 
exchange stock portfolio was designed for trading by large 
institutional investors and not individuals 
the number of shares of each company in the unit is weighted to 
reflect the index for example each unit would have holdings 
ranging in size from 3100 shares of exxon corp to nine of monarch 
machine tool co 
you are a shareholder of a stock donald solodar nyse 
senior vice president of capital markets told a news conference 
you are not somebody trading in an index participation index you 
will have all the shares in your account 
the basket will include 462 nyselisted stocks and 38 traded on 
the american stock exchange or the nations overthecounter 
markets nyse officials said they would ask the other exchanges for 
permission to trade their stocks in its portfolio 
the value of the stocks currently in the index would be about 5 
million officials said that compares with about 3100 per unit 
for stock baskets now traded on the philadelphia and american stock 
exchanges 
solodar said the new portfolio could help ease market volatility 
that may be heightened by waves of computerized program trades as 
occurred during the october 1987 stock market crash 
program trading is a strategy by which speculators attempt to 
profit from disparities between the prices of stock index futures 
and options and the prices of stocks represented by the indexes 
because the strategy generally involves large numbers of shares 
traded by wall street firms or institutional investors it has been 
blamed for causing or worsening big market price swings 
the new product could add capital that market players could use 
to try to balance a onesided market solodar said trading will be 
governed by a call market in which officials will be able to 
point out signs of trading imbalances every 15 minutes 
in a statement nyse chairman john j phelan jr said studies 
following the market crash recommended developing such an equities 
portfolio that would include ownership of the stocks 
the exchange stock portfolio approved today by the nyse board 
of directors incorporates those recommendations and should meet 
the needs of our customers he said 
the sec in march approved the sale of stock baskets on the 
philadelphia and american exchanges those are priced according to 
sampp 500 which essentially allows investors to bet on the overall 
direction of the stock market as a whole 
those products are based on the current value of indexes of 
stocks and do not provide ownership of their shares investors 
receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of 
any regular cash dividend declared on the component stocks of the 
basket 
the nations two futures markets have challenged those baskets 
saying they are thinly disguised stock index futures and therefore 
should be limited to futures exchanges

a survey says most americans would support 
advertisers that withdraw commercials from tv programs that some 
viewers find objectionable and would back a boycott of companies 
that sponsor such shows 
one in four people surveyed said the government should make it 
illegal to show objectionable material on television according to 
the survey released thursday by the consumer research firm 
oxtobysmith inc 
respondents were asked to describe what they regarded as 
objectionable and 74 percent cited excessive violence 67 percent 
sex 60 percent profanity 58 percent cited subjects that should 
be private and 41 percent ethnic stereotypes 
the survey comes as a number of individuals and groups upset 
with what they say is excessive sex violence profanity or 
stereotyping in tv programs have captured attention with calls for 
advertisers to withdraw ads from those shows 
joseph smith president of oxtobysmith said those calls appear 
to have touched a sensitive pervasive and perhaps festering 
public concern 
the naive supposition that the recent flurry of protest 
against objectionable programming reflects the opinions of a 
small but vocal minority on societys fringe simply isnt supported 
by what weve learned he said 
but several advertising and television executives questioned the 
significance of the polls findings noting that how a question is 
phrased may have a lot to do with how it is answered 
they said for instance that people who say they support 
withdrawing ads from an objectionable show may disagree on what 
is objectionable 
its a socially acceptable response there are not many people 
who would give a negative response to something like this said 
paul sonkin vice president of network audience research at abc 
thomas winner media director at the ad agency 
campbellmithunesty said he didnt think there was much 
significance in the poll results 
if someone called what would you say and would you really 
care about this if someone didnt call he said 
but david smith a marketing executive at his fathers firm 
said the poll questions were designed to be as dispassionate as 
possible 
the survey relied on telephone interviews conducted may 410 
with a randomlyselected sample of 500 adults across the country 
the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage 
points 
oxtobysmith which has been in business since 1956 and has 
counted block drug co bristol myers co mci communication corp 
and volvo among its clients said it commissioned the poll on its 
own and not for any client 
several major advertisers including tambrands inc ralston 
purina co and dominos pizza inc have withdrawn advertising from 
shows such as the fox networks married with children and 
nbcs saturday night live because of such concerns 
sixtyeight percent of those surveyed said it was a good 
idea for advertisers to stop advertising in programs some 
viewers found objectionable while 72 percent said it was a good 
idea for consumers not to buy products of advertisers in programs 
they find objectionable 
oxtobysmith said 49 percent of those surveyed said the amount 
of objectionable material on television bothers them a lot 
twentyfive percent said the government should make it illegal 
to show objectionable material 36 percent said objectionable 
material should be kept off the air but not necessarily through a 
government ban and 69 percent called for restricting objectionable 
material to latenight hours 
the rev donald wildmon executive director of the american 
family association in tupelo miss which has encouraged 
advertisers to withdraw from shows it finds offensive said he was 
delighted by the results of the poll 
our time has arrived he said

the nations unemployment rate dipped to 52 
percent in may but in a sure sign of a slowing economy job 
growth fell to its lowest level in more than three years the 
government said today 
the civilian jobless rate taken from the labor departments 
monthly household survey fell 01 percentage point from aprils 
53 percent in line with the expectations of analysts 
but nonfarm payroll growth taken from a separate survey of 
business establishments was up by only 101000 down from aprils 
revised growth of 206000 jobs the may growth was the lowest 
monthtomonth gain since 84000 added payroll positions were 
reported in march 1986 
for the past three months an average of only 160000 jobs have 
been added to nonfarm payrolls each month down from the robust 
average monthly gain of 270000 jobs reported in 1987 and 1988 
the great american jobs machine is cranking down to a more 
moderate pace said economist allen sinai of boston co economic 
advisers inc but the economy does not appear to be headed 
nearterm for a recession 
several analysts said after the release of the report today that 
the data which included some signs of moderating inflation 
would give the federal reserve some justification for easing its 
tight rein on credit but all agreed such a move was far from 
certain 
for a divided fed its a tough call sinai said 
in other signs of an economic slowdown the labor department 
said the average privatesector nonagricultural workweek fell 03 
hours to 346 hours that decline was influenced by april figures 
that likely overestimated the work week because the survey did not 
take into account that good friday and the easter holidays fell in 
march this year instead of april 
the average factory workweek also fell last month slipping 02 
hours to 41 hours while average overtime fell an equal amount to 
38 hours the labor department reported 
and in data that will hailed be by those looking for signs of 
easing inflation average hourly wages inched up only 01 percent 
in may following a 07 increase for april average weekly earnings 
fell from aprils 33504 to 33251 on a seasonally adjusted basis 
the consensus among analysts was that some 220000 jobs would be 
added to the nations economy more than double the number reported 
by the government 
such projections have led analysts to predict the economy would 
show too much strength for the federal reserve to ease its tight 
rein on credit but the sluggishness demonstrated by todays report 
likely will increase pressure on the central bank to relax monetary 
policy 
the serviceproducing industries again accounted for the 
overwhelming job growth adding 134000 jobs to help offset some of 
the declines in other economic sectors but even that number was 
well down from a revised april gain of nearly 190000 new 
serviceproducing jobs and well off the sectors 250000 monthly 
average gain last year 
in that service sector transportation and retail and wholesale 
trade posted job gains but were well below their 1988 averages 
goodsproducing industries reported a net loss of 33000 jobs 
with mining down slightly and construction employment off by 14000 
positions manufacturing operations reported a loss of 18000 jobs 
from april 
the unemployment rate dipped despite the slow job growth 
because the government said the civilian labor force fell by 
49000 people to 1236 million that indicated the influx of 
students into the summer labor force generally seen in may or 
june did not occur in any great number last month 
in a positive sign the government said the number of part time 
workers last month who wanted to work full time fell by about 
300000 to 48 million 
declines in the unemployment rate were reported for both white 
and black adult men while joblessness soared among black women and 
black teenagers 
unemployment among white adult men fell from 4 percent to 36 
percent in may while the rate dropped among black men from 10 
percent to 94 percent 
for white women the unemployment rate last month was unchanged 
at 41 percent while for black women it shot up from 88 percent to 
95 percent 
unemployment for black teens climbed from 262 percent to 284 
percent the rate among white teenagers was pegged at 112 
percent down from 115 percent 
among hispanics unemployment dropped from 83 percent to 79 
percent said the government which does not provide a gender or 
age breakdown for hispanics 
in a separate calculation that includes military personnel 
stationed in the united states the jobless rate dipped from 52 
percent to 51 percent the department said 
the data included a number of revisions to previous reports 
dating back to 1987 because of the labor departments annual review 
of state unemployment records 
those changes included a reduction of 595000 in the 
governments estimate of job growth in the last two years 
the report the first comprehensive look at economic performance 
last month indicated much slower growth than most analysts had 
expected a sign the slowdown of the first quarter continues into 
the second three months of the year

the european community favors 
deregulation of air transportation but it will strictly control 
airline mergers an eec official said friday 
european commissioner for competition leon brittan said the eec 
will be vigilant in controling airline mergers in the run up to 
a single european market for air transport in the 1990s 
increased concentration in a sector which is already 
characterised by high barriers to entry must be watched 
carefully brittan said in a speech to the international air 
transport associations aviation symposium in marrakesh morocco a 
summary of the speech was made available in brussels 
brittan said that common market air transport market should have 
less regulation less bureacracy more competition and cheaper 
fares but the official added that liberalization must be 
accompanied by strict enforcement of antitrust rules 
he said the eec did not plan to adopt the laissezfaire 
attitude of the us antitrust authorities who have allowed 
numerous mergers of airlines in the united states following 
deregulation of the us industry 
brittan made his comments amid moves by some european airlines 
to cooperate more closely 
scandinavian airlines system offered in april to buy a minority 
stake in sabena belgiums stateowned airline sabena is currently 
negotiating a possible alliance with british airways and klm royal 
dutch airlines 
on thursday iberia airlines said that the spanish national 
carrier will probably merge with other european airlines in the 
1990s 
brittan said that one of the eecs main concerns would be to 
preserve and promote the position of new carriers as well as 
smaller regional and charter airlines 
if all such carriers were to be swallowed up through various 
forms of cooperation or conglomeration with larger airlines the 
competitive atmosphere would be rather bleak he said 
brittan also said that the eec would have to adopt rules giving 
nationals of other eec member states the right to own shares in 
airlines anywhere in the community 
he said that currently restrictions on the ownership of airlines 
are contained in the laws and bilateral air service agreements of 
almost all the eec members 
brittan also said that the eec might tighten the conditions 
under which airlines are still free to share capacity and revenue 
these socalled exemptions to the eecs competition rules expire in 
january 1991

the way some observers see it the shares of 
general motors corp are about to send out a warning that the stock 
markets strong 1989 rally might soon run out of gas 
the analysts in question are followers of the gm bellwether 
indicator one of the many traditional tools developed over the 
years to try to outguess the direction of stock prices 
the theory holds that gm stock must set a new high within four 
months of its previous peak in any given market cycle to maintain 
an all clear signal for investors if it fails to do so then 
it switches to a bearish or at least caution indicator 
the all clear light has been on since oct 20 1987 the day 
after the crash on black monday notes robert stovall of 
stovalltwentyfirst advisers inc long known as a leading 
advocate of the gm bellwether 
but barring some lastminute fireworks stovall says that is 
about to change 
gms most recent peak was 4744 adjusted for a subsequent 
2for1 split on feb 8 1989 the shares trading late last week 
around 41 would have to rally above their february level by 
thursday june 8 to avoid a negative signal 
of course many money managers of the investment institutions 
that dominate the modern markets dismiss indicators like the gm 
bellwether as quaint artifacts of a bygone time like engraved 
stock certificates or mechanical tickertape machines 
if they want an indicator thank you theyll take a 
computerprogram model combining dozens of variables that suggests 
changes in their tactical asset allocation plans 
still says stovall the gm bellwether has been an accurate 
guide about 70 percent of the time since the 1920s and has some 
logic going for it 
gms stock is a useful foreshadower of future market trends 
because of its giant capitalization and cyclical product line he 
maintains it is also the only blue chip stock to have over many 
years regularly raised or lowered its dividend depending on the 
corporate outlook 
besides say some other analysts its a potential sign of 
trouble any time you see big names like international business 
machines and gm lagging behind when the market is rallying 
gms action is especially disturbing since it looks so toppy 
and vulnerable on the chart and in addition has proved to be so 
very important as a forecasting tool says stan weinstein in the 
current edition of his investment advisory letter the professional 
tape reader 
however closely wall streeters may watch it gm stock has been 
only a fringe participant at best in the markets rise to new highs 
in the 1980s 
actually said stovall the shares have been better as 
directional signals than as an investment over the past 20 years 
gm shares at the 40 level are virtually unchanged from the 
1969 price zone while merck has soared by eight times ford stock 
has risen by a factor of five and ibm has more than doubled among 
many other superior longterm performers

a day after its previous plan expired 
ford motor co issued a new incentive package with rebates ranging 
from 500 to 4000 and interest rates as low as 29 percent for 
twoyear loans 
the new package announced thursday includes a wide variety of 
ford lincoln and mercury cars and trucks

covering subcompact cars both programs expire july 31 
automakers use incentives to shrink vehicle inventories car and 
truck sales this year have been running behind last years pace 
while production schedules have been changed only slightly 
analysts have speculated for months that carmakers may be forced 
into widespread layoffs and plant shutdowns during the second half 
of the year to further reduce inventories and give time for 
retooling factories for the coming model year 
fords announcement thursday came the day after chrysler corp 
expanded its existing rebate program to include jeep cherokee and 
wagoneer models 
there are no expiration dates on chrysler incentives 
meantime general motors corps oldsmobile division announced 
new incentives thursday and its buick division followed suit today 
olds ebates range from 800 to 1500 and buicks are between 500 
and 1500 
both programs also give buyers the option of cutrate financing 
with interest rates as low as 29 percent on twoyear loans other 
incentives for other gm cars and trucks expire monday

were aimed at satisfying creditors of the strikebound airline 
indicating wage and benefit cuts were likely 
in a brief statement eastern said the changes were needed 
because of financial difficulties created by the 3monthold strike 
against the carrier and its bankruptcy proceeding 
the company scheduled an afternoon news conference in miami to 
outline what it called changes in wages vacation policies and 
other benefits areas 
eastern spokesman james ashlock in miami described the changes 
as austerity measures aimed at satisfying creditors as the airline 
moves ahead with its recently announced plan to reorganize as a 
smaller carrier 
because eastern aims to reduce its workforce to 17000 employees 
after having nearly 30000 before the strike middlemanagement 
positions were likely to be targeted ashlock said 
a lot of people will be offered other positions he said 
noting that many middlelevel management people have been 
performing new jobs to replace the striking union workers 
eastern currently has 4500 to 5000 nonunion employees most 
of them in management positions who have been running the airline 
since machinists pilots and flight attendants walked out on march 
4 
on thursday an investor group seeking to buy eastern was given 
a last chance by a federal bankruptcy judge and submitted a revised 
plan 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland had given the group led 
by chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie until 6 pm edt 
thursday to submit a business plan for eastern to the airline and 
to the committee representing its creditors 
ritchie said late thursday he submitted a detailed business plan 
and proposal just before the judges deadline he also said he 
scheduled meetings with representatives of eastern and its 
creditors 
i have now delivered a realistic plan for the rebirth of 
eastern that includes morethanadequate financing a firm 
commitment to growth and the unanimous support of easterns 
unions ritchie said in a statement 
lifland set another hearing for 2 pm today on the ritchie 
groups offer 
the bankruptcy court wrangling is important because the strikers 
want parent texas air corp to sell the airline but texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo wants to continue to run eastern but as a 
smaller carrier lifland and david i shapiro the courtappointed 
examiner for eastern have considerable influence over what happens 
next 
miamibased eastern one of the nations most unprofitable 
airlines has been mired in a strike and chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection for nearly three months 
in a separate development eastern agreed thursday to pay 31 
million to several of its employee benefit plans to settle a 
federal government complaint alleging the airline tapped those 
plans to pay corporate expenses the airline entered into the 
consent agreement with the government without admitting or denying 
that it had committed any wrongdoing 
and on capitol hill the senate approved a nonbinding 
resolution urging the bankruptcy court to consider appointing a 
special trustee to replace lorenzo in running the carrier on a 
940 vote lawmakers included the language in a 33 billion 
spending bill for this year 
at the bankruptcy hearing shapiro asked lifland to give the 
ritchie group until monday to discuss its offer with eastern and 
its creditors shapiro said he didnt believe the buyout proposal 
was viable but he wanted to lean over backwards to be fair 
leaders of easterns unions continued to hope that the airline 
might be sold 
nothings ever the last chance charles bryan head of the 
striking machinists union told reporters outside the bankruptcy 
courthouse in manhattan 
shapiro said he had been poised to recommend that both ritchies 
proposal and a rival offer from a group headed by former piedmont 
airlines chairman william howard be dismissed but he said 
ritchie and his associates dissuaded him at a meeting early 
thursday saying theyd raised the minimum 100 million in equity 
shapiro had earlier demanded from any potential buyer 
although the group had met that requirement it still lacked a 
viable business plan for running the airline shapiro said 
aflcio president lane kirkland said thursday that 13 unions had 
agreed to guarantee up to 5 million each to make the 50 million 
available the eastern pilots and machinists would determine the 
use of the loan in the purchase of the airline he said 
under the ritchie proposal easterns unions would have a 
substantial equity stake in the airline bryan said

the fact that wage rates have remained in line 
with other economic factors including productivity growth and 
inflation is one of the more remarkable economic differences 
between the 1970s and 1980s 
while wage growth has intensified during the past year perhaps 
in response to a tight labor market few analysts foresee a 
wageprice spiral at all and certainly not the sort that proved 
ruinous a decade or so ago 
by march of this year average hourly earnings were up just over 
4 percent from a year earlier while the consumer price index one 
measure of inflation has been running in a 4 percent to 45 
percent range for about a year 
benefits add to the total cost of wages and salaries but even 
with these added the total increase in labor costs last year was 
slightly under 5 percent greater than inflation but only minimally 
it was very different in the 1970s when wages played a large 
role in the doubledigit inflation that plagued much of the decade 
losing faith in governments ability to restrain inflation 
organized labor sought and obtained big wage increases reasoning 
that whatever increases they obtained might be erased by inflation 
in the following year or two 
much of heavy industry acquiesced rather than holding the line 
on wages management often acceded to labors demands confident 
the added cost could be passed on to the consumer management was 
correct 
consumers got caught up in the frenzy too fearing that existing 
prices would be higher in months to come buyers moved up their 
purchase dates for bigticket items they were right prices were 
higher they helped make them so 
before the inflationrecession cycle was over interest rates 
prices and unemployment at one time or another all hit doubledigit 
levels it was a scene to be avoided and for most of the time 
since then it has been avoided 
in the 1980s the attitudes of labor and management are vastly 
different labor seeks security and so does management and both 
feel it can best be obtained through stability through avoidance 
of strikes and layoffs 
neither had much choice the decade began with high 
unemployment which hardly is the environment for wage demands 
and faced with greater foreign competition management wasnt in a 
position to grant increases 
helping to improve labormanagement relations was a more stable 
economic environment learning from its mistakes of the 1970s 
federal reserve policy has been directed at avoiding crises and 
retaining stability 
unconvinced some analysts of the economy still are watching 
wages for signs of trouble and many were surprised that wage 
inflation didnt erupt when unemployment dropped below 55 percent 
of the civilian labor supply 
in theory the labor supply at that level of unemployment is 
hardly of the same quality as it would be with for instance a 7 
percent jobless rate at the higher rate many experienced workers 
generally are seeking jobs 
generally as labor quality deteriorates as industry relies on 
less skilled less productive workers business costs rise this 
time they didnt and the reasons why arent totally clear 
did business simply swallow the higher costs why didnt 
organized labor put on a longdelayed push for higher wages could 
it be that the memories of the 1970s were too painful to risk 
repeating

investing in zerocoupon bonds according to 
whom you listen is either a surefire trip to financial nirvana or 
a oneway ticket to investment hell 
zeros offer probably the first chance youve ever had to take 
your spare change and turn it into a fortune worthy of midas 
gushes zero coupons a book on the investment no longer are 
we barred from making huge profits due to a lack of investable 
cash with zeros your investment is carefree 
another investment guide the complete book of bonds has 
this bit of jaded advice about investing in zero coupons if 
youre anxious to part with your money why not visit las vegas or 
atlantic city where you can get some enjoyment from the 
experience 
zeros are bonds that lack the coupons entitling a bondholder to 
periodic interest payments hence the term zero coupon corporate 
municipal and treasury bonds all are available in zerocoupon form 
some zero coupon bonds are originally issued without the 
coupons while others are created when investment houses strip 
the coupons from a bond and sell the bond and securities based on 
the coupon strips separately 
because zeros lack coupons holders of zeros dont receive any 
current income from their investments until the bonds reach 
maturity 
to make up for this the bond is sold at a deep discount from 
its face value or par 
upon maturity the bondholder receives the face value of the 
bond and in effect receives a compound rate of interest that was 
built into the bonds low original price 
the rate of return on a zero can be substantial for example at 
a 10 percent interest rate a 20year zero bought for 5000 would 
be worth 35000 at the bonds maturity excluding brokers 
commissions 
but the appreciation built into the bonds price is treated as 
taxable income each year even though the bondholder receives none 
of the benefit until the bond reaches maturity 
because of this many investment advisers believe taxable zeros 
are suitable only for retirement plans such as taxsheltered iras 
and keoghs and for company pension plans 
savings bonds the bestknown form of zeros are an exception 
while the value of a savings bond appreciates over time its owner 
can elect to pay no federal income taxes on it until it is cashed 
in 
there are also taxexempt zeros in the form of municipal bonds 
that may be attractive to some investors outside of retirement 
accounts 
a major disadvantage of zeros is the potential for wild swings 
in their prices on the open market compared with regular bonds 
this occurs because zeros represent an interest in a future 
lumpsum payment and their interest rate is locked in 
these price swings may make it difficult to sell a zero before 
maturity except at a steep loss should interest rates rise since 
the zero has locked in a lower interest rate than the market rate 
it is worth less than you paid for it 
zeros once were extremely popular with parents saving for their 
childrens education but the overhaul of the federal tax code in 
1986 severely limited the tax advantage of this way of saving for 
college tuition 
jay goldinger chief market strategist at capital insight inc 
a beverly hills calif investment firm believes zeros are only 
suitable for investments in a retirement account 
outside of such a taxsheltered account the tax consequences 
are just awful he said 
as for municipal zeros he said its a disaster unless 
youre a real expert in the muni area 
he said municipal zeros often contain provisions that allow the 
issuer to call or redeem the bonds before maturity an early 
redemption could drastically lower a bonds yield 
mutual funds that invest in zerocoupon municipals are a safer 
way to invest in these bonds goldinger said but only if the 
investment is limited to a small aount 
investors also must shop around when buying zeros since the 
interest earned is determined by how the bond is priced investment 
houses can take a generous profit on the bonds and still pay an 
attractive return some investment houses may take a smaller profit 
margin on zeros than others

liquor industry officials says they dont fear 
the government will restrict their advertising like does for 
cigarette makers but they believe the us surgeon general went 
too far in a recent report calling for cutbacks in alcohol 
promotions 
alcohol and tobacco are entirely different products said 
patricia schneider director of health and social issues for the 
wine institute a trade association in san francisco that 
represents california winemakers 
she said the danger with alcohol is the abuse of the product 
unlike tobacco in which any use of cigarettes can be viewed as 
harmful 
surgeon general c everett koop issued a set of proposals this 
week aimed at curbing drunken driving koop recommends banning 
alcohol advertisements on college campuses and halting ads that use 
celebrities who appeal to youths 
also he said alcohol advertising should be matched with 
prohealth and safety messages and he called for an increase in 
excise taxes on beer wine and distilled spirits 
aside from these proposals government warning labels will start 
appearing on alcoholic beverage containers this fall the labels 
will caution pregnant women against drinking and warn how alcohol 
can impair the ability to drive 
government warning labels have appeared on cigarette packages 
for more than 20 years and cigarette ads have been barred from 
television and radio since the early 1970s 
producers of distilled spirits voluntarily have withheld from 
broadcast advertising since the early years after prohibition 
unlike beer and wine companies that promote their products on the 
airwaves 
some experts say its unlikely that advertising restrictions 
similar to those on cigarettes would placed on beer and wine 
if you took beer advertisements off tv 50 percent of the 
male population would be on congress necks because they wouldnt 
be able to see baseball games on television said roy burry a 
beverage and tobacco analyst at kidder peabody amp co inc in new 
york 
but industry officials nonetheless say they sense political 
pressure to halt broadcast ads of their products 
were concerned about people trying to ban our product from tv 
and radio said stephen lambright vice president of 
anheuserbusch cos inc the nations largest brewer but that 
is not to say were on a 20year track behind the tobacco 
industry 
the surgeon generals office while discouraging people from 
smoking is not trying to stop people from drinking only from 
drinking and driving said jim brown a spokesman in the office 
but spokesmen for the alcohol industry say they hear a different 
message 
its a real antialcohol campaign said schneider of the 
wine institute the real issue is to encourage safe drinking 
habits 
we think these recommendations seek to curtail alcohol use 
not alcohol abuse said steve forsyth a spokesman for miller 
brewing co 
industry officials say they try to promote responsible use of 
their products but they say koop is trying to tarnish the image of 
alcoholic beverages 
hes stigmatized a perfectly legal and legitimate product 
said lambright at anheuserbusch 
it is possible some consumers who see the warning labels and 
hear the surgeon generals proposals will begin viewing alcohol in 
the same light as cigarettes said henry pomeroy director of 
corporate communications for hiram walkerallied vintners in 
detroit 
but people on both sides of the alcohol issue say clear 
distinctions exist between alcoholic beverages and cigarettes 
alcohol problems are suffered by those who dont drink by 
victims of drunken driving said pat taylor director of the 
alcohol studies project at the center for science in the public 
interest a consumer advocacy group in washington that has pushed 
for restrictions on alcohol with smoking the person most 
affected is the smoker 
richard daynard a law professor at northeastern university in 
boston who has been active in bringing liability suits against 
tobacco companies said the alcohol industry is less vulnerable 
because the beverages themselves pose less of a health hazard than 
cigarettes 
also he said while cigarette companies insist their products 
are safe alcohol companies acknowledge the potential for abuse 
it will certainly help the alcohol companies look 
responsible daynard said of that acknowledgment

the mexican government has sold 773 
stateowned companies to private investors since 1983 and plans to 
continue selling nonstrategic industries the treasury department 
says 
the department said in a news release thursday that the 
socalled privatization process guarantees a maximum benefit for 
the federal government 
it said since president carlos salinas de gortari took office 
dec 1 a total of 17 of companies were sold to private investors 
salinas announced earlier this week his administrations plan 
for national development which includes the continued sale of 
stateowned companies a fight against inflation liberalizing 
regulations on foreign investment in mexico and a tough negotiating 
posture with creditor banks to lower payments on the 1074 billion 
foreign debt 
the salinas government which marked six months in office this 
week has brought inflation down to about 20 percent annually from 
last years rate of 517 percent 
last month the government opened the economy to foreign 
investment by allowing foreign ownership in many sectors previously 
restricted to mexican ownership and increased the amount of foreign 
ownership allowed in others 
the measure was designed to attract greater investments from 
abroad 
the government is now engaged in difficult negotiations with 
foreign banks to lower interest and principal on the debt 
when the preceding administration of miguel de la madrid 
initiated the sale of stateowned firms in 1983 the government 
owned 1155 companies 
business leaders in mexico have often criticized government 
control of the economy and bureaucratic interference with private 
enterprise 
as part of this divestment campaign salinas announced plans to 
sell the governments inefficient ferry system that serves routes 
to the mainland from the baja california sur peninsula 
salinas said the ferry company has drained the government of 82 
million a year to make up for its losses

tenneco inc on friday paid the government 5 
million one of the stiffest civil penalties ever levied by federal 
officials as settlement for the deliberate destruction of 1 
billion cubic feet of natural gas 
this is a matter of cheating the american people first by 
wasting an important natural resource and second by not paying 
america for using it interior secretary manuel lujan said we 
will not tolerate this kind of behavior 
tenneco said the incident involved about 117 billion cubic feet 
of gas over about a ninemonth period ending feb 3 1987 
this was an isolated incident and occurred without authority 
or the knowledge of tennecos executive management spokesman lew 
bullion said 
the flaring was in clear violation of the companys corporate 
policy which is to comply with all rules and regulations governing 
its oil and gas operations there were immediate corrective actions 
taken to halt the loss of gas and appropriate disciplinary measures 
were taken he said 
bullion said he did not know how many people were involved 
describing it only as a small group 
we are proud of our record and remain committed to a corporate 
policy that mandates compliance with the letter as well as the 
spirit of the rules and regulations governing our businesses 
jl ketelsen tenneco chairman said 
our investigation shows tenneco executive management in no way 
condoned this interior department spokesman steve goldstein said 
friday but what occurred was wrong tenneco management has been 
cooperative 
goldstein said the 5 million fine delivered friday by tenneco 
to federal minerals management service officials in new orleans 
might not be the end of the matter 
in our negotiations there is ongoing dispute between the 
department and tenneco as to the value of the gas he said the 
secretary wanted to make sure we preserved the right to collect 
more royalties 
tenneco estimated royalties lost because of the destruction of 
gas at 115000 
tenneco last year sold its oil and gas operations for more than 
7 billion the incident cited by the interior department occurred 
between may 1986 and february 1987 at a gulf of mexico drilling 
platform 
interior officials said the gas was destroyed by flaring a 
process that burns off unwanted gas tenneco said the action 
resulted in no health safety or environmental damage 
according to the departments inspector generals office 
tenneco burned off the gas because prices were too low to make it 
profitable to bring it onshore 
the companys lease agreement with the government however made 
tenneco responsible for paying royalties on all gas and oil 
regardless of whether it was sold government officials said 
tenneco tried to avoid the payments by filing false production and 
royalty reports and by disconnecting a gas meter 
two technicians from the minerals management service on an 
inspection tour of a tenneco offshore platform discovered the 
problem when they saw bubbling in the water a sign of gas being 
vented 
under terms of the accord which has been in negotiation for 
months tenneco will pay the fine in exchange for the governments 
agreement not to seek criminal prosecution civil penalties or 
cancel the companys lease

northrop corp directors boosted the value of 
stock options held by chairman thomas jones last year the same 
year they reprimanded him for his handling of payments in south 
korea the companys proxy statement reveals 
jones holds options to buy 12 million shares of northrop stock 
under an incentive plan last year the board cut the exercise 
price the price at which he is entitled to buy the stock from 
4588 a share to 2988 a share 
the stock was selling for about 25 a share on friday but if 
northrop stock climbed back above 4588 the 1987 high was

to the value of jones options 
the same proxy statement said jones had been reprimanded for his 
management style 
the statement didnt explain but the reprimand is widely 
believed to stem from the companys payment of 78 million to 
korean businessmen and companies in an unsuccessful attempt to sell 
northrops f20 fighter jet to that country from 1984 to 1986

the dollar fell sharply friday as us 
unemployment data indicated a slowdown in us economic growth 
interest rates fell on the bond market and a midwest bank lowered 
its prime rate 
the dollar came off rather dramatically today said bob 
morrissey a senior currency trader with the bank of bostons new 
york office 
the may jobless figure showed a modest 101000 new jobs in us 
nonfarm payrolls half the level expected by many analysts and one 
sign that inflationary pressures are subsiding 
southwest bank of st louis lowered its prime rate from 115 
percent to 11 percent although other banks did not follow suit 
in addition a rally on the bond market that sent longterm 
interest rates to a 15month low weakened the dollar dealers said 
dealers said the unemployment figures heightened market 
expectations that the federal reserve bank may soon ease its 
monetary policy in an effort to reverse the dollars recent surge 
lower interest rates hurt the value of the dollar by making 
yields on dollardenominated investments less attractive to global 
investors 
if you consider the balance of risk between the fed 
maintaining its monetary policy or easing its clear that after 
this latest set of figures the balance has shifted in favor of an 
early easing said christian dunis a senior official at chemical 
bank in london 
but the fed he added likely would wait for the release of 
further economic data before acting 
francoise soareskemp a vice president at credit suisse in new 
york said the currency market was about as volatile as weve 
seen in years 
she and other traders cited a 2 percent increase in the value of 
the german mark as a key indicator of the dollars decline 
ms soareskemp said currency swings were exaggerated because 
many major traders stayed out of the market 
in addition she said the fall was a reaction to the dollars 
steep runup of recent weeks it went too far too fast she said 
in london the british pound rose against the dollar to 15900 
from 15730 late thursday later in new york the pound rose 
further to 16040 from 15776 late thursday 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14180 japanese yen down from 
14252 yen thursday later in london the dollar was quoted at 
14175 yen in new york the dollar fell to 14050 yen from 14241

if new usx corp chairman charles a corry 
thought his predecessors troubles with takeover speculator carl 
icahn were history he got a jarring reminder less than 48 hours 
after taking charge of the steel and energy giant 
icahns sale of a record 2 billion block of texaco corp stock 
on thursday immediately raised speculation that he might turn his 
attention to usx which he unsuccessfully pursued in 1987 
corry who succeeded retiring chairman david m roderick on 
wednesday declined comment at a news conference friday on the 
possible impact of icahns stock sale 
usx which shot higher late thursday after news of icahns 
texaco stock sale finished down 1 at 3650 a share friday on the 
new york stock exchange 
but wall street analysts gave various reasons why they did not 
believe a takeover bid was likely any time soon 
charles bradford of merrill lynch capital markets cited 51 
billion in longterm debt that could become due immediately upon a 
change on control of usx that would increase the cost of a 
takeover beyond the 94 billion market value of its stock 
i really doubt thats as big a poison pill as some people 
think said bruce lazier of prescott ball amp turben if its a 
viable economic deal the financing will be had 
bradford also cited 2 billion in tax credits that the usx steel 
division could forfeit if ownership changes 
icahn certainly is aware of those things and doesnt want to 
lose them either but there is a lot of other restructuring that 
could be done lazier said 
for example usx could sell its texas oil amp gas corp for 25 
billion that could be used to repurchase stock bradford said usx 
also could appease any dissident shareholder by raising its 
dividends and speeding the sale of its diversified businesses 
icahn has advocated selling the steel division and concentrating 
on oil and natural gas production roderick has said usx may be 
willing to sell the steel unit the nations largest steelmaker 
but has received no offers that it considers worthy 
icahn acquired some 29 million shares of usx or around 11 
percent of the outstanding common stock beginning in 1986 late 
that year he proposed a takeover at 31 per share but usx rejected 
the proposal and threw roadblocks in his way and he withdrew the 
proposal in early 1987 
since then icahn has been a highly interested but satisfied 
shareholder according to rodericks account of their frequent 
discussions over lunch and dinner 
the sale of icahns 42 million texaco shares came one day after 
roderick 65 retired and was succeeded as chairman by corry 
any corporate raider might have to pay off usxs longterm debt 
under the terms of the companys lending agreements according to 
the usx annual report lenders could declare 51 billion in 
longterm debt due immediately upon a change in control of the 
company 
among the 51 billion is 738 million in revenue from the yates 
oil field of marathon oil co that is pledged as payment on 
borrowings 
the steelmaking uss division also enjoys about 2 billion in tax 
credits that could be forfeited if the parent usx sells off more 
than 20 percent of the steel division or if more than half the 
companys stock changes hands bradford said 
also said bradford keep in mind usx has a staggered board 
of directors if you were to make a tender offer today and you got 
it all youd get only a third of the board seats next year 
the sale of icahns texico stock the day after roderick left 
office may have been only a coincidence roderick has denied 
speculation that he had an agreement with icahn to delay takeover 
activity until after his retirement 
rodericks reputation lends credence to the speculation 
bradford said 
lets face it rodericks personality was that of a fighter 
he was a marine corps sergeant and a semipro boxer he said 
corrys background is that of a lawyer

gold and silver futures prices surged in late trading friday 
reacting to a weaker dollar a stronger oil market and expectations 
for a drop in interest rates 
on other markets grain and soybean futures finished mixed as 
did livestock and meat futures 
gold settled 450 to 460 higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the most active contract for delivery in august at 
37190 a troy ounce silver was 88 cents to 10 cents higher with 
july at 5338 a troy ounce 
the gains more than offset wednesdays steep decline and 
appeared to leave the gold market positioned for a further advance 
the weakening of the dollars value against the japanese yen and 
west german mark was the primary factor in the rally prompting 
investors to shift assets from dollars to gold 
but the late surge in oil prices a potentially inflationary 
development appeared to fuel some new investment buying of 
precious metals especially after the spot gold price rose above 
technical resistance at about 365 an ounce spot gold settled at 
36860 
there are some ideas here that a shortterm bottom has been 
carved out said bernard savaiko a metalmarket analyst in new 
york with painewebber inc the market was very oversold and 
looking for a technical bounce 
expectations for a drop in interest rates were fanned by 
fridays national unemployment report which showed job growth at 
its lowest level in more than three years 
some observers say the slowdown in job creation could prompt the 
federal reserve to ease up on interest rates in an attempt to 
stimulate the economy which could increase the threat of higher 
inflation and spur more buying of gold as an inflation hedge 
the late rally in oil prices on the new york mercantile exchange 
was largely due to nervousness about the opec strategy meeting in 
vienna austria analysts said 
little news came out of fridays opening opec sessions but many 
of the traders who had sold the market earlier in the week were 
reluctant to hold risky positions going into the weekend and turned 
buyers late in the day 
i would say a vacuum a reluctance to sell brought about 
aggressive nervous shortcovering said jerry samuels an 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 69 cents 
higher with july at 2014 a barrel heating oil was 169 cents to 
195 cents higher with july at 5004 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 35 cent to 151 cents higher with july at 6485 cents 
a gallon 
corn and wheat futures prices rose slightly on the chicago board 
of trade amid rumors of soviet purchases of us grain 
the agriculture department announced after the close that china 
had purchased 200000 metric tons of us wheat and that more than 
100000 metric tons of us corn had been sold to unknown 
destinations which usually means the soviet union 
soybeans ended lower on a continued easing of midwestern drought 
fears 
wheat settled unchanged to 3 cents higher with july at 391 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 262 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 168 a 
bushel soybeans were unchanged to 6 cents lower with july at 
706 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle were broadly 
mixed and feeder cattle were lower partly reflecting slack demand 
on the cash markets pork futures were mostly lower in light 
featureless trading 
live cattle settled 70 cent lower to 35 cent higher with june 
at 6835 cents a pound feeder cattle were 33 cent to 45 cent 
lower with august at 7762 cents a pound live hogs were 32 cent 
lower to 05 cent higher with june at 4832 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 12 cent to 30 cent lower with july at 3030 
cents a pound

there was a time when carl icahns opponents 
could easily pin the label corporate raider on the takeover 
strategist but four years after icahn bought and began running 
trans world airlines his image has become less clearcut 
icahn has pursued a string of companies over the years 
including phillips petroleum co chesebroughponds inc and bf 
goodrich co his bids were largely unsuccessful but icahn reaped 
millions of dollars in profits and became known as a raider in the 
process 
now there is speculation his next target will be usx corp the 
oil and steel giant in which icahn holds a large stake and 
unsuccessfully targeted for takeover in 1987 icahns sale of a 
record 2 billion block of texaco corp stock on thursday raised 
speculation that he might turn his attention to usx 
icahns tactics took a different turn after he defeated texas 
air corp in the fight for twa in september 1985 
twa management was convinced icahn would dismantle the airline 
and sell it off in pieces for a profit instead he has taken steps 
to build up the carrier and improve its financial health after 
years of losses 
in february 1986 icahn announced the airline was buying ozark 
air lines a smaller regional carrier at the time he said the 
purchase would give twa facilities and aircraft it needed but could 
not have acquired any other way 
in an attempt to further boost twas size and flagging finances 
he bid 165 billion for usair group inc in early 1987 but his 
target fought him off by acquiring piedmont aviation inc 
icahn also has considered buying eastern airlines last fall and 
again after eastern went into bankruptcy court reorganization in 
march 
icahn also is building twa from within announcing earlier this 
year the airline was expanding and updating its fleet with 
brandnew airbus industrie planes 
icahn proved a tough manager at twa negotiating wage 
concessions with the airlines unions when the independent 
federation of flight attendants walked out in march 1986 in a 
dispute over icahns demands for givebacks he began replacing 
strikers and they were forced to call off the walkout nine weeks 
after it started 
but his management of twa has not meant a completely new icahn 
in 1986 during the flight attendants strike icahn planned a 
hostile attempt to buy viacom international inc he ended up 
selling his 17 percent stake in viacom back to the firm in exchange 
for potentially lucrative stock purchase rights 
wall street analysts said icahn likely wanted to benefit from 
the entertainment companys expansion plans but couldnt juggle a 
takeover bid and his twa problems at the same time 
by selling his stock back to viacom icahn repeated transactions 
he had made many times in the past when companies repurchased his 
stock at a premium price to remove the threat of a takeover the 
practice known as greenmail on wall street branded icahn as a 
raider years ago 
the texaco stock sale the most expensive block trade ever on 
the new york stock exchange gave icahn 207 billion and raised 
questions about what he might do with the money 
icahn became texacos biggest shareholder in late 1987 and 
immediately began fighting with management charging it was not 
doing enough to raise the companys stock price 
he proposed a takeover of texaco valued at 145 billion and 
tried unsuccessfully to unseat the companys board in a proxy 
fight icahn said that if he won control of texaco the oil giants 
assets would be sold and the proceed would go to texaco 
shareholders 
however after the company undertook a major restructuring that 
included the sale of billions of dollars in assets and payment of 
an 8 a share special dividend to stockholders icahn reached a 
standstill pact in which he agreed not to attempt a texaco takeover 
for seven years 
icahn already has a major stake in usx he made a 72 billion 
bid for the company in early 1987 but gave up after the usx board 
rejected it when he made his bid there were again charges he only 
wanted to drive up the stock price and profit from it but he did 
not sell his shares when he abandoned the offer

energy futures prices rose friday led by a jump 
in heating oil and gasoline prices 
analysts said the sharp rise in prices took them by surprise 
given the bearish undertone in the market in recent days as 
investors nervously awaited opecs midyear meeting 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark crude oil grade ended 33 cents 
higher at 2014 a barrel the august contract rose 41 cents and 
other months were even higher 
among refined products the july heating oil contract rose 195 
cents to 5004 cents a gallon and the unleaded gasoline contract 
for july delivery jumped 151 cents to 6485 cents a gallon other 
contract months also gained 
there was no news and no cash reason why the market behaved 
like this said james r fiedler vice president in charge of 
energy brokering for edampf man international futures inc it 
was most likely the rumor of a rumor story 
opec ministers are scheduled to open talks on monday in vienna 
focusing on the cartels production ceiling for the second half of 
the year 
market observers said there was little news from vienna where 
opecs eightmember monitoring committee met briefly and then 
adjourned the rally they said coincided with the end of the 
meeting which was intended to lay the groundwork for mondays full 
ministerial meeting 
the question is why would it be so bullish said nauman 
barakat vice president of energy investments at prudentialbache 
securities inc the fact that the meeting adjourned without any 
contention and vitriolic statements by the kuwaitis and the saudis 
indicates they want to find a compromise 
opec is expected to raise its output ceiling by at least 1 
million barrels a day over the current 185 million barrels to 
stabilize prices at around current levels 
but kuwaits insistence on a higher quota has pitted it against 
its persian gulf neighbor saudi arabia the largest opec producer 
barakat said that speculation that opec general secretary 
subroto had arrived at a formula for resolving the differences 
between the saudis and kuwaitis helped lift prices 
other analysts attributed the gains to technical factors led 
primarily by a strong rise in heating oil 
heating oil had been oversold so it had more potential to 
rally said jim steel an analyst with refco inc it led crude 
oil and coming up to the weekend im not surprised to see 
shortcovering

employees of the chicago amp north western 
announced they have submitted an offer to buy the systems parent 
cnw corp adding a new twist to the companys fight against a 
hostile takeover bid by a new york investor group 
the association of general chairman a group comprising the 
leadership of the railroads 16 unions and 6500 members issued a 
statement saying terms of the proposal would not be revealed 
ed wytkind a spokesman for the group said the proposal was 
submitted to a committee of independent cnw board members by 
fridays 5 pm deadline for offers he said the proposal calls for 
employees ultimately to hold a onethird share in the recapitalized 
company with shareholders retaining the remaining twothirds 
we will not discuss the bidders or the bids received cnw 
spokesman james foote said 
japonica partners has offered 44 a share for outstanding cnw 
stock the new yorkbased investment group already owns 88 percent 
of cnws shares 
cnw rose 75 cents to 4650 a share friday on the new york stock 
exchange 
soon after japonica launched its tender offer cnw urged 
shareholders not to sell their stock while the company searched for 
other potential buyers 
in its statement the cnw employee group said it was undertaking 
a buyout to keep cnw intact and avoid splintering of the 
companys rail system which covers 6000 miles in nine states 
we will not stand by and allow this railroad to fall victim to 
the often devastating effects of leveraged buyouts said ellis 
johnson president of the union association the best way to 
avoid such a fate is to take the matter into our own hands 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with 
borrowed funds that are repaid with money from the targets cash 
flow or raised by the sale of its assets 
cnw defeated japonicas attempt to elect its own slate of 
directors at the annual shareholders meeting last month

longterm interest rates plunged to their lowest 
levels in 15 months friday as investors snapped up bonds in flurry 
of anticipation that the federal reserve might ease credit 
following a weak us employment report 
it was a spree a jamboree a jubilee said robert brusca 
chief economist at nikko securities co international inc 
trading started with a bang after the labor department reported 
the nations unemployment rate dipped to 52 percent in may from 
aprils 53 percent 
although lower unemployment can indicate stronger economic 
growth which tends to boost interest rates the market 
concentrated on factors in the report that underscored the view 
that the economy is slowing for example the report indicated may 
had the weakest monthtomonth job growth since march 1986 
the report sent bond prices sharply higher and the gains held 
throughout the session 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond soared 1 points or 
nearly 1875 per 1000 in face amount its yield which moves in 
the opposite direction plunged from thursdays 860 percent to 
843 percent its lowest since march 3 1988 
the report accentuated rumors all week that the fed is going 
to ease interest rates said robert chandross vice president and 
chief economist for lloyds bank plcs north america head office in 
new york 
the question is whether the market is expecting more than its 
going to get he said 
indications that the economy was slowing and thus dampening 
inflation have raised speculation the federal reserve might push 
interest rates lower to help curb the recent rise of the dollar 
chandross suggested the fed may allow the federal funds rate 
the interest on overnight loans between banks to trade lower the 
fed influences the fed funds rate and thus other shortterm 
interest rates by adding money to the banking system or draining 
it out 
the federal funds rate traded at 9 916 percent late in the 
session down from 9 1316 percent late thursday 
a lower federal funds rate could entice major banks to lower 
their prime interest rates a benchmark used to set interest in a 
variety of consumer and corporate credit early friday southwest 
bank of st louis lowered its prime rate from 115 percent to 11 
percent but major banks did not follow suit 
if we do get some prime rate cuts by the large money center 
banks it tells the fed that demand for money has weakened a 
little and the fed will seriously consider cutting the discount 
rate said jack barbanel senior vice president at gruntal amp co 
while some experts speculated a widespread prime rate cut could 
come as early as next week they said they did not believe the fed 
would ease credit by cutting its discount rate the interest it 
charges on loans to banks as quickly 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm governments rose 2332 point to 1 points intermediate 
maturities jumped 1 points to 1 points and 20year issues were 
up a full point according to telerate inc the financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 1093 to 116503 
in corporate trading industrials moved higher moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures total return 
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 290 to 31763 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 1332 point the average yield to 
maturity fell to 739 percent from 743 percent late thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills slipped to 862 percent as 
the discount fell 23 basis points to 835 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 856 percent as the discount fell 26 basis 
points to 812 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 855 
percent as the discount fell 22 basis points to 793 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

the manufacturer of alar the apple chemical 
that stirred a national furor over a possible cancer risk to 
children said friday it is taking the substance off the us 
market immediately 
uniroyal chemical co continued to defend the chemical as safe 
but said continued use on apples is causing doubt and confusion 
about the safety of americas food supply 
apple growers and processors had pleaded for such action because 
fears about alar had drastically cut into apple industry sales 
the company said sales of daminozide which is marketed under 
the name alar would continue to about 70 markets outside the 
united states including some that export apples and apple products 
to this country 
however a spokeswoman for the international apple institute 
said most imported apples are green ones such as granny smiths 
which are not treated with alar 
supplies of the chemical held by us customers may be returned 
for refunds the company said 
the environmental protection agency said late friday it has 
reached agreement with uniroyal on a plan to monitor the removal of 
alar from the us market although there is no government ban on 
its use the epa said it also will notify foreign governments about 
agency concerns about alar 
the action taken by uniroyal will significantly reduce risk 
from exposure to daminozide said victor kimm the epas acting 
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances 
the epa has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food 
products because tests in laboratory animals have indicated the 
chemical can cause cancer final action on the proposed regulation 
is not expected until late 1990 
uniroyal has disputed the findings and james wylie company 
vice president said friday we want to emphasize that we have 
not changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide 
the epa estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the us 
apple crop is treated with alar a growth regulator that improves 
the apples appearance and gives it a longer shelf life 
wylie of uniroyal said at a news conference our voluntary 
action is taken to ease public confusion and we hope to let the 
proven scientific process work 
daminozide has become the focus of a needless controversy that 
is causing doubt and confusion about the safety of americas food 
supply a needless controversy that is hurting the apple industry 
and the american public he said 
the company indicated that it intends to resume selling alar if 
a government scientific review scheduled to be completed next 
year concludes the chemical is safe 
apple growers applauded the decision by uniroyal but some 
suggested that the company should have made the move much earlier 
the international apple institute estimates that growers have lost 
more than 100 million because of the apple scare over alar in 
recent months 
they are darn late in getting to this point weve been after 
them for a long time and consumer confidence has been affected 
said john mcalister of tree top inc the nations largest apple 
juice maker 
mcalister said in yakima wash that tree tops sales have 
dropped more than 20 percent since the alar controversy began in 
february even though tree top and other processors have said 
repeatedly they do not use alartreated apples 
this action is most welcomed since it will allay any 
remaining concerns consumers may have about small levels of alar in 
apples and apple products said larry davenport executive 
director of the processed apples institute 
many growers have stopped using the product since concern about 
its health effects gained widespread attention earlier this year 
wylie although not providing any specific production figures said 
sales of alar in the united states have dropped 75 percent during 
the past three years 
earlier this year a report by the natural resources defense 
council a private environmental group said young children are 
particularly at risk from alar and a variety of pesticides used on 
fruits and vegetables because they consume large amounts 
especially relative to their weight of apple products other 
fruits and vegetables 
although the government said the levels of alar in apples were 
not hazardous the private groups report prompted many parents to 
question whether they should continue to provide apple products to 
their youngsters school districts in a number of major cities for 
a time stopped providing apples in school lunchrooms 
janet hathaway an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the uniroyal decision represented a capitulation to 
public opinion but that consumers could still be exposed to the 
chemical because it will continue to be sold in countries that 
export apple products to the united states 
but maureen miklavic a spokeswoman for the international apple 
institute said exposure to alar from its use in other countries 
would be unlikely not only are most imports green apples and thus 
free of alar she said but imported apple concentrates are 
expected to be closely monitored by the processing industry for 
possible alar content 
congress is considering legislation that would prohibit the 
importing of alar treated apples

the secretary of agriculture friday 
authorized additional limited relief for livestock producers with 
parched pastures and an iowa cattlemens group said that it was 
pleased even if there were more strings attached than it desired 
while the decision applies to 16 states with stunted pastures 
and meager feed supplies the us department of agriculture said 
the relief is needed most in iowa kansas and nebraska 
the action to allow haying and grazing on lands idled under a 
federal program designed to conserve highly erodable acres was 
announced in washington by secretary clayton yeutter three days 
after a tour of droughtstricken regions of southern iowa 
livestock producers have exhausted stocks of hay that were 
carried into winter and they are now faced with another dry 
spring so theyre out of hay and short of grass yeutter said 
iowa farmers with dwindling ponds dried up wells and skimpy 
pastures had urged yeutter on tuesday to open up land taken out of 
production under the federal conservation reserve program in that 
program the government makes an annual payment to farmers who 
agree to remove erodable land from production for at least 10 years 
as of last year 28 million acres nationwide had been placed 
into the conservation reserve program and the government pays an 
estimated 14 billion a year to participants 
the usda earlier had authorized livestock grazing and hay 
cutting on land taken out of production under this years commodity 
programs 
the 16 qualifying states are california colorado florida 
illinois iowa kansas minnesota missouri nebraska new mexico 
new york north dakota oklahoma south dakota texas and wisconsin 
the emergency haying and grazing rights will be granted on a 
countybycounty basis 
county offices of the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service will submit applications to their state office 
for designation as a livestock emergency and recommendations will 
be made to washington 
richard vohs an aide to gov terry branstad said it should not 
take counties long to apply for the relief 
during last years drought farmers and ranchers also were 
allowed to harvest hay or graze livestock on conservation reserve 
program acres 
unlike the 1988 program however owners will not be allowed to 
donate their conservation land for use by other livestock producers 
other usda restrictions on use of the conservation acres are 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at least 25 percent of a field be left undisturbed for wildlife 
cover 
no haying or grazing will be allowed on fields seeded after 
july 1 1987 
participants will lose 50 percent of their government 
conservation reserve payments in the next contract year 
only one cutting of hay will be permitted and no hay may be 
harvested after july 15 farmers must leave at least three inches 
of stubble on harvested fields 
grazing will only be allowed after an inspection of the field 
and will not be allowed after aug 1 
any reseeding must be paid for by the owner and the government 
will not reimburse farmers for fences or watering facilities 
erected on conservation acres used for livestock 
vegetative cover specifications in the conservation program 
contract wont be waived because of drought 
compliance spot checks will be expanded for the conservation 
program 
maynard jayne field manager iowa cattlemens association in 
ames said while restrictions were more severe than his group had 
recommended we are quite pleased the secretary has made the 
decision 
one sore point with the group was the decision to prohibit 
donation of haying and grazing rights 
many cattlemen do not have conservation reserve program 
acreage he said and will be denied the extra source of forage for 
their livestock 
he also said the 50 percent reduction in rental payments is 
twice the level of last year a level the iowa cattlemens group 
had recommended be continued

american airlines ground workers overwhelmingly 
accepted a fouryear contract that makes its mechanics the highest 
paid in the industry and includes an unusual flexible benefit 
package their union said friday 
the pact which also accelerates some new workers more quickly 
along the airlines wage scale was approved by a vote of 13103 to 
4157 or 76 percent in favor said transport workers union 
spokesman jim gannon in washington 
gannon said all locals approved the contract ranging from a 
high of 91 percent at americans home base of dallasfort worth 
international airport to a low of 66 percent 
this contract includes many innovative provisions that will 
benefit both the company and its employees american vice 
president charles pasciuto said it is a real winwin deal 
americans first proposal included provisions where employees 
would begin contributing toward their own health insurance a key 
sticking point in earlier negotiations 
the new contract solves that conflict with flex benefits 
under which the company will allocate to each employee a certain 
amount of money to be used toward benefits and the worker will be 
able to select the desired coverage 
all workers were moved up on americans 14step pay scale the 
scale under which it takes 12 years to reach top pay has long 
been a sore point with workers and the union had sought to reduce 
the time to five years 
gannon said the contract also makes topscale mechanics the 
highest paid in the industry 
during the life of the contract a line mechanics top salary 
will rise from 1875 per hour to 2058 an hour plus a 2 per 
hour license premium for mechanics with two licenses 
the agreement covers 22000 american workers including 
mechanics bag handlers ground crews stock clerks guards 
meteorologists and aircraft cleaners 
the contract was devised a month ago during a marathon 
negotiating session between the union the airline and a federal 
mediator who had been called in after workers rejected an earlier 
offer

the us economy cooled slightly in may for the 
first time since july 1986 in a further indication inflation could 
be easing the nations purchasing managers said friday in their 
monthly report 
production by the nations factories continued to grow although 
at a significantly slower pace than in april according to the 
report issued by the national association of purchasing management 
the total economy resumed its ratcheting path toward slower 
growth during may as the manufacturing economy reported the first 
decline in growth in almost three years said robert j bretz 
chairman of the trade group based in tempe ariz 
once again expanding exports and increased capital 
expenditures are providing the real growth he said virtually 
all indicators confirmed the slowing of the economy and perhaps 
most importantly the sharp slowing of inflation growth along with 
it 
the groups purchasing managers index declined to 497 percent 
in may down sharply from 53 percent in april the group said it 
was the first time in 33 months the indicator had dropped below 50 
percent and indicated the economy was slowing further the group 
stated 
a reading above 50 indicates the economy is generally expanding 
below 50 that the economy is generally declining 
the pmi has averaged 519 percent for the first five months of 
1989 bretz said past experience indicates that if this 
average were to continue for the balance of the year it would be 
consistent with real gnp growth of about 25 percent or roughly 
the same as in the first quarter the pmi would have to fall below 
44 percent before signalling negative real gnp 
the groups price index plunged to 576 percent in may from 665 
percent in april the lowest since december 1986 only 11 items in 
the groups survey were reported up in price last month the fewest 
since february 1987 
new orders continued to expand in may but also at a reduced 
rate the group said once again inventory buying did not supply 
the growth in production inventories decreased sharply in may for 
the fifth consecutive month 
new export orders increased in may but at a somewhat slower rate 
of growth the group said of the 69 percent of group members who 
said they export 25 percent reported better export orders down 
slightly from 28 percent in april 
the 5 percent who reported lower export orders during the month 
compared with 4 percent in april the seasonally unadjusted index 
of new export orders was 60 percent in may moderately lower than 
62 percent in april the group said this indicated exports 
continued to fuel economic growth 
the groups figures are compiled through a monthly survey of 
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies

opec ministers met briefly friday before 
breaking up for private bargaining over how to set new guidelines 
for pricing and producing their oil 
twelve ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries met in a 90minute session that preceded formal 
strategy sessions set to begin monday 
the ministers declined to give details of their talks which 
were not attended by qatar opec president rilwanu lukman the 
nigerian oil minister would only say the officials discussed the 
whole agenda 
venezuelas oil chief celestino armas said the officials would 
meet again saturday and sunday 
the ministers are attempting to fashion a new accord that will 
guide their pricing and output policies for the last six months of 
the year 
the cartel last november reached an accord governing production 
for the first half of 1989 the agreement set an opec output 
ceiling of 185 million barrels a day sharply under actual 
production levels of late last year in an attempt to support a 
target price 18 a barrel 
prices are now more than 40 percent higher than when the 
agreement was made partly due to accidents in oil producing areas 
that have caused supply disruptions 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
has soared from 1234 a barrel at the end of november to nearly 
1770 this week although it topped 18 earlier this year 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude closed up 33 cents at 2014 a barrel friday on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
some officials predict the ministers may decide to extend their 
current accord temporarily if they cannot reach a quick consensus 
some opec ministers have presented new ideas for an accord but 
most appear unwilling to want any changes that could upset what has 
been a surprisingly strong market so far this year 
diego tamariz ecuadors oil minister said the main 
objective of the meeting is to have stability 
evenness in the market he said will be brought by production 
levels in accordance with demand 
the ministers must consider whether to maintain their production 
ceiling at 185 million barrels a day or boost it some to 195 
million or 20 million barrels some analysts say opec already is 
producing in excess of 20 million barrels a day 
affecting their decision will be estimates on demand for their 
oil in the second half of the year 
the international energy agency in its monthly oil market 
report predicted demand for opec crude would rise to 204 million 
barrels a day in the last six months of the year 
if the producers agree to increase their output cap they then 
have the tricky task of dividing up the extra amount 
several nations including kuwait and the united arab emirates 
are pressing to enlarge their quotas ecuador and gabon also would 
like more officials say 
analysts say the saudi arabian delegation has suggested lifting 
the overall ceiling by 1 million barrels a day and giving some of 
the extra to those four nations 
the ministers also must decide whether to maintain the 18 a 
barrel target price which has been in effect since january 1987 
saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer said on his arrival in 
vienna that he would suggest eliminating the reference price but 
has declined to elaborate on the plan nazer has said previously 
that an option would be to eliminate the benchmark price in favor 
of strict adherence to production quotas 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

sun microsystems inc completing 
an expensive bonebybone transplant of the skeleton of the 
company and plagued by supply problems thursday forecast 
significantly lower earnings or possibly a loss in its fourth 
quarter ending june 30 
a loss would be its first since it reported red ink in its 
initial quarter in 1982 
although sun a leader in workstation computers issued its new 
forecast at the close of the stock market its share price tumbled 
125 to 2075 in trading on the nasdaq overthecounter market 
revenues in the fourth quarter could fall below the 497 million 
of the third quarter ended march 30 the company said that would 
put the companys fiscal 1989 revenues at about 18 billion up 
from 12 billion last year 
the conversion to a new management information system in april 
was not without difficulties the company said this slowed 
production early in the quarter in addition the introduction in 
this quarter of five major new products has made it more difficult 
to forecast product mix 
sun said production of the new products has been somewhat 
impaired by an insufficient supply of certain components 
scott mcnealy suns president declined to specify which 
components were in short supply but said we expect those 
component shortages to not be an issue by midjuly 
he also declined to say which of the companys new products were 
affected most by the supply shortage or to give details of how well 
the products were selling but he said the sparcstation1 suns 
lowcost entry into the workstation market with a starting price of 
about 9000 was clearly the lead product among the new 
entries 
mcnealy said the company could be faulted for not being more 
precise on our forecasting but he said it was difficult to 
predict what customers would order and how much the change in 
management information systems would affect sales 
basically we had to do a bonebybone transplant of the 
skeleton of the company he said referring to the replacement of 
a management information computer system that had been in place 
since its early days with a new system 
delays have also resulted from continued strong sales of suns 
traditional products causing unexpected production demands the 
company said 
these factors have hindered suns ability to assess accurately 
the companys incoming orders to forecast and to schedule 
production efficiently the company said 
sun said the problems will be confined to the fourth quarter and 
the company is not encouraging changes in expectations for fiscal 
1990 which the company said will be an excellent year 
kathleen hurley an analyst at the san josebase research firm 
dataquest inc said she was not surprised by the companys 
announcement in light of the ambitious product introductions made 
this year 
when they announced the sparcstation i thats a significant 
revamping she said that affected their net income it takes a 
lot of time and money to do that 
she called the cost of introducing the new products and the 
multimilliondollar change of the management information system a 
natural migration i dont think they messed up 
i think theyll recover by the end of the first quarter of 
fiscal 1990 or the start of the second quarter she said the 
workstation market as a whole is doing well
