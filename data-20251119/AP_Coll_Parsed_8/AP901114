govelect lowell p weicker jr said 
wednesday connecticuts budget problems may get worse and he is 
weighing all options including tax increases to deal with a 21 
billion shortfall 
ill have to study it said weicker a former threeterm 
us senator 
well get whatever job has to be done done weicker said 
i think its clear to anybody that sacrifice is going to be 
required in some form and i dont want to go ahead and state what 
the sacrifice is going to be until i understand the full dimensions 
of the problems 
the 21 billion gap between spending necessary to maintain 
current services and income from existing taxes represents 30 
percent of the current 705 billion budget 
retiring gov william a oneill who decided not to seek 
reelection this year had said he could not see how the next 
governor could balance the budget without raising taxes he 
reiterated that stance after a meeting with weicker wednesday 
i think thats going to be very difficult if not impossible 
oneill said of avoiding tax increases 
weicker was to be provided budget details thursday state law 
requires that the governor present a balance budget each year and 
the legislature approve a balanced spending plan 
weicker said he was not taken aback by the size of the 
deficit estimate 
the recession were in has accelerated at a rate far exceeding 
any predictions he said it could very well get even worse 
weicker will be inaugurated jan 9

nine members of a literary panel of the 
national endowment for the arts resigned to protest a new 
congressional edict that federally subsidized works must meet 
general standards of decency 
we deplore the implied threat of censure and attempt to 
constrict freedom of artistic expression and the rights grantd by 
the first amendment they wrote in a joint letter monday to nea 
chairman john e frohnmayer 
the nine resigned from an 11member nea panel of outside experts 
that judges grant applications from small independent presses 
literary magazines and nonprofit organizations that distribute 
contemporary literary works 
last year on the basis of the literary publishing panels 
recommendations frohnmayer approved 99 grants totaling 14 
million 
frohnmayer said resignations were premature and 
unfortunate he predicted the endowment would find a way to 
implement the new law in good faith without stifling artistic 
creativity 
the protest seemed largely symbolic nea spokesman josh dare 
said the panel was effectively dissolved when it completed its work 
on 198990 grant proposals last december a new panel minus the 
nine protesters will convene nov 26 to review next years 
grants 
the nine said they resigned over a new congressional requirement 
that the nea chairman shall ensure that grants are made 
taking into consideration general standards of decency and 
respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the american 
public 
congress tacked those restrictions onto the endowments current 
174 million budget shortly before it adjourned oct 28 the curbs 
replaced a much stricter obscenity ban that covered nea grants last 
year 
this year congress said only that obscenity shall not be 
funded by the nea and that obscenity judgments should be left to 
the courts 
even though the new curbs are milder than the former ban they 
nevertheless set a very scary precedent said jennifer moyer 
former chairwoman of the neas literary publishing panel if 
there are any restrictions on freedom of expression its 
unacceptable 
ms moyer a poet and literary publisher from mt kisco ny 
resigned along with eight others representing writers editors 
publishers booksellers and arts administrators on the panel 
in a separate letter informing frohnmayer of her resignation 
panelist helaine harris a bookseller from hyattsville md asked 
how the endowment can distinguish between decent or indecent 
art under the new law 
i feel that i can be a judge of artistic merit but i dont 
feel that i should pass judgment on decency she wrote i 
refuse to be a part of this selfcensorship process 
the other panelists who resigned were michael anania a poet 
fiction writer and teacher from chicago denise chavez a houston 
writer katharine harer of berkeley calif director of a 
distributing company for small literary presses brooks haxton a 
poet and teacher from white plains ny poet susan howe of 
guilford conn peter meinke a writer and director of a literary 
workshop at eckard college in st petersburg fla and e 
ethelbert miller a poet and teacher at howard university in 
washington dc 
the two panelists who did not resign were anne bourget of the 
california arts council in sacramento and beverly jarrett editor 
in chief of the university of missouri press at columbia mo 
ms jarrett who will serve on the newly formed literary 
publishing panel said she refused to resign because it seemed 
like throwing the baby out with the bath water at a time when the 
nea deserves support for helping the arts survive 
ms bourget did not return repeated telephone calls seeking her 
comment

if you dont know where you are youre 
nowhere 
thats the word from national geographic society president 
gilbert m grosvenor who unveiled a massive new book tuesday that 
shows where everywhere is 
the 18 million 405page sixth national geographic atlas 
arrives in a world undergoing change 
and that change made compiling the new book exciting confusing 
taxing and costly say its editors 
producing this new atlas was like covering a breaking news 
story its been a scramble said william graves editor of 
national geographic magazine 
changes such as the merger of east and west germany and north 
and south yemen and the potential for other changes nearly 
delayed publication and resulted in some unexpected costs 
for example on sept 21 the german embassy called to inform the 
society that the new united germany had chosen berlin as its sole 
capital that call cost the geographic 100000 
officials thought they had taken every precaution they printed 
all the physical maps first then the less controversial political 
maps 
germany in the process of merging two nations into one was 
left for last but finally the geographic had to go ahead 
the editors took a chance and designated two capitals bonn and 
berlin but the germans outfoxed them by choosing to have just one 
the presses ground to a halt the map of germany and some of the 
text was changed 
and on tuesday when the society unveiled the result its newest 
world atlas showed only berlin as the german capital 
wary of further potential changes in the soviet union for 
example grosvenor said buyers of the 7495 book will be entitled 
to two updates over the next three years those would be 
supplements but grosvenor said the exact form they take will 
depend on what changes they reflect 
in addition to the traditional maps the new volume has a number 
of satellite images including an unusual world map showing all 
land areas virtually cloudfree 
that map was compiled from thousands of pictures collected over 
several years by national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
satellites then the best cloudfree images of each part of the 
world were pieced together to form a giant world mosaic 
its an image of the earth as weve never seen it before 
said grosvenor

the postal service is trying to pit worker 
against worker by offering cash bonuses but no hourly wage 
increases the president of the largest postal union contends 
its just a massage piece designed to divide us moe biller 
president of the american postal workers union said tuesday as 
thousands of unionized postal employees held a rally at a 
washington hotel 
the postal service and its four largest unions which together 
represent 660000 workers are in the midst of negotiations to 
replace contracts that expire nov 20 
biller called managements latest offer which has not been 
publicly outlined by the postal service a piece of garbage 
designed to pit worker against worker 
postal service spokesman michael west said we have negotiated 
at the table and not in the press at least for now we prefer 
to leave the specifics on the table 
biller said management had offered the 234000member national 
association of letter carriers a separate pay incentive plan aimed 
at dividing the two unions which bargain together although for 
separate contracts billers union represents 334000 postal 
clerks maintenance employees drivers and special delivery 
messengers 
assistant postmaster general david charters said the 
payincentive plan was part of the postal services goal of holding 
the rate of postage increases below the rate of inflation 
we think incentives to support that plan are in order 
charters said 
because the agency no longer subsidized by taxpayers must 
break even over time its board of governors has proposed raising 
the cost of mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring 
the unions have not made a counter offer biller declined to say 
how big a pay increases the unions were proposing or when the 
proposals would be presented letter carriers and clerks now 
receive a starting salary of around 24000 and can earn a maximum 
of about 31500 employees receive an additional 8560 in 
benefits and premium pay 
tuesdays solidarity rally attended by both letter carriers 
and clerks was aimed at showing the postal service that the two 
unions would stand together biller said 
two other unions also negotiating with the postal service are 
the national postal mail handlers union which represents 50000 
mail handlers and the national rural letter carriers association 
with about 42000 members 
biller said little progress had been made since the talks began 
in august he said he was not optimistic that a deal could be 
struck by next week 
right now i dont see anything on the horizon he said 
but postal service officials still have hope that an agreement 
will be reached by deadline west said 
under federal law it is illegl for postal workers to strike 
if a contract isnt reached by midnight nov 20 both sides could 
extend the current contract to give themselves more time to settle 
the dispute

the white house and congress share blame for 
allowing scandal and mismanagement to go unchecked at the 
department of housing and urban development during the reagan 
administration a senate panel concludes 
in a report tuesday the investigative panel recommended a 
series of reforms including splitting up the white houses office 
of management and budget to create a separate office to monitor 
management of federal agencies 
hud mismanaged programs either because it opposed the program 
itself or because it lacked the capacity or leadership to 
operate them free from abuse the investigative subcommittee of 
the senate banking committee said unfortunately the various 
parties responsible for oversight were all negligent including hud 
itself omb and the congress 
sen bob graham dfla chairman of the panel appointed to 
handle the senates inquiry into the 2 billion hud scandals said 
the white house budget office under president reagan gave little 
scrutiny to required management reports and acted on none 
theres a need for more emphasis on the management side of 
omb graham said in an interview omb has become essentially a 
budget office they completely collapsed they became a filing 
agency not hardly reading and certainly not acting on the 
reports 
almost every safety net ripped and let hud crash to the 
ground he said 
the report blamed samuel pierce hud secretary for all eight 
years of reagans term for a handsoff management that fostered 
abuse it blamed congress for ignoring warnings of management 
problems and for holding no oversight hearings on the troubled 
department 
it said the senate failed in its confirmation responsibilities 
by allowing the reagan administration to fill the agencys top 
ranks with political appointees who had little interest in housing 
only two people nominated for hud positions during the 1980s failed 
to gain confirmation it said 
the panel recommended creation of a federal advisory panel to 
evaluate future hud political appointees and report to the senate 
on their worthiness graham compared it to the american bar 
associations review of judicial nominees which the senate 
considers before confirming judges and justices 
the senate panel focused on structural flaws that permitted the 
scandals a separate house investigation focused on personalities 
in the scandal and received far more public notice 
most of the subcommittees findings were approved unanimously 
the ranking republican sen connie mack rfla disagreed on 
splitting omb he also opposed creating the confirmation advisory 
board and the panels recommendation that huds staffing be 
increased 
graham said he would sponsor bills to implement the report 
congress created the white house budget office and could change it 
by law or the president could take executive action on his own he 
said 
among the panels other recommendations 
huds assistant secretary for administration should be a career 
employee not a political appointee hud should report to congress 
on other positions that should be reserved for career staff 
senate hearings should be held to receive each report of the 
hud inspector general the secretarys semiannual report and other 
required hud management reports 
hud should increase its monitoring of subsidy programs to 
eliminate excess subsidies for specific projects which were 
revealed in the hud scandals it should overhaul its calculation of 
fair market rents 
graham said he concluded the hud scandals were in part due to a 
deliberate effort by the reagan administration to fill the agency 
with people who werent competent and had antipathy for the 
departments mission resulting in failure and discredit falling 
upon housing programs 
the panel did not allege illegality but graham said he believed 
there may be some examples of perjury in reports pierce made to 
the president and congress on management capability as required by 
law 
the report cited a 1987 hud document stating that its financial 
management controls were adequate at the same time the report 
said hud management knew that serious problems existed with 
huds accounting systems and that the federal housing 
administrations accounting systems failed to meet accepted 
standards and were deemed unauditable 
pierce who is under investigation by the special prosecutor 
has denied any wrongdoing

marine base will be sentenced jan 9 for killing a marine corporal 
in an attempt to hide her role in an alleged embezzlement scheme 
involving the helicopter squadron that serves president bush 
markeithia r reeves 24 of suitland md on tuesday entered a 
socalled alford plea in which a defendant does not admit guilt 
but acknowledges that the state has enough evidence to convict she 
faces a maximum sentence of 20 years to life in prison 
the plea was accepted just before reeves was to begin her 
firstdegree murder trial in the death of cpl estella pearson 
pearson 26 a quantico clerk whose responsibilities included 
reviewing travel vouchers was found shot to death march 5 in her 
car in a shopping center parking lot 
a second defendant tania t morton 23 of arlington va a 
former navy civilian clerk is scheduled to go on trial tuesday 
following reeves plea in prince william county circuit court 
prosecutors called two witnesses to the stand to substantiate the

became apparent that travel vouchers were being falsified involving 
members of the quanticobased helicopter squadron one which 
transports the president and other government officials 
secret service agent robert turner testified that 44 us 
treasury checks totaling 33000 with endorsements that had been 
forged had been traced to reeves and morton 
reeves worked in the same department as pearson and was 
responsible for preparing travel vouchers for employees going on 
temporary assignments 
turner said pearsons supervisor asked her to verify several 
suspicious travel vouchers markeithia saw this the agent told 
the washington post outside the courtroom then she started to

a senate employee had a warning for paul 
wellstone when he walked into the capitol for the first time since 
unseating sen rudy boschwitz rminn 
senator this place changes people the worker told him 
remind me some time if im changing wellstone replied 
wellstone who has never held public office arrived for two 
days of orientation sessions tuesday intending to live up to his 
advance billing as an aggressive articulate spokesman for liberal 
causes 
he didnt seem to be intimidated at all sen tom daschle 
dsd said after an organizational meeting that was the first 
chance for many senators to see and hear wellstone 
im going to roll up my sleeves wellstone said im very 
serious about public policy i also have a mandate to be outspoken 
thats the way i am i want to enjoy myself here i dont want to 
change 
wellstone the lone democrat in the 1990 class was the only 
senate candidate in the country this year to defeat an incumbent 
the other senatorselect republican reps hank brown of colorado 
larry craig of idaho and robert smith of new hampshire won open 
seats 
wellstone is a short balding 46yearold a former state 
campaign manager for jesse jackson and a political science 
professor on leave from carleton college in northfield minn 
boschwitz aides dismissed him as an abbie hoffmantype 
character and the incumbent outspent him 71 in the campaign 
but wellstone crisscrossed the state in a rickety converted 
school bus and captivated minnesotans with his highenergy style 
selfdeprecating humor and infectious enthusiasm 
he also drew attention for a series of offbeat tv ads that 
exploited his underdog status one was a breakneck parody of a 
candidates day in which he said he had to talk fast because he had 
little money another followed the frustrated wellstone trying to 
find boschwitz at offices all over 
he called for national health insurance universal health care 
deep cuts in military spending and big increases in education and 
nutrition aid 
because of the deficit weve built up the kind of agenda i 
believe in which is kind of a human capitalpeople agenda cant 
happen right away he said tuesday 
wellstone however cant wait forever his promised after the 
nov 6 election to serve only two terms 
i think i can make a difference he said i really believe 
there will be big changes in our country in the 90s i think that 
people are ready for change if thats the case ill be a strong 
force for it 
wellstone introduced himself at the democratic senate caucus 
tuesday 
he talked about how he hopes the democrats will stand up for 
the things they believe in said daschle i think hes going to 
be a welcome addition to the caucus 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said wellstone 
will be a valuable productive and contributing member of the 
senate and will represent the people of his state fairly and 
effectively and vigorously 
but first more mundane matters beckoned such as getting into 
the capitol bidding for committee assignments and learning who 
people are 
what im most nervous about is that i hope everybody has name 
tags wellstone said otherwise im going to go up to somebody 
who i should know and say what is your name and it turns out to 
be the senate majority leader or something like that

in a tiny seaside village police on 
wednesday fatally wounded a gunman they said killed at least 11 
people in a shooting rampage that was new zealands worst massacre 
officials said 
police said 33yearold david malcolm gray who had fled to a 
house on the villages northern edge after being driven from his 
own had been shot in the chest and ankle and also suffered a head 
wound 
at about 545 pm police lobbed smoke grenades into the house 
and stormed it ending a 21hour ordeal that wiped out nearly half 
the population of the village of aramoana 
blackclad officers some with ski masks had stormed grays 
house nearly two hours earlier but found it empty and began a 
search 
police originally said gray was being airlifted by army 
helicopter to nearby dunedin later they said he had died of his 
injuries 
aramoana which had a population of 25 before the rampage is 
about 17 miles north of dunedin in rugged country on new zealands 
south island 
victims of the massacre included a 6yearold boy who had rode 
his bicycle up to the gunmans house to see what was happening and 
a police sergeant from nearby port chalmers whose body was found in 
dunes outside of town 
bodies lay strewn about outside grays house and a neighboring 
home that he had set on fire when the rampage began tuesday night 
said dunedin police sgt bill obrien 
police had been unable to check if the victims were still alive 
for fear the gunman might open fire gray had been holed up inside 
his home for much of wednesday firing indiscriminately they said 
about 140 police including an antiterrorism squad had poured 
into remote aramoana after the shooting began 
police spokeswoman kaye calder said police found a 22caliber 
rifle an air rifle and 9mm ammunition inside grays home 
residents who had been trapped in their homes since the 
onslaught began were finally evacuated aboard a navy training 
vessel the hmnzs moa 
they had spent a terrifying night huddled on the floors of their 
homes as gunfire punctuated the silence 
the worst previous worst massacre in new zealand occurred in 
1941 when eric stanley graham killed six police officers before 
being shot dead 
the rampage started tuesday evening when gray who apparently 
lived alone set his neighbors house on fire and began shooting at 
firemen and residents who approached to put it out according to 
neighbors 
obrien said police were mystified as to what sparked the 
incident 
we dont know why he has done this he said 
aramoana is among cliffs and sandy marshes in an isolated area 
across otago harbor from taiaroa head a famous albatross colony 
that attracts birders from around the world 
dorothy crimp 74 who lives across from grays house described 
him as a very quiet chap a real loner 
i have met him on the beach he never spoke to anyone

the us troop buildup in the persian gulf 
poses a difficult legal question says a federal judge in 
refusing to bar the army from sending a reservist to saudi arabia 
without a formal declaration of war 
us district judge royce c lamberth rejected a bid tuesday by 
army national guard sgt michael r ange for a temporary 
restraining order to stop his deployment to the persian gulf 
if i gave your soldier a tro i would have a few others in 
here tomorrow lamberth told anges lawyer michael ratner the 
judge scheduled a dec 10 hearing on anges request for a permanent 
injunction 
the case does pose a difficult legal question about 
president bushs power to send troops to a combat zone without a 
congressional declaration of war the judge said 
anges lawsuit was filed as two key republican lawmakers senate 
minority leader bob dole of kansas and richard lugar of indiana 
former chairman of the foreign relations committee urged bush to 
seek congressional authorization for the us military mission in 
the middle east 
ange contends that bush has not gotten the authorization from 
congress that is required by the constitution ratner an attorney 
for the center for constitutional rights also argued that the 
order to deploy ange violates the 1973 war powers act 
there has not been sufficient congressional consent or any 
consent to the military activities at issue ratner argued 
the constitution makes the president commanderinchief of the 
armed forces including national guard troops called into federal 
service and gives congress the power to declare war 
the war powers act requires the president to notify congress of 
any substantial new deployment of forces overseas and requires him 
to win congressional approval or withdraw troops within 60 days if 
he sends them into combat or into situations where hostilities are 
imminent 
ratner said the buildup of 230000 us troops in the middle 
east plus bushs order to send up to another 200000 creates 
the likelihood of war which must be declared by congress 
how does a court decide that hostilities are imminent 
lamberth asked the record here is nothing has happened since 
august except a few minor incidents 
ratner said the suit also seeks anges return from the middle 
east if he is sent there the lawyer said 
ange is a former beaufort county nc police officer now 
studying criminal justice at appalachian state university in boone 
nc he was ordered to active duty oct 10 with other members of 
the 1450th transportation company 
when we volunteered we swore to defend our country and our 
constitution ange told reporters at fort lee va we did not 
swear or agree to fight to defend economic interests of major 
oil companies 
at tuesdays court hearing justice department attorney john 
tyler urged lamberth to stay out of the growing political dispute 
between congress and the president 
congress is not without power this is a political debate it 
belongs in the political arena tyler said 
courts have been extremely reluctant on the grounds they lack 
jurisdiction to uphold lawsuits challenging troop deployments

a nickel will get you a loaf of bread this 
week in north dakota where farmers are demonstrating against wheat 
prices they say are forcing them out of business 
members of north dakotas farmers union are selling 5cent 
loaves in every county usually outside the courthouse where farm 
foreclosures take place 
some customers are needy and come to buy bargain bread but most 
just want to show they support the farmers 
it appears the crisis in agriculture is getting to be a pretty 
severe problem and as a banker i see more severe problems in the 
future if they dont get their point across said james helgeson 
who was among the customers tuesday 
wheat prices have plummeted because of a worldwide glut 
a nickel is roughly the price farmers get for the wheat in a 
1pound loaf of white bread that sells for 1 to 125 in stores 
farmers say they receive slightly more than 2 per bushel for that 
wheat about 1 less than last year and the lowest price in nearly 
five years 
to dramatize the problem the farmers are selling storebought 
loaves by the score 
were discovering that there are some really hungry people in 
our major cities said karl limvere a farmers union spokesman 
it shows the irony that farmers cant make any money from their 
production and yet we have hungry people 
in benson county the farmers bought 100 loaves from the rural 
countys only bakery and sold them under gray skies that some 
called foreclosure weather

hundreds of american communities get drinking 
water from wells that contain unhealthy levels of pesticides and 
nitrates the environmental protection agency says 
a survey of 1347 wells in 50 states indicates that fewer than 1 
percent are contaminated from pesticides to levels that are of 
concern the epa said tuesday about 25 percent of the wells have 
nitrate levels considered worrisome the agency said 
nevertheless those wells provide drinking water for millions of 
people epa officials said 
while the vast majority of the countrys drinking water 
wells dont pose a risk to public health the findings provide an 
early warning sign that this needs to be taken seriously said 
henry habicht the epas deputy administrator 
environmentalists cited the survey as further proof that the 
nations groundwater is being contaminated by chemical runoffs from 
agriculture and other sources nitrates come largely from 
fertilizer and sewage 
ron phillips a spokesman for the fertilizer institute said the 
survey confirms that at least 96 percent of our groundwater is 
perfectly safe he disputed that the levels of nitrates found in 
some of the well water should be of concern 
the epa survey covered both private wells and wells that feed 
community water systems 
from the results of the survey the agency estimated that about 
104 percent of all community wells nationwide and 42 percent of 
private wells likely contain at least some pesticides the survey 
also indicated that more than half of the nations wells have water 
contaminated with nitrates from fertilizer sewage sludge or septic 
tanks 
although in most cases the contamination was at levels too low 
to be a health concern the epa said as many as 750 community water 
systems may have wells that have pesticide or nitrate contamination 
exceeding federal health guidelines it estimated that nearly 
80000 private wells in rural areas also likely have unhealthy 
levels of contamination 
many of the pesticides found in the drinking water are suspected 
of causing cancer or damage to vital organs if consumed at 
significant levels over a long period high levels of exposure to 
nitrates can cause blue baby syndrome in very young infants as 
well as other illnesses 
the epa survey reinforces existing strong evidence that 
nitrates are contaminating groundwater said justin ward of the 
natural resources defense council a washingtonbased environmental 
group 
the nrdc and other environmentalists however said the epa 
findings may understate the seriousness of the problem in some 
regions of the country where pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers 
are heavily used 
they criticized the epas use of national contamination 
estimates that include parts of the country where there are few 
pesticides or nitrates to contaminate wells 
the epas habicht said there likely are regional hot spots 
where a significantly higher percentage of wells are contaminated 
he said the epa planned to further examine the overall findings to 
focus on regional problem areas the agency provided no estimates 
on water contamination by regions or states 
the community water systems included in the survey ranged from 
those that provide drinking water to very small towns to others 
that serve densely populated urban areas including midsize and 
large cities 
many of the countrys largest cities rely on surface water for 
drinking rather than groundwater from wells 
the two most frequently detected pesticides found in the well 
water were dacthal a broadleaf weed killer used primarily on 
lawns and atrazine a widely used weed killer used in agriculture 
especially on corn and sorghum the epa said 
dacthal and nine other pesticides were found at low levels not 
considered a health threat but atrazine and five other pesticides 
including some that have been banned by the epa were found at 
levels considered a health concern

restive republicans elected conservatives to 
secondechelon senate leadership posts in secret balloting that 
signaled more combative gop dealings with majority democrats in the 
next congress 
in their organizational caucus tuesday the gop senators 
reelected minority leader bob dole of kansas and his chief deputy 
alan simpson of wyoming but in contests for four secondtier party 
leadership posts conservatives held sway over more moderate 
colleagues 
dumped from the republican partys no3 leadership job was sen 
john chafee of rhode island the most liberal republican in the 
senate republicans voted 2221 to replace him with conservative 
sen thad cochran of mississippi 
democrats meanwhile reelected senate majority leader george 
mitchell of maine and chose sen wendell ford of kentucky to 
succeed alan cranston of california as assistant majority leader in 
a caucus that produced no surprises ford had been assured of 
election when sen david pryor of arkansas decided not to challenge 
him 
the move to the right among republicans held throughout the 
closeddoor voting on three other open posts in which no incumbents 
were seeking new terms 
sen don nickles of oklahoma defeated sen pete v domenici of 
new mexico for the chairmanship of the republican policy committee 
sen phil gramm of texas beat out sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky 
for the job of campaign chairman and sen robert kasten of 
wisconsin was elected secretary of the republican conference over 
sen christopher bond of missouri 
i dont think you should read into the election any kind of 
statement about ideology or statement that we are tilting one way 
or the other cochran told reporters it may be they just 
wanted a change chafee suggested 
but sen malcolm wallop rwyo who backed cochran said it 
was just more republican 
this year chafee voted to override president bushs veto of the 
civil rights bill voted against a constitutional amendment to ban 
flag burning voted with liberals on restricting aid to el salvador 
and voted to cut funds for the strategic defense initiative or 
star wars 
the party caucuses came a week after a disappointing gop 
performance in the offyear elections the party lost a senate seat 
when it had hoped to pick up a couple and position itself to retake 
the chamber in 1992 the democrats picked up a net of nine seats in 
the house 
many congressional republicans also were angered when bush 
reversed his nonewtaxes pledge and agreed with democrats on a 
deficitreduction package that included major new taxes 
norman ornstein a congressional scholar with the private 
american enterprise institute said the gop leadership election was 
a signal to dole and simpson that its time to get tougher with 
the president they rankandfile republicans wanted highenergy 
rocktheboat leaders 
he said chafee and domenici were two extraordinarily 
wellliked and wellrespected moderates but they were defeated by 
more conservative and more junior upstarts 
conservative fundraiser richard viguerie compared the senate 
elections to the atmosphere that caused georgia rep newt 
gingrichs rise to house republican whip two years ago 
cochran is a mildmannered conservative who in 1978 became 
mississippis first republican to win election to the senate since 
reconstruction 
hes like a fire ant said state gop chairwoman evelyn 
macphail he never goes into anything unprepared he does his 
work quietly 
gramm was likely preferred over mcconnell because the texas 
senator is more combative and more likely to succeed in 
moneyraising efforts gop officials said 
the democrats who will hold a 5644 majority in the 102nd 
congress emerged from their closeddoor caucus with a show of 
unity all of the top jobs were filled without contention mitchell 
said 
mitchell who first won the majority leaders job two years ago 
in a spirited threeway race won his second term by acclamation 
health care and campaign finance reform are tops on his list of 
legislative objectives for the new congress he said 
cranston 76 has served since 1977 as the assistant majority 
leader or whip he announced last week he was stepping down from 
the post and would leave the senate at the end of the next 
congress because of prostate cancer 
cranston is one of five senators under investigation by the 
senate ethics committee for their involvement with former savings 
and loan operator charles f keating

a newly released report alleges favoritism in 
the governments past handling of some shaky savings and loans but 
regulators havent decided whether to pursue the matter 
the document indicates that federal regulators gave preferential 
treatment as far back as the mid1980s to some ailing sampls whose 
executives sat on a regional regulatory board 
the report made public tuesday at a hearing by the house budget 
committees task force on urgent fiscal issues names several sampl 
executives who allegedly received favorable treatment from the 
federal home loan bank in dallas 
but regulators said they havent decided if they will take 
action against those executives or the federal sampl examiners who 
allegedly favored them 
this has come to us off the wall thomas mason a spokesman 
for the office of thrift supervision said of the new revelations 
mason said the ots the agency that took over sampl regulation 
from the federal home loan bank system has no idea at this 
point whether it will pursue action against the people involved 
at the hearing rep charles e schumer dny said the 
favoritism indicated by a 1988 government review of the dallas home 
loan bank discouraged bank examiners and slowed recognition of the 
magnitude of the sampl crisis 
sirens were sounding in the basement of the federal home loan 
bank board throughout 1988 but the regulators just plugged their 
ears said schumer who chairs the budget committee task force 
the task force released a summary of the 1988 review of the 
dallas bank board which was responsible for regulating sampls in 
texas louisiana arkansas mississippi and new mexico 
like home loan banks in other regions of the country the dallas 
institution was controlled by sampls that it both supervised and 
loaned money to 
the review of the dallas bank by an outside peer review team 
of government examiners indicated that senior federal sampl 
regulators knew losses were deliberately concealed by the thrifts 
with the approval of local examiners 
it also found conflicts of interest that resulted in 
preferential treatment for some sampl executives who also were 
directors of the dallas bank 
in one case local examiners removed an auditor who questioned 
the chairman of an arkansas sampl who was a director of the dallas 
bank according to the task force document mr godwin chairman 
of first federal savings of arkansas had been accused of 
defrauding shareholders 
the dallas bank board had been more interested in helping a 
fellow director than in removing godwin from his first federal 
post to protect shareholders the document said 
it said preferential treatment also apparently was given to 
allan d myers chairman of olney savings association and a 
director of the dallas bank shelby smith a director and former 
employee of the dallas bank robert mettlen a director of lamar 
savings association and a former director of the dallas bank and 
james ward chairman of commercial federal savings bank of 
louisiana and a director of the dallas bank 
the review found that the dallas bank failed to do financial 
examinations of nearly 200 sampls in a timely manner it said the 
dallas regulators delayed taking some supervisory actions and 
failed completely to take others 
it also accused the dallas bank board of 
terrible monitoring of sampls financial condition 
approving excessive pay and bonuses for sampl executives 
weak supervision and inflated financial ratings of sampls in the 
face of tremendous growth highrisk lending poor capital and 
insider abuse 
an overly bureaucratic multilayered decision process that 
slowed proper supervision 
another spokesman for the office of thrift supervision william 
fulwider declined to comment directly on those findings but said 
the system has improved greatly since sampl bailout legislation was 
enacted last year 
there has been a decided move to improve examination and 
supervision of sampls fulwider said he cited stricter capital 
requirements for sampls regulatory action against conflicts of 
interest and an increased number of federal examiners 
bailout legislation passed by congress last year to rescue the 
sampl industry could ultimately cost taxpayers 500 billion 
according to some estimates the legislation transferred regulation 
of sampls from the federal home loan bank system to the ots a new 
unit of the treasury department

president bush and european community leaders 
say theyll intensify the search for a solution to a farm subsidy 
battle that threatens to derail four years of talks on a new global 
trade agreement 
bush met tuesday with italian prime minister giulio andreotti 
head of the communitys council of ministers and with ec president 
jacques delors 
delors planned to continue the talks with other administration 
officials today but there was no hint that a breakthrough was 
imminent 
the united states is seeking to eliminate 75 percent of current 
domestic farm supports and import barriers and to reduce export 
subsidies by 90 percent 
the european community with its network of heavily subsidized 
small family farms has labeled the bush proposal politically 
unrealistic the ec wants to trim 30 percent of 1986 farm supports 
which the united states says would be only a 15 percent cut from 
current subsidies while leaving the import barriers and export 
subsidies untouched 
the farm issue is considered central to completion of the 
current round of global trade talks which involve 105 nations 
under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
thousands of farmers from france germany italy and switzerland 
demonstrated tuesday in front of gatt headquarters in geneva 
contending that the us proposal threatened their livelihoods 
bush has made gatt reform his top trade priority in a belief 
that lowering trade barriers offers the best chance of expanding 
us exports to reduce americas huge trade deficit which has 
topped 100 billion for the past six years 
without agreement to cut farm subsidies third world countries 
say they will not go along with us proposals to tighten copyright 
protections for american companies and reduce barriers keeping us 
service companies such as banks and insurance firms from 
expanding their overseas operations 
bush addressing andreotti during a white house departure 
ceremony said both sides had expressed a strong conviction that 
we must succeed in substantial trade liberalization 
bush said he and the ec leaders had agreed to make every 
effort to insure the round concludes in the coming weeks 
andreotti said failure to conclude the trade talks would bring 
about serious damages to the global trading system especially to 
third world nations 
us trade representative carla hills told reporters tuesday the 
administration remained committed to achieving a comprehensive 
trade agreement during a final round of bargaining scheduled for 
dec 37 in brussels less than three weeks away 
the problem is not time the problem is political will she 
said we could solve this in three days if we had the political 
will 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen whose committee 
would have jurisdiction over whatever agreement is produced said a 
recent trip to europe convinced him that the talks were in 
serious trouble with only about a 5050 chance for success 
he said there was significant opposition in congress as well 
noting that 37 senators were sponsoring legislation to remove the 
fasttrack authority that would speed the measures passage in 
congress 
any uruguay round agreement can be sold to congress only if 
the administration shows they have achieved a balanced package that 
gives americans greater access to markets abroad bentsen said

the internal revenue service let go of 
nevadas oldest legal bordello for 149 million at a bankruptcy 
sale where most of the 1000 bidders were more interested in nude 
paintings and other kitsch 
the future of the mustang ranch remained as clouded tuesday as 
the identity of its buyer 
storey county commissioners last month revoked the bordellos 
permit vowing never again to endure the circus that surrounded 
the place for 35 years 
during bidding on the 330acre property tuesday there were no 
takers at the asking price of 10 million the winning bid was made 
by reno lawyer victor perry who refused to identity the new owner 
perrys brother peter is the lawyer of former mustang owner 
joe conforte but conforte denied he was secretly bidding 
how can i he asked theyve got me handcuffed 
financially 
people had expressed interest in the property as a nursing home 
halfway house or home for wayward girls said dierdre pagni irs 
manager she said even a religious group inquired about the 
property but she refused to give details 
irs agents padlocked the 104room bordello sept 21 three days 
after the property owned by conforte and his wife sally was 
forced into liquidation 
the government planned to apply the proceeds from the sale to 
the 13 million in back taxes owed by the confortes 
my personal feeling is i hate to see this carnival happen 
conforte said of the auction but he took part in the activities 
autographing items for buyers 
he signed a painting of a partially clad woman bought for 190 
by mary kay walker and bill davis of san diego on vacation at 
nearby lake tahoe they said they came out of curiosity this is 
nevada history ms walker said 
a box of six tshirts bearing a mustang ranch logo fetched 105 
while a case of pocketsized ceramic liquor bottles adorned with 
naked ladies sold for 260 some of the larger paintings sold for 
around 2000 
a renoarea couple purchased a nude portrait for 80 
i liked it said marietta shaw of stead 
it was cheaper than the tshirts said her husband michael 
shaw 
also on the auction block were boxed condoms and framed posters 
pointing out the locations of nevadas legal bordellos 
ray grimm of reno offered a successful bid of 395000 for a 
58acre trailer park in nearby lockwood he said he planned to keep 
the property as is 
the confortes founded the mustang ranch illegally in the 1950s 
in 1960 local authorities proclaimed it a public nuisance and 
burned it to the ground 
but a decade later conforte won approval to operate legally 
paving the way for legalized prostitution in nevada

cells from a middleaged man with terminal 
cancer are being genetically altered at the national institutes of 
health in preparation for the first use of gene therapy in the 
treatment of cancer 
an nih team led by dr steven a rosenberg received approval 
tuesday from the food and drug administration to use the 
experimental gene therapy in patients critically ill with advanced 
melanoma a deadly skin cancer 
rosenberg said his team had been poised for the approval and had 
already been culturing cells from the first patients tumors 
now that weve got approval we will go full speed ahead he 
said 
the stillexperimental therapy amplifies the bodys own 
cancerfighting ability it uses a type of white blood cells 
called tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes or til that naturally 
invade and attack tumor tissue a gene inserted into the til cell 
adds a second natural anticancer protein 
in the new therapy til cells are removed from a patients tumor 
and placed into a culture the scientists then add to the til cells 
two new genes one of which makes a powerful cancer fighter called 
tumor necrosis factor or tnf the cells are further cultured until 
they number in the billions and then are returned to the patients 
blood stream 
the til cells now carrying the tnf gene migrate back to the 
tumor sites doctors hope the treatment will bring powerful doses 
of the natural tumor fighters directly against cells in the 
melanoma tumors 
rosenberg said the first patient to receive the therapy will be 
a middleaged man who is in an advanced stage of melanoma with only 
weeks to live two other patients are standing by and culturing of 
their cells should start soon he declined to further identify the 
patients 
the fda gave the rosenberg team permission to treat up to 50 
melanoma patients using the new gene technique once the process is 
started the nih scientists expect to add about one patient a week 
to the treatment group 
these are all patients with very limited life expectancy 
about three months rosenberg said 
rosenberg dr r michael blaese and dr w french anderson have 
been seeking approval for more than a year to use the gene therapy 
on patients the technique was considered by six committees 
organized by the nih before the fda approved it for limited use 
another form of gene therapy was approved sept 14 for the 
treatment of an extremely rare inherited immune system disorder 
called adenosine deaminase deficiency disease that studys first 
patient a 4yearold girl received a transfusion of her own white 
blood cells after a gene to correct the disorder had been inserted 
into the cells 
rosenberg has been using unaltered til cells to treat melanoma 
since 1987 but he said the cells seemed to help only about half of 
the patients and the rest died of the disease 
to strengthen the treatment rosenberg and his team turned to 
genetic engineering techniques with the aim of arming the til cells 
with the more powerful tumor necrosis factor as a marker to 
monitor treatment the scientists also put into the til cells a 
gene that is resistant to myacin antibiotics 
laboratory experiments in mice showed that the tiltnf cells 
were very powerful against cancer in mice rosenberg said in 
rodents the tnf made the tumors go away within hours he said 
but the laboratory animals are able to tolerate 40 times more of 
the tnf than are humans and rosenberg said it takes a high dose 
for the substance to kill tumors 
the body naturally produces tnf in response to infection the 
protein also plays a role in regulation of inflammation and in 
repairing injuries however if tnf is active throughout the body 
for too long it can cause shock and wasting 
melanoma is a skin cancer that usually cannot be successfully 
treated once it becomes widespread it is thought to be caused by 
excessive exposure to the sun particularly at a young age 
the disease has been on the rise in the united states in recent 
years now striking about 10 of every 100000 people

the dollar opened higher against the yen after speculation that

failed to materialize dealers said 
but the dollar gradually narrowed its gains as some investors 
sold back the currency following its initial rise they said 
toru kanai a currency analyst with new japan securities co 
said trading was thin because many investors remained on the 
sidelines in continuing anticipation of the us federal reserve 
lowering interest rates 
lower us interest rates tend to weaken the dollar

of rumors linking senior politicians with a stock insider trading 
case currently under investigation 
on the stock market traders said indexlinked largescale 
purchase by institutional investors supported the index in the 
afternoon traders said 
they said the nikkeis earlier decline was mainly because of 
profittaking after tuesdays sharp advance 
the index was unexpectedly wellsupported considering the amount 
of tuesdays gain which could have prompted more active selling

about 2 million americans unknowingly suffer from 
a breathing disorder that doubles their risk of dying from a heart 
attack researchers say 
the disorder in which people stop breathing for 30 to 60 
seconds or longer during sleep is most common in people who snore 
said dr bernard burack a cardiologist at the montefiore medical 
centers sleepwake center in new york 
that doesnt mean everyone who snores is going to drop dead 
burack said but patients with the snoringrelated disorder have a 
risk of heartrelated death 21 times the national average burack 
reported tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the american 
heart association 
the disorder is called obstructive sleep apnea it occurs most 
often in men but when it occurs in women it is even more lethal 
burack said 
it tends to occur in people who are overweight have high blood 
pressure and heart arrhythmias or rhythm disturbances burack 
said daytme sleepiness is another indicator of the disorder 
because it often disrupts sleep 
the disease is particularly dangerous in people who have 
atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries burack said 
in a study of 223 patients burack and his colleagues found that 
the patients died at a median age of 61 compared to the national 
median of 78 twenty of 35 deaths in the group occurred between 11 
pm and 8 am 
during an episode of sleep apnea the amount of oxygen in the 
bloodstream plummets the heart may beat slowly or even stop 
beating the heart already stressed by the lack of oxygen is 
further stressed by the abnormal rhythms 
efforts to breathe then produce an overdrive often triggering 
rapid heart rhythms that can kick off in somebody whos 
vulnerable a fatal rhythm burack said 
weight loss can help alleviate the condition in some people 
burack said patients can also be fitted with a mask and air pump 
that will force air into their mouths and keep the airways open 
during sleep 
the problem is people dont want to sleep with a mask over 
their faces for the rest of their lives burack said 
surgery to remove excess tissue in the throat can sometimes 
help in extreme cases an incision is made in patients throats 
that can be fitted with a plug meant to be removed at night 
burack said people who suspect they suffer from sleep apnea 
should seek treatment in a sleep disorders clinic

almost twothirds of the 300000 americans who 
drop dead suddenly each year from cardiac arrest might be saved if 
automatic shocking machines were made as common as fire 
extinguishers heart specialists say 
catastrophic disturbances in the hearts normal rhythm what 
doctors call sudden death account for about half of all heart 
disease fatalities 
shocking the heart with a machine called a defibrillator can 
restore normal beating but the shock must be delivered within five 
minutes or the victim will die or suffer brain damage 
this is an immense problem said dr douglas p zipes of the 
university of indiana in terms of numbers it far outstrips 
everything else but its a solvable problem 
zipes and other experts outlined the need for better and faster 
care of cardiac arrest tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of 
the american heart association 
defibrillators have long been standard equipment in hospitals 
for reviving patients whose hearts stop beating but since most 
such attacks occur outside the hospital and without warning highly 
automated devices have been developed that can be used by people 
with relatively little training 
dr james atkins of the university of texas in dallas said only 
5 percent to 15 percent of ambulances across the country carry 
these devices the machines can sense whether the victims heart is 
in fibrillation quivering disorganized beating that fails to 
pump blood throughout the body and if it finds this condition it 
delivers a shock that can restore normal beating 
even when ambulances and fire trucks carry the machines getting 
them to the victim in time is extremely difficult 
atkins said that in the best of cases ambulances often need 
five minutes to drive to the emergency and they lose an additional 
minute or two setting up the defibrillator by that time it is 
probably too late to save the patient 
dr w douglas weaver of the university of washington said that 
even if all ambulances carried the machines and they responded 
quickly at best they might save onequarter of patients in cardiac 
arrest 
several experts agreed the best solution is easytouse 
defibrillators that are stored in office buildings stores sports 
arenas or wherever large numbers of people gather 
we need to make devices that are cheap and idiotproof said 
zipes they need to be as common as fire extinguishers wherever 
there is a congregation of people they could be snatched off the 
wall patches applied and then let the device do the work 
current devices while relatively simple still require some 
training to operate and they cost between 4000 and 7000 he 
said the technology already exists to massproduce machines that 
would cost between 500 and 1000 and could be operated by 
virtually anyone 
a variety of research has shown that the faster the shock is 
delivered the better the chances of saving the victim 
if you shock them in the first minute virtually everyone 
survives said atkins its all time 
dr richard e kerber of the university of iowa said nearly 
twothirds of victims of cardiac arrest have fibrillation while 
the rest have other rhythm disturbances that cannot be corrected 
with electric shocks 
this means that 60 percent of the 300000 people who die have 
a good chance of being revived if defibrillators became widely 
available he said

taking a couple aspirins with a cocktail can get 
you drunker doctors warned today 
aspirin blocks the action of a stomach enzyme that breaks down 
alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream researchers reported in 
the journal of the american medical association 
its important that people be warned not to mix those two 
not to take aspirin before they drink or rather not to drink 
after they take aspirin dr charles s lieber director of the 
alcohol research center at the bronx veterans affairs medical 
center in new york said in a telephone interview tuesday 
he and his colleagues studied aspirin and alcohol absorption in 
five healthy men ages 30 to 45 years 
each man was given a standard breakfast then an hour later a 
glass of juice containing three grams of alcohol per kilogram of 
body weight about a drink and a half for an averagesize man 
lieber said 
the men underwent the procedure again but first took one gram 
of aspirin the equivalent of two extrastrength tablets with 
breakfast 
there was a 34 percent increase in the blood level of 
alcohol lieber said 
the same effect could occur on an empty stomach but previous 
studies have failed to show it possibly because alcohol remains in 
an empty stomach so briefly the researchers said 
women would probably be more susceptible said lieber who has 
reported previously that women produce proportionally less of the 
enzyme in their stomachs 
dr ernest p noble director of the alcohol research center at 
the university of california in los angeles said the findings are 
important because many people consider aspirin a magic drug 
that can protect against heart attacks 
if theyre going to do their drinking they should do it with 
a full stomach and not taking aspirin said noble former 
director of the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism 
lieber said people who take aspirin daily should do so in the 
morning if they plan to drink at night the findings do not mean 
drinkers need to abandon the timehonored strategy of taking 
aspirin before going to sleep to try to avert a hangover he said 
if they just go to bed the alcohol will wear off he said 
more danger lies in going out to dinner taking aspirin having 
a drink and driving home he said another dangerous scenario he 
cited included taking an an aspirin and having a beer or two at 
lunch returning to work and using machinery 
lieber said heavier drinking was not studied for ethical reasons 
but that the effect would most likely be the same bloodalcohol 
levels in the studys subjects ranged from 0025 percent to 0037 
percent well below the strictest standard of any state for 
drunkenness in motorists 008 percent he said 
were not talking about drunkenness here he said but 
these are levels that impair ones capacity to drive or to 
operate some sophisticated machinery

veronica iversen was an expert on how to stop 
smoking shed done it a halfdozen times 
but after a few days or the end of lent or her sisters 
hospitalization she always lit up again despite her vows and 
prayers 
finally she sought help from a source to which a small but 
growing number of heavy smokers are turning a doctor 
she chose elliot wineburg a psychiatrist at mount sinai medical 
school who specializes in treatment of stress about a third of his 
practice consists of heavy smokers who want to quit 
public education and antismoking classes have filtered out 
most of the people who can easily stop he said now were 
seeing the hard core people who are desperate and ashamed 
and who need medical attention 
a smoking problem is more than just a problem of will its an 
illness wineburg said curing it takes more than just say 
no you cant say that to an addict 
attention must be individual he argued since if you have a 
sore throat your internist doesnt say come to my lecture on 
penicillin along with 20 other people 
depending on the patient wineburg may prescribe three types of 
medicine nicotine gum antidepressant drugs or clonidine a drug 
usually used to control blood pressure 
in addition he uses techniques such as hypnosis biofeedback 
and cognitive therapy to help smokers relieve their underlying 
psychological problems 
within five weeks wineburg reports 68 percent of his patients 
stop smoking compared to a rate of 20 percent for many programs 
and courses 
wineburg treated iversen a single 68yearold retired 
secretary from brooklyn who was smoking a pack a day for 750 the 
fee was not covered by insurance because she was not suffering from 
an ailment caused by smoking 
on her first visit iversen insisted she didnt know why she 
smokes it was a bad habit with no purpose but after prodding 
she admitted to a very good reason if im tired it picks me up 
if im upset it calms me down 
iversen used nicotine to cope with everything from the drudgery 
of housekeeping to the illness of her sister who has alzheimers 
disease 
nothing is more difficult than being worried about someone and 
not being able to do anything about it she said 
at the beginning of her second visit iversen announced that 
shed smoked her last cigarette two hours earlier 
since nicotine is highly addictive wineburg needed to determine 
how much iversen had been ingesting told that she smoked a pack of 
true kings a day wineburg calculated that she consumed about eight 
milligrams daily 
he prescribed a daily dosage of four pieces of nicotine gum to 
ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and showed iversen how to 
chew the gum slowly not swallowing the saliva until the nicotine 
could be absorbed through the cheek membrane 
during her third visit wineburg tested iversen and decided she 
would not be a good candidate for deep hypnosis he then showed her 
a way to relax her body from the toes up as he did so he tried to 
shore up her selfconfidence insisting you are a very strong 
person he concluded by saying im going home with you and 
handing her a cassette recording of their session 
the following week iversen talked about the times she is tempted 
to smoke and things she associates with smoking such as an 
occasional whiskey sour before dinner youll always want to 
smoke wineburg told her you cant get it out of your head 
the trick he said is to know how to resist 
on her fifth visit a therapist attached iversen to a machine 
that recorded the tension in her forehead muscles as she watched a 
video screen she learned ways to relax those muscles in moments of 
stress and tension she also learned a technique of deep breathing 
that reduces stress 
that was april 19 1989 since then veronica iversen has not 
smoked she no longer gets scowls from other members of her church 
group she has taken up oil painting to occupy her hands and mind 
and sometimes she would just love a cigarette

a federal panel waited five months before 
announcing its finding that steroids can halve the death rate from 
the pneumonia that is the leading killer of people with aids the 
new york times reported today 
the panel withheld the announcement until oct 10 because 
members could not agree on how to word their statement the 
newspaper said 
part of the reason they could not agree said panel vice 
chairman dr paul meier was that the findings had not yet been 
accepted at a prestigious medical journal and they feared an early 
announcement would jeopardize publication 
many medical journals have a policy of not publishing studies 
that have been reported in the popular press the journals say the 
policy is aimed at ensuring that studies are subjected to scrutiny 
by disinterested scientists 
aids activists have attacked the policy as a barrier to the 
release of lifesaving information 
the panel of 16 aids specialists and statisticians convened by 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases had 
concluded on may 15 that a steroid hormone treatment can be 
effective against pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 
the finding and the delay in releasing it came to light in the 
nov 2 issue of aids treatment news a san franciscobased 
newsletter 
the delay has angered members of the aids treatment and research 
communities 
when the lives of people are in the balance it is totally 
unethical not to release information immediately said dr 
mathilde krim a founder of the american foundation for aids 
research a nonprofit group in new york 
dr jerome groopman an aids researcher at the new england 
deaconess hospital in boston said it is time to set new ground 
rules for the release of potentially lifesaving information 
one of the things were learning from aids is that the 
situation has to change and adapt to all lifesaving situations 
groopman said

12902 yen and 12980 yen in quiet trading that totaled some 818

federal reserve board which would have made the dollar less 
attractive did not materialize dealers said 
but dollars were being sold again wednesday afternoon in tokyo 
said masato hayashi a dealer with the bank of tokyo 
the dollars afternoon slip resulted from position adjustments 
because investors still expect that the us fed will lower 
interest rates today he added 
hayashi said the dollars afternoon slide against the yen also 
was prompted by its weakness against the major european currencies 
especially the german mark 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities 
co said trading was thin because many investors remained on the 
sidelines in continuing anticipation of lower us interest rates

more than 1400 us troops assigned 
to operation desert shield have been airlifted to germany for 
treatment of broken bones depression snake bites and other 
afflictions military officials say 
but the army is treating fewer gis than anticipated for a 
population of 230000 people based on health risk assessments 
for that region of the world said barbara slifer spokeswoman 
for the armys 7th medical command in heidelberg 
fortythree soldiers have died in the deployment mostly in 
accidents 
officials say two army hospitals in germany had received 926 
evacuated patients as of tuesday afternoon and the air force 
hospital in wiesbaden had received 515 since aug 11 when us 
troops were sent to saudi arabia 
the figures mean that of the 230000 gis sent to the persian 
gulf region about one soldier in every 166 has had a medical 
problem 
some have been treated and returned to the persian gulf region 
and others with more serious conditions have been transferred to 
the united states said ms slifer 
she said 88 remained hospitalized at the armys regional 
hospital in frankfurt and 53 in the regional hospital at landsthul 
capt robert lenahan of the air forces hospital in wiesbaden said 
39 desert shield patients were still there as of tuesday 
military medical officials have said that facilities newly set 
up in the gulf region can care for most casualties as well as 
hospitals anywhere but evacuating patients to germany keep beds 
free in the gulf in case of hostilities 
the medical problems run the gamut ms slifer said 
the predominant area of care that weve been providing is 
orthopedic broken bones weve had one snakebite case weve had 
gallbladder attacks she said 
she said a few soldiers were also sent back for psychological 
care 
i think the psychological ailments are pretty much what you 
would expect in any type of militarytype environment 
most of the patients coming through wiesbaden are sent back to 
the united states unless they can be treated in a fairly short 
timeframe lenahan said 
but we have people coming back with kidney stones torn knee 
ligaments things that take more than just a couple of weeks to 
repair lenahan said 
he said that longterm patients requiring treatment of more than 
three to four weeks are sent back to the united states so that we 
still have enough empty beds here for other patients that may come 
up 
in addition to injuries patients needed treatment for 
allergies asthma and dermatological problems he said 
he said that the allergies and asthma are apparently due to the 
very dry climate in saudi arabia people who wouldnt normally 
have asthma problems are experiencing that

poor milwaukee youngsters can continue to 
attend private schools at taxpayer expense while the state drafts 
an appeal of a ruling that the program was unconstitutionally 
enacted officials say 
a state appeals court tuesday struck down on a legal 
technicality the law establishing milwaukees firstinthenation 
school choice program 
it said the program was passed in violation of the wisconsin 
constitution which forbids sneaking through local programs in 
state budget bills 
the court did not address the programs merits 
roger sundby an executive assistant to the state schools 
superintendent said his agency will let it continue for at least 
30 days the period allowed for lawyers to appeal to the state 
supreme court 
the program has been praised by the bush administration for 
creating a healthy competition between public and private schools 
critics sued to block the program arguing it undermined state 
efforts to ensure that educational standards are met at private 
schools and ignored the majority of students left behind in public 
schools 
a judge rejected those arguments in august ruling the program 
served a legitimate public purpose the case went to the appeals 
court 
im sad they did not make a decision on merits just on the 
process said gov tommy g thompson 
parental choice is a model program that holds great promise 
for disadvantaged children in milwaukees poorest neighborhoods 
he said it must be given an opportunity to prove its 
potential 
the program passed by the legislature in the spring was 
authorized to provide 2500 each for as many as 1000 students 
this year but only about 400 were able to enroll in about 10 
eligible private schools because of space limitations 
the money is deducted from the state aid provided to the 
milwaukee public school system which has about 97000 students 
the ruling implies that lawmakers can rewrite the law and 
salvage the program senate majority leader dave helbach said such 
an effort will be undertaken when lawmakers reconvene in january

an indian relief official bitterly 
withdrew his name from consideration for the post of un high 
commissioner for refugees after charging western officials with a 
demeaning bias against noneuropeans 
the united states and other western countries had strongly 
objected to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars choice of 
virenda dayal his chief of staff for the post 
dayal a former indian civil servant sent a letter to perez de 
cuellar withdrawing from consideration un spokesman francois 
giuliani said tuesday giuliani said it was accepted with 
regret 
given the present controversy as to whether a noneuropean can 
be worthy of the post which i find demeaning i would appreciate 
it if my name could be withdrawn from consideration dayal wrote 
there is no way in which i can develop the attributes of a 
westerneuropean politician whether in or out of office and i 
would not wish unhcr or the refugees of the world to be deprived of 
funding on that account he said 
the un high commissioner serves a threeyear term and oversees 
programs for an estimated 15 million refugees both western and 
third world nations are seeking a strong and independent candidate 
who can appeal for more funds and public support for refugees 
state department spokesman richard boucher said tuesday that the 
bush administration was extremely concerned over reports that we 
heard last week that the secretarygeneral intended to appoint the 
next high commissioner without consulting concerned governments 
the united states is the single largest donor to the refugee 
program providing 117 million of its 550 million budget boucher 
said 
cnada britain france austria belgium and new zealand have 
all put forth their own candidates they are expected to confer 
with the united states and agree on a nominee who is a westerner 
the director of the state departments office of refugee 
programs princeton lyman was leaving today on a foreign trip to 
interview candidates 
on monday a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the bush administration was outraged that perez de cuellar 
insisted last week that either the commissioner or deputy 
commissioner be from the third world 
washington took that as a threat to fire the deputy american 
douglas stafford if dayal didnt get the top post 
un spokeswoman nadia younes denied there had been a suggestion 
stafford would be eliminated she also denied there had been no 
consultations with the us mission on dayals candidacy 
dayal was a senior official in the refugees program from 
19651979 serving as regional representative to un headquarters 
and as executive assistant to the high commissioner 
the previous commissioner thorvald stoltenberg resigned two 
weeks ago to become deputy prime minister of norway 
stoltenberg had replaced jeanpierre hocke who resigned in 
october 1989 when it was disclosed he used a special education fund 
to upgrade his airline travel to first class at a cost of about 
300000 
the secretarygeneral appoints the commissioner and the general 
assembly approves the candidate in a vote 
perez de cuellar who was traveling in japan and europe and was 
to return to new york next week will have to see who emerges as 
the western candidate or propose another himself

the oldest person in missouri to receive the death penalty since it 
was reinstated in 1977 
she was convicted saturday of five counts of murder the jury 
tuesday recommended death on four of the charges and life in prison 
on the fifth 
under the law judge e richard webber may accept the jurys 
decision or give her life without parole no sentencing date was 
set 
defense attorney david miller said he will appeal 
mrs copeland wept quietly and held the hands of miller and a 
son al copeland as the jurys decision was read 
authorities said the victims were unwitting participants in a 
cattlebuying scheme orchestrated by mrs copelands 75yearold 
husband ray 
four bodies were found in shallow graves and the fifth was found 
in a well all had been shot in the head prosecutor doug roberts 
called it one of the worst if not the worst cases of serial 
murder in the states history 
prosecutors charged that copeland hired the drifters at 
missions promising them 50 a day plus room and board to act as 
cattle buyers copeland had the men buy livestock with bad checks 
and then killed them to conceal the thefts they said 
authorities said mrs copeland was his partner in the scheme 
which netted the couple 32000 from 1986 to 1989 the defense 
contended she was dominated by her husband and did not know of his 
business dealings 
copelands murder trial begins jan 24 his attorneys contend he 
is senile and incompetent to stand trial 
a drifter who once worked for the couple told authorities last 
year that bodies were buried at their small farm about 90 miles 
from kansas city 
no bodies were found on the farm but police unearthed victims 
at area farms where copeland performed odd jobs over the years 
a list in mrs copelands handwriting with an x marked next 
to the names of several of the victims was a key piece of evidence

president bush has extended the state of 
emergency with iran stemming from its 1979 seizure of the us 
embassy and american hostages in tehran 
because our relations with iran have not yet returned to 
normal the national emergency declared on nov 14 1979 must 
continue in effect bush said in the annual renewal notice to 
congress published tuesday in the federal register 
iran seized the us embassy in tehran on nov 4 1979 former 
president jimmy carter declared a state of national emergency with 
iran 10 days later allowing the us government to freeze iranian 
assets and impose other economic sanctions 
the last of the remaining 52 hostages were released by iran on 
jan 20 1981 just after president reagan was inaugurated into 
office a state of emergency must be renewed every year prior to 
its anniversary date or the economic and diplomatic sanctions it 
imposes would otherwise expire

the steel industry is working to remove 
the dirtiest ingredient in its 378yearold steel recipe coke 
the 44 million fouryear experiment in this pittsburgh suburb 
to make steel in a cleaner more efficient way could clear the air 
near coke ovens and help steelmakers meet federal pollution 
standards but could also mean layoffs 
the american iron and steel institute and us department of 
energy unveiled their research on tuesday 
what you have is steel without all the stink said carnegie 
mellon university professor rj fruehan a researcher on the 
project 
an american company will be selling steel made with the new 
cokeless process by 2005 said ian hughes technology vice 
president at inland steel corp 
at least one environmental activist is sketical the changes 
will come anytime soon 
coke will be around for a long time and its certainly going 
to be another generation of our children before these changes are 
in place said david jasnow a board member of the group against 
smog and pollution 
in the method first used in blast furnaces in 1612 in england 
steel is made by melting iron ore to remove oxygen then mixing the 
liquid iron with limestone and coke coke is almost pure carbon 
made by baking impurities from coal 
the ironcokelimestone mixture then must go through two 
furnaces before it is finished into steel 
the experimental process mixes coal iron ore and limestone to 
make liquid steel in one step 
hughes said the new technology combined with other advances in 
steel finishing and rolling would cut the current 1000hour 
method of making steel to 10 hours while demanding the same amount 
of coal from american mines 
the steel industrys work force would be halved if all of this 
eventually works out said project director egil aukrist 
the onestep process will cut energy costs by 20 percent saving 
10 to 25 per ton of steel aisi said 
the process should help big steelmakers such as usx bethlehem 
steel corp and ltv steel co regain market share lost to imports 
said joe goodwin director of the center for materials research at 
carnegie mellon university 
japanese steelmakers are developing technology similar to aisis 
cokeless production officials said

israel launched a new crackdown on the nearly 
3yearold palestinian uprising today imposing widespread curfews 
and announcing plans to halve the arab work force from the occupied 
lands 
the curfews were to prevent demonstrations on the eve of the 
second anniversary of the palestinian state declared by the 
palestine liberation organizations parliament in exile on nov 15 
1988 
the measures also came a day after two key proplo palestinian 
activists were ordered jailed for six months without trial for 
alleged involvement in inciting a wave of attacks against israelis 
in the past month 
israeli leftwingers protested the detentions of radwan abu 
ayyash 40 of ramallah in the west bank and ziad abu ziad 50 of 
jerusalem 
abu ayyash heads the arab journalists union and abu ziad edits 
a hebrewlanguage palestinian weekly 
the message of the israeli government to the palestinian 
leadership is clear there is no point in being a moderate said 
dedi zucker of the citizens rights movement 
yossi beilin of the leftofcenter labor party warned that the 
price is liable to be more unnecessary bloodshed 
the curfews in the occupied west bank and gaza strip confined 
roughly 420000 people indoors schools were also shut in the west 
bank keeping 300000 arab pupils away from classrooms 
holiday celebrations were launched tuesday night in gaza and the 
west bank in anticipation of the curfews activists set off 
firecrackers draped outlawed palestinian flags over electric wires 
and marched in the streets arab reports said 
demonstrations persisted today before the curfews in gaza 
citys commercial district school girls marched chanting proplo 
and proiraqi slogans arab reports said 
one chant was saddam fire the chemical weapons 
in israel authorities rounded up 1350 palestinians working 
without security permits army radio said the sweep was part of a 
campaign launched last month in the wake of a spate of stabbing 
attacks in israel 
labor minister david magen said the government would institute 
new policies that he expected to cut by more than half the number 
of palestinians working in israel 
the government will discuss new labor laws the significance 
will be a serious reduction in the number of workers from the 
territories magen said on israel radio 
magen added he expected 60000 of about 108000 palestinians 
employed in israel to lose their jobs the slack would be taken up 
by soviet immigrants and discharged soldiers he said 
the socalled administrative detentions of abu ayyash and abu 
ziad were announced several hours after an infiltrator from jordan 
shot and killed an israeli soldier tuesday 
security officials blamed the attack on the plos mainstream 
fatah movement and the moslem fundamentalist group islamic jihad 
it was the seventh infiltration this year along the previously 
quiet jordan frontier 
rightwing legislators voiced concern that jordans support for 
iraqi president saddam hussein was encouraging the attacks the 
army stepped up patrols along the frontier today israel radio 
said 
also tuesday two policemen were wounded in a stabbing in 
jerusalems old walled city only four days after another policeman 
was attacked near the same site 
both abu ayyash and abu ziad were accused of being senior 
figures in fatah and in the underground leadership of the uprising 
a defense ministry statement said both were either involved in 
writing leaflets calling for attacks on israelis or directing 
strike forces to conduct violence 
israeli reports said a physician in gaza ahmed alyaziji was 
also placed under administrative detention for one year on 
allegations of involvement with fatah 
the imprisonment of the three palestinians without trial was 
ordered under emergency regulations adopted by the british in 1945 
when they ruled palestine and kept on the law books by israel 
israelis have killed more than 770 palestinians in the uprising 
that began dec 8 1987 against israels occupation of lands seized 
in the 1967 middle east war more than 290 arabs have been killed 
as collaborators by other arabs and more than 50 israelis and 
foreigners have died

a chill wind blew dust into every 
pore at times visibility on the desert plain dropped to about 100 
yards but there was no morale problem for a us special forces 
team preparing kuwaitis for war 
american troops elsewhere in saudi arabia may be clamoring to go 
home but in the shrubless stony desert wasteland of eastern saudi 
arabia on tuesday 10 hardened us soldiers were embarked on a 
mission that stirred their emotions 
you have a cause worth fighting for said the officer 
commanding the team which includes both special forces and regular 
army experts talking with the kuwaitis you seen their concern 
for their families for their country being a family man i 
cannot help being moved 
staff sgt barry d sparlin 29 of houston said it was time to 
stop iraqi president saddam hussein before he gets nuclear weapons 
were here to prevent our children from having to do the 
same thing were here for right now he said 
part of kuwaits 20000man army escaped to saudi arabia with 
their tanks after the iraqis overran their country on aug 2 they 
have been camping in the desert for several months 
for soldiers like capt ali a 34yearold tank commander 
waiting for the order to attack has become almost an obsession 
we want revenge said ali who didnt identify himself 
further because his wife and four children are still in kuwait 
we didnt have a chance that day when they surprised us but now 
we are ready 
the chief us adviser speaking on condition he not be 
identified agreed that all the kuwaitis need is some equipment 
theyre as good as any brigade anywhere in the world in any 
army 
the kuwaitis could use more tanks spare parts and ammunition 
for the existing martyrs brigade a second brigade being formed has 
manpower but no armor a brigade normally has from 4500 to 5000 
soldiers about the number of regular kuwaiti forces who escaped to 
saudi arabia and more than 100 tanks 
the us team arrived in the kuwaiti camp only about two weeks 
ago just before the americans and saudis agreed on a joint command 
for operations inside the country and us command of any 
operations outside saudi arabia 
some 145000 arab troops under saudi command are part of the 
more than 350000strong multinational force confronting iraq 
the us officer said he didnt know why it had taken so long to 
get american advisers into the field 
but he said the time has been put to good use and the 
confusing command structure among the arab forces had been 
straightened out 
the american team leader said he assumed other us advisers 
were also based with syrian troops 
his men had an unscheduled meeting with the syrians one night 
they got lost and drove into the syrian camp where they were 
stopped by an alert sentry who checked them out and sent them back 
to the kuwaiti camp 
sgt paul evans 28 of vista calif said relations with the 
kuwaitis were so good that team members were invited to dinner 
almost every night that meant lamb or chicken with rice and 
potatoes instead of prepackaged army meals 
the americans refused to discuss their role saying only that 
they were coordinating activity between us units and the kuwaiti 
brigade 
the americans are training us on many things we need to face 
iraq said capt ali they are very good soldiers they just 
want to help 
ali said americans were training kuwaitis to deal with chemical 
weapons to communicate with us aerial command posts to call in 
air strikes and to use tow antitank missiles more effectively 
they teach us iraqi doctrines they teach us about iraqi 
minefields and they teach us how to handle prisoners he said 
a kuwaiti captain in intelligence speaking anonymously said 
the americans were also teaching the kuwaitis housetohouse 
warfare which would be essential in liberating kuwait city 
the chief us adviser said winds gusting between 20 and 30 mph 
were churning up dust tuesday and curtailed training but the 
colder weather was welcome he said because it meant fewer flies 
the location of the camp could not be revealed under military 
rules

saudi arabia said today 
that it wont take part in a proposed arab summit until iraq 
pledges to pull out of kuwait 
any arab meetings will bear no fruit or results unless iraq 
promises to adhere to the resolutions of the emergency arab summit 
held in august and of the united nations said the foreign 
minister prince saud alfaisal 
prince sauds statements were distributed by the official 
emirates news agency wam following his arrival and a meeting with 
president sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan 
sauds was the first saudi comment on the proposal by king 
hassan ii of morocco for an emergency arab summit to work out an 
arab solution to the persian gulf crisis and avert war over iraqs 
refusal to quit kuwait which it seized aug 2 
the comment came as iraqi president saddam husseins 
secondincommand and first deputy prime minister taha yassin 
ramadan returned to baghdad from a meeting with hassan in morocco 
the official iraqi news agency said ramadan stressed to hassan 
the need to provide a positive atmosphere and to make mature 
ideas available for discussion at the level of an arab summit 
the iraqis have said saddam would consider attending such a 
summit if it first consulted on the time and place and if the 
palestinian issue is on the agenda 
ina said ramadan said an arab summit would erase the infamous 
cairo summit resolutions which created divisions in the arab 
stance toward the dangers and the collusion against the arab nation 
created by its enemies led by the united states and its allies 
at the august emergency summit in cairo 14 of the arab leagues 
21 members voted to condemn the aug 2 invasion of kuwait and 
demand iraqs withdrawal while six either abstained or voted 
against the measure 
the six were sudan palestine jordan mauritania iraq and 
yemen libya was not represented at the meeting

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
nov 13 
birmingham ala postherald on the persian gulf crisis 
whatever lies ahead in the persian gulf the large new 
deployment of forces ordered by president bush is justified 
the magnitude of the force being built up in the gulf sends a 
necessary message too to all americans this commitment is 
irrevocable and may be costly 
war against iraq would be no quickfix intervention on the order 
of grenada or panama it could be long and bloody 
president bush who has handled many aspects of the gulf crisis 
with skill has yet to level with the public about the possible 
sacrifice ahead 
 
nov 11 
grand forks nd herald on the persian gulf 
it would be reassuring if bush toned down the rhetoric while he 
built up the armies as well there may yet be a diplomatic 
solution to this crisis 
there have been suggestions that iraq might be satisifed with 
better access to the sea control of an uninhabited sandbar and an 
indemnity for kuwaits welldocumented theft of oil and its 
shenanigans in the oil cartels with these conditions kuwait could 
be restore as an independent nation perhaps with a un 
peacekeeping force stationed there 
if such a settlement is possible it ought to be sought 
it is far more attractive than the war 
saddam may yet reject it of course then the consequences are 
on his shoulders if it is not offered before thousands of lives 
are lost the president will need to explain his failure as a 
diplomat to his people and to history 
 
nov 13 
the charleston wva gazette on the persian gulf 
is president bush preparing to invade iraq and kuwait without 
asking congress for a declaration of war just as he invaded panama 
without congress approval would he do it without a united nations 
decision authorizing warfare 
questions like these hang in the air as bush continues his 
bellicose tone and his military buildup in the middle east 
bush contends that he is acting to deter aggression to undo 
iraqs seizure of tiny kuwait but thats windowdressing no 
america and other nations are acting strictly to protect the 
mideast oil supply that sustains the industrialized world an 
understandable goal 
the nagging question is does one man have the right all by 
himself to plunge america into a major war 
we would feel less uneasy if he would promise not to send 
400000 young americans into a blood bath without asking congress 
first

delaware county daily times primos pa on the death of 
stormie jones 
doctors are vigorously trying to find out what exactly killed 
stormie jones the 13yearold texas girl who underwent a historic 
heartliver transplant in 1984 
but all forensic medical technology in the world is useless in 
telling us what kept stormie going and her chin up the past 6 
years 
stormie battled her way through hell a living hell she 
survived a war in which many of us would have been mentally 
conquered 
this courageous little girl captured the hearts of america 
time and time again as she showed us all how to manhandle adversity 
and what it really means to live

the marietta ohio times on the us elections 
an expert as most people know is someone who offers an opinion 
from far away pork barrel is used to describe government money 
that funds a project in somebody elses neighborhood now 
tuesdays national election figures have given us a new definition 
bum is somebody elses congressman 
throw the bums out supposedly was the cry of the land at 
least according to media prophets before the election 
wednesday morning however america woke up to find congress 
almost exactly as it was before the vote before the budgettax 
debacle before the savings and loan bailout before the pay raise 
issue before ethics inquiries before any of the other decisions 
that supposedly inflamed rightthinking patriots 
so basically on election day we got what we asked for we 
apparently are being duly represented 
 
nov 12 
the new mexican santa fe nm on the elections 
what the voters did on nov 6 should give neither the 
republicans nor the democrats much comfort 
neither major party really won or lost much although the 
returns gave a few members reason to worry because of the closeness 
of the tally they set the us on no new course the state of the 
economy and events in the persian gulf will probably do more to 
shape politics in the next two years than did election day 1990 
 
if messages were sent to congress they were that taxes are 
unpopular perhaps even more unpopular than the democrats believed 
despite the difficulty of this years tax fight and the votes 
reaction to it taxes will probably be an issue both in 1991 and 
1992 the sour taste of the 1990 tax debate likely sets the stage 
for harder fights over budget cutting in 1991 and 1992

the dallas morning news on william bennetts legacy 
the resignation of william bennett as director of the office of 
national drug control strategy should have the bush administration 
thinking seriously about where it wishes to go from here is the 
nation to stay the course in aggressively confronting the challenge 
of illegal drugs or is a new approach called for 
the chorus of voices calling for drug legalization should not 
obscure the fact that the nation does appear to have achieved some 
success in reducing certain kinds of drug use among certain 
segments of the population moreover the price of cocaine is 
reportedly down and the product being sold on the street is said 
to be unusually diluted no one is claiming victory and whether 
mr bennett can take credit for even these limited successes is 
open to question but to shirk from our commitment to an aggressive 
twotrack policy based on education and law enforcement could 
reverse even these few favorable signs 
the fact is that mr bennetts strength has reposed in his 
ability to move national debates forward

the times trenton nj on the bush administrations gag order 
on abortion information 
late last month the us supreme court heard oral arguments on a 
case in which the verdict ought to be a foregone conclusion 
at its heart is the reaganbush administrations gag order that 
bars government subsidized family planning clinics from giving any 
information about abortion to their clients even in answer to 
direct questions 
it is the bush administrations intent to block the option of 
abortion by trampling upon the priceless right of free speech and 
the priceless obligation of professional responsibility 
the court wont find many easier cases than this one it should 
throw those regulations into the potomac river

the plain dealer cleveland on the sampl bailout 
grim as it is regulators and taxpayers should keep an eye on 
the intricate sampl cleanup process 
timely action including closing down reckless thrifts selling 
off rtc resolution trust corporation assets strengthening the 
bank insurance fund and reforming federal deposit insurance will 
save taxpayers money in the long run 
the voters are already hopping mad about the thrift fiasco 
there is no excuse for washingtons further delay in speeding the 
inevitable sampl salvage operation 
 
nov 13 
the atlanta constitution on the noriega tapes 
what poses the real threat to manuel antonio noriegas right to 
a fair trial 
is it the airing by cable news network of a few leaked 
recordings of privileged conversations between the ousted 
panamanian dictator and his legal defense team 
or is it the bald fact that federal agents taped an unknown 
nubmer of telephone discussions involving noriega and his attorney 
and legal staff and thus may possess important clues as to the 
direction his defense strategists will take clues that a 
prosecutor could use if he were so minded to parry effectively 
his adversarys courtroom thrusts 
the latter possibility seems a far more plausible menace to a 
fair hearing for the accused drug trafficker noriega than the 
offchance that potential jurors might be swayed by his 
conversations as broadcast by cnn by the way one has to wonder 
why some official made the tapes available to cnn 
the case against noriega is already burdened with constitutional 
issues the circumstances of his capture and the gathering of 
evidence the release of sensitive documents to the defense and 
until recently the freezing of noriega assets needed to pay for 
his defense 
and now this the feds poking their noses into a supposedly 
inviolate legal communication its hard to imagine anything they 
might have learned in these conversations that would be worth 
taking a gamble with his trial 
the proceeding after all was meant to be a culmination of one 
of the objectives president bush set for the country in invading 
panama last december it is vital that the case be won it is no 
less vital that the trial be perceived around the world as fair 
alas its not likely to work out that way the feds could 
hardly have done a better job of jeopardizing the case if they 
tried

the houston post on ocean dumping 
a quick glance at the globe shows most of the earth is covered 
by water there seems to be so much of it that its hard to imagine 
that mere humans could make a difference in the vast seas but 
weve been giving it the old college try 
its time to stop and think about the future and consider the 
oceans arent as limitless as previously thought fortunately the 
worlds largest industrial nations have reached agreement on a 
global ban on dumping industrial waste at sea and moved toward 
restricting marine pollution discharged on land 
at a meeting of the 43 signatory nations to the london dumping 
convention a consensus was reached to phase out industrial waste 
dumping at sea by 1995 it is legally binding on all the nations 
that signed the 20yearold london treaty including the united 
states britain germany france the soviet union and almost all 
other industrialized nations 
the international agreement calls for dumping to stop without 
increasing pollution in other parts of the environment nations are 
encouraged to promote cleaner industrial processes recycling 
treatment of waste on land and more research and development on 
environmentally sound means of waste disposal 
these goals are to be applauded the seas must not be turned 
into sewers

the independent london on the us elections 
american voters are against the budget deficit but do 
not want to pay higher taxes they are against the rich but not 
eager to spend money on the poor they dislike incumbent 
politicians but are unimpressed by their rivals they want to be 
strong abroad but are understandably hesitant about war 
if the president could offer clear policies he might get a clear 
verdict from the voters as it is his indecision has been 
reflected in the indecision of the voters he emerges with less 
authority in congress and therefore in the world

neue zuercher zeitung zurich switzerland on iraqs holding of 
western hostages 
undoubtedly the iraqi regime through a masterfully staged 
operation to soften hearts is intent on diverting the western 
public from an initially generally accepted insight and the 
resulting willingness for resolute containment of iraqi arrogance 
by now every diplomatic step conveying to saddam the illusion 
that his strategy can succeed is a mistake the iraqi dictators 
room for maneuver for withdrawing from kuwait out of political 
insight is getting tight now that even moscow is not explicitly 
ruling out the force option anymore and for the american 
president bush and the united nations a military resolution of the 
gulf crisis is becoming increasingly unavoidable as diplomatic 
options are exhausted or prove fruitless 
travelers in humanity have no right to disavow their great 
political responsibility in this test case of a new world order

the times of india new delhi on israel and the palestinians 
how long can the global community whose will is expressed 
through the un tolerate israels adamant refusal to even 
consider any move designed to guarantee the security of 
palestinians living in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
the us and its western allies are working to have iraq 
charged with war crimes in kuwait yet what israel is doing to 
the palestinians in the occupied territories is scarcely less 
reprehensible how can the west much less the un allow double 
standards to be applied to put iraq in the dock but let israel go 
scotfree

financial times london on world trade talks 
the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations stands on 
the brink of failure following the breakdown of talks on farm 
reform over the weekend as expected proposals by the european 
community which imply further cuts in support of only some 15 
percent between now and 1996 have been roundly rejected by its 
partners in the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
developing countries many of which have spent the last decade 
liberalizing their own economies at the selfrighteous behest of 
the industrial world have a right to feel cruelly deceived by the 
ecs grudging attitude it would be understandable if farm 
exporters such as argentina concluded there was no further benefit 
in carrying on 
washington and brussels must back away from the selfserving 
approach that has nearly brought the round to disaster this is not 
only dangerous it also risks fuelling political instability in 
the developing world and eastern europe just when global

the guardian lagos nigeria on frances tying 15 billion in 
development grants to africa to democratic reforms 
this is because in the view of the french government democracy 
and development are inseparable in other words african countries 
are being told this if you want aid for development prepare for 
true democracy 
fortunately the values of democracy such as equality freedom 
and popular participation are values we should all cherish and 
whoever wants to promote these values cannot be an enemy of the 
people there is indeed some good reason for linking democracy and 
development 
as long as african countries remain minority authoritarian 
regimes aid flowing to them is easily converted into means for 
enriching their invariably corrupt elite that exploits the people 
and diverts the aid into building up arms with which to suppress 
them

the daily telegraph london on the enthronement of emperor 
akihito of japan 
the enthronement ceremony itself which transforms the emperor 
into a living god marks a partial regression to the era before 
gen macarthur compelled emperor hirohito to divest himself of the 
divine status in the name of which terrible things were done half a 
century ago greater sensitivity toward the feelings in 
particular of the countries occupied during japans militarist 
phase is in order 
the west though should also take these into account when 
pressing japan to send military forces to the persian gulf while 
a much greater financial contribution toward the gulf effort is 
desirable as japan is more dependent on the region for its oil 
than any major western nation the rejection last week of a 
proposal to authorize the deployment of its forces is probably a 
healthy acknowledgment of external opinion by japans postwar 
political system

president mikhail s gorbachev says he fears 
bloody social upheaval if he fails in his efforts to reach a 
powersharing agreement with russian republic president boris 
yeltsin 
gorbachev met sunday with yeltsin and pressed him to sign a new 
union treaty as a means of preserving the federation of 15 
republics to be renamed the union of sovereign republics 
the union of sovereign republics to use the military idiom 
is the last trench line gorbachev told senior military officers 
at a kremlin meeting on tuesday 
the disintegration of the state begins beyond he said in 
remarks quoted by the official news agency tass dissolution of the 
soviet union could turn into a bloodbath tass paraphrased him 
as saying 
a situation may arise that will be worse than during the 
cultural revolution in china gorbachev said referring to the 
tumultuous final decade of mao tsetung in china from 196676 
according to tass 
maos attempt to revive revolutionary fervor in china sparked a 
violent struggle for power an estimated 1 million people died 
 
gorbachev made a similar comment in march grappling with a 
crisis over baltic separatism and facing a russian parliamentary 
election that eventually put yeltsin in power of the countrys 
largest and most populous republic 
gorbachev and yeltsin met for five hours on sunday in a major 
initiative to end the paralysis of power in the soviet union 
gorbachev confirmed yeltsins statement that the two had set up 
commissions to decide how to divide authority between the central 
soviet government and the russian government which has emerged as 
an independent force since yeltsin was elected its president in 
june 
the soviet and russian commissions will work while 
representatives of the 15 republics try to negotiate a new union 
treaty to replace the 1924 charter that forms the basis of the 
union of soviet socialist republics 
despite the agreement between gorbachev and yeltsin on the need 
to compromise the two leaders seem to differ on whether to first 
conclude the union treaty or to define the respective powers of 
their rival governments 
yeltsin addressing the russian legislature on tuesday said 
that during sundays meeting the soviet leader insisted on 
rushing quickly through completion of a union treaty and that 
russia should play a great consolidating role in the process of 
signing a new union treaty 
but yeltsin said he insisted that gorbachev respect the 
sovereignty of the russian republic he said he would sign such a 
treaty only after the central government and republics had 
carefully defined their powers 
russia which contains more than half the soviet unions 287 
million people and is rich in natural resources holds a de facto 
veto over many of gorbachevs decisions 
in recent months gorbachev and yeltsin and their respective 
parliaments have issued conflicting decrees and laws that have 
complicated even simple transactions that in turn has worsened an 
already dire shortage of food and consumer goods at the outset of 
winter 
yeltsin said the commissions appointed by the two leaders must 
clearly define the functions of the governments 
he said the panels will cover division of property the use of 
the natural wealth use of foreign currency debts financial 
resources tax policies the banking system on the role of the 
banks and the independence of foreign economic trade by russia 
preparation and implementation of convertibility of the ruble the 
budget of 1991 
he said gorbachev agreed to cede to russia some elements of the 
kgb security police to give the russian government a voice in 
military reforms and to share millions of dollars the german 
government is paying moscow to aid the repatriation of soviet 
troops

after nearly five years out of office former 
defense secretary michael heseltine is a more dominant national 
figure now than when he stormed out of margaret thatchers cabinet 
that reflects both a flair for the dramatic and the patience to 
wait for the prime minister to stumble 
tall and handsome with flowing blond hair and piercing blue 
eyes the 57yearold heseltine is a selfmade millionaire who 
doesnt quite fit any faction of the governing conservative party 
to admirers in the party heseltine looks like a savior 
critics accuse him of volatility and showmanship as his 
challenge to her leadership loomed thatcher aides commented all 
glamour and no substance 
he has carried the nickname of tarzan since 1976 when he 
grabbed the heavy ceremonial mace in the house of commons and swung 
it over his head at labor party leftwingers who were singing their 
anthem the red flag 
as defense secretary from 1983 to 1986 at the height of the 
propaganda battle over the deployment of us nuclear missiles in 
britain heseltine donned a flak jacket for a confrontation with 
antinuclear protesters at a missile base 
politically hes dead center in the party while mrs thatcher 
stands well to the right but many on the tory left distrust him 
for views that include enthusiasm for a program in the united 
states that requires unemployed to work for welfare 
he calls his political philosophy caring capitalism that 
contrasts with the freemarket stance of thatcherism 
for any democratic government the challenge is to take people 
a little further than they can go by themselves he once wrote 
and when need be to show that compassion for which the 
marketplace makes no allowance 
michael jones political editor of londons conservative sunday 
times wrote of heseltine he has the trick of making tory 
supporters feel good about themselves of making them feel that 
capitalism can have a moral base 
while a member of mrs thatchers government heseltine was the 
golden boy and seemed destined for bigger things 
the rift came in 1986 in a dispute over the buyout of the 
financially troubled british helicopter manufacturer westland plc 
heseltine always proeurope favored a european consortium while 
mrs thatcher favored the us corporation sikorsky 
to the surprise of nearly everyone heseltine stood up in the 
middle of a cabinet meeting in january 1986 and walked out 
of course i miss it hugely he mused earlier this year of 
his long exile from government i regretted profoundly the need 
to leave the cabinet but i have never had any doubts that it was 
the right thing to do 
most other casualties of the thatcher cabinets have fallen into 
political obscurity 
but heseltine conducted a patient campaign of a leader in 
waiting he has swept around the country addressing party meetings 
an average of five a week opening fetes spreading goodwill and 
glamour and assiduously avoiding direct criticism of mrs thatcher 
subtle criticisms however were always there particularly 
about her combative stance against the european community and a 
controversial new local government tax the socalled poll tax 
michael ray dibdin heseltine was born march 21 1933 into a 
middleclass welsh family his father was a structural engineer and 
parttime army colonel 
as an undergraduate at oxford heseltine mapped out his 
ambitions to make a fortune in business and become prime minister 
starting with a 1000pound legacy from his grandfather he made 
one fortune in property and then another in magazine publishing 
he and his wife anne who have two daughters and a son live in 
considerable style a magnificent period house in londons 
belgravia district and a country mansion where he has planted 2500 
species of trees and shrubs it also has a lake for his lifelong 
hobby of birdwatching 
i havent been driven by money heseltine once said i saw 
money as an important part of the process of being independent 
and in enabling me to pursue a political career 
after two unsuccessful attempts he was elected to parliament in 
1966 he got his first government job as minister of aerospace in 
1972 in edward heaths conservative government 
mrs thatcher appointed him to her first cabinet as environment 
secretary when she won power in 1979 and then defense secretary

poland and germany today formally settled 
one of the last disputes of world war ii signing a treaty 
confirming their longquestioned border on the oder and neisse 
rivers 
in the pact germany abandons claim to 40000 square miles of 
its former territory in east prussia pomerania and silesia that 
was added to poland after the war the land poland gained from 
germany made up for a much greater expanse of land in the east 
taken from poland by the soviet union 
the formerly german lands account for about onethird of poland 
today 
the treaty commits the countries to building a peaceful 
european order in which borders will not divide and which will 
ensure permanent peace freedom and stability 
the pact was signed by foreign ministers hansdietrich genscher 
of germany and krzysztof skubiszewski of poland at the council of 
ministers building seat of the polish government 
skubiszewski said both nations should congratulate 
themselves for closing a difficult chapter in their histories 
genscher said the loss of german lands confirmed by the pact was 
the fault of the criminal system in germany during world war 
ii 
in a speech after the signing he called the treaty a decisive 
step between both our countries and for the future of europe a 
step of historical dimension 
he said the pact shows the newly united germanys will to 
establish a firm basis of friendship with poland 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and his assembled cabinet 
stood by as the twopage document was signed final agreement on 
the treaty was reached at a border meeting thursday between 
mazowiecki and german chancellor helmut kohl 
mazowiecki made what appeared to be polands strongest statement 
of apology to the germans for the loss of their lands 
we ask for forgiveness he said the suffering of the 
german nation must be spoken about every harm remains a harm 
every tragedy remains a tragedy irrespective of the harms and 
tragedies that we ourselves experienced 
winning unequivocal german acceptance of the border has been one 
of polands chief foreign policy goals 
genscher expressed sympathy for the millions of germans who lost 
homes that fell within the new polish borders after the war 
the decision we have made is not an easy one for us 
germans for none of us for me neither and for those who have 
lost their home lands who suffered expulsion it is an especially 
painful one he said 
the treaty signing is seen as a boost for mazowiecki engaged in 
an uphill campaign for president against solidarity chairman lech 
walesa 
genscher was to meet with both mazowiecki and walesa during his 
oneday visit as well as with outgoing president wojciech 
jaruzelski and cardinal jozef glemp leader of polands powerful 
roman catholic church 
stalin urged the border on the oder and neisse rivers at potsdam 
in 1945 and britain and the united states accepted by that time 
the soviets had installed an obedient government in poland and were 
occupying eastern germany 
as a result millions of germans fled or were roughly expelled 
from lands that had been home to german speakers for centuries in 
their stead came millions more poles from the east whose former 
homes had fallen within the expanded borders of the soviet union 
by insisting the border be moved so deeply into former german 
territory stalin partly compensated the poles for his own land 
seizures punished germany for the war and bound poland to moscow 
as the ultimate guarantor of its western frontier 
communist east germany recognized the oderneisse line in 1950 
and west germany disavowed any territorial claims in 1970 but 
conservatives and politically influential associations of those 
expelled from german land pressed for decades to regain all or part 
of germanys lost territories 
under the timetable agreed to by kohl and mazowiecki the border 
treaty will be ratified by the end of february by parliaments of 
both countries 
at the same time a broader friendship treaty is to be ready for 
ratification too among other things that pact will contain 
assurances of minority rights for the up to 1 million ethnic 
germans still living in poland

the african national congress 
today called for urgent land redistribution to end the white 
domination of property and to restore land that blacks lost under 
apartheid laws 
in its first comprehensive report on a future land policy the 
group said that nationalizing property was one of several options 
for reaching a more equitable distribution of land 
in the context of a mixed economy there would only be 
selective nationalization and the distribution of this land 
would be based on landuse needs the report said 
it said landowners in those cases would be compensated in cash 
and bonds 
but the report also said compensation would be due from 
present owners on the basis of the benefits they have received 
from the land to those blacks who were dispossessed 
the 20page report was based on discussions last month of the 
ancs land commission workshop 
whites make up about 16 percent of the population of south 
africa but own 87 percent of the land the imbalance in land 
ownership is becoming a major issue as the government and black 
opposition groups move closer to negotiations on a new constitution 
to give blacks a share of power 
president fw de klerk has promised to end apartheid and repeal 
decadesold land laws that forced millions of blacks into 
designated townships and rural tribal homelands blacks are able to 
own property in the townships and homelands 
white landowners and farmers in particular have expressed 
fears that they could lose their property under a black government 
according to the anc report workshop delegates envisioned a 
system of one person one farm in a future south africa and 
agreed that the state should play the principal role in 
redistribution of land 
a land commission is needed to oversee land claims and an 
affirmative action program is needed to help blacks once they have 
acquired property the report said 
priority would be given to acquiring land claimed by entire 
communities it said and factors to be considered would include 
whether the land had been neglected or underutilized 
those people who lose their land under such a plan should be 
paid 25 percent cash 25 percent in 10year government bonds and 
50 percent in industrial bonds it said

a policeman said today he grabbed the barrel of a 
hunting rifle as a marcher in a parade aimed it in the direction of 
soviet leaders watching revolution day ceremonies in red square 
earlier this month 
up until now official reports on the nov 7 incident had not 
said what the gunmans target was 
but the policeman sgt andrei mylnikov said the gunman was 
aiming at the reviewing stand atop the lenin mausoleum where soviet 
leaders including president mikhail s gorbachev were standing 
mylnikov said he was three yards away when the man pulled the 
rifle from under his coat 
he rushed the gunman and forced the gun barrel into the air just 
before he fired the official tass news agency quoted the policeman 
as telling a news conference 
i ran up to him and snatching the hunting gun barrel with 
both hands sharply raised it upwards mylnikov said at that 
time the first shot was fired 
although he said the gun was aimed at the reviewing stand he 
did not say whether the gunman seemed to be trying to hit a 
specific leader 
mylinkov said a second shot was fired over the heads of police 
guarding the square but by then they had enough warning from the 
commotion to bend down or fall to the ground he said 
after that the gunman was apprehended he said i 
snatched the gun from his hands 
about 20 plainclothes police seized alexander a shmonov 38 an 
unemployed worker from leningrad and bundled him off to the gum 
department store across the square from gorbachev 
he has been charged with attempted terrorism and tass said 
today he was being held in a kgb investigating isolation ward 
tass quoted kgb investigator pyotr sokolov as saying shmonovs 
actions amounted to an attempt to commit a terrorist act 
the gunman had been standing about 80 yards from the official 
reviewing stand he was marching in a delegation from the bauman 
region of moscow during a procommunist demonstration 
no one was hurt in the shootings which came during an otherwise 
peaceful marking of the 73rd anniversary of the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
the shooting occurred five minutes after gorbachev russian 
federation president boris yeltsin and other officials returned to 
the mausoleum after marching with the demonstrators

three thousand police fired tear gas and water 
cannons today during a successful fivehour battle to drive 
hundreds of leftist radicals from a dozen rundown tenements in 
eastern berlin 
police and a special paramilitary unit used armored personnel 
carriers and bulldozers to break down barricades erected by the 
leftists hundreds of squatters living on mainzer strasse responded 
with firebombs and rocks 
it was the third consecutive day of clashes on the street this 
week 
zdf television said several police officers were injured but 
there was no immediate word on injuries among the squatters zdf 
said 135 people were arrested 
police raided mainzer strasse and adjoining blocks at 7 am and 
battled for control for about five hours before driving the 
squatters from the ramshackle tenements splashed wtih slogans and 
signs including eat the rich 
berlin interior minister erich paetzold said todays clash was 
marked by unbelievable brutality from the radicals 
late monday night and tuesday morning leftists battled with 
police for nearly 10 hours on mainzer strasse about 137 police 
were injured and 20 people were arrested in those clashes 
fighting began monday on mainzer strasse after police began 
evicting leftist radicals from houses in other parts of the city 
the leftists say they have a right to the abandoned homes and have 
mobilized their supporters to resist police action 
police spokesman werner thronicker said mainzer strasse is 
headquarters for people responsible for serious criminal acts 
anarchists from the former west berlin have taken over about 12 
tenement buildings on the block in recent months and several houses 
elsewhere in eastern berlin 
while east germanys democratic government did little to evict 
the squatters officials have begun cracking down since german 
unification oct 3 
the clashes have drawn new attention to the shortage of 
affordable housing in berlin and other german cities the situation 
is expected to be particularly acute in eastern berlin where many 
residents still pay relatively low rents 
under the former communist system rents were heavily subsidized 
by the government they are to begin rising in january

juiceflavored mineral water is testing its domestic product after 
small traces of benzene were found in its us stocks 
koala springs international has recalled its drinks from stores 
in the united states and eastern canada following the discovery of 
traces of the toxic chemical the same substance that forced 
perrier to recall millions of bottles in february 
koala springs said laboratory tests are being conducted in 
australia on fruit concentrate used in its americanbottled 
product and on locally bottled fruit mineral water 
tested as recently as june australianbottled mineral water 
supplies had shown no traces of benzene but further tests are 
being verified by the australian government analytical 
laboratories the company said 
benzene is a naturally occurring chemical used in solvents 
we have no thoughts of withdrawing our product until the 
results of the australian tests are known a company spokesman 
said today 
the results of the government test would not be known for at 
least a week 
containers used to ship concentrates to the united states would 
also be tested the company said 
benzene forced a recall this year for french mineral water giant 
perrier the company withdrew 160 million bottles worldwide

its product in the united states 
we are taking this action willingly and voluntarily to protect 
our product and its good name he said from the companys us

us intelligence recruited hundreds of 
guerrillas and laid weapons caches across western europe during the 
early days of cold war as part of preparations for a feared soviet 
invasion a newspaper reported today 
only recently was the wouldbe resistance network disbanded and 
several former highranking european officials say some of its 
hidden stockpiles of arms and explosives still existed just two 
months ago 
the top secret organization brought to light last month in 
italy and codenamed gladio there after the short swords used by 
roman gladiators is now under investigation for possible links to 
rightwing terrorism 
the network is said to have had branches in italy germany 
france belgium the netherlands denmark norway austria spain 
greece and portugal the respected german newspaper die welt said 
today that even neutral sweden and switzerland took part 
swedens tt news agency today quoted former cia director william 
colby as saying that he organized an armed anticommunist movement 
in a scandinavian country during the 1950s when he was based in 
sweden 
it cannot surprise anyone that such movements networks were 
organized in western europe to attack communist occupation 
forces colby was quoted as telling tt 
he was interviewed by phone at his pebble beach calif home he 
refused to name the scandinavian country in which he organized a 
resistance movement 
die welt said that soon after world war ii us agents worked 
with intelligence agencies of various european countries in 
setting up the network and training natives as guerrilla fighters 
the newspaper did not name its sources 
training centers sprang up in forests in the usoccupied 
part of germany said die welt 
at the centers said the newspaper former prisoners of war 
men who had done civilian work for the occupying powers and young 
men acquired by chance were trained in pistolshooting radio 
operations and tactics 
pistols grenadelaunchers explosives and radios were stored in 
secret caches to be used by the guerrillas said die welt 
the network was expanded to all of western europe by 1959 
said die welt money was provided by intelligence agencies 
the operation was designed to be an underground resistance 
network in case of a soviet invasion in western europe it mostly 
prepared communication networks escape routes and sabotage plans 
officials have said 
die welt said the networks controlling body still exists in 
belgium thought only as a shell 
in 1951 said die welt allied intelligence agencies and each 
participating nation germany italy and france being among the 
first agreed to set up a clandestine committee for planning to 
oversee the network 
headquarters were initially in france said the newspaper 
the controlling bodys name was changed to allied clandestine 
committee in 1964 said die welt 
the newspaper said that in the 1950s the network began 
systematic cooperation with the brusselsbased supreme 
headquarters allied powers europe which worked with the group in 
maneuvers 
the network was independent of natos control said die welt 
german officials were not immediately available for comment 
in paris french president francois mitterrand on tuesday 
confirmed that he had dissolved the french arm of the group but did 
not say when he was first elected in 1981 
i didnt have much left to dissolve mitterrand said 
there only remained a few remnants of which i learned the 
existence with some surprise because everyone had forgotten about 
them 
the paris newspaper liberation said the french arm of the 
network was disbanded only after disclosures of the italian 
operation had created a political controversy 
henk vredeling the dutch defense minister from 197377 said he 
had been told about the existence of gladio weapons caches on dutch 
soil 
one dump discovered in 1980 could supply a force of up to 150 
men and enough explosives to destroy buildings and bridges reports 
said 
in belgium a former gladio member and former belgian army 
intelligence official andre moyen told the leftist newspaper le 
drapeau rouge he knew of at least six arms caches hidden in 
belgium up to two months ago 
a former belgian defense minister francoisxavier de donnea 
said gladio exercises were scrapped perhaps as long as one or 
two years ago during his 19851988 tenure he said he was 
briefed on gladio operations 
belgium is investigating links between the local branch and 
indiscriminate killings in supermarkets during the early 1980s that 
left at least 28 people dead the murders have been linked by 
authorities to rightwing terrorism 
italian premier giulio andreotti last month revealed the 
existence of gladio which he said had more than 600 members in his 
country 
the operation caused controversy in italy because of unconfirmed 
statements that the network might have been behind rightwing 
terrorist attacks in the early 1970s to keep communists out of 
power 
venice investigating magistrate felice casson a specialist in 
terrorism discovered the existence of gladio during a probe of a 
rightwing terrorist attack and has asked president francesco 
cossiga to testify about the group 
in greece where the anticommunist network was known as 
sheepskin caches with arms ammunition torches and other 
equipment were dug up between 1985 and 1988 when the network was 
dismantled

building where shuttles are prepared for launch was cocaine

the contractors responsible for shuttle preparations and security

cocaine said nasa spokesman karl kristofferson nasa conducted 
another test that identified the substance as calcium hydrogen 
phosphate which is used in high school chemistry kits 
kristofferson said officials did not know how the bag got into

burmas military leader said in a 
speech broadcast today that a dissident who died in custody last 
week committed suicide and was not tortured to death 
maung ko 52 an influential organizer of the opposition 
national league for democracy died in military custody on friday 
while a un human rights investigator was visiting the country 
political sources contacted in rangoon said tuesday on condition 
of anonymity that maung kos relatives believe he died of torture 
we did make necessary interrogations but there was no reason 
for us to kill him the head of the military government gen saw 
maung said in a speech broadcast on burmese state television he 
spoke on tuesday 
maung kos death coincided with a visit to burma by sadako 
ogata a japanese human rights expert who was looking into 
allegations of widespread abuse by the government she left burma 
on sunday and is to report back to the un human rights commission 
in geneva 
saw maung denied his government used torture he said a report 
he had received from the head of the military intelligence maj 
gen khin nyunt said maung ko after confessing what they did 
and what their plans were made use of a blanket there and hanged 
himself 
this happened because of his own problems let me say it here 
today it did not happen because of our doing he said 
khin nyunts directorate of defense services intelligence was 
cited by amnesty international last week as the agency most widely 
blamed for torturing dissidents 
the political sources said maung ko was arrested late last month 
and detained at a military intelligence center near rangoon 
airport where he died 
relatives and colleagues who attended maung kos funeral in 
rangoon on sunday said his body was heavily bruised around the 
face neck and body and there was blood around the mouth and 
ankles they did not believe the suicide report the sources said 
on sheer personality grounds they found it difficult to 
believe he was not the sort of person who would give up one of 
the sources said 
maung ko headed the leagues workers wing and was a close 
associate of its general secretary aung san suu kyi who has been 
under house arrest since july 1989 
the league won the may 27 elections by a landslide but the 
government has refused to hand over power 
the government came to power in 1988 after troops killed 
thousands of people to crush a mass movement for democracy 
the political sources said death in detention from torture was 
not uncommon and often the government did not return victims 
bodies to their relatives it was unclear why they did so this 
time they said 
it may be because he was such a senior person or that they 
felt they had nothing to hide or they may have done it to make an 
example of him one said 
the sources said the government had arrested at least 50 senior 
league members in its latest clampdown that began with raids on 
buddhist monasteries last month they said up to 200 monks also 
were detained

surgeons unscrewed a steel rod from a brave 
8yearold impaled through the heart in a fall from a roof 
justin stiner asked for some ice and wanted to play nintendo on 
tuesday after waking up from surgery doctors said 
he probably just thinks this is kind of a slight inconvenience 
in his life said trauma surgeon dr michael esser 
the 4footlong inchthick threaded bar used to reinforce 
concrete was literally unscrewed from the boys neck and torso 
monday in a 2hour operation at university medical center 
eighteen inches of the rod had penetrated his body 
justin was listed in critical condition esser said the heart 
wounds should heal fully and although the boys severed jugular 
vein was tied off other veins can provide the needed circulation 
the jugular vein carries blood back from the head to the heart 
the 4foot10 86pound thirdgrader from sierra vista fell onto 
the rod while playing with friends on the roof of a house monday 
morning 
he was suspended two feet off the ground for about 20 minutes 
alert the whole time while paramedics cut the rod which pierced 
him just below the breastbone 
justin who was taken the 80 miles from sierra vista to tucson 
by helicopter neither panicked or screamed and on arrival 
wanted to know if i was going to remove it he was very 
cooperative dr phillip richemont said 
esser and richemont said the rod went through the right side of 
the heart which has about onethird the pressure of the left side 
he would have bled to death if it had been on the left side 
esser said hes one lucky kid it just didnt hit any arterial 
structures 
richemont said surgeons were stunned to find that the rod had 
pierced the heart in two places and divided the jugular vein but 
yet it didnt bleed its amazing richemont said calling it a 
oneinamillion occurrence 
during the operation the heart seemingly contracted down 
between the threads cutting off bleeding richemont said 
the outcome esser said makes us feel good we have a lot 
that dont make it

challenged by congressional leaders over its new war footing 
the bush administration has begun to emphasize that american jobs 
could be at risk if saddam hussein is allowed to maintain his grip 
on kuwait 
iraq today stepped up its accusations that the united states is 
preparing to attack it denounced a plan by us marines to hold 
amphibious assault exercises in saudi arabia calling it a clear 
act of provocation 
meanwhile president bush told congress today he was extending 
for an additional 90 days the 90day callup for reservists already 
serving in the persian gulf region and the united states pressed 
japan to toughen its stance in the gulf crisis 
in a setback for arab diplomatic efforts saudi arabia suggested 
it would probably not take part in a proposed arab summit until 
iraq pledged to pull out of kuwait 
the saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal said any arab 
meetings will bear no fruit unless iraq promises to adhere to 
the resolutions of the emergency arab summit held in august and of 
the united nations 
king hassan ii of morocco has proposed an emergency arab summit 
to work out an arab solution to the persian gulf crisis and avert 
war over iraqs refusal to quit kuwait which it seized aug 2 
the saudi foreign ministers statement came on his arrival today 
in the united arab emirates where he met with president sheik 
zayed bin sultan al nahyan the remarks were distributed by the 
official emirates news agency wam 
the iraqis say saddam would consider attending the summit if he 
was consulted on the time and place and if the palestinian issue is 
on the agenda 
bush was meeting at the white house today with a select group of 
lawmakers to try to bolster support for his gulf policy secretary 
of state james a baker iii set the stage with comments a day 
earlier linking the economy and the persian gulf crisis 
the economic lifeline of the industrial world runs from the 
gulf and we cannot permit a dictator such as this to sit astride 
that economic lifeline he said to bring it down to the level 
of the average american citizen let me say that means jobs 
baker suggested that a worldwide economic recession could result 
if saddam is not checked and the security of gulf oil reserves 
ensured 
he spoke after meeting in bermuda with canadas external affairs 
minister joe clark who voiced support for a ussponsored united 
nations resolution authorizing the use of military force to drive 
iraqi forces from kuwait 
the call for greater japanese support for the antiiraq 
coalition came from vice president dan quayle who met in tokyo 
with japanese prime minsiter toshiki kaifu quayle said he told 
kaifu washington would like a japanese presence in the gulf in 
addition to the billions of dollars tokyo has committed there 
kaifu had proposed sending japanese soldiers to be the gulf for 
noncombat duty but the measure failed to win enough support in 
parliament the government and the opposition have now agreed to 
draft a new measure calling for the dispatch of japanese civilians 
as part of peacekeeping efforts 
still more allied soldiers and hardware may be on their way to 
join the us expeditionary force that has gathered in the saudi 
desert as the chief challenger to saddam 
the times of london reported today that britain is expected to 
send an additional 6000 troops and more than 100 additional tanks 
to the gulf increasing its ground forces there to 15500 and its 
tanks to more than 220 
the bush administration has indicated that its readiness to 
attack iraqi forces to dislodge them from kuwait if a unordered 
embargo on trade with iraq and saberrattling fail 
that position is encountering resistance from some allies abroad 
and some leading members of congress who accuse the president of 
showing too much of an inclination to resort quickly to the 
military option 
bush last week decided to send 200000 more troops to the 
persian gulf to bolster the 230000 american gis already there 
putting us forces on an offensive footing 
on tuesday key democratic and republican senators asked him to 
convene an emergency session of congress to discuss the 
administrations gulf policy 
the white house quickly called such a session unnecessary said 
press secretary marlin fitzwater there is no war 
iraqs harsh criticism of the us plan for an amphibious 
assault exercise in saudi arabia came a day after the pentagon 
announced it pentagon spokesman pete williams would not say when 
or exactly where the exercise would be held 
the washington times said it would be held 10 miles from kuwait 
this behaviour constitutes a clear act of provocation that 
exposes along with other evidence americas aggressive intentions 
against iraq the official iraqi news agency quoted an 
unidentified iraqi government source as saying 
iraq also criticized the us buildup in the region in a letter 
to the security council today foreign minister tariq aziz said the 
united states was looking for an excuse to unleash aggression 
under a smoke screen by sowing confusion and organizing a campaign 
to mislead the american people the united states congress and 
world public opinion

retail sales inched up 01 percent in october 
fueled for the third straight month by the high cost of gasoline 
the government said today excluding gasoline sales fell 01 
percent amid continuing signs of fading consumer confidence 
the commerce department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1523 billion up from 1521 billion in september 
the revised 13 percent gain in september was a bit stronger 
than the 11 percent increase originally reported but excluding 
the gasoline impact sales were up only 09 percent 
many analysts now believe the us economy is in a recession 
which could be intensified by a drop in personal consumption 
retail sales represent about a half of all consumer spending which 
itself accounts for twothirds of the nations economic activity 
the department said retail sales since august have been 
artificially inflated by gasoline prices that surged after iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and disrupted world petroleum markets 
not by increased sales volume 
some of the other details in the report were suggested in 
advance last thursday when the nations biggest retailers reported 
dismal sales in october 
analysts have said consumers have become cautious in their 
spending in recent months after fears of war in the persian gulf 
added to their anxiety over the weakening economy 
the conference board a new york business research organization 
has reported that consumer confidence in the economy plunged in 
october to the lowest level since 198182 recession 
sales at department stores a key barometer of consumer 
sentiment were off 06 percent after falling 11 percent in 
september 
automobile sales which have been choppy through much of the 
year slowed to a 07 percent gain from a 29 percent advance the 
previous month analysts have attributed much of the october sales 
to fleet purchases by rental car companies 
excluding the automobile category sales were unchanged from the 
previous month auto sales were off 37 percent in august 
sales of durable goods which include cars and other items 
expected to last more than three years were up 07 percent 
following a 14 percent increase in september 
besides automobiles other components of the durable category 
were mixed sales of furniture and other home furnishings fell 03 
percent while building materials jumped 15 percent 
nondurable goods which include food and gasoline slipped 02 
percent after a 12 percent gain a month earlier 
sales at gasoline stations rose 32 percent but analysts said in 
advance of the report the increase would reflect higher prices in 
the wake of the iraqi invasion rather an an increase in volume 
except for a 16 percent increase in drug store sales all other 
categories dropped grocery stores down 05 percent clothing 
stores down 10 percent and restaurant and bar off 03 percent

vice president dan quayle told prime minister 
toshiki kaifu today that washington would like a japanese presence 
in the persian gulf in addition to the billions of dollars tokyo 
has committed there 
quayle told reporters he had expressed appreciation for the 4 
billion japan has offered to the usled force arrayed against 
iraq and to the nations suffering economic losses because of the 
trade embargo against baghdad 
it has been an adequate response but we hope for more 
quayle told reporters after meeting with kaifu i reaffirmed our 
interest in having a japanese presence in the persian gulf 
the vice president said it was up to tokyo and not washington 
to decide what form japans involvement would take 
we are not going to detail what that presence should be the 
japanese political system will make that determination he said 
as japan has achieved economic superpower status there are 
certain responsibilities on a global basis that go with that 
kaifu proposed legislation that would have allowed japanese 
soldiers to be deployed in the gulf for noncombat duty but the 
measure failed to win enough support in parliament 
the governing liberal democratic party and opposition groups 
have agreed to draft new legislation saying that japanese civilians 
could be sent overseas as part of international peacekeeping 
efforts 
japan now has a small medical team in the gulf 
japans foreign ministry said kaifu responded that any further 
actions by japan would have to be based on discussions in 
parliament about the nations international role 
the ministry said quayle also had asked japan to foot a larger 
share of the cost of stationing us forces in japan 
japans constitution which was written by us officials at the 
conclusion of world war ii prohibits japan from sending troops 
overseas 
quayle who was in japan for the enthronement of emperor 
akihito left tokyo soon after the meeting with kaifu 
on the issue of trade quayle reportedly gave a letter to kaifu 
from president bush in which the president reiterated the us 
position that tokyo should remove its ban on imports of rice 
japans staple food 
the cold war must not be replaced by a trade war quayle 
said 
the r word did pass my lips he said meaning rice 
japan has a rice problem the united states has a problem with 
sugar and dairy he added referring to american agricultural 
products that receive government protection 
japan knows what the problems are and we just need to move 
this forward he said

in front of the camera and behind it women 
in television have a long way to go before their numbers equal 
those of men 
not only are there far fewer women than men in virtually every 
aspect of tv production but the depiction of women in primetime 
programs perpetuates a stereotype of halfclad halfbrained 
creatures 
those findings highlight an 81page study titled whats wrong 
with this picture released today by women in film a los angeles 
organization and the washington dcbased national commission on 
working women 
the yearlong study examined 80 primetime programs on the abc 
cbs nbc and fox broadcasting co networks it assessed 555 tv 
characters and the producers writers and directors responsible for 
creating them 
women continue to fare poorly on television both on screen 
and behind the camera despite significant gains over time and 
some notable but scattered breakthroughs the study said 
male characters outnumber females in onscreen portrayals 
especially dramas and men producers writers and directors 
greatly outnumber women in those jobs 
specifically the study found 
fewer than half of all television series characters are women 
compared to 51 percent of the general population 
male drama characters outnumber women by almost twotoone 
only three percent of female tv characters are over the age of 
60 compared to 14 percent in real life 
men comprise 85 percent of televisions producers 91 percent 
of directors and 75 percent of writers 
of the four networks fox had the highest percentage of women 
producers writers and directors with 26 percent 33 percent and 
12 percent respectively 
of primetime shows cbs sugar n spice now canceled had 
the highest percentage of female producers with 75 percent cbs 
designing women had the highest percentage of women writers 
with 83 percent and nbcs a different world had the highest 
percentage of women directors with 96 percent 
still more than half of the 80 shows studied had no female 
directors 
the report did note that women have made inroads in television 
especially with strong female leads such as nurse colleen mcmurphy 
in abcs china beach and journalist murphy brown on the cbs 
series of the same name 
but such portrayals are the exception not the rule of tv 
programming the report said 
despite working womens breakthroughs on tv too many female 
characters remain the extension of male fantasies it stated 
and it noted it is virtually impossible to watch an evening 
of entertainment television without encountering young women in 
various states of undress men on tv wear more clothes than women 
and they keep them on

in the most serious challenge to prime minister 
margaret thatcher former defense secretary michael heseltine said 
today he will contest her position as leader of the conservative 
party and thus prime minister 
heseltine who resigned as mrs thatchers defense minister in 
1986 will run in a ballot among conservative legislators next 
week 
the challenge to mrs thatcher after 11 years in power comes 
amid growing criticism within the governing party over the prime 
ministers reluctance to integrate with the european community 
the party also is suffering in the polls as a result of high 
interest rates doubledigit inflation and an unpopular local 
percapita tax dubbed the poll tax 
i am persuaded that i have a better prospect now than mrs 
thatcher of leading the conservative party into a fourth election 
victory said heseltine 57 in a statement broadcast on sky 
television 
in essence the prime minister holds views on europe behind 
which she has not been able to maintain a united cabinet this 
damages the proper pursuit of britains national interest 
heseltine said 
he said he decided to run because of deep divisions within the 
party over steps toward european unity and the conservatives 
recent thirdplace finish in a parliamentary special election he 
promised to review the new local tax which mrs thatcher pushed 
through parliament 
there was no immediate statement from mrs thatcher but aides 
told reporters at her 10 downing st office that she was determined 
to defeat heseltine 
kenneth baker the chairman of the conservative party said 
heseltines candidacy was unnecessary and unwanted 
more than 100 of my parliamentary colleagues have urged me to 
stand and promised me their support heseltine said 
to win tuesday mrs thatcher or heseltine needs to get 50 
percent of the votes cast by tory legislators plus 15 percent more 
than the opponents vote 
if all 372 conservative legislators participate in the secret 
ballot heseltine would need 159 votes to force a second ballot 
mrs thatcher 214 votes to avoid one the number of votes required 
decreases as the number of abstentions increases 
the same rules apply on a second ballot but other candidates 
could jump in if that ballot fails to produce a winner a third 
ballot would be held on nov 29 limited to the top three finishers 
in the second ballot 
the winner is prime minister and no general election is 
required 
mrs thatcher who will be in paris attending a 35nation summit 
of leaders from east and west will vote by proxy in the ballot 
party officials said 
heseltine stepped forward a day after sir geoffrey howe who 
resigned as deputy prime minister nov 1 delivered a scathing 
attack in the house of commons on the leader he had served 
throughout her years in power 
the time has come for others to consider their own response to 
the tragic conflict of loyalty with which i have myself wrestled 
for perhaps too long said howe who had been the last survivor 
of mrs thatchers first cabinet in 1979 
howe resigned in protest of mrs thatchers rejection of a plan 
adopted by the 11 other european community leaders at a summit in 
rome to set up a single central bank by 1994 and a single currency 
perhaps by the year 2000 
thatcher supporters on tuesday came to her defense 
to attempt to throw over margaret thatcher now would be an act 
of panic and madness and a denial of all she has achieved over the 
past 11 years parliamentarian sir john stokes said tuesday in 
defense of the tory leader 
if the tory party is sensible and pulls itself together it can 
still win the next general election without jettisoning the prime 
minister he said 
lawmaker george younger said the deployment of british troops in 
the middle east made it the wrong time for a challenge against a 
critical world leader 
mrs thatcher has faced no serious challenge since she ousted 
former prime minister edward heath as party leader in 1975 
the woman who faced down rebellious labor unions slashed 
government spending and was known in the soviet press as the iron 
lady served notice she would not go without a fight 
howe said he resigned because of a fundamental dispute with mrs 
thatcher over policy on steps toward european union an issue on 
which heseltine has also disagreed with the prime minister 
howe contrasted winston churchills vision of a united states of 
europe with the nightmare image sometimes conjured up by the 
prime minister who seems to look out on a continent that is 
positively teeming with illintentioned people 
though europe is the issue on which the conservatives have 
chosen to fight the party is also under pressure because of 
doubledigit inflation and interest rates of 14 percent 
the opposition labor party no longer the divided doctrinaire 
socialist party that mrs thatcher easily defeated in 1979 has 
been ahead in opinion polls for 16 months

the citys former mayor now a convicted 
felon has been declared official winner of last weeks mayoral 
race but faces a challenge from a group that says his conviction 
makes him ineligible for office 
the providence board of canvassers refused tuesday to decide 
whether vincent a buddy cianci jr is barred from returning to 
office because of his 1984 conviction 
board members said their panel did not have authority to 
consider that issue so ciancis opponents took their case to the 
state board of elections 
im not bothered by it cianci said i dont think its 
going to stop me from taking the oath of office 
a challenge filed friday by three providence voters and joined 
tuesday by 15 others argued cianci should be barred from office 
under a 1986 amendment to the state constitution that amendment 
prohibits anyone convicted of a felony from holding office for

police said today they are 
searching for four african national congress members in connection 
with an alleged plot to overthrow the government 
the four are suspected of illegally importing arms ammunition 
and explosives for socalled operation vula police said 
eight other suspects were arrested in july and were recently 
charged in connection with the alleged plot against the government 
they have been released on bail 
the anc says the government should not prosecute its members for 
operation vula which it claims was part of regular anc military 
activities before the armed struggle was suspended aug 6 
authorities say the african national congress and its ally the 
communist party planned to topple the government by force if peace 
talks on ending apartheid failed the government and the anc the 
leading black opposition movement have been holding talks since 
may 
ronnie kasrils one of the four suspects sought and a 
highranking anc and communist party member went into hiding 
earlier this year when the government failed to extend a temporary 
amnesty for him police said the other three people sought are 
janet love charles ndaba and christopher manye 
meanwhile the bophuthatswana black homeland said it detained 44 
anc members this week after authorities uncovered an alleged anc 
plot to overthrow homeland leader lucas mangope 
clement sehume the bophuthatswana education minister said the 
crackdown was aimed at certain elements and not the anc as a 
whole 
the anc which considers the homelands part of the apartheid 
system of racial segregation and white dominance denied plotting 
to kill mangope or overthrow the government 
the anc and other antiapartheid groups call for the homelands 
to be reincorporated into south africa mangope has rejected such a 
move

saddam hussein has contributed a new word 
to the english language guestages short for 
guesthostages 
the iraqi presidents ministers routinely warn reporters not to 
refer to the thousands of westerners banned from leaving iraq as 
hostages 
this is a very very bad and dirty word and im not going to 
accept it says information and culture minister latif jassim 
during his news briefings 
and a warning in iraq today should be taken seriously 
after several such warnings the word guestages entered the 
lexicon of iraqispeak 
are you a hos the moment you ask any of the hundreds of 
westerners held in baghdad hotels comes the swift reply no im 
a guestage 
to tell the world that western news reports on the conditions of 
hostages held at strategic sites are wrong iraqs staterun 
television has started a new program guest news in which 
americans british japanese and germans are shown playing pool or 
giving interviews 
understandably the hostages speak highly of iraq but some use 
sign language to convey their true feelings 
 
iraqis are obsessed with spying on each other the practice is 
ctively encouraged by the authorities who even urge 
schoolchildren to tell what their parents say at home 
as iraqis tell it two officials spotted each other dining with 
western reporters in one of the fish restaurants along the banks of 
the tigris river that flows through baghdad 
both dutifully reported the fact to the alamn the secret 
police both were promptly transferred to remote towns 
it is an accepted fact that foreigners telephones are tapped 
lines are disconnected if people talk in a language the 
eavesdroppers dont understood 
when a reporter called his home in india and started speaking in 
bengali with his wife the line went dead there are no bengali 
interpreters in baghdad 
on fridays the moslem sabbath international calls are 
restricted to 10 minutes because there are not enough people to tap 
all the calls 
in all of baghdad only one public telex functions its at the 
alrasheed hotel where all foreign journalists must stay the 
telex is constantly monitored 
people living in baghdad almost by habit switch on the radio 
or play a tape when talking about politics or war so that their 
conversations cant be picked up by surveillance bugs people in 
offices or at parties whisper when they talk 
iraqis are discouraged from talking to foreigners those who are 
found in the company of one are promptly hauled off for 
interrogation or worse 
 
the iraqi president is probably the most protected world 
leader today an asian diplomat said 
taxi drivers warn their fares in advance not to point their 
finger in the direction of the presidential palace 
police patrols in mercedesbenz sedans scour the area around the 
palace ready to arrest anyone who stops outside the perimeter 
walls 
no pedestrians are allowed within a 500yard radius of the 
heavily guarded complex where multibarreled antiaircraft guns 
are manned round the clock 
saddam who has survived several assassination attempts and coup 
plots since he took power in 1979 rarely appears in public in 
baghdad these days 
foreign television networks allowed to interview him are told to 
be ready three days in advance the actual interview is done 
suddenly at 30 minutes notice 
cars are sent from the palace to pick up the tv crew not that 
foreigners on the crews get to do much the networks can only use 
iraqi cameramen and cameras for the interviews

landmark imports inc of memphis tenn has 
recalled 24 planterstyle floor lamps that the government says may 
pose an electrocution hazard even when switched off 
the voluntary recall in cooperation with the consumer product 
safety commission involves the model 4088 3u planter floor lamp 
sold in the memphis area last year 
most of the 24 units were obtained from landmark by three 
stores bampt enterprises in south medon tenn and mtc company and 
import 1 both in memphis the model 4088 3u features a single 
light socket at the top of a center post and three planter 
supports at the ends of its ushaped support legs 
the danger the cpsc said stems from the possible use of 
excessively long screws used to attach the three metal support legs 
to the center post the screws may pierce the power cords 
insulation meaning consumers could be electrocuted if they touched 
any part of the brass frame the agency said 
purchasers of the model 4088 3u should unplug it immediately 
and return it to the store for a refund of the purchase price the 
lamp sold for about 40

scientists have discovered the first specifc abnormality in the 
brains of people with hyperactivity the most common psychiatric 
disorder of childhood and believe it may an underlying cause of 
the condition 
their study found that parts of the brain essential for 
attention and controlling behavior do not work as hard as usual in 
hyperactive people experts described this as a potentially 
important insight into the sources of the mysterious ailment 
people have long suspected that some physical irregularity is at 
the heart of the disorder which affects between 2 percent and 4 
percent of schoolage children 
however dr alan j zametkin who directed the research said 
this is the first large study of hyperactivity that shows some 
sort of metabolic abnormality 
the research conducted at the national institute of mental 
health in bethesda md was published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine 
brain scans of adults who had been afflicted with the disorder 
since childhood showed that their brain cells were 8 percent less 
active than those of normal people however the reduction was 
especially dramatic in the parts of the brain that control 
attention and inhibit behavior 
hyperactivity known technically as attention 
deficithyperactivity disorder is a serious ailment that makes 
children inattentive and impulsive they tend to blurt out answers 
in school run into the street without looking and constantly 
fidget squirm and jump about their hot tempers and frequent 
disobedience make them difficult for parents and teachers to 
handle 
about half the time the disorder persists into adulthood and 
victims are more likely to have runins with the law and abuse 
drugs and alcohol 
about threequarters of victims improve when given mild 
stimulant drugs such as ritalin just why these medicines work is 
unclear however they help people concentrate with less 
distraction and irritability 
zametkin said he hoped the latest findings will reduce the 
stigma attached to being treated for this disorder by showing that 
it involves a biological abnormality 
hyperactivity often runs in families the latest study was 
conducted on 25 adults who had been hyperactive since childhood 
they were also parents of hyperactive youngsters 
the researchers compared the metabolism the rate at which 
energy is used in the brains of the hyperactive adults and 50 
normal people they found that brain activity was significantly 
reduced among hyperactives in 30 of 60 specific regions of the 
brain 
in particular they noticed reductions in the premotor cortex 
and the superior prefrontal cortex these parts of the brain 
control attention damage to them can result in inattention and 
difficulty in controlling behavior 
in an accompanying editorial dr gabrielle weiss of montreal 
childrens hospital said the findings represent a clear advance 
in our understanding of hyperactivity 
but whether low metabolism is the ultimate cause of 
hyperactivity is still unclear 
im not going to say its the cause said zametkin we 
have to look at young kids and people with the nongenetic form of 
the disorder but its possible this has something to do with the 
cause 
dr paul h wender of the university of utah said that finding 
any biological abnormality in a mental illness is of great 
interest but he said it may not turn out to be the basic cause 
of hyperactivity instead the cortex may be sluggish because of 
faulty control signals from a more primitive part of the brain 
if the more primitive centers dont tell the guys upstairs to 
wake up they wont have attention he said but the problem is 
not in the cortex its the guys downstais 
zametkin said that measuring brain metabolism may someday 
provide a way of accurately diagnosing hyperactivity it could also 
allow doctors to check the effects of different drug treatments 
currently he is studying how ritalin changes the brains metabolic 
activity 
zametkin conducted the newly published study by injecting sugar 
that contained a radioactive label then he performed 
positronemission tomography or pet scans these produce 
crosssectional pictures of the head that show how intensely the 
radioactive sugar is being used

britain he said he will not get a fair hearing in britain and 
asked to be tried in ireland

republic for possessing explosives 
extradition has been a contentious issue between britain and 
ireland under the previous law some suspects wanted in britain 
have successfully pleaded that their alleged offenses were 
political 
in northern ireland 10 prisoners belonging to the ira or the 
irish national liberation army died on hunger strikes in maze 
prison in 1981 the best known was bobby sands who was elected to 
the british parliament during his 65day hunger strike

twentytwo months into his presidency george 
bush has yet to make peace with environmentalists even though he 
is about to sign legislation to clean up the nations air 
bush say the environmentalists is more talk than substance 
if i had to grade him id have to give him a low d a year 
ago id have given him an f so hes moving up a little bit 
said mike clark president of friends of the earth bush has yet 
to prove hes an environmentalist clark added 
early in his term bush proclaimed himself proenvironment on 
thursday he will sign the clean air act of 1990 in a ceremony he 
is expected to try to use to reenforce that image 
the legislation totaling more than 1000 pages is designed to 
stem acid rain urban smog and toxic industrial pollution by 
imposing tighter controls on automobiles factories coalburning 
power plants and thousands of businesses 
while leaders of environmentalist groups credit bush for being a 
major player in ushering in the first air pollution controls in 13 
years they say there are many other issues from global warming to 
protecting wetlands on which the president has not met their test 
last summer bush expressed his irritation with 
environmentalists and declared that their grading system is 
absolutely absurd 
i didnt rely heavily on them for support in getting elected 
and im not going to be persuaded that i can get some brownie 
points by appealing to them he snapped when asked by reporters 
at an international economics conference in houston about 
environmentalists protesting his views on global warming 
among those targeted by bushs remarks were such mainstream 
environmental groups as the wilderness society the national 
wildlife federation and the sierra club all of which have 
criticized the president 
his remarks really blew the cover mike mccloskey president 
of the sierra club until then mccloskey said environmentalists 
had thought that their problems with the white house were largely 
the work of aides such as presidential chief of staff john sununu 
the presidents hostility really showed thats where hes at 
too mccloskey said in a recent interview 
bushs signing of the clean air act is not expected to soften 
the criticism 
this is his one and only significant environmental achievement 
and he certainly is not entitled to take sole credit for it said 
george frampton president of the wilderness society 
among the few bush actions widely praised by environmentalists 
is his appointment of william reilly a longtime conservationist 
to head the environmental protection agency 
reilly highly respected in the environmental community 
staunchly defends the presidents environmental record and said in 
an interview that the presidents critics often judge bush against 
an unfair standard of perfection 
among the issues cited by administration officials are the 
presidents ban on ivory imports to protect the african elephant 
and his decision last summer to postpone the leasing of 
oildrilling sites off florida and california until environmental 
concerns can be further examined 
the president has many agendas and has to balance to achieve 
the best benefits to the country as a whole reilly said by 
any objective measures george bush has done more for the 
environment than any president in my memory 
peter dykstra a spokesman for greenpeace counters that the 
president has shrewdly espoused concern for the environment and 
delivered less of the goods than any president 
bush has taken his hardest hits on environmental issues of 
broad international concern such as global warming 
when the latest conference on global warming concluded last week 
in geneva sen al gore dtenn said the bush administrations 
performance was embarrassing because no one should have to 
drag us kicking and screaming to address the problem 
while many industrial nations have established goals on cutting 
the pollutants that cause global warming bush steadfastly has 
refused to do so and maintains that scientists have yet to 
determine how serious a threat global warming will be 
there is a long list of other issues on which bush has 
disappointed environmentalists said sharon newsome a vice 
president for the national wildlife federation 
she cited bushs strong support for opening the arctic national 
wildlife refuge in alaska to oil exploration a lack of progress in 
developing a formal policy to protect wetlands nearly two years 
after promising to do so and hints of wanting to reexamine the 
endangered species act to more heavily take into account economic 
considerations an issue spotlighted by the debate over the 
spotted owl in the northwest 
on capitol hill the administration has almost consistently been 
on opposite sides from environmentalists even in the debate over 
how strong clean air legislation should be said the sierra clubs 
mccloskey 
he cited administration opposition to legislation that would 
have required higher fuel economy standards for automobiles bills 
that would have reduced mining logging and grazing on federal 
lands and a bill to protect a vast california desert

retail sales growth slowed to a barely 
perceptible 01 percent in october the government said wednesday 
prompting analysts to predict the holiday giftbuying season will 
be a bust 
i think holiday sales are going to be pretty lousy said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets in new 
york compared to christmases past its just not going to look 
very good 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group in washington 
agreed pointing to two months of declining sales at department and 
clothing stores often gauges of consumer sentiment 
consumers have a limited budget she said with the rapid 
deterioration of the job market and more inflation consumers just 
simply have less money to spend 
the commerce department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1523 billion up from 1521 billion in september but like the 
previous two months sales were artificially inflated by high 
gasoline prices not volume 
in fact the department said sales actually fell 01 percent in 
october when gasoline purchases were excluded the price of 
gasoline has spiraled since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
disrupted world oil markets 
analysts saw the report as further evidence of weakness in an 
economy that many believe is now in a recession retail sales 
represent about half of all consumer spending which itself accounts 
for twothirds of the nations economic activity 
ms shaber predicted a repeat of last years holiday shopping 
season when many retailers cut prices and offered other promotions 
to lure consumers to their salesrooms 
its really a very very promotional christmas already she 
said we have too many stores and too many malls now being 
aggravated by the erosion of household purchasing power 
retailers depend on the holiday shopping season for about half 
of their sales and profits 
automobiles which represent about 20 percent of retail sales 
slowed to a 07 percent gain from a 29 percent increase in 
september but steinberg said unit sales were down in october 
suggesting the increase represented higher prices for 
newmodelyear cars 
excluding the auto category overall retail sales were unchanged 
from the previous month 
sales of durable goods which include cars and other items 
expected to last more than three years rose 07 percent just half 
of their 14 percent gain a month earlier 
purchases of building materials rebounded 15 percent from a 15 
percent drop in september but sales of furniture and other home 
furnishings fell 03 percent 
nondurable sales such as food and gasoline slipped 02 
percent after rising 12 percent the previous month 
gasoline service station sales were up 32 percent after 
increases of 56 percent in september and 7 percent immediately 
after the august invasion 
but department store sales were down 06 percent after a 11 
percent loss the previous month while apparel purchases declined 
10 percent following septembers 17 percent drop 
sales at restaurants and bars were off 03 percent from a 04 
percent increase a month earlier 
but purchases at drug stores rose 16 percent after a 09 
percent gain in september 
people are taking more aspirin because theyre more worried 
steinberg suggested

students from each state were placed in the time capsule that was 
buried at the library of congress to mark the second annual 
national young readers day 
six months to live tells how to cope with personal 
problems the ones you cant change 12yearold tiffany harmon 
of lexington sc wrote 
kids growing up in the 1990s are faced with their own personal 
battles tiffany continued some of these include drugs 
divorce peer pressure and stress 
thomas daniel tarantino of camarillo calif said of the 
hobbit you know ive studied a lot about the revolutionary 
war in school but i never had such an indepth look at the horror 
and sadness of war this book showed to me 
i love to read said 11yearold jennie pacheco of bristol 
ri my mother told me when i was young that if i had a good 
book i had a good friend 
jennies favorite book is the bridge to terabithia although 
she noted i read at least two books a week ive read 100 books 
in the last two summers 
the reviews were in the forms of letters in which youngsters

british defense secretary tom 
king warned saddam hussein on wednesday that time is running 
out for the iraqis to leave kuwait or military force will be 
used 
we are moving now into very critical weeks king said at a 
news conference held beneath camouflage netting in the saudi 
desert 
we arent going to keep our troops hanging around forever 
doing nothing king saidit would be a very foolish man indeed 
who thought we were bluffing 
he refused to set an exact timetable but he added he better 
make a pretty early decision or he will have to take responsibility 
for the consequences that will follow 
king spent the day on tank maneuvers with the 7th armored 
brigade also known as the desert rats he visited british air and 
naval stations in the persian gulf region to determine what more is 
needed 
king declined to give precise details but said he wanted to see 
where else we can help and fit in the most effective way he 
said reinforcements would arrive soon 
the british have deployed 15000 ground troops more than 120 
challenger battle tanks 50 combat aircraft and 12 warships 
british ground and air forces are under the tactical control of 
the us military the desert rats are under the tactical command 
of the us marine corps which has been conducting joint training 
exercises with the british 
in saudi arabia all troops are under the control of prince 
khalid but command and control of international forces under a 
single commander is still being worked out if fighting spreads 
outside the kingdom 
as part of his mission king met with gen norman schwarzkopf 
commander of all us forces involved in operation desert shield 
we will have absolutely clear command and control 
arrangements im satisifed they are being achieved king said 
king rode in a tank with brigade commander brig gen patrick 
cordingly and lt gen sir peter de la billiere commander of all 
british forces in the middle east 
meanwhile king said the united nations embargo designed to 
starve iraq out of kuwait is costing saddam 1 billion a month in 
oil exports and 1 billion a month in import business 
stocks are starting to run out theyre starting to realize 
what total isolation from the world is going to mean king said 
but he added that the military option would be applied if saddam 
refuses to abandon kuwait 
there must be no doubting our resolution we dont want to see 
conflict but the warning is quite clear there are limits to our 
patience king said 
we cant allow the atrocities the cruelty the unbelievable 
behavior to go on month after month as though we didnt care

minute injections of a highly poisonous 
toxin have been found effective and safe in treating a varity of 
involuntary muscle spasms a committee of experts announced today 
at the national institutes of health 
the toxin obtained from a bacteria that causes botulism food 
poisoning has been used successfully to treat spasms of the 
eyelids throat face and the vocal cords the panel said 
this is the most powerful toxin known said dr roger 
duvoisin of the robert wood medical school in new brunswick nj 
the complex protein known formally as botulinum toxin is 
produced by a bacteria in spoiled food and can lead to lethal food 
poisoning in large doses 
duvoisin said however that in very small injected doses the 
toxin has the ability to block signals from nerves to muscles this 
action will halt involuntary muscle spasms 
it has given relief where little was available before for 
muscle spasms duvoisin said 
the injections have been used for patients whose lives were 
blighted by such ailments as the involuntary and uncontrollable 
closing of the eyelids the inability to speak because of vocal 
cord spasms and facial tics that cause the muscles to contort 
repeatedly 
the committee organized by nih consisted of experts from around 
the country who evaluate clinical results from experimental use of 
the toxin in a variety of patients 
we have seen at this conference impressive evidence that this 
is the first choice of treatment for several disabling disorders 
duvoisin said 
because of the high success rates of the toxin treatment 
thousands of more patients have the potential to lead improved 
lives he said 
the committee called for additional studies to determine how 
else the toxin might be used and to better understand its precise 
action in the body 
injections of the toxin which can cost from 400 to 1800 
must usually be repeated three to four times a year for continuous 
symptomatic relief 
duvoisin emphasized that the injections only control the 
symptoms of the muscle spasms and are not a permanent cure

i doubt the diplomats can go into the jungle and forest and 
find the men buried in battle he said 
moments after making the promise he prayed with american vets

of the grave sites

philadelphia and washington dc and visits are planned during 
the next month for new haven conn boston atlanta madison 
wis pittsburgh los angeles san francisco and san diego

stress syndrome 
they looked at me attentively as i came in he said 
but then they began to talk about a mothers suspicious looks 
about a girlfriends rejection about drugs and nightmares and 
flashbacks 
although some veterans have criticized the us governments 
psychological programs for them hung was impressed 
in vietnam the government thought we were the winner so their 
soldiers didnt have any problems he said in fact the 
vietnamese had flashbacks and nightmares and things like that 
too 
psychology is new in vietnam we need something like that

that vietnamese sometimes allowed black soldiers to pass before 
opening fire on whites 
hung thought for a moment and answered yes 
he later explained that the viet cong included villagers who by 
day mingled with many us soldiers when they became soldiers 
themselves at night they would allow friendly faces to pass before 
firing at officers many of whom were unpopular with local 
residents and most of whom happened to be white 
not all american soldiers were bad some gave food to the 
people he said we werent shooting at the black or the white 
we were shooting at the bad man 
there was something nice and funny going on during the war 
that nobody wanted to dip into it was kind of like if you behave 
you were well if you didnt behave you were punished 
new york state veteran counselor daniel a friedman said he 
thinks nguyens visit is a good thing 
i think its healthy to bury the hatchet to heal the 
wounds said friedman who was at the vietnam memorial service 
i think its important for people to put the war behind 
them friedman said my fellow vietnam veterans who want to 
keep refighting the war are not helping themselves

the typhoon which hit the central philippines tuesday with peak 
winds of 150 mph had weakened to 94 mph and was continuing west 
into the south china sea late wednesday said crisologo enriquez 
the manila weather bureaus chief forecaster 
about 140 people were missing and 320000 refugees from te 
typhoon jammed schools offices and makeshift evacuation centers 
president corazon aquino who returned wednesday from japan 
declared 30 of the countrys 73 provinces disaster areas 
among the most severely devastated areas was cebu city the most 
important industrial and transport center next to manila and 
negros occidental province where millions of dollars worth of 
sugar crops could be lost 
the typhoon sunk at least 41 cargo and passenger vessels nearly 
all of them in the cebu harbor navy officials said most sank in a 
narrow channel among the busiest maritime centers in the country 
and could pose danger to other vessels 
the navy also reported that at least eight ships ran aground 
including the research vessel calypso operated by jacques 
cousteau the navy said the calypso ran aground off mindoro island 
but there was no word on the crew 
the french embassy said cousteau himself was not in the 
philippines the embassy said it was unaware of the report 
radio station dyhp reported from cebu that 28 people were 
confirmed dead in the city and surrounding districts 
cebu mayor tomas osmena contacted by radio from manila said 
the city was without electricity telephones and drinking water he 
said he had not been able to make contact with officials in manila 
the general situation in the city is that its almost 
impossible to quantify the damage osmena said in an interview 
there is tremendous and widespread damage particularly among the 
poor 
osmena said numerous telephone and electric poles had been blown 
down and strewn on the streets like matchsticks blocking 
traffic 
during the height of the storm tuesday a ship slammed into a 
bridge that links the city to mactan island causing major 
structural damage he said an international airport which also 
suffered damage and an fuel depot are on the island 
we are in need of basic infrastructure osmena said we 
are highly susceptible to an epidemic because there is no water

single men looking for a raise or 
promotion should consider a serious option get married 
married men earn an average of 306 percent more than unmarried 
men according to a university of michigan survey released tuesday 
husbands outearn bachelors in several other countries as well 
said robert schoeni a doctoral student at the schools population 
studies center 
the average earnings of married men were consistently higher 
than the earnings of their unmarried counterparts in all the 
countries we studied the effect persisted even when education age 
or experience and race were taken into account schoeni said 
he offered three possible explanations 
employers are more likely to hire and promote married men 
because they consider them more stable and community oriented 
women are more likely to marry financially successful men 
married men feel responsible for a wife and family and become 
more productive 
our data doesnt clarify which is the correct explanation i 
suspect however that all three explanations play a role 
schoeni said 
schoeni studied incomes in 12 countries using data for 25 to 
64yearold males collected since 1983 by the center for 
population poverty and policy studies in walferdange luxembourg 
he said he found marriage had a particularly powerful effect on 
mens earnings in the united states norway sweden and 
switzerland 
in the united states the effect was powerful at all ages 288 
percent at age 30 303 percent at age 40 and 325 percent at age 
50 
in italy and in predemocracy poland the effect was weaker 
93 percent in italy and only 31 percent in poland schoeni said 
he didnt know why the gap was narrower in italy he said a planned 
economy like predemocracy polands was not affected much by issues 
such as marriage 
the gap in different countries 
australia 136 percent 
canada 144 percent 
france 127 percent 
germany 124 percent 
italy 93 percent 
netherlands 119 percent 
norway 264 percent 
poland 31 percent 
sweden 261 percent 
switzerland 259 percent 
united kingdom 127 percent

democratic leaders told president bush today 
they believe the constitution requires bush to seek congressional 
authorization before using military force in the persian gulf the 
white house left its options open 
the president did not indicate a commitment to do that or a 
refusal to do that senate majority leader george mitchell said 
secretary of state james a baker iii at a news conference a 
few moments later said bush certainly will follow the 
constitution 
however baker said its a question what the constitution 
requires 
baker who is a lawyer said that the administration respects 
congress prerogative under the constitution to declare war 
but baker said he would not play the game of getting into 
what the president might do since the use of force at this point 
was still hypothetical 
mitchell said he and house speaker thomas s foley at a 
twohour meeting at the white house expressed directly to the 
president our view that if he does make a decision to use military 
force that under the circumstances the requirements of the 
constitution would have to be met 
he said that would involve presentment of that decision to the 
congress for authorization 
house republican leader bob michel said bush told the lawmakers 
that iraqi president saddam hussein threatens to have a 
stranglehold on oil and free world economies and that hostages are 
in jeopardy 
michel quoted bush as saying if we dont take heed now well 
pay dearly later 
both mitchell and foley said that they agreed with bush that 
there should not be an emergency session of congress to discuss 
persian gulf policy but the senate announced tuesday it would hold 
hearings on the crisis and the house did the same today 
but on tuesday two leading republican senators endorsed the 
idea of a special session 
with the election over the budget behind us the american 
people are starting to focus on this weve lost some support we 
need to regain it said dole rkan 
meanwhile bush today notified congress that he was extending 
for an additional 90 days the callup for reservists already 
serving in the persian gulf region 
tours of duty run for 90 days renewable for another 90 days by 
presidential order bushs action had been expected 
the president said the effective support and conduct of 
operational missions in and around the arabian peninsula 
necessitates this action 
todays session comes less than a week after bush announced 
200000 new us troops will be sent to the gulf region to provide 
an offensive military option for use against saddam husseins 
iraqi forces about 230000 us troops are currently in the gulf 
area 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee and a backer of the additional deployment said the 
announced buildup triggered a minifirestorm of concern in 
congress 
following weekend sniping by several democrats at the 
presidents gulf policy dole and other republicans asked bush on 
tuesday to convene an emergency session of congress to vote on the 
administrations position 
i think it ought to be put up to the congress put up or shut 
up dole said and if they say no well then they say no and 
then the president has to decide whether to go it alone 
the white house publicly opposed a special session as 
unnecessary since the nation is not at war but dole said later 
tuesday that bush has not made up his mind and may decide after his 
foreign trip late this month 
bush is scheduled to spend next week in europe for the expected 
signing of an arms control treaty then visit us troops in the 
gulf and go on to mexico for two days 
mitchell gave little support to the gop call for a special 
session contending that such a step would be justified only if the 
president decides to go to war but he said the armed services and 
foreign relations committees will hold hearings on the crisis in 
the next several weeks 
traditionally when congress adjourns for the year it can be 
called back into session only by the president however lawmakers 
this year gave their own leaders the authority to call them back 
after the oct 28 adjournment 
in other gulfrelated developments 
the pentagon said it was raising the ceiling for naval 
reservists called to active duty from 6300 to 10000 
the pentagon announced that marines are preparing to conduct 
their first amphibious assault exercise in saudi arabia since being 
sent to the gulf spokesman pete williams would not say where or 
when the exercise will be held 
rep ron dellums dcalif and 21 other house democrats 
announced plans to file suit next week in federal court to keep 
bush from going on the offensive without congressional approval 
baker conferring with canadian foreign minister joe clark in 
bermuda told reporters according to a transcript provided by the 
state department in washington the economic lifeline of the 
industrial world runs from the persian gulf and we cannot permit 
a dictator such as this to sit astride that economic lifeline 
let me say that means jobs of the average american citizen

a secret network of trained resistance 
fighters was exposed in norway in 1978 when a policeman tracking 
illegal moonshine stumbled on one of its arms caches 
the network was set up in the late 1940s by people who saw nazi 
troops sweep away their illprepared resistance in world war ii and 
feared the cold war could bring a communist invasion 
the norwegian government confirmed the resistance network 
existed during the inquiry that followed the discovery of the 
weapons in 1978 at the same time former cia director william 
colby published his memoirs and referred to such groups 
it was a little surprising that no one in the other nato 
countries picked up on it and raised questions about their own 
countries nil gleditzch of the international peace research 
institute in oslo said wednesday 
colby who was stationed at the us embassy in stockholm from 
19511953 was quoted wednesday by the swedish news agency tt as 
saying he helped form an armed anticommunist guerrilla force in 
a scandinavian country he would not name the country 
officials in other nato countries recently confirmed their own 
anticommunist cells also established in the 1940 and 1950s but 
the north atlantic treaty organization has refused to say if it 
played a role 
in italy a group known as operation gladio is being 
investigated for possible connections with rightwing terrorist 
killings in the early 1980s 
gleditzch said norways groups are not suspected of such 
wrongdoing 
hans otto meyer an intelligence operative was arrested in 1978 
when an illegal still was found on his property police also 
discovered at least 60 weapons many machine guns and 12000 
rounds of ammunition 
meyers claim that norwegian intelligence provided some of the 
weapons for use by a resistance cell was eventually confirmed 
gleditzch said the reference in colbys book stirred interest in 
norwy 
rolf hansen norways defense minister at the time told 
parliament the resistance groups were privately organized after the 
war later they were placed under the supervision of the 
intelligence service he said 
the norwegian underground network was not answerable to nato or 
other countries hansen said dismissing any connection to the cia 
but he would not discuss details saying the organizations 
activities had to be kept secret 
government officials remain secretive asked to confirm that the 
groups are still active in norway defense ministry spokesman erik 
senstad responded what hansen said then still applies 
rear admiral jan ingebrigtsen said the groups still existed in 
1985 when he stepped down as head of the norwegian supreme defense 
commands intelligence service 
there is nothing suspicious about it but these are units that 
would stay behind in occupied territory and it is therefore 
necessary that they be kept top secret he told the norwegian 
news agency ntb 
christian christensen a former norwegian intelligence officer 
wrote many books about the groups as recently as this autumn he 
said private groups were formed in 1947 sometimes kept communists 
under surveillance and became part of the intelligence service in 
1948 
norway a sparsely populated country expects trained citizen 
soldiers to meet an invasion by arming themselves from thousands of 
arms dumps in rural areas and the mountains 
the idea is to have so many caches that it would be 
impossible to knock out all of them senstad said 
but gleditzch said the socalled staybehind groups are a 
last line of defense with their own weapons 
its separate from the other arms dumps there are most likely 
caches of weapons in closedoff rooms in peoples basements he 
said in an interview

malcolm muggeridge once britains bestknown 
media celebrity died wednesday at a nursing home in southern 
england three months after suffering a stroke his family said he 
was 87 
muggeridge was an agnostic who became a roman catholic when he 
was nearly 80 and a youthful socialist who later mocked the trendy 
left he had one unchanging fascination death 
i rejoice in it i love it if it werent for death life 
would be unbearable muggeridge said in a television appearance 
seven years ago without a trace of morbidness 
muggeridge delivered the remark with the same puckish smile and 
twinkling eyes that enlivened his rigid views against 
contraception abortion divorce and pornography 
some commentators dubbed him st mugg while others said he 
railed in old age against vices such as smoking drinking and 
adultery that he had enjoyed as a younger man 
but for one who spent a long life talking writing pronouncing 
denouncing laughing at himself and others and infuriating many in 
the process he earned a rare reward few ever accused him of being 
a bore or a hypocrite 
journalist author teacher world war ii spy for britains mi6 
counterintelligence service editor and traveler muggeridge became 
famous through television in the 1950s and 60s 
his caustic commentaries waspish views on postimperial britain 
and a 1957 british broadcasting corp ban for what was perceived as 
an attack on the royal family made him familiar to millions 
he continued writing and interviewing after he moved in the 
1960s to the sussex village of robertsbridge where he lived with 
his wife kitty whom he married in 1927 he died in a sussex 
nursing home wednesday 
they had three surviving children one son died and nine 
grandchildren 
in middle life muggeridge a heavy smoker and drinker who 
once said i just liked getting drunk gave up both vices 
because the old must choose between sainthood and suicide 
muggeridge a selfconfessed unfaithful husband later changes 
his ways 
being unfaithful is the most despicable thing i have done in 
my life he said but i always owned up in the end and kitty 
understands 
through a career that included spells as a foreign correspondent 
in moscow and washington muggeridge remained both fascinated and 
repelled by politicians he espoused no political cause but loathed 
communism 
that was due party to his experiences during a 193233 
assignment in the soviet union as correspondent for britains 
liberal guardian newspaper 
muggeridges religious odyssey was tormented but conclusive 
he described that journey in his 1969 book jesus 
rediscovered which he wrote after he decided to become a 
committed christian and a nominal member of the church of england 
christianity to me is like a hopeless love affair he 
lamented in 1958 it is infinitely dear and infinitely 
unattainable 
he described his conversion to catholicism at age 80 as a 
homecoming picking up the lost threads of life he had found he 
couldnt take the anglican church seriously 
thomas malcolm muggeridge was born into a lower middleclass 
family and reared in south london his father henry a clerk in a 
shirtmaking firm was a lifelong socialist and for two years a 
labor party member of parliament 
after attending state schools muggeridge went to cambridge 
university and soon dropped his fathers socialist views 
he was mainly a freelance journalist but also held highpowered 
staff jobs such as the deputy editorship of britains conservative 
daily telegraph and editorship of the satirical magazine punch 
life holds no more wretched occupation than trying to make the 
english laugh was his verdict on punch 
the best thing about being a journalist he once said was the 
opportunity for contact with the eminent without being under the 
necessity to admire them or take them seriously 
winston churchill was a disaster he failed to notice the 
british empire was over and john f kennedy was a fraud but 
ronald reagan was not such a fool as people say 
he saw western civilization as doomed the inevitability of 
death as the most interesting aspect of life and life itself as an 
adventure mystery and for anyone of any sensitivity a 
disappointment 
human life i have come to feel in all its public or 
collective manifestations is only theater and mostly cheap 
melodrama at that he concluded 
there is nothing serious under the sun except love of 
fellowmortals and of god

scientists tested a nuclear weapon today after 
security guards removed four protesters from the remote desert 
site 
department of energy officials spotted the protesters near 
ground zero minutes before they planned to detonate the weapon the 
test was delayed while the protesters were taken from the site 105 
miles northwest of las vegas 
the test controllers are obviously glad that it went and went 
without any prolonged delayes because of the infiltrators said 
energy department spokesman jim boyer said after the 1117 am est 
test 
city hall workers in downtown las vegas said the 10story 
building shook slightly boyer at a control point 30 miles from 
ground zero said he felt a slight rolling motion 
the protesters were arrested and taken to a base camp at 
mercury nev they were to be turned over to nye county 
authorities 
earlier today the environmental group greenpeace said four 
people had reached ground zero this morning in an attempt to halt 
the test of the british nuclear weapon the energy department 
initially disputed the claim 
the test scheduled for 9 am was delayed several times in the 
final 30 minutes of the countdown because of technical 
difficulties boyer said 
the four protesters were spotted by video cameras trained on the 
site as the countdown was about to resume with six minutes 
remaining 
the four three british woman and an american man reached the 
area shortly after dawn said junior bridge a spokeswoman for 
greenpeace she said one had made contact with a security guard 
there 
energy department spokesman chris west had disputed the report 
saying there was no one at ground zero except the scientists who 
arm the device 
the nuclear device is buried 1900 feet deep in a shaft filled 
with concrete ground zero is the ground level spot above where the 
underground explosion takes place 
they could damn near be on top of it and it would just shake 
them up a lot boyer said of possible intruders 
west has said that someone standing on ground zero could receive 
a jolt from the upward blast strong enough to break a leg 
the device was expected to produce an explosive force of 20 
kilotons to 150 kilotons of tnt the atomic bomb that destroyed 
hiroshima had the force of 13 kilotons 
bridge identified the british protesters as juley howard 23 
jane gregory 27 and lorna richardson 25 all of london she said 
michael perry 27 of the rocky mountain peace center was also 
with the group all british nuclear tests are conducted in nevada 
britain has conducted 17 nuclear tests in nevada since 1958 
bridge who identified herself as nuclear weapons program 
coordinator for greenpeace from washington dc said the women 
were taken sunday by jeep to a point 20 miles from ground zero 
the test site covers 1350 square miles of rugged desert 
terrain an area larger than the state of rhode island 
antinuclear activists have hiked onto the site several times in 
recent years in most cases the intruders have been arrested by 
security forces who patrol by helicopter airplane and allterrain 
vehicles 
the department once launched extensive searches when activists 
began penetrating in the id1980s they dropped the policy in 1986 
as too costly 
department officials say an infiltrator reached ground zero only 
once two years ago a man appeared near a detonation site just 
minutes before a blast the test was delayed an hour until the man 
was picked up by helicopter 
todays test was the eighth this year at the nevada site and the 
707th since testing began there in 1951 the last test was oct 12

congressional investigators said wednesday the 
tiltrotor v22 osprey a plane legislators told the pentagon to 
build over its objections is too heavy and vibrated excessively in 
early tests 
the general accounting office said its impossible to know at 
this point whether the osprey which takes off like a helicopter 
but flies like a plane will be ready for production in 1992 as 
scheduled 
the agency expressed concern that the aircraft would be in 
production at the same time it was being tested 
however the manufacturers of the osprey bell helicopter 
textron inc and boeing helicopter co said the program is 
ready to move forward the production and testing schedule dont 
pose a high risk they said 
defense secretary dick cheney has said in his last two budget 
proposals that the osprey should be canceled arguing that a mix of 
conventional helicopters would be a cheaper alternative to the 23 
million aircraft 
widespread support in congress especially in texas and 
pennsylvania where the aircraft is being built saved the osprey 
from the budget ax 
president bush earlier this month signed a military spending 
bill for the fiscal year that began oct 1 that bill included 238 
million in research money for the v22 and 165 million in 
production funds 
the provisions added by congress also called for freeing 200 
million for the program that had been included in the fiscal 1989 
defense bill 
rep bill dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the house 
armed services committee released the oct 12 study by the gao 
the investigative arm of congress 
the defense department largely concurred with the gao findings 
and in a letter to dickinson deputy secretary of defense donald 
atwood reiterated that the department doesnt consider the program 
affordable 
the gao found that early tests identified unacceptable vibration 
during flight the contractor designed a vibration reduction 
package that has not yet been tested 
as of aug 3 the agency said the v22 was expected to be about 
2822 pounds over the required weight the contractor expects to 
eliminate about 1600 pounds during production leaving about 1200 
pounds of excess weight 
and the gao reported that as of aug 8 about 86 deficiencies 
had been found during the first phase of government flight testing 
including 33 that were deemed as adversely affecting airworthiness 
crew effectiveness or safety among other problems 
rep curt weldon rpa a member of the house armed services 
committee and a proponent of the aircraft that is built in his home 
state said flight testing of the osprey has proceeded without any 
major problems and should continue 
while our marines are training in the sands of saudi arabia 
we on capitol hill are discussing whether or not to provide them 
with stateoftheart equipment he said

five us lawmakers warned chinese leaders on 
wednesday that china could still lose its preferential trade status 
if its human rights record does not improve delegation members 
said 
we were trying to make the point with them that it was very 
important how they handle the human rights issue rep jim 
lightfoot riowa said at a news conference he did not say how 
the chinese officials responded 
the five lawmakers made up the first congressional delegation to 
visit beijing since june 1989 when chinese troops opened fire on 
prodemocracy demonstrators killing hundreds and possibly 
thousands of people us sen warren rudman of new hampshire 
visited in aug 1989 
they spoke on a day when china was savoring its role as host to 
three visiting heads of state or government its busiest day of 
diplomatic activity in more than a year of semiisolation 
indonesian president suharto argentine president carlos menem 
and thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan flew to beijing after 
attending the enthronement of japanese emperor akihito in tokyo 
indonesia argentina and thailand were not vocal critics of 
chinas crackdown and did not take part in the western boycott of 
highlevel contacts with beijing their visits thus were not a 
break with past policy 
but they came at a time when western countries as well are 
healing their breach with china the european community decided 
last month to end most of its sanctions against china including 
its ban on highlevel visits and the united states has been 
gradually dismantling its sanctions 
however the us congressional visit was not publicized until 
the official chinese media reported on it and the us embassy at 
first refused to provide information about the delegation 
the congressmen said their mission was to stress to chinese 
leaders that the key to improved bilateral relations was the 
resolution of human rights problems in particular they said china 
should resolve the fate of the several hundred people still 
imprisoned without trial for their participation in the democracy 
protests 
the incident that occurred in june of last year has not been 
forgotten said rep michael g oxley rohio many of us 
wanted to express in person our outrage 
the group also included reps e clay shaw a republican from 
florida george w darden a democrat from georgia and rep john 
j rhodes iii an arizona republican 
bilateral trade dominated their talks with premier li peng and 
other leaders who initiated discussions about chinas mostfavored 
nation trade status they said 
the united states granted china the preferential treatment a 
decade ago substantially lowering tariffs on chinese products 
president bush renewed the status last may despite public pressure 
to punish beijing the house of representatives has tried to 
reverse bushs decision or to link the status with human rights 
improvements 
rhodes said that after their meetings chinese leaders realized 
congress will look for a final resolution of last years 
crackdown when considering the future of bilateral trade 
that means they make a final determination of the fate of 
those who are still in captivity rhodes said we made that 
point over and over again 
authorities say 355 people remain jailed and under investigation 
in beijing but they refuse to say how many others have been 
sentenced or what the figures are nationwide 
some of the lawmakers said they thought li indicated the cases 
of jailed dissidents would be resolved quickly but others in the 
delegation disputed that interpretation no one was able to quote 
the premier 
the lawmakers also discussed the crisis in the persian gulf with 
chinese leaders but said they had no indication how china would 
vote on a un resolution endorsing the use of force to compel iraq 
to withdraw from kuwait

gov stan stephens called out the 
national guard today to help firefighters battle a fire that 
threatened homes hunters and ranches along the missouri river 
at least 30 homes were evacuated and a dozen hunters jumped into 
a creek to avoid getting burned as the 30000acre blaze raged 
uncontrolled though steep timber small canyons and grassland near 
the river in western montana 
people that have been around fires for 30 years have told me 
this is the most unusal thing they have ever seen said dennis 
casey commissioner of state lands theres so many hunters in 
there and it happened so quickly 
no injuries were reported but officials said they were 
concerned about hunters in the area which is a popular hunting 
spot for deer elk and bear 
the fire began tuesday night in two areas of the stateowned 
beartooth game management range north of helena fire officials 
said recordhigh temperatures extremely dry conditions for 
midnovember and high wind contributed to the fires rapid spread 
bob lasalle one of about two dozen hunters who fled the fire 
said a hunter in another camp told him the fire started from a 
spark from a cookstove 
the cinders were falling on us said lynn dumas of big

enough time to saddle a horse when we left we could feel the 
heat

winstonsalem nc ap a woman who prosecutors said 
spoonfed her boyfriend homecooked food laced with aroo travelers with 
an aggressive marketing campaign that includes heavily discounted 
seats for vacationers and firstclass upgrades for anyone paying 
full coach fare 
easterns traffic figures show more passengers are flying the 
airline but its still confronting enormous obstacles besides 
angry creditors and a debt exceeding 1 billion 
perhaps the most critical immediate problem is fuel expenses 
which have nearly doubled since the iraqi invasion of kuwait aug 
2 because eastern is so weak financially the impact of that 
unforeseen cost increase has hurt eastern more severely than many 
of its rivals 
as easterns fate was being determined in liflands court 
travel agents expressed mixed views on the wisdom of purchasing its 
tickets some were advising customers that it might be better to 
make reservations with other carriers 
we have warned them definitely that the bankruptcy judge could 
close them down said william cooper president of adventure 
travels in pompano beach fla the problem is that most of the 
people have bought their tickets for the thanksgiving or christmas 
holidays in advance 
cooper doubts easterns competitors would have any incentive to 
offer good deals to any travelers who might get stuck with 
worthless eastern tickets people who bought early tickets at 
cheaper fares might wind up shelling out more cash for expensive 
tickets bought close to their departure dates he said 
some of the other carriers may say hey why are we going to 
give special promotional fares cooper said 
at jbs world travel in new york owner jack bloch had a 
different view 
the farreaching thing of eastern going under wouldnt affect 
most people bloch said the fare loads on all the carriers are 
very light the flights are wide open i would think most of the 
carriers would allow people to fly standby 
several hours before eastern and the creditors had their court 
date bloch said he would have no qualms about selling eastern 
tickets

germany and poland signed a treaty 
wednesday under which germany permanently surrendered its claim to 
40000 square miles of territory lost in world war ii about 
onethird of presentday poland 
the pact signed by foreign ministers hansdietrich genscher for 
germany and krzysztof skubiszewski for poland ended one of the 
most intractable diplomatic disputes of the postwar era 
although the treaty has long been one of polands chief foreign 
policy goals polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki avoided 
conveying any sense of triumph at the signing ceremony 
he instead stressed sympathy for the tragedy of millions of 
germans roughly expelled from their former homeland at the end of 
the war 
by recognizing the border on the oder and neisse rivers germany 
gives up any claims to historically german lands in pomerania 
silesia and east prussia now populated mainly by poles 
the victorious allies turned over the land to poland in 1945 to 
make up for an even greater expanse of polish territory taken in 
the east by the soviet union 
as a price for international consent to reunification this year 
germany agreed to make the border permanent 
the decision we have made is not an easy one for us 
germans for any of us including myself genscher said after 
signing the treaty and for those who have lost their home lands 
who suffered expulsion it is an especially painful one 
the 2page treaty called for building a peaceful european 
order in which borders will not divide 
the germans are not forwarding any territorial demands and 
will not forward any in the future genscher said 
because the frontier is now safe poles and germans can put 
aside mistrust and meet on a new footing he said he 
repeated a promise to lift the visa requirement for visiting poles 
by years end 
i am glad we have this stage behind us said solidarity 
leader lech walesa the frontrunning candidate in this months 
presidential election who met with genscher lets lift visas 
and other obstacles and there will be no problems 
mazowiecki took pains to address german concerns in what 
appeared to be the strongest apology ever made by a polish 
statesman to those who lost their homes 
the suffering of the german nation must be spoken about he 
said every harm remains a harm every tragedy remains a tragedy 
irrespective of the harms and tragedies that we ourselves 
experienced 
johann kroll a leader of the polish german minority present at 
the signing said the treaty does not create too much joy for 
us 
however it is necessary he said the present borders 
we consider to be temporary because we count on the fact that 
borders will vanish in the common europe 
kroll was referring to efforts by the european community to 
achieve greater unity among european nations 
under a timetable agreed to by kohl and mazowiecki the border 
treaty will be ratified by the end of february by parliaments of 
both countries 
meanwhile a broader friendship treaty is to be prepared for 
ratification at the same time the pact will contain assurances of 
minority rights for the up to 1 million ethnic german citizens of 
poland 
the polishgerman border was defined at postdam in august 1945 
by the soviet union britain and the united states by that time 
the soviets had installed an obedient government in poland and were 
occupying eastern germany 
after the germans were deported millions more poles from the 
east moved into the new territory from homes that had fallen within 
the expanded borders of the soviet union names of towns were 
changed to polish and monuments and other signs of the areas 
german past were removed 
by putting the border so deep in former german territory soviet 
leader josef stalin partly compensated the poles for his own land 
seizures punished germany for the war and bound poland to moscow 
as the ultimate guarantor of its western frontier 
communist east germany recognized the oderneisse line in 1950 
and west germany disavowed any territorial claims in 1970 but 
conservatives and politically influential associations of expelled 
germans pressed for decades to regain all or part of germanys lost 
territories

the government said wednesday it is lifting 
controls on the prices of luxury goods in an effort to encourage 
production only hours later russias parliament declared the 
decree void in the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
the move by the russian federation set up the latest struggle in 
the war between the central soviet and russian governments it 
demonstrated the fragmentation and confusion plaguing the soviet 
union as the base of power moves from the kremlin to the republics 
the battle began with a decree by the national council of 
ministers that prices would be freed on goods of no essential 
influence on peoples living standards such as jewelry 
furniture and american cigarettes 
it marked the first time in decades that the government has 
completely freed an entire range of retail prices to respond to the 
market forces of supply and demand 
floating prices is an important element in the governments 
outline for converting the soviet union from a centrally planned 
economy in which the government sets all prices often regardless 
of the cost of production to a free market economy 
the councils decree applied to some of the items most in 
demand their prices have been fixed but in fact many of the goods 
are sold above the official price by corrupt store employees who 
sell them truckers who deliver them and factory workers who make 
them 
shoppers have to wait as long as 10 years to receive furniture 
at the official price but can get it immediately if they are 
willing to pay three times that rate 
other goods covered by the decree which was released by the 
tass news agency are natural furs carpets hightech 
electronics cut glassware china spare car parts and imports such 
as whiskey gin and american cigarettes certain meat products and 
fish delicacies are also included 
to prevent panic buying like that which preceded a round of 
price hikes planned for july 1 and later canceled the 
government announced the action just one day before it was to take 
effect on thursday 
the government said freeing prices would provide extra 
incentives to increase the production of consumer goods and 
saturate the market it also said the measure would undermine the 
black market for the items 
the decree drew immediate criticism 
i consider it pointless radical legislator gennady filshin 
told the russian federations parliament an account of his remarks 
by the independent news agency interfax did not report his reasons 
for opposing the move 
the russian council of ministers in its retaliation said the 
national decree has no force on russian territory and forbade sale 
of the affected goods until further notice it said wine vodka and 
tobacco goods would continue to be sold at current statefixed 
prices 
it ordered an inventory of the affected goods to be conducted 
for the purpose of preserving them and said local government 
leaders would be held personally responsible for the results 
even a member of the national council of ministers which 
adopted the decree criticized it 
deputy prime minister stepan sitaryan said there would be many 
bruises he predicted that prices of the goods affected would 
double and that there would be a chain reaction that would drive 
up the prices of other goods he said some businesses might 
intentionally decrease production to drive up prices artificially 
so they can get a higher profit 
many of these problems he said could have been avoided if 
prices were freed simultaneously with a move to privatize 
businesses and end the state monopoly of the economy 
as the old central planning system collapses hidden inflation 
and hoarding have exacerbated many perennial shortages and created 
new ones 
soviets have been hoarding anything with lasting value 
including many of the goods whose prices are being raised in the 
decree 
many people are particularly worried about the coming winter a 
public opinion poll published in an edition of the weekly moscow 
news released wednesday said 62 percent of those questioned fear 
hunger in the next few months twentysix percent had no fear and 
12 percent did not know 
the poll conducted by the allunion center of study of public 
opinion did not give a margin of error 
an accompanying open letter by a group of prominent politicians 
and economists said the government should head off difficulties 
this winter by opening strategic reserves saved in the event of 
war 
the country is slipping into an abyss a civil war they 
warned unless a number of urgent decisive measures are taken a 
tragedy will be inevitable

the 1973 war powers act requires that the 
president consult with congress formally when us forces are 
introduced into hostilities or into situations where imminent 
involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the 
circumstances 
notification also is required when combatequipped troops are 
sent to the territory of any foreign nation 
the notification must include the presidents explanation of why 
the move is necessary and the estimated scope and duration of the 
deployment 
the law requires that the president terminate the military 
deployment within 60 days unless congress has specifically 
authorized its continuation the 60day period can be extended to 
90 days if the president certifies that such a move is an 
unavoidable military necessity 
administrations regard the act as an unconstitutional 
infringement by congress on the presidents powers as 
commanderinchief of the armed forces rather than tackle the 
issue headon however notification usually is given in a way that 
congress regards as compliance with the law

from gatherings of quakers 
here at the nations biggest air force reserve base to 
demonstrations at californias venerable presidio signs of protest 
are growing along with the threat of war 
eighteen demonstrators were arrested tuesday for investigation 
of trespassing and malicious mischief after a group of activists 
protesting the american military presence in the middle east 
occupied the rotc building at the university of california 
berkeley 
while many americans support the buildup in the persian gulf 
others say they worry the country is repeating the mistakes of 
vietnam 
i dont think theres a clear recognition of the cost the 
human cost of going to war said paul wright a former war 
protester and an editor at the university of massachusetts press 
he has a son stationed with the marines in the gulf 
protesters have marched in fargo nd held peace vigils in new 
haven conn and poured oil and simulated blood over a mound of 
sand in front of san franciscos presidio an army base since 1846 
quakers and buddhist monks have been gathering at the gates of 
westover since august their numbers growing from two or three to 
about 50 on monday 
i think as long as the president is beating the war drums and 
not wanting to have a full discussion of this in congress people 
are getting angrier and angrier frances crow a 71yearold 
quaker said tuesday 
much of the concern seems to focus on how congress has not voted 
on the military action 
im concerned that were starting to make that leap of faith 
from supporting our troops to supporting this policy of the 
president said dean r kahler who was paralyzed after being 
shot at the kent state demonstration of 1970 
now a county commissioner in athens ohio kahler echoed calls 
for congress to reconvene i think its important that congress 
exercise its responsibility and not duck it he said i think 
they ducked it in the vietnam era 
last weeks decision to send up to 200000 more troops to the 
gulf seemed to have raised concern that the united states is trying 
to assume anew the role of world policeman said marty linsky a 
lecturer in public policy at harvards kennedy school of 
government 
as in the vietnam era much of the protest is studentbased 
from the sporadic demonstrations at berkeley to a peace vigil at 
yale university on sunday fifteen of those arrested in berkeley 
were students 
but unlike the 1960s many of the demonstrators are veterans 
themselves gis who felt the ignominy of fighting in an unpopular 
war 
im afraid theyre going to go to war and going to kill a 
bunch of good young men for really nothing said leonard 
lavender a korean war veteran who participated in sundays 
veterans day observance in bozeman mont 
waitll they start sending gungho women back in body bags 
lavender said 
on the other side of the issue several support groups are 
launching letterwriting and gift campaigns 
a group in minneapolis plans to collect 10000 pounds of gifts 
to us troops in the gulf some of them dont have any family 
roberta nathe of new hope said were going to be their adopted 
family 
in arizona operation santa claus will send gifts to soldiers 
deployed from fort huachuca an army base in sierra vista 
there are about 230000 us troops in and around saudi arabia 
and an up to 200000 more are expected 
i wish theyd go ahead and do it and get it over with said 
rosa lee who owns a record and video store in camden sc 
gen william c westmoreland of charleston sc commander in 
vietnam said he believes the united states is not ready for 
battle 
but we are moving into the position to be prepared he said

cigarettes increase smokers pain tolerance and 
could therefore block the chest pains that serve as a warning for 
heart disease researchers said wednesday 
in studies with 20 male smokers ages 19 to 44 the researchers 
found that the tolerance to pain increased with each of three 
cigarettes smoked 
the study presented at the annual meeting of the amerian heart 
association was conducted by asking the smokers to keep away from 
cigarettes for 12 hours and then smoke three cigarettes at timed 
intervals a hot probe was touched to their arms after each 
cigarette and warmed until it reached the threshhold temperature 
that produced pain said dr paula miller of the university of 
north carolina school of medicine the principal author of the 
study 
a statistically significant rise in the temperatures the men 
could tolerate occurred after they smoked the cigarettes she said 
we have a lot of confidence in our findings because the 
responses were so consistent said the senior author of the 
study dr david sheps also of the university of north carolina 
almost every man showed increases in threshhold and tolerance 
temperatures immediately after smoking a cigarette he said 
smokers are known to have a higher prevalence of what is called 
silent ischemia said miller 
silent ischemia occurs when blood flow to the heart is briefly 
interrupted because of the buildup of fatty deposits and 
cholesterol in the arteries that nourish the heart 
in many people ischemia produces the chest pain known as 
angina which is an indicator of heart disease in silent ischemia 
however there is no pain to call attention to the underlying heart 
disease 
miller has been trying to understand why silent ischemia occurs 
and she said that the painmasking effects of smoking might explain 
why it is more common in smokers 
in another study she showed that the naturally occuring 
painrelieving substances called endorphins also may help mask the 
pain associated with ischemia 
people whose bodies naturally produce more endorphins may be 
more likely to suffer from silent ischemia she said 
the american heart association estimates that 2 million 
americans suffer from angina as many as 3 million or 4 million 
americans may suffer from silent ischemia the heart association 
estimates

virginia gov doug wilder lambasted president 
bushs fiscal and civil rights policies wednesday and all but 
declared himself the ideal democratic nominee to take on bush in 
1992 
wilder speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the conservative 
national review magazine depicted himself as far more fiscally 
conservative than bush and said the democrats must nominate such a 
person to regain the white house 
the virginia governor the first black to be elected head of any 
state also tied bush to sen jesse helms rnc and said the two 
had reduced gop conservatism to false symbolism and intimidation 
tactics 
wilders associates have formed a political action committee the 
governor says is designed to aid fiscally responsible candidates 
the pac could be turned into a wilder presidential committee if he 
declared his candidacy 
sounding themes that could easily become campaign slogans 
wilder said the bushhelms axis represents the new extremism as 
opposed to his own new mainstream 
the new mainstream brings people together while the new 
extremism pulls americans apart he said the new extremism 
spouts mighty rhetoric about fiscal responsibility and balanced 
budgets but then embraces a trillion dollar federal debt and 
skyhigh taxes on middle america and forgotten america 
wilder said bush demonstrated a willingness to mortgage the 
moral authority of the white house by vetoing the 1990 civil 
rights bill and aligning himself with helms 
he needed something to hold his 1988 coalition together and 
the senator needed something anything to hold on to his seat in 
washington wilder said 
this years civil rights act was designed to restore broad job 
protections for women and minorities that had been eroded by 
several recent supreme court decisions bush said he vetoed the 
bill because it would have led to hiring quotas 
participants in a panel before wilder spoke notably former new 
york mayor ed koch said the bill surely would have led to quotas 
they also said the gop has a central and winning issue in the 
affirmative action question at least until democrats rethink their 
position 
proponents of the civil rights bill vehemently deny it would 
lead to quotas 
wilder accused bush of falsely raising that specter and laying 
the groundwork for a devastating helms ad against his black 
democratic opponent harvey gantt in the closing days of the 
campaign 
as one who has had some real experience with real racial quota 
laws let me say that the civil rights act of 1990 is not one of 
those laws wilder said 
turning to economic matters wilder charged the reagan and bush 
administrations with tripling the national debt decimating the 
dollar and creating structural deficits that are still out of 
control 
by contrast he cited his own record of spending cuts and 
reordered priorities in virginia 
he then described his vision of a victorious 1992 democratic 
presidential nominee a candidate with proven fiscal management 
credentials a candidate able and willing to make the tough choices 
at home and abroad 
asked his views on the persian gulf wilder said he had been 
encouraging bush to better explain why the united states is in the 
middle east what it hopes to accomplish there and what further 
help it expects to get from allies 
i support the presidents positions the question is where 
are we going from here he said echoing a common democratic 
view 
wilder sounded less like his party brethren and more like helms 
when he was asked about the controversy involving the national 
endowment for the arts 
there is no constitutionally protected right to obscenity 
he said funding for the arts is one thing funding for obscenity 
is another

consumers have plenty of turkeys for this 
thanksgiving and more are on the way next year the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
an outlook report said stockpiles of frozen turkeys sept 30 
were at nearrecord levels up 8 percent from a year ago and 
production in the octoberdecember quarter is forecast to be up 5 
percent 
further the report said 1991 turkey output is expected to rise 
6 percent from this year compared with a 1990 increase of 9 
percent 
retail prices are averaging slightly higher than a year ago 
said larry witucki of the departments economic research service 
its hard to predict exactly because we dont know what the 
retailers special strategy will be in any particular year he 
said 
in the last quarter of 1989 retail prices of whole turkeys 
nationally averaged about 96 cents per pound witucki said 
about all i can say is that its another year of ample 
supplies in stores at reasonable prices but those may be a 
little higher he said 
supermarkets in the washington dc area are offering specials 
on whole turkeys this week at prices ranging from 66 cents to 89 
cents per pound 
the 1990 turkey crop will total more than 281 million birds and 
produce an estimated 47 billion pounds of turkey meat witucki 
said not all of it will be sold as whole birds 
processors have developed many ways of selling turkeys 
including turkey luncheon meats turkey ham and turkey sausage and 
there are the turkey parts such as breasts drumsticks and thighs 
for those not wanting whole birds or certain kinds of meat 
that has helped make turkey an item throughout the year not 
just during the holiday season in the fall 
about 35 percent of the turkey business still occurs in the last 
three months of the year witucki said in 1960 almost 60 percent 
of the annual total came in the fourth quarter 
projections by usda show per capita turkey consumption this year 
may average a record 183 pounds retail weight up from an average 
of 171 pounds per person in 1989 it could rise to 193 pounds in 
1991 
total poultry consumption is projected by usda at 90 pounds per 
person this year rising to 947 in 1991 broilers lead the pack 
with 696 pounds in 1990 and 733 pounds in 1991 
red meat consumption is estimated at 1304 pounds per person in 
1990 rising to 132 pounds next year beef is the leader at 678 
pounds and will remain at about that level in 1991 according to 
the department pork at 601 pounds is projected at 617 in 1991 
the usda report said hams are in shorter supply this season 
with sept 30 inventories down 22 percent from a year earlier 
wholesale ham prices rose to more than 1 per pound in late 
september but have not exhibited the typical strong seasonal 
upward pattern this fall the report said

several new jersey public housing commissions 
ignored housing authority executives who drew excessive salaries 
and wasted federal money according to a report wednesday by the 
department of housing and urban development 
new jersey was cited for the most egregious abuses in the 
report which included 17 recommendations for the more than 3100 
public housing authorities nationwide said joseph g schiff 
assistant secretary for public and indian housing 
i dont think theres anything of the depth in new jersey 
elsewhere in the united states said schiff 
the report also included reviews of housing authorities in 
atchison kan bremerton wash montgomery ala san bernardino 
calif santa fe nm stamford conn york pa and youngstown 
ohio 
schiff said housing secretary jack kemp on wednesday sent 
letters to chairmen of all public housing boards asking them to 
give poor tenants a bigger role in housing management he also 
wrote to mayors city councils and governors who appoint housing 
officials outlining the type of experience housing board members 
should have 
it is quite apparent that some executive directors and 
commissioners in new jersey have treated their phas as private 
kingdoms to the ultimate detriment of the residents and the 
american taxpayer wrote schiff chairman of a special new jersey 
strike force created by housing secretary jack kemp 
youve got isolated instances that just blow me away that im 
confident are not common practice schiff said 
kemp created the strike force on jan 22 after the discovery of 
more than 17 million misappropriated by the passaic nj 
housing authority including multiple salaries paid to paul a 
marguglio the executive director he and other executives 
subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges including 
conspiracy perjury and tax evasion 
the report found that many commissioners believing hud 
officials would advise them of problems within their authorities 
merely rubberstamped activities by their executive directors 
the task force found problems ranging from contracts assigned 
without competitive bidding and salaries paid without records of 
hours worked to cost overruns and excessive travel 
among the wasteful practices chronicled were 
the irvington nj housing authority purchased a 26290 
automobile and paid a consultant 1570 in connection with the 
purchase when the authority already had leased another car of the 
same model the agency also had three pickup trucks available for 
staff use although all of the authoritys units are within walking 
distance of the administrative offices 
the north bergen housing authority paid 12600 for meals and 
drinks of board members and authority members before during and 
after commission meetings from aug 22 1988 to jan 18 1990 
the report recommends 
tighter hud guidelines on salaries and administrative costs 
a departmental policy to restrict the hiring of relatives for 
example reviewers found 22 related employees at the housing 
authority of north bergen 
a review of methods for auditing the housing agencies 
guidelines for legal services contracts 
losses from hud abuses and mismanagement during the reagan 
administration may cost taxpayers up to 2 billion a 
courtappointed special prosecutor is now investigating former 
secretary samuel pierce and other former hud officials

arizonans arent sure who their governor will be 
in january or even when theyll get a permanent head of a ship of 
state buffeted since 1985 by presidential ambitions political 
beheadings and personal indecision 
there may be more storms on the horizon 
rudderless house minority leader art hamilton asked with a 
smile we certainly have a rudder it just seems at times that 
its broken and thats why were going around in circles 
hamilton is the only lawmaker still in the same leadership post 
he had in 1986 by january the only other ongoing statelevel 
political leader attorney general bob corbin will be gone as well 
to retirement 
a political vacuum isnt the states only problem 
the states business elite has crumbled led by the collapse of 
financierdeveloper charles keating jrs empire savings and loan 
failures and financial troubles besetting such major companies as 
convenience store giant circle k and electricity producer arizona 
public service co 
the sports establishment also is reeling as the national 
football league and fiesta bowl try to deal with voter rejection of 
a paid state holiday honoring martin luther king jr the nfl is 
threatening to take away the 1993 super bowl and the fiesta bowl 
spoke briefly of leaving as well 
the states lameduck legislature is trying to write rules this 
week and next for a gubernatorial runoff early next year between 
republican fife symington and democrat terry goddard 
democratic gov rose mofford a caretaker elevated when 
republican gov evan mecham was impeached in 1988 after a 
particularly stormy period may stay on past the jan 7 end of her 
term or she may turn over the reins to fellow democrat dick 
mahoney elected last week to his first term as secretary of state 
arizonas equivalent of a lieutenant governor 
mofford first said she intended to run for a full term but 
then after mecham had set off a storm by making a bid for 
reelection she added to the turmoil by changing her mind she has 
been criticized for her lack of decision and described as the 
stealth governor for her low profile and lack of programs 
symington beat goddard 497 percent to 493 percent last week 
but the writein candidacy of a mecham lieutenant deprived him of 
the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff under a previously 
untested constitutional amendment inspired by mechams surprise 
election 
though voters approved the amendment lawmakers did nothing to 
say how it should work 
even if the lameduck lawmakers agree on a runoff for late 
january or february and overcome a court challenge filed by 
symington supporters theres more turbulence ahead when the new 
legislature convenes in early january and faces a 300 million 
deficit 
after more than a decade in which republicans controlled both 
legislative chambers voters last week gave democrats a 1713 edge 
in the senate while leaving republicans in charge of the house 
3327 
we could be facing legislative paralysis at the start of the 
year without any executive leadership said dana larsen 
executive director of arizona common cause 
the states political sea began getting choppy in 1985 when 
gov bruce babbitt a democrat began running for president and 
pushed for a king holiday in a state where blacks are only 3 
percent of the population 
frustrated by repeated lack of legislative action babbitt 
proclaimed a paid king holiday for executivebranch employees 
corbin issued a nonbinding opinion that the proclamation was 
illegal saying only the legislature could establish paid state 
holidays 
mecham a perennial political outsider who won a threeway race 
against two establishment favorites to succeed babbitt rescinded 
babbitts proclamation and was hit with a wave of entertainment and 
convention boycotts 
the protests mounted when mecham defended use of the word 
pickaninny and made remarks that offended other ethnic groups 
mecham later proclaimed an unpaid king holiday which remains in 
effect but is scorned by supporters of the paid holiday it came 
too late by april 1988 he was impeached and ousted 
mecham supporters took their revenge at the polls that fall 
ousting the senate president house speaker and several others who 
had voted for impeachment symington beat mecham in a gop primary 
comeback bid last september but mechams chief lieutenant running 
as a writein in the general election cost him the majority 
against goddard

americas top census taker said tuesday the 
1990 count is on schedule despite a sweeping recanvass ordered 
after thousands of cities complained that some of their residents 
had been skipped 
census operations are substantially on schedule and we do not 
anticipate any delays census director barbara everitt bryant 
told a house panel 
the final count will be delivered to president bush by years 
end as required by law and he will have the privilege of announcing 
the number that will be cited as americas population for much of 
the decade 
bryant declined to give any preview of the number saying that 
was up to the president and added that more information was needed 
to make a judgment on the accuracy of the census 
it is too early to conclude anything about the coverage 
accuracy of the 1990 census she said she said a clearer picture 
would emerge in the months ahead as the numbers are refined and 
analyzed 
the bureau is reviewing 5 million housing units in response to 
complaints from cities and 15 million as part of its own 
postenumeration survey designed to check the accuracy of the 
census the resulting recanvass will affect 20 percent of the 
nations housing units 
bryant said the bureau is now wrapping up the final portions of 
this survey in philadelphia lansing mich and buffalo ny 
documented challenges to the preliminary count have been 
presented by 6602 or 166 percent of 39189 local governments 
bryant said she said 2262 gave favorable responses to their 
surveys 
challenges however came from all of the 51 largest cities 
twentytwo of them challenged fewer than 100 blocks 34 fewer than 
500 blocks but counts of more than 2000 blocks were challenged by 
eight cities atlanta boston chicago detroit honolulu los 
angeles new york and philadelphia 
in the census a decade ago 6500 governments presented such 
challenges but only 2500 could provide documentation she said 
this time 7600 challenged and 6600 provided documentation we 
could check she said 
this does not mean that the 1990 census has poorer coverage 
she said she said the governments were better prepared and 
motivated than in the past 
were taking everything they did very seriously she told 
reporters after the hearing but she said that in some cases cities 
were using just any kind of definition they could come up with 
she said both the census bureau and some cities had made 
geocoding errors involving the location of housing units in 
other cases she said mistakes were based on obsolete data 
she said substantial inaccuracy rates were found in chicago and 
part of new jersey and there was evidence that information had been 
falsified but she said the inaccuracies had little impact on the 
count 
in one case she said new york officials claimed that 414 
housing units had been omitted in queens but the tract was located 
within the gateway national seashore 
all we could find were three lifeguard benches she said

the nations of nato and the warsaw pact 
will officially declare an end to their military rivalry in a 
special statement drawn up for signing next week sources said 
wednesday 
the two pacts are saying were going to put the cold war 
behind us and were looking at ways to improve our relations 
said a western diplomat who demanded anonymity 
we have a document that basically focuses on ending the 
kind of conflict inherent if not real between these countries 
said a nato official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
lastminute details were still being worked on in vienna to 
polish the 2page nonaggression statement 
but officials said it would be finished in time for signing on 
monday in paris by the leaders of the 16 nations of the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the remaining six of the crumbling 
warsaw pact 
the declaration however will be overshadowed by the completion 
of the conventional forces in europe treaty a historic agreement 
designed to slash tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arms in 
europe 
the arms accord also was expected to be signed on monday 
shortly before the opening of a summit of the 34 nations of the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe or csce the 
gathering will bring together the leaders of the united states 
canada and 32 european nations all but albania 
the less dramatic but also important nonaggression statement 
will end decades of hostility between the 41yearold nato and the 
warsaw pact which was set up by moscow in 1955 
the document according to sources was expected to say that a 
new era of european relations is beginning and that the nations 
are no longer adversaries 
they will promise to work to together to build new 
partnerships and extend the hand of friendship according to 
the sources and they will pledge to refrain from the threat or 
use of force against each other 
the statement will welcome new diplomatic contacts between the 
western alliance and the east european countries since august the 
soviet union and east european nations have tapped diplomats in 
belgium to be their liaison with nato 
mention also will be made of arms reductions in europe and 
upcoming negotiations between the united states and the soviet 
union to trim shortrange nuclear weapons also in europe 
the dozen european nations which are attending the csce summit 
in paris but are not part of either military alliance will be 
invited to sign the agreement officials said 
at a july summit in london president bush and other leaders of 
the nato nations proposed drawing up a nonaggression pact between 
the alliances 
the kremlin earlier in the year had raised the possibility of a 
joint warsaw pactnato declaration 
western officials were initially skeptical of soviet motives 
worrying that such a document would give life to the dying eastern 
alliance some east european countries were said to be reluctant to 
do anything to preserve the pact 
but western diplomats also wanted to ease soviet fears o 
becoming isolated militarily as its oncestaunch allies in the east 
moved closer to the west 
the resulting statement according to the nato official 
reflects the mix of those two things the express soviet desire 
which we knew had a hook in it but at the same time a western 
interest in trying to do something for the soviets 
so the formula we came up was the willingness to develop a 
document that would basically end the cold war and would be signed 
by the countries of nato and the warsaw pact but as countries and 
not as members of the pact he said 
no promises were made of further natowarsaw pact contacts 
its a declaration of the end of the bloctobloc approach 
said the nato source 
countries still in the warsaw pact are the soviet union poland 
hungary czechoslovakia romania and bulgaria east germany dropped 
out when it merged with west germany which belongs to nato 
hungary already has said it plans to pull out of the warsaw 
pacts military arm next year western officials say alliance 
support also is weak in poland and czechoslovakia 
nato members are the united states canada britain belgium 
iceland luxembourg the netherlands germany france denmark 
norway italy spain portugal greece and turkey

hostile teenagers are likely to grow up to be adults who have 
high cholesterol according to a study that finds new links between 
anger and heart trouble 
for years many experts assumed that harddriving impatient 
people with classic type a personalities were at high risk of heart 
attacks but many have grown skeptical of this theory and some now 
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and 
anger 
people with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high 
cholesterol levels at 40 according to dr redford b williams of 
duke university 
redfords study was among several presented at the annual 
meeting of the american heart association to suggest that hostile 
people are more prone to heart trouble both because of the 
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their 
tendency to have unhealthy living habits

minute injections of a highly poisonous toxin have been found 
effective and safe in treating a variety of involuntary muscle 
spasms a committee of experts announced at the national institutes 
of health 
the toxin obtained from a bacteria that causes botulism food 
poisoning has been used successfully to treat spasms of the 
eyelids throat face and the vocal cords the panel said 
this is the most powerful toxin known said dr roger 
duvoisin of the robert wood medical school in new brunswick nj 
the complex protein known formally as botulinum toxin is 
produced by a bacteria in spoiled food and can lead to lethal food 
poisoning in large doses 
duvoisin said however that in very small injected doses the 
toxin has the ability to block signals from nerves to muscles this 
action will halt involuntary muscle spasms

disorder of childhood and believe it may an underlying cause of 
the condition 
their study found that parts of the brain essential for 
attention and controlling behavior do not work as hard as usual in 
hyperactive people experts described this as a potentially 
important insight into the sources of the mysterious ailment 
people have long suspected that some physical irregularity is at 
the heart of the disorder which affects between 2 percent and 4 
percent of schoolage children 
however dr alan j zametkin who directed the research said 
this is the first large study of hyperactivity that shows some

cigarettes increase smokers pain tolerance and could therefore 
block the chest pains that serve as a warning for heart disease 
researchers said 
in studies with 20 male smokers ages 19 to 44 the researchers 
found that the tolerance to pain increased with each of three 
cigarettes smoked 
the study was presented at the annual meeting of the amerian 
heart association by dr paula miller of the university of north 
carolina school of medicine the principal author of the study 
smokers are known to have a higher prevalence of what is called 
silent ischemia said miller silent ischemia occurs when blood 
flow to the heart is briefly interrupted because of the buildup of 
fatty deposits and cholesterol in the arteries that nourish the 
heart 
in many people ischemia produces the chest pain known as 
angina which is an indicator of heart disease in silent ischemia 
however there is no pain to call attention to the underlying heart 
disease

almost twothirds of the 300000 americans who drop dead 
suddenly each year from cardiac arrest might be saved if automatic 
shocking machines were made as common as fire extinguishers heart 
specialists say 
catastrophic disturbances in the hearts normal rhythm what 
doctors call sudden death account for about half of all heart 
disease fatalities 
shocking the heart with a machine called a defibrillator can 
restore normal beating but the shock must be delivered within five 
minutes or the victim will die or suffer brain damage 
this is an immense problem said dr douglas p zipes of the 
university of indiana in terms of numbers it far outstrips 
everything else but its a solvable problem

about 2 million americans unknowingly suffer from a breathing 
disorder called obstructive sleep apnea that doubles their risk of 
dying from a heart attack researchers say 
the disorder in which people stop breathing for 30 to 60 
seconds or longer during sleep is most common in people who snore 
said dr bernard burack a cardiologist at the montefiore medical 
centers sleepwake center in new york 
that doesnt mean everyone who snores is going to drop dead 
burack said but patients with the snoringrelated disorder have a 
risk of heartrelated death 21 times the national average burack 
reported at the annual scientific meeting of the american heart 
association 
it occurs most often in men but when it occurs in women it is 
even more lethal burack said

an antismoking group has blocked proposed national ventilation 
standards that it said would not have protected office workers 
against the toxic effects of secondhand cigarette smoke 
a lawyer for the group charged in an appeal to the american 
national standards institute that the proposed standards reflected 
the aims of the tobacco industry which had sought to soften the 
ventilation requirements in buildings where smoking is allowed 
the tobacco industry almost succeeded in pulling off a 
tremendous coup richard daynard chairman of the tobacco 
products liability project in boston said they were using the 
standards to cast doubt on the evidence that environmental tobacco 
smoke causes disease 
in a letter that it has been sending to employers the tobacco 
institute has said where ventilation is adequate and ventilation 
systems are properly maintained tobacco smoke is not a problem 
it based that conclusion on the proposed ventilation standards a 
copy of the letter was obtained by the associated press

foreign minister tariq aziz on wednesday 
accused the united states of seeking to dominate the world oil 
market 
the official iraqi news agency quoted aziz as saying the main 
us objective in the region is to control oil wells and dictate 
oil policies 
he was responding to comments by us secretary of state james 
a baker iii a day earlier in bermuda 
in those remarks baker said us officials are concerned that 
the persian gulf crisis will increase unemployment in the united 
states he said washington cannot permit iraq to strangle the 
economic lifeline from the gulf 
bakers suggestion that iraq might cut off oil supplies if it 
kept control of kuwait deliberately obscured the oil policies 
that baghdad has pursued the past 20 years the foreign minister 
said 
these policies have tried to prevent market fluctuations 
whereas the regimes that have received us troops were the parties 
that tampered with the oil market to serve the rulers whims and 
their evil ambitions 
it was not clear who he was referring to saudi arabia where 
most of the us forces are stationed has sought to prevent market 
fluctations saudi arabia controls about onefourth of the worlds 
oil reserves and iraq under control of kuwait accounts for about 
20 percent of the worlds oil reserves 
before invading kuwait on aug 2 iraq accused it and the united 
arab emirates of trying to wreck iraqs economy by pumping 
excessive amounts of oil and bringing the price down

states must suspend the drivers licenses of 
all convicted drug offenders or risk losing part of their federal 
highway funds under newly approved legislation signed by president 
bush 
the measure applies to all states and all illegal drugs 
including the 10 states where possession of small amounts of 
marijuana has been decriminalized but is still considered an 
infraction of the law 
the legislation included in the transportation appropriations 
bill for the current fiscal year got little attention during the 
flurry of activity as congress rushed to leave town at the end of 
october 
news that the measure had become law drew criticism from groups 
as diverse as the national governors association and the national 
organization for the reform of marijuana laws 
the legislation calls for withholding 5 percent of federal 
highway funds starting oct 1 1993 from states that fail to impose 
sixmonth suspensions on drivers convicted of a drug offense the 
cut would increase to 10 percent on oct 1 1995 
about half the states now allow suspension of drug offenders 
licenses but only new jersey colorado georgia and pennsylvania 
have mandated such suspensions for drivers of all ages according 
to liz gibson of the american legislative exchange council 
passed oct 27 and signed by bush on nov 5 the measure 
accomplishes in large part what national drug control policy 
director william j bennett tried to impose more than a year ago 
but white house chief of staff john sununu a former governor of 
new hampshire blocked that effort arguing that states should be 
allowed to decide such matters for themselves administration 
sources say 
the new legislation notes that states can reject the rules and 
still obtain federal funding if their legislatures vote 
specifically against requiring the license suspensions and their 
governors go on record in agreement with that position 
this forces the states to be accountable said an 
administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity were 
not going to force you but if you dont want to do it youll have 
to be public about it 
rep gerald bh solomon rny who pushed the amendment said 
his main targets were new york and california which have both 
decriminalized marijuana both also have splits in party control 
in california the democrats control the legislature the governor 
is a republican in new york the governor is a democrat and his 
party controls the state assembly while republicans control the 
state senate 
seventyfive percent of the drug purchases in america are done 
by casual drug users and thats white uppermiddle class 
americans that drive their pontiac firebirds into the ghetto and 
buy these killer drugs solomon said 
you dont see the murders take place out in the suburbs but 
its the casual drug user who supplies the demand for these 
drugs he said if you do away with the demand for drugs then 
the drugs will dry up in this country when it starts to affect 
their livelihoods maybe then theyll stop using these drugs 
but license suspensions wouldnt necessarily affect their 
livelihoods because they would receive limited driving permits 
enabling them to continue commuting to work he said 
in the current fiscal year the federal highway administration 
will distribute some 123 billion to the states of that total 
california will get the largest chunk some 11 billion new york 
is to get 666 million 
nolan jones staff director for the national governors 
associations justice and public safety committee said his group 
fought the measure last summer and still opposes it 
numerous states have drivers license revocation laws but 
they dont go as far as this calls for jones said that points 
to why we are against the whole issue of mandates when looking at 
this sort of problem 
criticism also came from lester lamm president of the highway 
users federation for safety and mobility which includes everything 
from road builders to insurance companies and automobile clubs 
in many cass theyre holding a program hostage for something 
that the program managers have no say over lamm said the 
state departments of transportation dont have any role in the 
criminalization of drug possession 
norml which has urged the legalization of marijuana for two 
decades also denounced the new legislation saying it seems 
ludicrous that we would take our concerns with drugs and somehow 
transform them to a completely different area ie transportation 
and money for roads

scientists searching for the remains of 
sainthood candidate pierre toussaint say they have found the body 
of a black male but are not sure it is toussaint 
this is the furthest weve gotten joseph zwilling 
spokesman for the roman catholic archdiocese of new york said 
wednesday he said three other bodies discovered in the old 
graveyard in lower manhattan where toussaint was buried were either 
white or female or both 
toussaint who was born a slave in haiti and came to new york 
with his french owners could become the first black american saint 
if his candidacy is approved by the vatican he died a free man in 
1853 after what church officials say was a life of exemplary 
charity and virtue 
zwilling said archaeologists and forensic anthropologists 
searching for toussaints remains would have to exhume the body and 
study the skull teeth and other parts before deciding if it 
belonged to toussaint 
in 1989 the church began investigating and examining toussaints 
life the first formal step if he is to be canonized the process 
can take years 
identifying toussaints remains is part of that process if he 
is made a saint his bones may be distributed to churches and 
places where he once lived

thousands of riot troops stormed a barricaded 
neighborhood with bulldozers and armored trucks wednesday and 
smashed a defiant community of anarchists in the heart of berlin 
commuters watched as officers burst through the makeshift 
barriers after daybreak and battled for hours before driving 
hundreds of radicals from a row of tenements in the former east 
berlin 
at least 325 people were arrested and 70 officers and protesters 
were injured including one squatter shot in the foot when a police 
officers warning shot ricocheted police said 
one officer and 15 squatters had to be hospitalized they said 
about 50000 people marched through eastern berlin late 
wednesday to denounce the police raid and to demand affordable 
housing 
many residents of eastern berlin now get rent subsidies a 
practice that will soon end 
the protesters tried to march to the street where the squatters 
lived but a huge police presence turned them back no serious 
violence resulted although protesters tore down or burned campaign 
posters that major political parties have put up for the dec 2 
national elections 
wednesdays confrontation was the third in three days on mainzer 
street and the latest example of lawlessness in the former east 
germany once strictly controlled by communist rulers 
as many as 3000 police many of them paramilitary units brought 
in from other german states moved in to seize the heavily 
fortified mainzer street and adjoining streets where leftist 
radicals had taken up positions 
armored personnel carriers and bulldozers burst through several 
barricades and officers used clubs water cannons and tear gas in 
pitched battles with the radicals 
radicals fired flare guns and threw rocks and firebombs from 
rooftops and windows the battle spilled onto several other streets 
and an adjoining sixlane thoroughfare was closed to traffic 
and now our street is kaput said waetroud goets 59 after 
the fighting spread to the block where she lived for 30 years i 
never had any trouble with these people but as soon as the police 
showed up they started throwing rocks 
after the fighting mainzer street was filled with smoldering 
debris spent teargas canisters junked cars and furniture that 
had been hurled from windows much of the street was torn up by the 
radicals who used its cobblestones as weapons 
berlin interior minister erich paetzold said the clash was 
marked by unbelievable brutality from the radicals 
baerbel bohley an activist who helped lead the peaceful revolt 
that toppled communism last year denounced the police raid as an 
unnecessary use of force she said a peaceful solution could have 
been reached 
most of the radicals involved in the fighting are anarchists 
from the former west berlin hundreds of radicals have taken over 
abandoned row houses in eastern berlin and have built encampments 
on vacant land where the berlin wall once stood 
the largest such community was on mainzer street where 12 
tenements were occupied and radicals set up special houses and 
cafes for women and homosexuals signs and slogans such as eat 
the rich and learn to burn covered the tenements decorated 
with the redandblack flags of the anarchist movement 
authorities evicted radical leftists from three houses in other 
parts of the city early monday radicals on mainzer street began 
building barricades and hurled rocks when police showed up monday 
afternoon 
that clash lasted until tuesday morning and at least 137 
officers were hurt and 20 people were arrested 
experts say eastern germanys freedom from authoritarian rule 
and its dire economic problems including a high unemployment rate 
and a lack of affordable housing have created a breeding ground 
for unrest 
the crime has included rampages by hooligans after soccer games 
attacks on foreigners and homosexuals by neonazis and increases in 
prostitution drugs and gambling

a former duke university student was 
convicted wednesday of defrauding two banks while masquerading as a 
wealthy french baron 
a jury convicted maur rothschild of four federal fraud charges 
involving lines of credit and creditcard applications in 1987 and 
1989 
prosecutors called him a veteran impostor 
mr rothschild knew exactly what he was doing and why he was 
doing it assistant us attorney john stone said during his 
closing statement earlier in the day mr rothschild was nothing 
more than a con man 
rothschild 38 faces up to eight years in prison and a 1 
million fine his sentencing is scheduled for jan 30 
rothschild showed little emotion when the verdict was read he 
would not comment when he was led from the courtroom 
the government has refused to say how much money rothschild 
defrauded from duke federal credit union and wachovia bank amp trust 
co in september and december 1987 and april 1989 but it was 
believed to be thousands of dollars 
born in el paso texas as mauro cortez jr rothschild signed 
two applications for lines of credit as baron maurice de 
rothschild on one he listed his mother as baroness maurie de 
rothschild in federal court documents his name is listed as 
maur jeffrey loche rothschild 
rothschild said he meant to change his first name to maurice but 
that a clerk made an error changing it instead to maur 
he said he had been abused as a child and had undergone 
extensive therapy and basically it got to a point where i lived 
out my fantasies he once tried to kill himself rothschild said 
after the name change he said he began to believe that he was a 
member of the french rothschild family while he was a continuing 
education student at duke in 1987 
were all disappointed with the verdict said his lawyer 
matthew martin its obvious maurice signed these forms of 
course the question is what was behind the signature maurice 
is not the runofthemill ordinary person he lives his life in a 
different way 
rothschild testified that the two banks pressured him into 
taking loans and never verified who he was 
martin said no one would deny rothschild had problems but he 
said dont you know the folks at these institutions began to 
salivate when they heard a member of the internationally known 
family of rothschild had come to durham the banks were involved in 
his fantasy as well 
martin said the banks used a doublestandard with rothschild 
taking his word on information because they didnt want to press a 
wealthy customer about detail 
stone said rothschild was a veteran impostor who finally got 
caught at his game 
rothschild also faces state charges of fraudulently obtaining 
1200 from a private cancer fund in durham between may and june 
last year

botulinum toxin bestknown as a cause of 
lethal food poisoning has been found to be safe and effective in 
small injections for a variety of muscle spasms a national 
institutes of health committee announced wednesday 
the toxin obtained from bacteria that cause botulism food 
poisoning has been used successfully to treat involuntary 
clinching of muscles in the eyelids throat face and the vocal 
cords the panel said 
it also shows promise in the treatment of stuttering 
misalignment of the eyes and for cramps experienced by musicians 
writers and typists 
dr roger duvoisin chairman of the nih panel and on the faculty 
of the robert wood medical school in new brunswick nj said the 
toxin is an example of a highly lethal poison that can be 
beneficial used in small doses 
this is the most powerful toxin known said duvoisin and 
yet he noted it has given relief where little was available 
before 
he said there are hundreds of thousands of americans who suffer 
from some form of muscle spasm that can be treated by the toxin 
known formally as botulinum toxin the substance is a complex 
protein produced by bacteria that in contaminated food can lead to 
lethal poisoning 
but very small doses injected directly into specific muscles 
duvoisin said have the ability to block signals from nerves to 
muscles this action will halt involuntary muscle spasms 
muscle spasms can be quiet disabling maladies said 
duvoisin 
spasms can distort facial expressions or cause eyelids to close 
tightly so that victims have to pry them open by hand or cause the 
voice to jam when the vocal cords are involved unbalanced muscles 
can cause eyes to be crossed or pointed fixedly to the side 
duvoisin said that a form of muscle spasm cut short the piano 
career of robert schuman and led to a cramping disorder now 
described as the schuman hand writers and typist have similar 
problems 
the nih panel which evaluated the use of the toxin said all of 
these conditions may be helped by small injections of the poison 
mrs robert bruce the president of the benign essential 
blepharospasm research foundation and a member of the panel said 
that the toxin shots were able to restore her to a full life 
her problem started she said when muscles controlling both 
eyelids suddenly contracted and refused to open 
mrs bruce said she was unable to see unless she pried her 
eyelids open by hand when the lids were released they jammed 
closed once more 
i couldnt work i couldnt drive i couldnt cook said 
mrs bruce i couldnt even go shopping someone had to lead me 
around by the hand 
she tried a number of treatments including hypnotism 
biofeedback and 12 types of medications but nothing worked 
then a doctor injected specific muscles in her face with small 
doses of the botulinum toxin 
the effect was to loosen and weaken the malfunctioning muscles 
and mrs bruce said it enables her to control her eyelids normally 
duvoisin said the toxin injections work for only a few months 
and then the effect wears off he said there is no apparent limit 
on the number new injection rounds that can be used without side 
effects 
the therapy takes a high degree of expertise and only a limited 
number of experts are skilled in its use he said more are being 
trained now 
a round of treatment with the toxin can cost from 400 to 
1800 duvoisin said

the persian gulf crisis was the news story 
most closely followed by the american public last month although 
interest in economic conditions jumped markedly according to a 
poll released wednesday 
nearly twothirds of a nationwide sample of adults questioned in 
a timesmirror poll said they were very closely following the iraqi 
occupation of kuwait and the presence of us military forces in 
saudi arabia it was the fourth consecutive month the gulf 
situation has been the top story 
interest in the plight of us hostages in iraq and kuwait was 
also high with 49 percent saying they were following the story 
closely 
interest in the economy rose to its highest point for the year 
39 percent that was 10 points higher than in september and only 
one point below the level of public interest the timesmirror poll 
found in the october 1987 stock market crash 
and 38 percent of those polled said they followed news about 
elections and campaigns in their states about on a par with this 
years turnout level estimated at 36 percent a month earlier 
only 18 percent reported paying close attention to election news 
the budget negotiations on capitol hill intensified and 
concluded in october but the level of public interest stayed the 
same as october 34 percent only 46 percent of those questioned 
knew that congress hmminent an armed 
conflict would threaten world oil supplies and drive up prices 
crude oil prices gained 125 tuesday on strong war words by 
british prime minister margaret thatcher but market fundamentals 
such as supplies and other technical factors played a larger role 
wednesday 
as weeks go by and people are more comfortable with the 
situation to the extent that they feel war is not immediately 
around the corner those become more important in decision 
making gohler said 
from a fundamental point of view the market is certainly 
relatively weak if you look at the numbers he said 
on wednesday president bush clashed with leaders of congress 
trying to limit his warmaking powers but assured lawmakers he has 
not decided to use military force to push iraqi troops out of 
occupied kuwait 
gohler said api statistics showing home heating oil supplies 13 
million barrels higher than a year earlier pushed down prices in 
that market 
decemberdelivery contracts for wholesale home heating oil 
traded on the merc fell 163 cents a gallon to 8664 cents after 
rising 175 cents tuesday latermonth contracts also fell 
unleaded gasoline tumbled 272 cents a gallon to 8039 cents 
with later months also lower natural gas rose 17 cent per 1000 
cubic feet at 2428 after rising 1 cent tuesday latermonth

hispanic earnings and living conditions 
deteriorated in many metropolitan areas and hispanics lost economic 
ground compared to other americans during the 1980s according to a 
study issued wednesday 
the independent nonprofit aspen institute said overall 
conditions for hispanics improved in only one city miami and 
remained relatively stable in only one other city with a large 
hispanic population san diego 
but the parity gap with angloamericans widened in 11 other 
cities over the past decade the report said the 13 cities studied 
are home to twothirds of us hispanics 
while the rich got richer and the poor got poorer did 
hispanics get poorer than anglos they did the report said 
between 1979 and 1987 the real median family income of 
hispanics fell in all but four of the 13 areas new york mcallen 
texas miami and phoenix where it remain unchanged 
with the exception of mcallen aided by a joint venture with 
mexico the greatest declines occurred among hispanics in texas 
where the economy was hit by the oil price shocks of the 1980s the 
study found 
in dallas hispanics median family income fell from 23274 in 
1979 to 19000 in 1987 while the percentage of hispanics living 
in poverty grew from 20 percent to 30 percent over the past decade 
in houston hispanics family income fell from 25281 in 1979 
to 19000 in 1987 at the beginning of the 1980s 19 percent of 
hispanics were living in poverty at the close of the decade 30 
percent were considered below the poverty level 
in addition to studying income and poverty rates the report 
looked at educational attainment unemployment rates and other 
factors to judge overall hispanicangloamerican parity it said 
san diego had the narrowest parity gap followed in order by 
miami san francisco los angeles denver dallas houston chicago 
and new york comparable data was not available for mcallen el 
paso san antonio and phoenix 
miami has made the greatest progress toward parity the study 
said followed by san diego dallas chicago new york los 
angeles san francisco houston and denver 
the report warned that the growing gap between hispanics and 
angloamericans must be closed 
the nations competitive position cannot be maintained if a 
sharp division continues between stable leadership isolated in the 
suburbs and poor workers and an underclass isolated in 
deteriorating inner cities said solomon d trujillo vice 
president and general manager of us west communications 
trujillo is also chairman of the aspen institutes hispanic 
americans and the business community program which issued the 
report 
the countrys hispanic population is estimated to be 348 
million in the year 2000 up from 201 million in 1989

many british prime ministers serve long and 
glorious terms in office but for some the end has been sudden and 
sorrowful 
few go out voluntarily in the style of lord salisbury who 
retired in 1902 after 13 years in office 
and since then no one has served longer than margaret thatcher 
who faces her first serious challenge after 11 years in power 
she has lasted longer than sir winston churchill and herbert 
asquith who each served eight years eight months both resigned 
under pressure from colleagues 
churchill lost the first peacetime election in 1945 but when a 
labor party government fell in 1951 churchill was back at 10 
downing street the prime ministers home 
everyone has his day and some days last longer than others 
he said in a speech to the house of commons in 1952 
churchills days of power lasted until 1955 when at age 80 he 
resigned under pressure from party colleagues who saw he could no 
longer concentrate on cabinet business 
his successor sir anthony eden lasted only two years his 
health and then his career broken by the suez crisis 
churchill lived a decade after retiring but others died soon 
after relinquishing power 
the liberal sir henry campbellbannerman was dead 17 days after 
resigning in 1908 the conservative bonar law lived only five 
months after he quit in 1923 
neville chamberlain who was replaced by churchill in the early 
months of world war ii lived only another six months 
asquith was maneuvered out in 1916 in the midst of a world war 
by liberal party colleagues headed by david lloyd george who 
believed they could conduct the war more effectively 
lloyd george still regarded as perhaps the cleverest prime 
minister of the century lost the 1922 election to bonar laws 
conservatives but expected to return to power quickly 
the defeat however was the end of lloyd george as a force in 
politics and also of his liberal party he remained in politics 
until his death in 1945 but had little influence and no power 
harold macmillan resigned after nearly seven years as prime 
minister after falling ill in 1963 
he summoned queen elizabeth ii to his hospital bedside and said 
his foreign secretary the 14th earl of home later lord home of 
the hirsel should succeed him and not ra butler macmillans 
deputy whom the prime minister disliked 
but macmillan could have stayed on he did not die until 1986 
at age 92 in any event home lasted only a year before the party 
was defeated by labor in a general election 
during his term however home changed the rules for selecting 
conservative prime ministers abolishing the smokefilled room of 
party leaders in favor of a secret ballot by tory lawmakers

later when antiterrorism police rushed a house where gray was 
holed up and shot him in the chest 
in between gray killed two children including a 6yearold boy 
who rode up on his bicycle to see what all the commotion was about

while inside his home gray used highpowered rifles to keep 
olice at bay and prevent them from reaching the victims who were 
scattered on the lawn and a nearby street 
new zealand police commissioner john jamieson described the 
gunman as one tough customer and absolutely ruthless 
we have a situation here obviously with a lunatic whos gone

about 140 police poured into remote aramoana the town comprises 
just five streets and is home to about 25 people mainly retirees 
officers steadily tightened a cordon around grays house before

smoke spilled out the windows but gray was nowhere to be found 
just a 22caliber rifle an air rifle 9mm ammunition and

building wounding one officer in the leg 
police lobbed smoke grenades and returned fire hitting gray in 
the chest he died at the scene a few minutes later jamieson said

this obrien said 
neighbors described the unemployed gray as a moody loner who had 
been upset by the death of his mother about three months ago 
mrs crimp called him a very quiet chap a real loner he 
never spoke to anyone 
frank and iris henderson who live in nearby waipuna bay said 
6yearold victim leo wilson lived in the house opposite them 
he heard all the police cars and fire engines going past and 
went down on his bike to have a look at it all he ran straight 
into it henderson said 
the worst previous massacre in new zealand occurred in 1941 when 
eric stanley graham killed six police officers before he was shot 
to death

the head of the nations largest testing 
organization said wednesday a proposed exam to judge students and 
their schools would be unnecessary unwarranted and wasteful 
gregory anrig president of educational testing service said at 
the national press club on wednesday that he detailed his 
opposition to such a test in a letter to the presidents education 
policy advisory committee 
the panel reportedly is preparing to recommend national testing 
of all students in grades four eight and 12 and want to use the 
results for important judgments about students and schools he 
said 
what is needed is not another test but strategies to promote 
higher standards clearer expectations for schools to achieve these 
standards and demonstrations that these standards and expectations 
can be met successfully anrig said in the sept 19 letter 
deputy education secretary ted sanders agreed 
we need to make better use of the instruments we have both to 
guide classroom learning and to measure our progress in meeting 
national goals he said 
anrigs comments underscored results of a gallup poll of the 
nations top teachers released earlier wednesday 
seventythree percent of the teachers surveyed said they felt 
pressured to spend more time preparing students for tests and 57 
percent said classroom subjects were determined by what is covered 
on the test 
exceptional teachers who perhaps understand and deplore this 
dilemma more than their peers want to break the shackles that bind 
them to wasteful modes of instruction the poll said in its 
summary 
the gallup poll involved 231 teachers who were semifinalists 
cited for excellence from among 20000 nominees to a nationwide 
program called thanks to teachers 
anrig said 47 states already have statewide testing programs 
with results released annually congress also recently authorized 
trial state assessments using the federally funded national 
assessment of educational progress 
anrig said the ets next month will unveil instructional 
assessments for critical thinking science mathematics writing 
and the arts at the junior high level rather than dictate 
curriculum the assessment will assist and supplement instruction 
he said

georgias new parliament declared wednesday it 
will seek full independence from the soviet union which it accused 
of seven decades of bloody terror and repression 
in lithuania prime minister kazimiere prunskiene said her 
baltic republic may soon face a second kremlin economic blockade 
she sought help in advance from other soviet republics western 
companies and former us sen gary hart 
angry members of the national legislature demanded that 
president mikhail s gorbachev report to them on his attempts to 
hold the country together and on his sunday meeting with his main 
political rival russian federation president boris n yeltsin 
gorbachev agreed to address the supreme soviet on friday the 
official tass news agency said 
georgian lawmakers met in tbilisi their capital for the first 
time since a proindependence coalition the round table for a free 
georgia won oct 28 parliamentary elections those elections were 
the first true multiparty polling in soviet history 
parliament voted 238 to 5 with one abstention to elect round 
table leader zviad gamsakhurdia a 51yearold author as georgias 
president he immediately reiterated his promise to lead the 
southern republics 53 million people to complete independence and 
a marketbased economy 
we are for an economy totally independent of the central 
authorities a maximum of privatization and business contacts with 
all other states on a mutually beneficial basis he told 
interfax an independent soviet news agency 
tass said the parliament declared georgia was entering a 
transition period to full state independence and dropped 
soviet and socialist from its name it now is called the 
republic of georgia instead of the georgian soviet socialist 
republic the length of the transition period was not set 
georgia earlier declared economic sovereignty from the central 
soviet government but wednesdays declaration went further and 
appeared to rule out signing a new treaty of confederation among 
the 15 soviet republics as gorbachev wants 
all 15 republics with the exception of kirgizia now have taken 
steps toward sovereignty or independence and the parliament of 
that central asian republic has been debating a possible 
sovereignty resolution for weeks 
georgias parliament restored the state hymn seal and flag used 
from 1919 to 1921 when georgia was independent 
in an amended preamble to the republics constitution the 
lawmakers said that in february and march of 1921 soviet russia 
rudely violated a peace treaty it signed with georgia occupied 
the republic by military force and effectively annexed it 
the entire period in which georgia has been part of the soviet 
union has been marked by bloody terror and repression the 
preamble says 
georgia in the caucasus mountains is bordered by russia 
armenia and azerbaijan the republic is a major resort area and the 
nations fruit and vegetable basket georgia also has mining and 
industry 
lithuania was the first republic to declare independence on 
march 11 its parliament agreed to suspend the declaration in 
return for the kremlins calling off a crippling 10week trade 
embargo and entering negotiations 
mrs prunskiene said monday night that kremlin officials show no 
willingness to compromise and are trying to squeeze lithuania 
economically before scheduled formal negotiations begin at the end 
of this month 
she said another embargo was quite a possibility an ominous 
reality that is approaching us 
during the first blockade from april 18 to june 30 moscow cut 
off all oil most natural gas and many raw materials forcing 
lithuanian factories to close and thousands to lose jobs 
mrs prunskiene said she met wednesday with moscow mayor gavriil 
popov economist grigory yavlinsky a deputy prime minister of the 
russian federation and gary hart the former us senator from 
colorado and 1988 democratic presidential candidate 
she said she wanted to discuss possible trade agreements with 
moscow and other russian cities or regions to help us in escaping 
a blockade which could be even worse than the previous one 
she said hart brought along representatives of a large 
investment bank and some other western companies which have 
largescale plans for investments in lithuania she declined to 
provide names or details

the first of several hundred 
topline american m1a1 tanks rolled into saudi arabia wednesday 
night to replace older models and give us forces a bigger edge 
against the iraqis 
the m1a1 abrams tanks the armys premiere ground combat weapon 
willreplace m1 tanks in all frontline army units currently 
deployed in saudi arabia as part of operation desert shield 
the m1 is better than anything the iraqis have said army 
spokesman maj douglas bidle 38 of arlington heights ill the 
m1 gave us an edge this is a better tank so obviously this is an 
even better edge 
the m1a1 has better chemical and biological warfare protection 
enabling the fourman tank crew to operate inside without wearing 
protective gear m1 crews must don protective clothing and hook 
into a breathing system 
the m1 has a 105mm gun far smaller than the m1a1s 120mm gun 
which can penetrate more and thicker armor 
bidle said the m1a1 also has improved survivability with 
better armor better suspension and a newer transmission and final 
drive 
the new tanks arrived on the civiliancrewed us government 
cargo ship the norfolk vabased cape ducato after a threeweek 
trip from germany plagued by engine trouble 
a steady stream of m1a1s rumbled out of the cargo hold onto the 
dock late wednesday janes defense weekly reported last month that 
350 m1s would be swapped for m1a1s 
the khaki tanks which will now be repainted in desert 
camoflauge were taken from prepositioned storage facilities in 
europe where they were part of natos inventory to be used in the 
event of hostilites 
the department of defense in announcing the replacement on oct 
20 said the tanks would have had to be phased out anyway in the 
conventional forces in europe treaty expected to be signed by the 
end of the year the treaty is expected to cut the number of tanks 
in europe 
the defense department said it was proposing to the nato allies 
that the older tanks continue to be counted under the treaty 
bidle said the m1 tanks being taken out of the desert will 
remain in saudi arabia as a reserve to replace those lost in 
battle 
the m1a1s will replace m1s in the 24th infantry division the 
197th infantry brigade and the 2nd armored division that is part of 
the first cavalry division bidle said all are frontline units in 
the 230000strong us force sent here to defend saudi arabia 
the department of defense has said all tanks will be switched by 
the end of the year 
the only unit in saudi arabia that has m1a1 tanks at the moment 
is the 3rd armored cavalry regiment which brought them with them 
from ft bliss texas 
it is unclear whether the 200000 us troops being mobilized by 
president bush to give the united states an offensive capability 
will also have m1a1 tanks

the government wednesday squelched a 
nationwide strike over its economic policies by barring news 
coverage and threatening to fire participating workers 
in a radio interview president cesar gaviria announced that the 
army and air force were waging a major assault on the main base of 
the armed revolutionary forces of colombia the leftist group 
known by its spanish acronym farc is the countrys oldest and 
biggest rebel group 
radio and newspaper reports said the fighting at the base had 
left about 35 guerrillas and at least two soldiers dead a 
spokesman at the defense ministry said the total dead was not yet 
known 
gaviria who declared the strike illegal said lftist 
guerrillas could take advantage of it to step up violence 
military and police reinforcements were increased throughout the 
country radio and television were prohibited from reporting on the 
strike 
in one of the governments toughest stands in years against 
strikers the president authorized businesses to fire employees who 
didnt show up to work 
most shops banks and factories were open wednesday despite the 
work stoppage called by colombias four main labor unions 
labor unions had called the strike to protest gavirias economic 
policies of privatizing many staterun industries and raising 
prices of basic goods and services workers fear the new measures 
will increase poverty and unemployment 
despite the government measures some workers including those 
of the state monopoly telephone company did observe the strike 
traffic in major cities was reduced 
in addition university students in the capital bogota and in 
the northwestern city of medellin staged demonstrations 
also wednesday gaviria confirmed that the military supported 
by jets and helicopter gunships had been attacking the farcs main 
base in the eastern province of meta since last week 
the army also reported that highway ambushes and gunfire attacks 
on military bases have killed nine policemen and soldiers the past 
three days 
the farc and another insurgent group the national liberation 
army are not participating in peace talks between the government 
and three other rebel organizations

after four years of contentious debate among 
environmentalists homeowners and rival energy suppliers federal 
regulators wednesday approved construction of a 583 million 
pipeline to bring natural gas from canada to the northeast 
in the end tight energy supplies in new england new york and 
new jersey outweighed the concerns of opponents of the iroquois 
pipeline who ranged from wildcat oil drillers in the southwest to 
pop psychologist dr joyce brothers whose hudson valley estate in 
new york would be crossed by the line 
jerry langdon a member of the federal energy regulatory 
commission said wednesdays unanimous decision by his agency 
represented a move to make greater use of north american if not 
just us energy supplies 
robert j reid president of the iroquois gas transmission 
system a consortium of us and canadian gas companies and 
utilities based in shelton conn said it was imperative that 
we receive ferc approval in november to maintain our timetable for 
constructing the pipeline 
the pipeline will extend 370 miles from the st lawrence river 
through the woodlands of upstate new york beneath the hudson 
river into affluent sections of western connecticut and across 
long island sound to long island iroquois officials hope to have 
gas flowing to new york and new england by november 1991 and to 
complete the line by january 1992 
iroquois still has a few regulatory hurdles to clear including 
permits from the us army corps of engineers for waterway 
crossings and import permits from the energy department expected 
to be pro forma under the uscanada free trade agreement 
thousands of property owners along the route have not yet agreed to 
let iroquois pay to cross their land and iroquois may have to 
settle some of those cases in court 
this has been controversial almost since it was filed in 
1986 said susan court associate general counsel of the 
commission for gas and oil 
iroquois is designed to deliver 575 million cubic feet of gas 
daily or enough to meet the energy needs of 15 million homes 
though one reason it is being built is to make gas available for 
electricity generation 
the daily amount could supply between three and four large 
electric power plants if it were all devoted to that use though 
utilities receiving the gas may use it for any of their customers 
the gas supplied by iroquois will increase the energy supply 
flowing to the northeast by 5 percent according to reid iroquois 
could double transmission capacity with additional compressors 
existing gas pipelines to the northeast from us gas fields 
have been running at capacity for years no one sought to build new 
ones 
transcanada pipelines ltd one of iroquois several owners 
estimated the new line will generate 1 billion per year in exports 
for canada canada has been supplying natural gas to the united 
states since the 1960s but mostly in the west and midwest 
domestic energy suppliers complained that iroquois will 
discourage production and will compete unfairly with us pipelines 
and oil companies 
iroquois gas however will be more expensive than us gas and 
cheaper than oil according to a formula approved by the commission 
that ties the price to those two commodities 
we really view oil as the competition not other natural 
gas said iroquois spokesman gary davis

some members of a scientific panel said 
wednesday they should have moved faster to draft guidelines for 
adding steroids to the treatment of a killer pneumonia in people 
with aids 
in retrospect it should have happened more quickly said 
paul meier professor of statistics at the university of chicago 
and vice chairman of the panel that convened last may 
aids activists also said the panel took too long but federal 
medical officials said these critics were disregarding some 
important facts 
still other panel members said the approval process could not 
have been significantly speeded up 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases on 
oct 10 sent an alert to physicians informing them that recent 
studies had found benefits among some patients with pneumocycstis 
carinii pneumonia whose treatment was supplemented with steroids 
steorids are known to weaken the immune system and aids is a 
disease of a collapsing immune system 
the letter sent to 2600 medical practitioners was based on 
the findings of the 17member panel organized by the institute and 
the university of california at san diego 
mike merdian executive director of the national association of 
people with aids said the five months it took the panel to come up 
with its recommendations was unconscionable and unethical 
but not unusual 
weve long said there are many therapies available were not 
aware of he said 
but the chairman of the panel rejected the criticism and said 
the time it took members to analyze the studies was well spent 
trying to agree on the wording of any recommendations as to which 
patients would benefit most from steroid treatment in what doses 
and for what period of time 
the five months was a relatively short period said dr 
henry masur panel chairman and chief of critical care the national 
institutes of health clinical center i dont think it will ever 
get much faster 
since steroids weaken the immune system the whole concept of 
giving steroids to someone with aids is very novel and 
controversial masur said 
among the concerns are that steroids can increase the rate at 
which the aids virus replicates and make it more likely other 
infectious complications develop he said 
it was vitally important to make sure that steroids 
unequivocally improved survival and it was important to prove that 
while improving from one disease it didnt cause numerous other 
potentially fatal problems he said 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the biggest killer of people 
with aids about 40000 cases are expected to occur this year in 
the united states 
the broad outlines of a consensus on the steroid issue was 
reached may 15 but it wasnt until the end of august that the 
experts agreed on the technical details such as for whom the 
therapy should be recommended for and in what doses 
they decided that the studies showed that patients who benefit 
most from steroids along with standard therapy were those who had 
moderate or severe pneumocystis but that there was no evidence of 
benefit for patients with mild disease 
bernard bihari executivemedical director of the community 
research initiative which treats aids patients in new york said 
the issue was too important for lengthy disagreements to stall the 
discussions 
they should have locked them in a room and said youre not 
coming out until you have a statement he said 
dr samuel bozzette assistant professor of medicine at the 
university of california at san diego and a panel member said that 
in a perfect system it could have been shorter but it was not 
an unreasonable amount of time 
he added that when you release one of these consensus 
statements you are setting a worldwide standard of care and one 
has to make sure that the recommendations are as carefully 
considered as possible 
but he also agreed with meier that the documents could have been 
passed around more quickly and daytoday processes could have 
moved quicker 
meier said that the panel which took about three months to 
complete its part of the task ould have achieved that goal in 
about one month but nobody set a deadline 
a failure to recognize it the process was dragging is where 
i would fault us meier said

hostile teenagers are likely to grow up to be 
adults who have high cholesterol according to a study that finds 
new links between anger and heart trouble 
for years many experts assumed that harddriving impatient 
people with classic type a personalities were at high risk of heart 
attacks but many have grown skeptical of this theory and some now 
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and 
anger 
people with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high 
cholesterol levels at 40 dr redford b williams of duke 
university said wednesday 
williams study was among several presented at the annual 
meeting of the american heart association to suggest that hostile 
people are more prone to heart trouble both because of the 
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their 
tendency to have unhealthy living habits 
one report from yale university researchers found that people 
who react to situations with strong emotions particularly anger 
are especially likely to die of cardiac arrest 
williams study conducted with dr ilene c siegler was based 
on a followup 20 years later of 830 people who took personality 
tests while students at the university of north carolina in the 
mid1960s 
they found that those who scored high on a hostility scale in 
college tended to have high levels of total cholesterol in their 
blood but relatively low amounts of hdl the protective socalled 
good cholesterol 
one explanation for this is the effect of hormones that 
mobilize lipids from fat stores said williams 
when people get angry their bodies pump out stress hormones 
such as adrenaline which trigger the body to release fat into the 
bloodstream to provide energy 
stress hormones give you a hershey bar when they fire off 
williams said 
hostility may work to raise cholesterol and harm the heart in 
other ways too other duke research found that alumni who were 
especially rebellious or hostile were more likely to smoke 
cigarettes this suggests that hostile people are less health 
conscious 
in williams view hostile people tend to be suspicious as well 
as easily angered 
they are the people who when they stand in the 12item line 
at the supermarket always count how many items other people 
have said williams they always suspect that other people are 
trying to weasel through 
in another study at duke researchers set up an experiment to 
see how people would respond when bothered by a technician while 
trying to solve word puzzles hostile people tended to react by 
getting angry at the harrassment and their blood pressures rose 
i think the effects of hostility are preventable or even 
reversible through stress management techniques he said 
the yale study by dr lynda powell was based on eight to 10 
years of followup of 929 men who had survived heart attacks 
the researchers interviewed the men and scored how emotionally 
aroused they became by observing such things as tense facial 
expressions rapid speech quick gestures rapid blinking an 
aggressive attitude and other clues from their posture and words 
we think hostility is a critical part of emotional arousal 
but its too specific powell said extreme joy can trigger the 
same thing it is the resulting surge of stress hormones that puts 
the person at increased risk of death 
powell believes that chronic exposure to these hormones which 
help the body gear up for emergencies can damage the heart and 
trigger cardiac arrest 
her study found that those who scored high in emotional 
reactivity were three times more likely than more even tempered 
people to die of cardiac arrest and their risk was five times 
higher if they also had high cholesterol levels

in an effort to solidify support for us 
moves in the persian gulf secretary of state james a baker iii 
will meet this weekend with the foreign ministers of three african 
countries that are members of the un security council 
he hopes to persuade them to support a resolution authorizing 
the use of force to expel iraqi invaders from kuwait baker last 
week lined up the soviet union china britain and france they are 
permanent members of the council and could have killed the 
resolution with their veto 
the three african countries are ethiopia ivory coast and zaire 
enlisting them to support the bush administration would give the 
toughened us stance broaer approval among neutral and third 
world nations 
bakers meetings with the african foreign ministers will be held 
saturday in geneva he then will fly to paris to meet sunday with 
the foreign ministers of romania and finland and hold another 
session with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
later sunday baker will meet president bush in paris for a 
34nation summit where a landmark treaty to reduce nato and warsaw 
pact tanks and other nonnuclear weapons will be signed 
the following weekend baker will go to colombia to confer with 
president cesar gaviria colombia also is a member of the security 
council this month 
baker at a white house news conference wednesday said the 
administration had not decided to use force but wanted that option 
to be credible in hopes of persuading iraqi president saddam 
hussein to give up kuwait 
abc news said wednesday evening the administration had decided 
to seek approval of a un resolution before the end of this month 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said later no 
decision has been made on whether to submit such a resolution 
saudi arabia egypt bahrain egypt turkey and the exiled 
government of kuwait all assured baker during his recent eightday 
trip to the persian gulf and europe that they would not oppose the 
resolution 
baker leaves washington on thursday stopping first in brussels 
to meet with the 12nation european community the key issue is 
whether they are ready to add to their commitments to poorer 
nations such as turkey and egypt that are suffering economically 
by adhering to the trade cutoff with iraq approved in august by the 
security council 
in the meantime king hassan of morocco is trying to organize an 
arab summit meeting to head off war with diplomacy 
we are in favor of any diplomatic approaches that can move us 
in the direction of a political and peaceful settlement baker 
said but we are not in favor of diplomatic approaches that call 
for partial solutions 
baker was referring to the longstanding us demand that iraq 
withdraw its troops unconditionally from kuwait before any 
discussion on related issues are held saudi arabia a key us 
ally against saddam hussein has taken the same position with 
regard to an arab summit

here is the text of this years thanksgiving 
proclamation issued wednesday by president bush 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the first presidential thanksgiving day proclamation george 
washington observed that it is the duty of all nations to 
acknowledge the providence of almighty god to obey his will to be 
grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and 
favor as a people who have long enjoyed unparalleled material 
prosperity and the priceless blessings of peace and freedom we 
americans cannot fail to fulfill this great yet joyous duty 
thus we pause each year on thanksgiving day to express our 
gratitude for the goodness and generosity of our creator and to ask 
his continued protection and guidance in all our endeavors both as 
individuals and as a nation 
the observance of thanksgiving was a cherished tradition in 
america long before george washington called his countrymen to 
the service of that great and glorious being who is the beneficent 
author of all the good that was that is or that will be 
indeed we trade the tradition of giving thanks back to some of the 
earliest settlers in this country not only the pilgrims at 
plymouth but also early colonists at jamestown new amsterdam and 
st augustine with hands clasped in prayer and hearts full of 
gratitude these men and women gave public thanks to god for having 
been sustained through times of hardship and peril 
william bradfords account of the experience of the settlers at 
plymouth colony is not only a moving description of the trials of 
emigration to a wilderness but also captures their profound faith 
and contains a timeless exhortation to succeeding generations 
being thus passed the vast ocean they had now no friends 
to welcome them nor inns to entertain or refresh their 
weatherbeaten bodies no houses or much less towns to repair to 
and for the season it was winter and they that know the winters of 
that country know them to be sharp and violent besides what 
could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness neither 
could they as it were go to the top of pisgah to view from this 
wilderness a more goodly country to feed their hopes for which way 
soever they turned their eyes save upwards to the heavens they 
could have little solace or content what could now sustain them 
but the spirit of god and his grace they cried to the lord and he 
heard their voice and looked on their adversity let them 
therefore praise the lord because he is good and his mercies 
endure forever 
the historic observance of a day of thanksgiving at plymouth in 
1621 was one of many occasions on which our ancestors paused to 
acknowledge their dependence on the mercy and favor of divine 
providence today on this thanksgiving day likewise observed 
during a season of celebration and harvest we have added cause for 
rejoicing the seeds of democratic thought sown on these shores 
continue to take took around the world in central and eastern 
europe in latin america and elsewhere courageous men and women 
are beginning to reap the blessings of freedom and selfgovernment 
peoples who once suffered under the heavy yoke of totalitarianism 
have begun to claim the liberty to which all are heirs 
our gratitude for the rights and opportunities we enjoy as 
americans may be measured by how carefully we use the preserve 
these gifts as when we cultivate in our children a love of freedom 
and an understanding of the responsibilities that freedom demands 
of us we tend the precious blossom of our liberty when we recall 
the example of our ancestors and strive to ensure that our own 
lives are firmly rooted in faith like our forebears we must 
cherish the values and beliefs that are the foundation of strong 
loving families and caring communities and recognize the importance 
of learning and hard work because these are the wellspring of 
progress and prosperity 
the great freedom and prosperity with which we have been blessed 
is cause for rejoicing and it is equally a responsibility 
indeed scripture tells us that much will be asked of those to whom 
much has been given our errand in the wilderness begun more 
than 350 years ago is not yet complete abroad we are working 
toward a new partnership of nations at home we seek lasting 
solutions to the problems facing our nation and pray for a society 
with liberty and justice for all the alleviation of want and 
the restoration of hope to all our people 
this thanksgiving as we enjoy the company of family and 
friends let us gratefully turn our hears to god the loving source 
of all life and liberty let us seek his forgiveness for our 
shortcomings and transgressions and renew our determination to 
remain a people worthy of his continued favor and protection 
acknowledging our dependence on the almighty obeying his 
commandments and reaching out to help those who do not share fully 
in this nations bounty is the most heartfelt and meaningful answer 
we can give the timeless appeal of the psalmist o give thanks to 
the lord for he is good for his steadfast love endures forever 
finally on this thanksgiving day let us also remember all 
those americans abroad who labor to advance the ideals for which 
this great nation stands whether peace corps volunteers or 
military or diplomatic personnel these selfless individuals often 
accept great personal risks and sacrifices to serve our country 
let us remember in particular those americans held hostage and 
members of the armed forces serving in the persian gulf region on 
this day let us pray for their wellbeing and their safe return to 
the united states and let us be thankful that such fine men and 
women are still willing to answer the call of duty to country and 
to defend the cause of liberty 
now therefore i george bush president of the united states 
of america do hereby call upon the american people to observe 
thursday november 22 1990 as a national day of thanksgiving and 
to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of 
thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many 
blessings god has bestowed upon us 
in witness whereof i have hereunto set by hand this fourteenth 
day of november in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and 
ninety and of the independence of the united states of america the 
two hundred and fifteenth

us roman catholic bishops on wednesday 
adopted their first comprehensive guidelines on human sexuality 
portraying it in exalting terms and calling for it to be taught in 
catholic schools 
against some opposition and attempts at delay the document was 
approved by a strong voice vote by the national conference of 
catholic bishops 
it says sexual education should be taught in schools and 
parishes as well as in families a provision strongly opposed by 
several bishops who said many parents want such education kept in 
the home one said families might remove their children from 
catholic schools if sex education is required 
describing sexuality as a wonderful gift the bishops say 
they approach the subject with a deep and abiding sense of 
appreciation wonder and respect 
they add 
we are dealing with a divine gift a primal dimension of each 
person a mysterious blend of spirit and body which shares in 
gods own creative love and life 
sexuality is a dimension of ones restless heart which 
continually yearns for interpersonal communion glimpsed and 
experienced to varying degrees in this life ultimately finding 
full oneness only in god here and hereafter 
the 185page document called human sexuality a catholic 
perspective for education and lifelong learning was developed by 
a special task force including experts in various fields 
auxiliary bishop william newman of baltimore said the effort 
was to present the subject in positive terms and with flow 
much of it has a lilting sweep in phrasing 
we are created not as angels or pure spirits but as human 
beings embodied and sexual the document says 
the gift of sexuality involves the whole person because it 
permeates all facets of the human personality the physical the 
psychoemotional the intellectual the spiritual and ethical and 
the social the bishops say 
sexuality prompts each of us from within calling us to 
personal as well as spiritual growth and drawing us out from self 
to interpersonal bonds and commitments with others both women and 
men 
the document affirms the churchs traditional teaching that 
condones intercourse only in marriage 
like all our human powers and freedoms sexuality can be 
channeled for good or ill can be abused sometimes 
intentionally sometimes through immaturity or ignorance 
given how important sexuality is such errors in judgment 
frequently have a profound impact for ill on nes psyche human 
commitments and relationship with god it says 
bishop kenneth e untener of saginaw mich noted the document 
mentions that some dissent from the church ban against 
contraception and urges they pray and reconsider 
he said they might respond we will if you will refering to 
widespread disagreement with the contraception ban among catholics 
he urged listening to them 
if we dont it will cause great damage to the church at 
large he told fellow bishops saying the churchs credibility 
depended on it 
some bishops complained that many parents wanted sexual 
education kept in the home and not taught in school 
auxiliary bishop austin vaughan of new york protested that the 
document had been shaped without wide parental consultation he 
sought unsuccessfully to get it tabled 
he said if sexual education is required many parents will 
pull their children out of catholic schools 
considerable debate came on a section dealing with 
homosexuality and a move was made to insert a 1986 vatican 
declaration that homosexuality is an objective disorder 
involving a tendency to moral evil 
however archbishop john quinn of san francisco said that the 
vaticans philosophical analysis had been misinterpreted to mean 
the person was intrinsically disordered and intrinsically bad 
the matter was put in a footnote along with an explanation of 
the distinction between the technical and personal implications 
homosexual orientation because it is not freely chosen is 
not sinful an added line said 
the portion on teaching about sexuality focuses on the different 
stages of life childhood adolescence and adulthood 
the bishops on the third day of their fourday annual meeting 
also approved a major aid program to longsuppressed churches of 
eastern europe 
a national collection was to be made for three and perhaps five 
years to fund the operation 
asked how much was expected from such fund drives archbishop 
john l may of st louis told a news conferencemillions 
he said other special drives have yielded more than 10 million 
annually

former defense secretary michael heseltine on 
wednesday challenged prime minister margaret thatcher for 
leadership of the government and the conservative party 
heseltine who will stand against mrs thatcher in a ballot 
among the 372 conservative legislators on tuesday accused her of 
splitting the party on europe and alienating voters with an 
unpopular local government tax 
the challenge by heseltine a handsome selfmade millionaire 
who espouses a caring capitalism in contrast to mrs thatchers 
rigorous freemarket views poses the biggest threat to her 
survival since she won power more than 11 years ago 
i am persuaded that i will now have a better prospect than 
mrs thatcher of leading the conservatives to a fourth general 
election victory heseltine said 
kenneth baker chairman of the troubled conservative party said 
the 65yearold prime minister will fight to the end to keep power 
through a possible three ballots ending nov 29 
this contest is unwanted and unnecessary baker said i am 
sure she will win on the first ballot 
other ministers in the 22member cabinet said it was wrong to 
challenge mrs thatcher now with about 16000 british troops in 
the persian gulf and war possible against iraq 
heseltine who needs 159 votes in the first secret ballot to 
force a runoff said more than 100 legislators have pledged 
support mrs thatcher needs 214 votes to win outright 
press association the domestic news agency reported wednesday 
night that it had contacted 215 conservative lawmakers on the 
leadership question it said 54 percent supported mrs thatcher 19 
percent favored heseltine and 27 percent refused to answer 
if a second ballot is needed it will be held nov 27 and may 
well bring in other contenders from the cabinet such as foreign 
secretary douglas hurd if no one won outright then a third and 
final vote among the last three top contenders will be held nov 
29 
heseltine defense secretary until he stalked out of mrs 
thatchers cabinet in 1986 in a europerelated dispute stepped 
forward a day after her former deputy prime minister delivered a 
scathing attack on her attitude toward europe 
the onslaught by sir geoffrey howe who resigned nov 1 
appeared to have tipped heseltine into his along awaited bid for 
the leadership 
rebellion has simmered in the party for more than a year partly 
over mrs thatchers isolation in the steppedup drive for greater 
european unity britain alone rejected an agreement last month in 
principle for a single central bank and single currency for the 
12nation european community 
but mrs thatchers crisis is rooted in the tories 16month lag 
in opinion polls mainly because of high interest rates 
doubledigit inflation and an unpopular local percapita tax dubbed 
the poll tax 
heseltine said that if he wins he will order an immediate review 
of that tax which he said left a lingering sense of injustice 
mrs thatcher is the longestserving head of government in the 
western world and britains longestserving prime minister in this 
century 
the attempt to overthrow her threatened to become a dirty 
noholdsbarred campaign for the leadership of the party which has 
a majority in the 650member house of commons the party leader is 
automatically the prime minister 
on tuesday the 4million circulation sun newspaper carried 
stories with intimate details of the private lives of some of 
heseltines known supporters including that one had a mistress and 
another had visited a gay club 
mrs thatcher will vote for herself by proxy tuesday from paris 
where she will be at a 35nation summit of leaders of east and 
west 
her supporters expressed dismay at the prospect of the party 
dumping the leader who faced down the unions led the war in the 
falkland islands and whose grity brand of nationalism helped 
revive the countrys selfimage as a european power and americas 
no 1 ally 
her leadership qualities are the greatest political assets 
which the conservative party and our nation have said party 
chairman baker 
hurd who could pose the biggest threat of all to mrs thatcher 
if she fails to stop heseltine in the first ballot said on 
wednesday the challenge was a mistake but he added he agreed with 
many of howes criticisms 
in the house of commons on wednesday afternoon mrs thatcher 
sat in her usual frontbench seat occasionally smiling thinly as 
opposition legislators taunted her chancellor of the exchequer 
john major 
why dont you line up with heseltine a legislator shouted 
as major defended the governments economic record and promised 
better times ahead 
heseltine left the cabinet after mrs thatcher ordered him to 
halt a campaign for a european consortium to rescue the british 
helicoptermaker westland instead of a usled consortium she 
favored

a multicolored volleyball floats before your 
eyes there is a hole in the ball big enough for your hand you 
insert your fingers feel for the edge 
but there is no edge 
there is no ball 
there is only air and a remarkable threedimensional illusion 
created through a process that leapfrogs laser technology and may 
fulfill some of holographys unkept promises 
the process is phscolography pronounced skohlahgrahfee a 
combination of photography holography sculpture and computer 
graphics 
its inventors at the illinois institute of technology and the 
university of illinois at chicago say phscolograms are easier and 
cheaper to create than laserconstructed holograms a factor that 
could hasten the longawaited advent of 3d television 
they say phscolographys biggest advantage over holography is 
the ease with which it can transform computergenerated images into 
3d illusions most holograms are of physical objects 
this thing can do impossible images said thomas defanti a 
cofounder of uics electronic visualization laboratory and a 
member of the artistsandscientists collaborative that developed 
phscolography 
for example the phscologram that resembled a blue green red 
and yellow volleyball was actually a computergenerated model of 
the polio virus it is one of 47 phscolograms on display at 
chicagos museum of science and industry the exhibit titled 
science in depth runs through jan 13 
among the exhibits most intriguing pieces are eight 
phscolographic renderings of mathematical concepts these are not 
numbers but bright abstract forms with titles like norton fractal 
i and strange attractor that essentially are 
computergenerated maps of how certain systems of mathematical 
equations behave 
its exciting to have a way for people to look at these 
visualizations defanti said 
he said that by looking at a 3d visualization of an abstract 
concept scientists can sometimes make connections they would 
otherwise have missed 
the museums works also include 3d architectural photos 
visualizations of various molecules and a crossshaped montage of 
images tumbling dice human head and hands and an aids virus 
meant to suggest the roles of hope and chance in finding a cure for 
the deadly disease 
were marrying art science and math said sculptor ellen 
sandor a leader in phscolography research since 1983 
threedimensional imaging goes bck to the early days of 
photography but got a big boost in the 1960s when lasers first were 
used to construct holograms some scientists predicted that 
holographic home entertainment centers would become common by the 
year 2000 
phscolograms resemble holograms but have more in common with 3d 
postcards 
the cards work because they contain two or more different 
images only one of which can be seen from any given angle because 
of the different positions of a persons eyes each eye sees a 
slightly different image the brain interprets this to give 
threedimensional information 
a phscologram is like a transparent slide of a 3d postcard 
containing 13 images that have been sliced and spliced on a 
computer screen into 8000 extremely thin vertical columns the 
slide is overlaid with a piece of opaque film called a barrier 
screen containing 8000 corresponding slits 
the phscologram is mounted over a light source which projects 
the image toward the viewer most of the phscolograms exhibited in 
chicago are 20 inches high and 24 inches wide 
defanti said the technology could easily be adapted to a 
computer display for still images 
he also said it also could work for moving pictures although 
conventional television picture tubes do not provide enough image 
resolution the liquid crystal display or lcd technology of small 
televisions such as the sony watchman offer more hope for 3d tv 
de fanti said 
stephen a benton a professor of media technology at the 
masschusetts institute of technology and a recognized leader in 
holography research said color and computergenerated holograms 
are in the works 
he conceded that holography has not developed as rapidly as some 
experts had hoped in the late 1960s but he said holography 
research ultimately will yield clearer better 3d images than 
phscolography 
were more out on the longterm research end of it he said 
we dont think the slit or barrierscreen approach can get us 
where we need to go

president bush clashed wednesday with leaders 
of congress trying to limit his warmaking powers but assured 
anxious lawmakers he has not decided to use military force to push 
iraqi troops out of kuwait 
in a twohour meeting democratic leaders insisted that bush 
must seek congressional approval before taking military action in 
the persian gulf he refused to give any such guarantee 
the president did not indicate either a commitment to do that 
or refusal to do that senate majority leader george mitchell 
said later 
secretary of state james a baker iii said bush would follow the 
constitution but he pointedly added its a question of what the 
constitution requires 
while acknowledging that only congress has authority to declare 
war baker said there are many many circumstances and 
situations indeed where there could be action taken against 
american citizens or against american interests that would call for 
a very prompt and substantial response 
fears of war in the middle east were flamed by bushs decision 
last week to send upwards of 200000 more troops to the gulf 
nearly doubling the american military force there and adding what 
bush called an offensive capability 
reading from his notes of the meeting house minority leader 
robert michel rill quoted bush as saying we havent crossed 
any particular rubicon here with the latest increase 
for his own part michel said i dont look for the kind of 
action some people are anticipating real soon we want to 
continue to counsel with our allies and the united nations 
however michel said he was a little distressed that some 
participants in the meeting with bush had spoken of waiting up to 
18 months for sanctions against iraq to take full effect he said 
that was far beyond the time frame i thought appropriate 
according to an administration source house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo told bush that waiting a year or a year 
and a half for sanctions to force iraq out of kuwait was a better 
choice than war michel told bush he could not wait that long and 
rep john murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee said the president should be prepared to move 
soon the source said 
rep david obey dwis said democrats were unanimous in 
counseling patience 
how long are you willing to wait it out to save lives my 
answer is a fair amount of time 
baker said the sanctions are working but might not be enough to 
force an iraqi withdrawal i dont think we can say that today 
with certainty we know they are beginning to bite baker said 
abc news said wednesday evening the bush administration had 
decided to seek approval of a united nations resolution authorizing 
force against iraq for which baker has been seeking support in 
his recent overseas trip before the end of the month but marlin 
fitzwater the presidents press secretary said no decision has 
been made on submitting such a resolution 
some lawmakers including senate republican leader bob dole 
have called for a special session of congress to vote on the gulf 
crisis but that proposal appeared dead wednesday there is no 
support for it on either side senate foreign relations chairman 
claiborne pell dri said as he left the white house 
rep william broomfield rmich senior republican on the house 
foreign affairs committee said there was a bipartisan agreement 
that it would be just poor judgment to have it right now 
however there will be congressional hearings the senate 
foreign relations committee tentatively planned to hear from baker 
on tuesday the senate armed services committee planned hearings 
nov 27 through nov 29 the week after the thanksgiving holiday 
sen jesse helms rnc said the campaign against iraqi 
president saddam hussein already has been damaged by the arguments 
about the presidents ability to commit american forces to war 
if i was saddam hussein i would be doing handsprings of 
joy helms said 
baker at a briefing for reporters said he hoped the nation 
could send a consistent and uniform signal referring to the 
debate over gulf policy baker said someone said one time that 
democracy can sometimes be messy and indeed thats true 
and i suppose it is easier to some extent in situations like 
this to operate as he saddam does by way of dictatorship baker 
said 
baker readily acknowledged there are sharp differences between 
congress and the white house about bushs authority to commit 
troops to action 
there is a genuine and substantial debate between the 
executive and legislative branches of this government and has been 
for quite some time about whether or not the war powers act for 
instance is constitutional baker said we think there are 
provisions in there that are clearly unconstitutional 
the 1973 act prompted by congressional discontent over the way 
us troops were used during the vietnam war requires the 
president to notify congress within 48 hours after american forces 
are put into a situation where they may become engaged in 
hostilities it also requires those forces to be withdrawn within 
90 days if congress doesnt declare war 
baker refused to elaborate on his pledge that bush would abide 
by the constitution 
what you cannot do in this period is speak to hypotheticals 
the secretary said the president feels very strongly as prior 
presidents before him have that he has a firm obligation to 
protect american citizens 
baker said the huge buildup of us troops did not mean the 
united states was plunging into war but it is important since 
we cannot rule out the option of force that we lay an appropriate 
political and military foundation for that option

defense minister moshe arens called the 
35monthold palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories a war on wednesday the eve of the anniversary of the 
palestinian declaration of statehood 
israel imposed widespread curfews in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip to prevent violence the move confined more than 420000 
of the territories 17 million arabs to their homes 
in other developments 
a jew a follower of assassinated militant rabbi meir kahane 
was arrested on suspicion he stabbed a jewish butcher and his arab 
employee on wednesday wounding them israel radio said it 
reported the man said he attacked the two because he opposed arab 
labor in israel 
labor minister david magen said the government was considering 
a policy that could cut by more than half the number of 
palestinians working in israel the 60000 freedup jobs would go 
to soviet jewish immigrants and unemployed israelis about 110000 
palestinians from the territories now work in israel 
the palestine liberation organizations parliamentinexile 
declared independence for the west bank and gaza strip at a meeting 
in algiers on nov 15 1988 some arab and thirdworld nations 
recognize the action but israel and most western countries do not 
foreign minister david levy told parliament on wednesday if 
anyone is dreaming about a palestinian state we will not allow it 
to be formed 
arens said israels struggle to put down the uprising was a 
war that cannot be fought through normal legal channels 
he was defending tuesdays sixmonth detention without trial of 
radwan abu ayash chief of the arab journalists union and ziad abu 
ziyad editor of a hebrewlanguage palestinian weekly 
the government said the two were plo activists who helped write 
leaflets encouraging recent stabbings of israelis 
arens told israel television most palestinians in the occupied 
lands had lost hope in the intefadeh or uprising 
they began this intefadeh with great expectactions that they 
would push israel to the wall so it would have no other choice but 
to form a palestinian state today the percent of the population 
in the west bank and gaza that has such hopes for the intefadeh is 
very small 
despite the curfews however some palestinians began 
anniversary celebrations early 
in gaza city schoolgirls marched and chanted proplo and 
proiraqi slogans arab reports said 
they said dozens of palestinians marched in nablus in the west 
bank and set off fireworks 
masked activists handed out leaflets at a rally at bethlehem 
university pledging the uprising would continue until we burn the 
land under the occupiers 
students clapped whistled and sang the palestinian anthem 
biladi biladi my homeland my homeland 
university spokesman mousa darwish told the rally palestinian 
aspirations for statehood persist 
some people say we have independence only on paper darwish 
said i say it is a growing hope in our hearts surrounded by 
barbed wire our martyrs and our wounded it is not an illusion it 
is a fact 
arens said israel would triumph over the antiisraeli violence 
that followed a riot on jerusalems temple mount in which at least 
17 palestinians were killed as police fired on stonethrowers 
a large part of our population is trained in the military a 
part of the population is armed and is on the streets there is the 
police there is the army there are the security forces and the 
civil guard we will triumph arens said on israel television 
near the town of jenin in the west bank the stabbed body of 
hussein mahmid 37 was found in a barrel arab reporters said he 
was killed for collaborating with israeli authorities 
his death brought to 299 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaboration 
at least 773 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the uprising which began in december 1987 
fiftytwo israelis have died in the violence

a congressional report released wednesday 
blames the office of mangement and budget for allowing a 
proliferation of misleading health claims on foods 
health claims have been increasing since 1987 when at the 
urging of the white house agency the food and drug administration 
proposed to permit health claims on food labels the report said 
the next year omb prohibited the fda from publishing a rule to 
bar some of the most misleading claims 
the white house office can take credit for supermarket shelves 
being flooded with misleading health claims said rep ted weiss 
dny chairman of the house governmental operations subcommittee 
on human resources and intergovernmental relations 
the report was based on an investigation by the subcommittee and 
was approved by the full committee 
omb last year abandoned its opposition and allowed the fda to 
propose a new regulation to curtail health claims however 
legislation recently passed by congress and signed by president 
bush also restricts those claims and in some ways conflicted with 
the stillpending proposal 
spokesman jeff nesbit said wednesday the fda is reviewing the 
bill the agency intends as soon as possible to either 
repropose the health claims regulation or amend it to incorporate 
the congressional language 
omb declined to comment on the report

thousands of workers nationwide marched wednesday 
to protest a proposed social security tax an issue that has allied 
communists and conservatives in the hopes they could topple the 
socialist government 
the tax controversy coincides with militant national protests by 
high school students demanding more government spending to improve 
their schools together the two campaigns present premier michel 
rocard with his greatest challenge since taking office in 1988 
rocard announced wednesday evening that the government would 
allocate an additional 900000 to improve the high school system 
the biggest protest wednesday was in paris where at least 
10000 members of a leftist labor federation marched to the 
national assembly one worker wore a rocard mask a santa claus 
costume and a sign that said his gift a tax 
about 4000 workers marched in marseille 3500 in le havre 
3000 in toulouse 2600 in lyon 1300 in grenoble and thousands 
more in other cities 
the demonstrations proceeded with few disturbances unlike the 
most recent student protests monday when gangs of toughs went on a 
looting and carburning rampage during a march in paris by 100000 
youths 
the only significant confrontation wednesday occurred in 
marseille where marchers tried to push away barricades outside a 
government building riot police fired tear gas to repel the 
demonstrators 
rocard has accused his critics of deliberately misrepresenting 
the proposed tax known as the generalized social contribution it 
would be levied at 11 percent of all income including investment 
earnings 
the government insists that low and middleincome workers will 
come out ahead under the plan because of adjustments made to other 
levies but critics say the net effect will be to tax individuals 
more and companies less and they also worry that the levy rate may 
rise in future years 
the debate over the tax has taken on added significance because 
the communist party has committed itself to voting with the 
rightist opposition for a noconfidence motion over the bill such 
a motion is expected next week in the national assembly and the 
government could fall if it passed 
the socialists hold only 272 of the national assemblys 577 
seats 17 short on an outright majority they have defeated 
previous censure motions through abstentions by the communists who 
hold 26 seats

the food and drug administration took action 
wednesday aimed at making it harder for generic drug companies to 
cheat on tests needed to win agency approval for their products 
the fda said it has begun requiring all testing laboratories to 
retain for five years samples of drugs tested to ensure that 
generics are substantially the same as the brand name drug from 
which they are copied 
currently the labs are not required to retain samples 
in some previous instances of cheating generic drug companies 
have substituted a brandname drug for their own in tests to 
determine whether the two versions act the same in the body 
in these instances where products were switched the brand name 
drug was compared with itself rather than with the product to be 
approved 
the agency said the samples that now have to be retained can be 
used as evidence in investigations into wrongdoing 
the requirement applies to all drug products whether generic or 
brand name that are tested for equivalence of action 
genberic drugs are sold by companies who manufacture them after 
the patent on the brandname equivalent has expired

the soviet government announced a shakeup of the 
state television monopoly wednesday creating four separate 
companies in a move intended to increase competition and improve 
quality 
leonid p kravchenko 52 was named as the new head of the state 
committee for television and radio known in russian as 
gosteleradio he has been the directorgeneral of the official tass 
news agency since 1988 
he replaces mikhail nenashev who will become chairman of the 
soviet committee on the press nanashev is under orders to propose 
fundamental reforms in the structure of the print media 
both personnel changes were made by decree of president mikhail 
s gorbachev kravchenkos successor as head of tass has not been 
named 
the government newspaper izvestia reported that instead of one 
central television station with four channels gosteleradio has 
decided to make each channel an independent company with full 
creative and commercial independence 
the first company channel one will continue to carry the 
countrys principal news programs and remain an outlet for 
government information and cultural programming its directors will 
be gorbachev the supreme soviet legislature and the national 
government 
the second company to be called commonwealth will be 
devoted to programming from studios in the 15 soviet republics 
a new moscow tv company a jointstock enterprise will run the 
third channel the original stockholders will be gosteleradio the 
moscow city council the moscow regional council and various public 
organizations 
the fourth company called 21st century tv will take the 
current educational channel as its base gosteleradio said writers 
and artists unions and other public organizations have been 
invited to become its founders 
leningrad tv the only channel that has been independent of 
central television also is being invited to form a joint stock 
company izvestia said 
gosteleradio said the changes would democratize the artistic 
process strengthen the spirit of competition and as a result 
raise the quality of broadcasting 
gosteleradio itself will be among the founders of all four new 
companies because it controls virtually all the equipment and 
existing broadcast revenues izvestia said 
in a presidential decree carried wednesday by tass gorbachev 
gave nenashev two weeks to submit proposals for reforming the 
committee on the press 
the decree says a major reorganization of the press is needed to 
ensure citizens rights to receive and disseminate information 
broader rights for publishing houses and printing enterprises and 
delineation of the functions of central and localauthorities 
earlier this year the supreme soviet passed a new law on 
freedom of the press giving legal backbone to gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost or greater openness 
in the past year several leading soviet publications including 
the weekly newspaper moscow news and the magazine ogonyok have 
gained formal independence from ownership by government and 
communist organizations but most newspapers and magazines still 
belong to political bodies or state organizations 
the reorganization of the press could pave the way for more 
independent publications and privately owned profitmaking 
publishing houses

federal savings and loan regulators wednesday 
filed claims for 68 billion against drexel burnham lambert inc 
alleging the firm plundered more than 40 failed thrifts through 
junk bond and other securities 
the claims are by far the largest in the collapse of the 
nations savings and loans they also for the first time place 
much of the blame on drexel which managed most of the 15 billion 
in junk bonds sold to thrifts 
the filing in us bankruptcy court charges that the collapsed 
wall street investment bank engaged in bribery coercion 
extortion fraud and other illegal activities that created huge 
losses for the savings and loans 
the federal deposit insurance corp and the resolution trust 
corp also said they would seek recovery from two funds established 
with 750 million from drexel and its former junkbond leader 
michael milken the money is meant to compensate investors in 
frauds drexel and milken already have admitted 
the two agencies claimed drexel monopolized the 200 billion 
highyield debt securities market and maintained an appearance of 
activity when none existed disguising and delaying losses on the 
thrifts junkbond portfolios 
among the thrifts listed in the fdic and resolution trust claim 
are major drexel clients involved in civil lawsuits around the 
country they include columbia savings and loan association and 
lincoln savings and loan association in california and centrust 
bank in miami 
drexel which sought chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in 
february faces billions of dollars more in claims in more than 100 
civil lawsuits filed by investors shareholders and former clients 
the fdic and rtc claims are based on losses incurred by the 
failed thrifts on investments in highyield debt securities 
underwritten or managed by drexel the junk bond market collapsed 
about a year ago devastating the value of these securities 
the fdic insures deposits for the nations savings and loans 
resolution trust oversees the federal thrift bailout and has taken 
over more than 100 failed savings and loans 
drexel said the claims reflect that the firm has become a 
convenient scapegoat for the sampl crisis as various agencies and 
branches of the government attempt to deflect their own 
responsibility at the expense of parties to the firms bankruptcy 
proceedings 
regardless of the number of zeros in the claims of the 
government drexel intends to vigorously defend against them in 
the bankruptcy proceedings a statement said in court the 
conduct of regulators and others chiefly responsible for the sampl 
debacle will be the real issue 
l william seidman chairman of the fdic and resolution trust 
said in a statement that the drexel investigation is among the 
most extensive ever undertaken by federal banking agencies 
but we still have much more to do to ensure that we identify 
and recover all the losses caused by drexel he said the 
american taxpayers who are paying the bill for the sampl bailout 
expect no less from us 
the government bailout is expected to cost taxpayers 500 
billion over the next 30 years 
seidman said the two agencies are considering possible civil 
claims against drexel milken and other participants in the alleged 
frauds by the firm 
the agencies claimed drexel made misrepresentations about the 
sale of the bonds and gave payoffs to managers of some sampls 
involved in alleged illegal trading with drexel 
the agencies also said drexel engaged in anticompetitive 
practices and threatened stock manipulation against public 
companies that did not retain drexel as an investment banker 
the fdic and rtc said in a statement that the claims reflect 
total junk bond losses to date of 2 billion the alleged damages 
were tripled under federal antitrust and racketeering laws for a 
total of 6 billion 
the filing includes other claims totaling 800 million for 
alleged illegal trading unrelated to junk bonds involving 15 failed 
thrifts 
those include a 517 million fraud allegation in the sale of 
government securities filed in dallas federal court on behalf of 
guarantyfederal savings and loan of dallas the agencies said 
the claims by far exceed drexels current assets of about 3 
billion and 285 billion in liabilities the assets do not reflect 
the value of the firms junk bond portfolio and stock investments 
in drexelmanaged takeover deals 
claims on the restitution funds to be administered by the 
securities and exchange commission to compensate investors for 
wrongdoing by drexel and milken would be in addition to the total 
alleged damages 
milken must place 400 million into the fund after he is 
sentenced for six felony counts to which he pleaded guilty in 
april sentencing was scheduled for next week 
drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts last year it has 
placed 200 million into the sec fund but 150 million has yet to 
be paid and is tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings 
through their lawyers drexel and milken have denied any role in 
the collapse of the savings and loans at a presentencing hearing 
for milken former drexel employees did state that drexel engaged 
in illegal activity with at least one major thrift

an 8yearold boy impaled on a 
halfinchthick steel rod was upgraded to serious condition 
wednesday just two days after the thick spike punched through his 
heart and destroyed one jugular vein in his neck 
this is one in a billion said dr phillip richemont one of 
three university medical center surgeons who spent almost 2 hours 
monday extracting the section of steel rod from justin stiners 
chest and neck 
the 4foot10 86pound thirdgrader fell off the roof of a 
house in sierra vista while playing with a friend monday he fell 
onto a 4foot section of the threaded rod similar to rebar 
used for reinforcing concrete that was sticking out of the ground 
surgeons were stunned to find that although the rod had pierced 
the heart in two places and divided the jugular vein it didnt 
bleed its amazing richemont said 
the heart tissue seemingly contracted down between the 
threads cutting off bleeding richemont said 
justin hung on the rod about 2 feet off the ground for about 20 
minutes alert the whole time before paramedics cut off a 2foot 
piece of the rod without disturbing the 18inch section that 
penetrated his body 
he was flown by helicopter about 80 miles to tucson surgery did 
not begin until about 3 hours after the accident said dr michael 
esser who operated on the boy 
paramedics said the boy was calm throughout the trip to the 
hospital 
what makes this so interesting is the amount of time it took 
until he got to the hospital and yet he lived richemont 
said 
on arrival at tucson justin wanted to know if i was going to 
remove it he was very cooperative richemont said 
the rod was unscrewed from justins neck and body while the boy 
was on a heartbypass machine richemont said 
the bar had pierced his body several inches above the navel and 
just below the breastbone it tore through the bottom of his 
hearts right ventricle and exited the top of the chamber 
his mother amanda stiner said wednesday her son hasnt 
comprehended yet the seriousness of his injuries this morning is 
the first time he found out he was cut open she said 
the doctors have told me how lucky he was they said that it 
was just a miracle that he lived 
she said he underwent testing wednesday because of abdominal 
pains but later in the day he was moved from an intensive care 
unit to the centers regular pediatric unita spokeswoman said 
ms stiner 31 said doctors told her justin might be released 
early next week barring complications 
ms stiner described her son as a climber always on trees on 
the roof and said he told doctors wednesday that it was like 
falling in slow motion 
she added that he told her hes not climbing on nothing in 
the future 
esser and richemont said the right side of the heart has about 
onethird the blood pressure of the left side 
he would have bled to death if it had been on the left side 
esser said hes one lucky kid it just didnt hit any arterial 
structures 
after leaving the heart the rod missed the aorta and pulmonary 
arteries cut the thymus gland tore the right interior jugular 
vein in half and skimmed off the carotid artery but did not exit 
his neck said the doctors and hospital spokeswoman peggy rowley 
the boys severed jugular which returns blood from the head to 
the heart was simply tied off but that will pose no problems 
because other veins would provide needed circulation esser said 
justins condition was upgraded from critical to serious 
wednesday morning and he remained in intensive care said ms 
rowley 
when justin awoke tuesday he asked for two things some ice to 
soothe his throat since he wasnt allowed to eat or drink and to 
play nintendo richemont said 
he probably just thinks this is kind of a slight inconvenience 
in his life esser said

iraq on wednesday accused the united states of looking for a 
fight but president bush told congressional leaders he has no 
immediate plans to go to war in the persian gulf 
saudi arabia meanwhile said any arab summit would fail unless 
iraq agreed in advance to withdraw from kuwait moroccos king 
hassan had appealed last week for an emergency summit saying it 
might be the last chance for peace 
the united states was putting pressure on japan to do more for 
the effort to drive iraq out of kuwait vice president dan quayle 
in tokyo thanked prime minister toshiki kaifu for japans 
financial support but suggested that a japanese presence in the 
gulf would demonstrate a far greater commitment 
the state department said two americans were to leave iraq on 
wednesday and thursday the department did not release their 
identities or further details 
iraq has been releasing scores of western hostages in recent 
weeks including some who have been held as human shields at 
strategic installations to deter a possible attack 
bushs meeting with lawmakers came against a backdrop of growing 
congressional concern about the scope of us military involvement 
in the gulf the president announced last week that 200000 new 
us troops would be sent to provide an offensive military 
option for use against iraq that will nearly double us troop 
strength in the region now at about 230000 
senate majority leader george mitchell said after talking with 
bush that the buildup is not in and of itself a decision to use 
force but rather is intended to create credible options 
democratic leaders told bush they believe the constitution would 
require him to seek congressional authorization before using 
military force in the gulf secretary of state james a baker iii 
said bush would follow the constitution but added that there 
was some question about its interpretation 
the first of several hundred american m1a1 tanks rolled into 
saudi arabia on wednesday night to give us forces a bigger edge 
against the iraqis the m1a1 abrams tanks the armys premiere 
ground combat weapon will replace m1 tanks in all frontline army 
units deployed in saudi arabia 
iraq has been assailing the us buildup as proof of aggressive 
intentions on wednesday it did so again denouncing plans for 
amphibious assault exercises by us marines in saudi arabia 
the pentagon had disclosed the plans on tuesday for the 
maneuvers the first such exercises staged in saudi arabia but did 
not say where or when they would take place the washington times 
reported they would be be held 10 miles from kuwait 
the iraqi statement carried by the official iraqi news agency 
and quoting an unidentified government official called the planned 
maneuvers an intended provocation close to the iraqi border 
meanwhile iaqs foreign minister tariq aziz lobbied the 
united nations security council seeking to block any move to use 
force against iraq aziz complained that the united states had 
been planning since the very outset to attack iraq 
a resolution on use of force could be vetoed by any of the 
security councils five permanent members among them france 
china and the soviet union have indicated they want to give the 
economic sanctions and diplomacy more time 
britain the other permanent member besides the united states 
is said to be building up its forces in the region the times of 
london reported wednesday that britain was expected to send an 
additional 6000 troops to the gulf increasing its ground forces 
there to 15500 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who is locked in a 
parliamentary battle to keep her job has made a series of strongly 
worded demands in recent days that iraq relinquish kuwait those 
comments drew scorn from information minister latif jassim 
the beating of war drums by thatcher reflects the acute 
psychological condition she lives in while she is preparing to 
leave the leadership of her party the iraqi news agency quoted 
him as saying 
in an effort to solidify support baker will meet saturday in 
geneva with the foreign ministers of ethiopia ivory coast and 
zaire which are all members of the un security council he hopes 
to persuade them to support a resolution authorizing the use of 
force to expel iraq from kuwait officials said 
there has also been a flurry of arab diplomatic activity since 
moroccos call for an emergency arab summit but divisions appeared 
to deepen on wednesday 
saudi arabian foreign minister prince saud alfaisal arriving 
in the united arab emirates said the only way such a gathering 
could succeed would be for iraq to agree in advance to withdraw 
from kuwait which it seized aug 2 
any arab meetings will bear no fruit or results unless iraq 
announces it agrees to implement the resolutions of the emergency 
arab summit held in cairo in august and the international 
resolutions that call for a pullout of iraqi troops and the 
restoration of kuwaiti legitimacy he said in a statement 
distributed by the official emirates news agency wam 
iraq made it clear any such promise was highly unlikely 
president saddam husseins secondincommand taha yassin ramadan 
went to morocco for talks and said on his return that any arab 
gathering should instead erase the infamous cairo summit 
resolutions 
just after the invasion 14 of the arab leagues 21 members 
meeting in the egyptian capital voted to condemn iraq and demanded 
a restoration of kuwaits former government 
in other highlevel talks in the arab world on wednesday 
egyptian president hosni mubarak was in syria and iraqi deputy 
prime minister saadoun hamadi met with algerias president two 
soviet envoys were also in the region 
in other developments 
bush notified congress he was extending for an additional 90 
days the callup for reservists already serving 90day stints in 
the gulf region the move had been expected 
former nicaraguan president daniel ortega became the latest 
outofpower leader to try his hand at peacemaking in the gulf 
arriving in baghdad on wednesday ortega whose leftist sandinista 
administration waged a long war with usbacked contra rebels

marks had no visible reaction when the sentence was announced by 
state district judge frank davis and he was led from the courtroom 
in handcuffs about 40 people showed up at the sentencing 
including marks brother bob former speaker of the montana house 
marks pleaded guilty july 9 to four counts of felony sexual 
assault for molesting four of his elementary school students 
between 1985 and 1989 the fathers of two of those boys said they 
too had been victims of marks years ago 
prosecutors said marks molested many other male students during 
his lengthy teaching career in boulder and nearby clancy

investigation that resulted in the charges and who took his 
complaints public was in the courtroom 
it was more than i expected he said i thought he was 
going to get away with no prison time 
davis sentenced marks to a 40year term but suspended 20 years 
davis also said if marks is paroled he can have no contact with 
anyone younger than 18 years old 
at a hearing last week davis refused to allow some of marks 
victims to testify saying i wasnt going to embarrass this poor 
man any more 
marks should be eligible for parole in about five years 
llewellyn said davis said marks could not be paroled until he paid 
the 25000 fine which would be used to pay for counseling of his 
victims and other youths involved in sex crimes 
marks is a member of a prominent local family that owns 
substantial ranch property in the helenaboulder area and a sawmill 
in clancy 
llewellyn said he was satisfied with the sentence adding that 
marks had shown little remorse for the victims 
defense lawyer richard gillespie had asked that marks be 
sentenced to a treatment program and 238 days in jail most of 
which would have been served on weekends 
llewellyn took issue with suggestions by some that investigators 
acted too slowly in bringing marks to justice he said the state 
acted as quickly as it could interviewing dozens of witnesses in 
several states 
marks had built a reputation as a devoted and selfless teacher 
in boulder but questions about his morals were raised as early as 
1959 
he was forced to resign from jefferson county high school that 
year after three boys said he molested them but he later taught at 
nearby clancy and then returned to boulder in 1965 as an elementary 
school teacher 
in a related development tuesday boulder school officials said 
an independent investigation had shown that five people had 
reported improper conduct by marks to school officials 
the school board hired two investigators in september to look 
into allegations that school officals were slow to act on 
complaints about marks the investigators reported their findings 
to a board committee at a closed meeting monday 
superintendent of schools richard moe said the boards conduct 
committee is reviewing information and giving anyone who allegedly 
acted improperly a chance to respond he would not elaborate

france tested a nuclear weapon wednesday in the 
south pacific and publicly announced the explosion in keeping with 
a new policy new zealand quickly condemned the test 
the french defense ministry said a device with explosive power 
below 100 kilotons was detonated at fangataufa in french polynesia 
one kiloton has the explosive force of 1000 tons of tnt 
over the previous 15 years france had refused to comment on its 
nuclear tests in the south pacific word of such tests came from an 
observation station operated by new zealand in the cook islands 
in may president francois mitterrand announced during a trip to 
the south pacific that france would begin announcing the tests 
which many countries in the region oppose french officials also 
said the number of tests would be reduced from eight to six 
annually 
wednesdays test was the fifth under the new disclosure policy 
in wellington new zealand deputy prime minister don mckinnon 
on thursday denounced the test 
i want to make it clear the government opposes nuclear 
testing in our region he said his statement added that it is 
all the more disappointing when a country which we regard as a 
friend continues to ignore the concerns of new zealanders and of 
all the people in the south pacific

the reputations and careers of five us 
senators are at stake as the senate ethics committee begins public 
hearings thursday into their actions on behalf of highflying 
savingsandloan owner charles h keating jr 
the televised hearings will offer a dramatic glimpse into the 
roles of the keating five in one of the nations biggest 
financial debacles the collapse of keatings lincoln savings and 
loan in a failure that may cost taxpayers 2 billion 
the hearings are in effect a trial for republican sen john 
mccain of arizona and democrats john glenn of ohio donald w 
riegle jr of michigan dennis deconcini of arizona and alan 
cranston of california 
each of the five denies any wrongdoing 
their involvement has become a symbol of the larger sampl industry 
collapse and the outcome of the proceedings could intensify 
political ramifications of what so far has been a bipartisan 
scandal 
its not just the five senators but the whole senate whose 
integrity and credibility is on the line said fred wertheimer 
head common cause whose complaint last year began the committees 
proceedings 
individual political futures are on the line for all but 
cranston 
he said last week that he has prostate cancer and wont seek 
reelection in 1992 he also gave up his position as whip the no 
2 democratic senate leadership post 
each of the five intervened with federal banking regulators on 
behalf of keatings irvine califbased thrift before it was 
seized by the government in april 1989 
each also received money totaling 13 million in campaign 
contributions or donations to favored causes from keating and his 
associates each denies any connection between eatings money and 
intervention with regulators 
the basic issue is whether any of the keating five violated 
senate rules against exerting improper influence in return for 
compensation 
the question has enormous ramifications for the three democrats 
and three republicans who sit in judgment on the ethics panel and 
for the senate itself 
members of congress routinely intervene with the federal 
government for constituents contributors and friends where the 
line of impropriety falls is an uncomfortable issue for congress 
technically the initial question is more narrow the committee 
scrutiny is still in its preliminary stage and the panel is to 
decide whether investigations should be advanced or terminated for 
any of the five 
the committee ultimately could vote to rebuke any of the five or 
recommend to the full senate a more serious punishment such as 
censure or expulsion 
on wednesday cranston released a letter to the committee saying 
that one of its members sen jesse helms rnc made remarks in 
his recent reelection campaign that reveal an absence of 
impartiality 
cranstons attorney william taylor said helms criticized his 
opponent for receiving 5000 from cranstons political action 
committee taylor also cited news accounts quoting helms as calling 
cranston the leading water carrier for keating 
a receptionist at helms office said neither helms nor his press 
spokesman was available to respond cranston will make an opening 
statement before the panel but will not testify because he is 
undergoing radiation therapy 
the ethics panel is chaired by sen howell heflin dala the 
chief counsel is robert s bennett a prominent washington lawyer 
bennett will present evidence lawyers for each of the five will 
crossexamine witnesses and present their own cases committee 
members will question them as well 
despite the triallike qualities bennett who declined to 
discuss his evidence said he wont function as a prosecutor 
what is important in this proceeding is that there be a full 
disclosure of the facts that justice be done to each of the five 
senators and we are dealing with five separate cases he said 
i as special counsel am here to assist the committee in reaching 
the right result and explain to the public what occurred and what 
did not occur 
it was unlikely keating would be called to testify 
congressional sources said he has not been granted immunity and 
its expected he would refuse to testify citing constitutional 
rights against selfincrimination as he did before the house 
banking committee last year 
the hearings are scheduled to run the rest of this week and 
first two days of next week heflin has said they may take 10 days 
but the abundance of lawyers and openended time for questioning 
may make it run much longer 
the committee has denied requests by glenn and mccain for 
separate hearings 
to get to this stage the ethics committee apparently ignored 
its chief counsels private recommendation that proceedings be 
dropped against mccain and glenn 
its decision to proceed with hearings on all five postponed the 
issue beyond last weeks election that kept the bipartisan keating 
five from becoming a democratsonly group of three and thus 
avoided handing republicans a potent partisan cudgel 
republican mccain denounced the delay as political cowardice 
his top aide chris koch said mccain ended his friendship with 
keating on march 24 1987 when keating asked the senator to 
negotiate with regulators on his behalf 
john refused to do it for him koch said 
the scandal already has taken an enormous political toll on each 
of the five 
voter exit polling in the senators states last week found 40 
percent thought cranston should resign immediately in ohio 39 
percent thought glenn should not run again when his term expires in 
1992 and 18 percent thought he should resign 
deconcini wrote to some 5000 supporters this week 
you may hear derogatory statements about me and my office but 
i can assure you that i have not betrayed my public trust nor do i 
intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their 
dealings with our government deconcini wrote 
riegle whos not up for reelection until 1994 is chairman of 
the senate banking committee 
theres no smoking gun on don riegle said his lawyer 
thomas green 
glenn the first american astronaut to orbit the earth has 
called the keating affair the worst thing ive ever been 
through he said he attended the meetings only to determine if 
lincoln was being treated fairly 
the cable network cspan will televise the hearings

hunters fled for their lives and the 
governor wednesday called out the national guard as a windwhipped 
wildfire blackened at least 34000 acres of timber and grassland 
near the missouri river 
after gov stan stephens issued his call 40 guardsmen and extra 
equipment joined 400 firefighters battling the blaze other 
firefighters were brought in from indian reservations and a prison 
the cause of the fire was under investigation authorities 
believed it started tuesday night in a hunting camp in the big belt 
mountains about 35 miles northeast of helena 
no injuries were reported but authorities worried that deer and 
elk hunters could still be trapped at remote campsites 
by early evening lewis and clark county sheriff chuck oreilly 
said searchers in aircraft found no sign of trapped hunters there 
were no reports of anyone missing 
everybody we know of up there is accounted for oreilly 
said 
about two dozen hunters fled their backcountry camps late 
tuesday when the fire raged through the remote gates of the 
mountains wilderness and adjacent beartooth game range 
butch hestekin said a wall of flames seven miles wide just 
whipped across the tops of the trees at his camp hestekins 
hunting party abandoned five pickup trucks and their belongings in 
their rush to flee 
the cinders were falling on us said hunter lynn dumas we 
had five minutes warning just about enough time to saddle a 
horse 
bob michaelson said he saw flames destroy four pickup trucks and 
four camping vehicles hunters freed their extra horses while the 
heat caused ammunition to explode and the chrome on vehicles to 
melt 
about 180 miles northeast of the missouri river blaze fire 
authorities reported containment of a separate 33000acre grass 
and timber fire on the fort belknap indian reservation 
i guess the key factor is what the winds do to us today

that blaze had burned at least one mobile home several barns 
and had killed a cow fire officials said no injuries were 
reported the fires cause was under investigation 
no other structures were damaged missouri river fire but at

came within about two miles of the small town of craig which the 
river protects 
about 10 to 15 hunters jumped into elkhorn creek on tuesday 
night as the fire passed over them said lorraine parrish a 
spokeswoman at the interagency dispatch center near helena 
recordhigh temperatures extremely dry conditions for 
midnovember and winds up to 30 mph helped the blaze spread said 
fire officials

secretary of defense dick cheney on wednesday 
authorized the military services to call up 72500 more reservists 
and national guard members because of the situation in the persian 
gulf 
his action brings to 125000 the number of army navy air force 
and marine corps reservists who can be on active duty the limit 
had been 48800 before friday and 52500 before wednesdays 
announcement 
his action had been expected in the wake of president bushs 
decision last week to order an additional 200000 troops to the 
gulf region in addition to the approximately 230000 already 
there 
the president said the expansion was necessary to enable the 
united states to go on the offensive 
the administration had previously said that the mission of the 
troops sent to saudi arabia after iraq invaded neighboring kuwait 
on aug 2 was defensive 
cheneys action raises the callup ceilings from 25000 to 
80000 for the army from 14500 to 20000 for the air force and 
from 3000 to 15000 for the marine corps 
last friday the ceiling for naval reservists was raised from 
6300 to 10000 
cheney also extended to the army the authority previously 
granted to the other services to call reserve combat units to duty 
if needed the earlier orders had limited the army to support 
units 
combat units may be ordered to undergo refresher training before 
they are sent overseas the pentagon said 
todays armed forces are designed with combat support and 
combat service support built into the reserves cheney said as 
we increase the deployment of active duty forces we must also call 
upon more members of the national guard and reserve to get the 
supporting forces we need cheney said 
earlier wednesday bush extended the tour of active duty for the 
reservists from 90 to 180 days the original order in august had 
specified 90 days subject to an additional 90 by presidential 
action 
congress has passed legislation permitting combat reserves to be 
called up for an additional 180 days by presidential action but 
cheney said the defense department has not yet asked the president 
for such authority 
since cheneys original order on aug 23 there have been 35562 
reservists called to active duty they include 24524 in the army 
4616 in the navy 5278 in the air force and 1144 by the marine 
corps in addition the coast guard has called up 511 
also on wednesday the navy announced it was activating 17 
medical public affairs and construction units of the naval reserve 
in 13 states 
that announcement said 62 reservists are being called to active 
duty from the 17 units the activation of a reserve unit may not 
involve the entire unit the navy said 
the units with their missions are

the prime minister of luxembourg told 
parliament wednesday that nato organized a network of clandestine 
resistance fighters at the start of the cold war 
nato was the initiator and the coordinator but each member 
nation was master of its own operation prime minister jacque 
santer said adding that virtually all the european nations in nato 
took part he said the network was recently disbanded in 
luxembourg 
nato officials have refused to comment on the alliances role in 
the network of guerrilla groups organized as part of preparations 
for a possible soviet attack 
nato does not comment on matters of security said a 
spokesman at nato headquarters 
former nato secretary general joseph luns said he had never 
heard of the guerrilla network but acknowledged it could have 
operated behind his back 
the government of luxembourg said it participated in an allied 
network of guerrilla operatives 
the very principle of such a concept of patriotic resistance 
cannot be disputed in the strategic context at that time the 
government said referring to the start of the cold war 
the guerrilla network was brought to light last month in italy 
where it takes its name operation gladio from the swords used 
by roman gladiators in italy gladio is under investigation for 
possible links to rightwing terrorism a similar inquiry is under 
way in belgium 
the existence of the resistance networks has been disclosed in 
italy germany france belgium the netherlands denmark norway 
austria spain greece and portugal the guerrilla groups became 
public knowledge years ago in norway and turkey but debate in 
those countries drew little notice elsewhere 
on wednesday guy coeme belgiums defense minister 
acknowledged the existence of a belgian network codenamed stay 
behind 
he said it was in touch with similar groups in other nato 
nations through a coordination committee that most recently met in 
brussels in october but coeme said he could not say now what 
links the belgian network had with nato 
in bonn the german government confirmed plans for covert 
anticommunist actions in case of war but denied any military unit 
took part 
reports that link the precautions mentioned with expressions 
like commando group or guerrilla army are false government 
spokesman hans klein said without elaboration 
the german newspaper die welt reported wednesday that us 
intelligence agents recruited hundreds of guerrillas and laid 
weapons caches across western europe at the start of the cold war 
jean gol a former belgian justice minister was quoted 
wednesday as saying the government knew of a secret anticommunist 
network in belgium 
shortly after i became minister of justice on jan 16 1984 
i was informed about the belgian network gol told the daily 
newspaper le peuple he said belgiums 1984 budget contained 
328000 to modernize the networks communication equipment 
in turkey the independent daily milliyet said a unit known as 
the special war department within the general staff was most likely 
the turkish branch of operation gladio 
it quoted former premier bulent ecevit as saying the unit had 
been funded by the united states until 1974 after that he said 
the unit sought funds from the defense budget 
patriotic volunteers were members of the group they were 
trained specially to launch a counter guerrilla operation in the 
event that the country was occupied ecevit was quoted as saying 
existence of the turkish group was well known and often became 
the focus of debate in political circles and newspapers during a 
wave of terrorism in 1970s leftist groups questioned the possible 
role of the organization in rightwing terrorism 
british intelligence expert nigel west said wednesday that us 
and british agents were heavily involved in creating european 
resistance networks 
in a telephone interview in london west editor of intelligence 
quarterly magazine said such networks were often continuations of 
plans first created in world war ii 
initially they arose out of allied desire not to repeat wartime 
mistakes when german advances caught allies without plans for 
staybehind fighters said west pen name of conservative 
lawmaker rupert allason author of books on britains mi5 and mi6 
security services 
he said such operations in britain were disbanded because a 
soviet invasion of britain has never been regarded as a tactical 
practicality 
but he added that curiously enough they still find caches of 
arms in funny places

the spurned indian candidate for un high 
commissioner of refugees on wednesday slammed western nations that 
opposed him as racists who feel the commissioner has to carry the 
burden of the white man 
virendra dayal chief of staff to secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar ran into a wall of opposition from the united states 
and other western nations when the un chief circulated his name 
last week 
dayal withdrew from consideration on tuesday 
western and third world countries want a strong independent new 
high commissioner who can appeal for more funds and public support 
for refugees 
there are some people in some capitals who are more 
comfortable with secondlevel politicians from the first world 
rather than firstrate international civil servants from the third 
world dayal told reporters 
ive been stabbed in a dark alley by assassins who have not 
disclosed who they are youre darned right im bitter im also 
angry 
dayal said claims by some governments including the state 
department they were been consulted were untrue 
dayal blamed racism 
it is a feeling that a western european has to carry the 
burden of the white man its not personal its just that some 
jobs are not meant to be taken by a noneuropean its as simple as 
that dayal said 
among those who emerged as alternatives are candidates from 
norway austria canada france japan and britain 
dayal accused outgoing commissioner thorvald stoltenberg of 
norway of lobbying on behalf of norways former un ambassador 
tom vraalsen 
the un high commissioner for refugees who serves a threeyear 
term is traditionally a western european or someone backed by 
europeans and americans the office is responsible for protecting 
15 million refugees

the panamanian government cited a set of newly 
discovered taped telephone calls by manuel noriega when it asked a 
federal judge wednesday to prohibit the ousted dictator from 
transferring any of his funds 
attorneys for the new panamanian government said one of the 
audio tapes obtained and broadcast by cable news network last week 
indicates noriega tried to move millions of dollars around the 
world from his prison cell 
us district judge edward davis who is overseeing panamas 
civil lawsuit against noriega did not immedidately rule on the 
request by panamas attorneys for a temporary restraining order 
the new panamanian government has filed a 63 billion lawsuit 
against noriega alleging he looted its treasury before us troops 
deposed him in december 1989 the panamania government estimates 
noriegas personal fortune including property is 300 million 
about 20 million in noriega bank accounts has been frozen in the 
united states and several other countries us officials said 
davis said us district judge william hoeveler who is 
overseeing a separate criminal case against noriega told him 
earlier wednesday there were no funds available to noriega 
washingtonbased attorney john kester representing the 
panamanian government argued any noriega oney that surfaced 
except what was necessary to pay for his criminal defense should 
be frozen 
from the tapes we believe that hes making hundreds of 
telephone calls apparently moving funds hes not just talking to 
his lawyers kester told davis for all we know hes on the 
phone right now moving money around 
noriegas attorney in the civil case stephen zukoff said the 
court had no right to act because the violations alleged in the 
lawsuit all took place in panama not the united states he also 
said noriega could not be sued under the geneva convention 
this court does not have jurisdiction zukoff said 
general noriega was brought here as a prisoner of war and is 
entitled to certain rights he does have certain immunity 
davis asked both sides to attempt a compromise on the money 
issue and set another hearing for nov 27 
noriega is being held on drugtrafficking charges at the 
metropolitan correctional center where he apparently made the 
telephone calls that were recorded and later broadcast by cnn

the struggle for control of the southern baptist convention 
moved to the states this week as moderates and conservatives vied 
for leadership and grappled with mission spending and control of 
colleges 
moderate members of the nations largest protestant denomination 
appeared wednesday to continue their historic domination of state 
conventions fundamentalists hold sway at the national level 
moderates have contended in recent years they have been stripped 
of a voice because the conservativecontrolled national convention 
decides which missions seminaries and other programs get sbc 
funds 
by maintaining control at the state level moderates say they 
are able to have at least some pull in how funds are spent even 
though the state and national conventions operate autonomously 
conservatives have taken over the national convention because 
of the deceit that says there is liberalism among moderates 
said the rev bill sherman pastor of nashvilles woodmont baptist 
church and a moderate leader 
but when you come down to the state level no one can hang a 
liberal label on a pastor because other baptists know him and have 
heard him preach sherman said 
however the rev charles sullivan a conservative national 
executive committee chairman said fundamentalists dont have 
absolute control at the state level because most have fulltime 
jobs along with their church duties and cant attend both state 
and national conventions 
conservative baptists over the past 12 years have taken control 
of the 149 millionmember denominations national executive 
committee and presidency moderates already were strong in most 
state conventions 
fundamentalists or conservatives insist the scriptures be 
interpreted literally while moderates believe portions of the 
bible are written figuratively 
state representatives this week chose moderate presidents over 
conservative candidates in tennessee kentucky georgia and north 
carolina 
both moderates and fundamentalists claimed victory when north 
carolina baptists approved a resolution that gives individual 
churches the options of saying how the national convention spends 
their money 
fundamentalists claimed other victories 
in south carolina where moderates have held sway for years 
state representatives elected a fundamentalist president wednesday 
florida oklahoma and west virginia also elected 
conservativebacked presidents while officers in new mexico and 
other states proclaimed neutrality 
also in oklahoma resolutions were adopted calling for tighter 
state restrictons on abortion and to keep strong control over 
oklahoma baptist university fearing it may try to break from 
conservative control 
in other action in texas and south carolina representatives 
debated actions by baylor university and furman university trustees 
to take control over their own boards of trustees 
state organizations previously had chosen trustees for both 
colleges but school administrators said they feared a takeover by 
conservatives and gave trustees authority to elect their 
replacements 
texas baptists on wednesday agreed to place in escrow the state 
organizations 68 million allocation to baylor for 1991 until the 
issue is resolved

the pentagon has ordered moe than 7500 
employees trimmed from seven air force logistics command bases 
including more than 1400 from utahs hill air force base a 
congressman said wednesday 
rep james hansen rutah confirmed his office was notified 
that 1427 hill workers would be among those targeted in a 
nationwide reduction 
a letter hansen received from the department of the air force

kelly air force base in texas must get rid of 1213 workers 
robins in georgia 907 mcclellan in california 811 newark in 
ohio 709 and wrightpatterson also in ohio 240 hansen said 
some cuts are inevitable mccurdy said the defense budget 
is declining when you lose 180 billion over five years there are 
going to be some reductions 
hansen said changing international politics also made the 
cutbacks inevitable 
the reduction would affect about 5 percent of hills work force 
hansen said it was not real dire news for utahs defense 
industry 
a lot of these will be handled by attrition and the 
likelihood of legislation to allow for early out retirements is 
high hansen said 
the reduction was ordered for 1991 but hansen said that didnt 
mean workers would be forced out in january 
theyre going to give the people some lead time im 
looking at march or april he said 
in a prepared statement hill officials said no specific date 
had been decided for the reductions 
the statement said gen charles c mcdonald commander of air 
force logistics requested in september the congressional authority 
to implement an early retirement program 
the prospect for a greatly reduced logistics workload in the 
years ahead is the main factor driving aflc toward a smaller work 
force said the statement 
as forces are reduced there will be fewer aircraft and 
missiles in the air force inventory thus reducing the workloads at 
aflc maintainance and repair depots and other specialized 
centers it said

president juvenal habyarimana of rwanda 
where tribal differences have often resulted in widespread 
massacres has ordered the issuance of new national identity cards 
that do not list the holders ethnic origins 
he also has asked rwandans to submit their views on possible 
political reforms including moving to a multiparty system to a 
commission preparing a new national political charter to be voted 
on next year 
habyarimana whose government currently is battling 
predominantly tutsi rebels made the announcement in a wideranging 
address tuesday to parliamentarians diplomats and dignitaries at 
rwandas national assembly 
his comments were reported by state rwandan radio which was 
monitored in nairobi a monitor copy was made available wednesday 
to the associated press 
in an apparent reference to the fighting habyarimana said he 
had decided the current id cards be replaced to ensure maximum 
security apparently by dropping listing of ethnic origin 
the introduction of the new cards also will facilitate the 
exclusion of the mention of ethnic origin he said 
the issue is a sensitive one in rwanda where bloody power 
struggles have resulted in brutal ethnic retaliation in the late 
1950s hundreds of thousands of the minority tutsi fled the country 
after the hutu seized control and killed thousands of their former 
feudal rulers 
on sept 30 tutsi exiles living in uganda invaded rwanda 
seeking to overthrow habyarimanas government which they accuse of 
corruption habyarimana claims to have defeated the rebels but 
sporadic clashes continue to be reported from the border areas 
meanwhile preliminary talks have begun in goma zaire between 
a delegation from the rebel rwandese patriotic front and army 
officers from neighboring countries who have been chosen to monitor 
a ceasefire agreed to last month but as yet unobserved the 
staterun rwandan radio said wednesday 
zairean president mobutu sese seko is mediating in the conflict 
delegates to the meeting which started tuesday were to discuss 
the agenda and adopt working procedures according to the broadcast 
monitored in nairobi 
in his address tuesday habyarimana also called on rwandans to 
assist a commission that is looking into reforms including 
political pluralism 
the former belgian colony has been a singleparty government 
since 1978 the 30member political reform commission which has 
been meeting since september will produce a draft of a new 
political charter at the end of december that will be open to 
popular debate until march said habyarimana

a 102carat diamond the largest gem of its kind 
ever sold fetched a record 128 million at an auction late 
wednesday 
sothebys auctioneers identified the buyer of the internally 
flawless diamond as robert mouawad a lebanese jeweler based in 
geneva 
sothebys had forecast the pearshaped 14inchlong diamond 
would sell for 13 million 
the previous record was set by an 86carat diamond that fetched 
91 million at a new york auction in 1988 
the auction was seen as a test of the reaction of the jewelry 
market to recession fears and the persian gulf crisis amid lively 
bidding the daylong sale fetched a total 31 million 
i was afraid the climate of the moment would affect the 
price said david bennett european sales director but it was 
a very very good sale 
sothebys said the diamond of exceptional fire brilliance and 
purity was only recently cut from a 222carat rough diamond 
found somewhere in black africa the cutting process took seven 
weeks 
the auction house said the diamond was graded d color this is 
the highest possible classification and means the total absence of 
color it said there were only a handful of stones of such 
quality over 100 carats 
sothebys declined to reveal the seller but ruled out de beers 
the south african mining corporation with a large holding company 
in switzerland 
the auctioneers said the buyer would be responsible for naming 
the gem 
it is only seven carats smaller than the world famous kohinor 
which is kept in the tower of london as part of the british crown 
jewels 
it weighs more than half as much as the 200carat orloff of 
russian empress catharine the great kept in the soviet diamond 
treasury 
twentyone years ago a 69carat stone was sold to richard 
burton for elizabeth taylor at a comparatively cheap 12 million

feng xiaolin was clearly embarrassed in preparing 
for her debut on beijings newest most popular television show 
this is just too awkward she complained following 
instructions to walk across a miniature bridge toward the camera 
i never wear these colors 
she tried to hide the bright pink sweater with an aquamarine 
overcoat 
despite her discomfort the 37yearold divorcee went through 
the shot several times spurred by thoughts of the hopedfor 
reward a husband 
her video was to be shown on the matchmaking show tonight we 
meet which features twominute spots of four to five single men 
and women each week and invites viewers to contact the station for 
dates 
tonight we meet the idea of the beijing city government 
may seem modern and western but it also harks back to the chinese 
tradition of marriages arranged by gobetweens the difference in 
this case is that the decision to date or marry is made by the 
couple rather than their parents 
the communists tried to do away with matchmaking when they 
gained power in 1949 but single people in china have few ways of 
meeting potential mates varied dating and casual pickups are 
frowned upon 
professional matchmaking centers have sprung up in recent years 
singles register their names vital statistics and criteria for a 
spouse and await responses 
there is more glamor on tonight we meet which has been 
broadcast for 20 minutes each friday night since last summer 
candidates for the show are filmed at work and play in settings of 
their choice 
ms feng a medical worker wore her uniform cap and gown and 
posed in the laboratory of the university infirmary where she 
works 
yang guang the host and editor shouted encouragement 
throughout the filming 
you look beautiful she called out were going to get a 
whole mailbag full of letters for you 
she said the waiting list to get on the show was more than two 
months long and that most applicants like ms feng were divorcees 
in their 30s or early 40s 
they all say they are a pitiable generation because their 
youth was disrupted by the radical cultural revolution of 196676 
ms yang said in that decade many young people chose spouses on 
the basis of their political convictions or because they had 
residence permits for the cities 
unlike past generations ms feng said people of her age are 
not willing to stay in loveless marriages we still feel young 
like weve still got a lot of life to live she said 
ms yang who is single said no marriages had resulted from the 
show but many couples had begun dating a 60yearold widower who 
appeared reported receiving more than 100 letters from interested 
women 
for those who want to meet other singles but are not brave 
enough to appear on television the station holds dances the 
cosponsor of the first dance was a firm called the purple house 
which arranges fancy weddings another revived tradition 
for decades ostentation was frowned upon as ideologically 
unsound most couples simply got a marriage license and invited a 
few friends and relatives to a quiet party 
higher living standards are bringing back oldfashioned wedding 
bashes with new western touches 
the purple house which opened in june is the only operation of 
its kind in china for a fee it can provide tuxedo and gown for 
the bride and groom limousine pickup a wedding complete with 
flower girl and attendants a feast afterward and even a suite for 
the wedding night 
so far it has arranged more than 50 weddings said zhao 
zhongfeng assistant to the manager she said couples already are 
booking for january and february the lunar new year season and 
chinas most popular time to get married 
a typical wedding organized by the purple house costs about 
3000 yuan 633 which is 15 months pay for the average worker 
the ceremonies are a mix of chinese and western customs 
at one recent wedding the couple walked in to the wedding march 
and promised westernstyle to love and respect each other through 
sickness and health causing giggles among guests who had never 
heard such vows 
then chinesestyle the couple took a sip of wine and bowed to 
their guests employers and parents 
finally socialiststyle they bowed to each other while the 
master of ceremonies reminded them that chinese law allowed them to 
have only one child

the ceremonial presidency is being replaced by 
an elected office with executive powers which lee kwan yew may 
intend for himself sometime after he retires as prime minister 
lee steps down nov 28 after 31 years of running the government 
but is not bidding farewell to power 
he will be a senior member without portfolio in the cabinet of 
new prime minister goh chok tong and continue as head of the 
governing peoples action party 
goh 49 has been first deputy prime minister of this tiny 
island republic since 1984 spent 13 years in the cabinet and now 
is defense minister he expects the current parliament session to 
end about two months after he takes over as soon as it amends the 
constitution to strengthen the presidency 
the revised office will have wide veto power over budgets and 
spending of the prosperous citystates financial assets estimated 
to total more than 47 billion 
appointments to key posts in the civil service police military 
and judiciary on statutory boards and in stateowned companies 
would be subject to approval by the president who is to be elected 
directly for a sixyear term 
he also would have power over the use of the internal seise the new 
duties for the rest of 
his current term which expires in 1993 as if he had been 
elected 
the proposed constitutional change was the main issue of the 
last general election in 1988 in responding to opposition charges 
that he intended to retain power after retiring as prime minister 
lee pledged not to be the first of the new presidents 
he has not however ruled out seeking the office later lee is 
a fit 67 
critics say the presidency will be so powerful it will virtually 
end the countrys british style of government in which parliament 
is supreme 
to that argument goh responds so long as any government 
abides by the principles of financial prudence and meritocracy in 
governing singapore this bill will not have any real effect on 
it 
opposition politicians contend the amendment would 
institutionalize the peoples action party by eroding the powers of 
parliament the party has been in power led by lee since 1959 and 
holds 80 of the 81 elected legislative seats 
some singaporeans feel the amendment is designed for the prime 
minister and enacting it now indicates the new leadership is 
not confident of itself or our older masters have doubts about the 
integrity and capability of the new generation leaders and the 
electorate chandra dasa said he is a member of parliament and 
head of the government feedback unit which samples public opinion 
goh said the change is necessary because there are inadequate 
checks in our present parliamentary system of government he 
cited the lack of a restraining upper house in the unicameral 
system 
he rejected calls by the opposition and even some retired 
lawmakers from the governing party for a referendum before the 
constitution is amended 
lee siew choh of the workers party said such existing 
institutions as the judiciary civil service and parliament would 
provide enough checks and balances if allowed to function freely 
goh has said his administration plans no major policy 
initiatives political analysts agree that lees retention of the 
party leadership and the ascendency of his son will ensure that no 
fundamental changes take place 
the incoming prime minister recently appointed trade and 
industry minister lee hsien loong 38 the prime ministers eldest 
son to serve as one of his two deputies 
that came as no surprise goh acknowledged earlier that the 
younger lee was his logical successor as prime minister 
now however goh finds it necessary to insist he will not play 
a transitional role to keep the seat warm for the leaders 
ambitious son

the fate of americas invisible hostages is 
bound up in a maze of shifting interests and allegiances 
crosscurrents that could yet serve the cause of freedom for six 
us captives in lebanon 
pressure and attention are concentrated on the confrontation 
with iraq and on nearly 1000 americans detained deployed as 
human shield hostages at potential military targets or hiding from 
saddam husseins regime there are no clear and current demands for 
specific concessions as the price of release for the 13 western 
hostages in lebanon 
but there have been frequent reports that one step might lead to 
another 
and in those circumstances a gesture need not be a surrender to 
the demands of kidnappers a policy that bars negotiating 
concessions to terrorists does not necessarily preclude granting 
what is not demanded 
israel is in a position to take steps of that sort that 
government controls the forces holding an estimated 340 shiite 
captives in southern lebanon forty others were freed on oct 1 
the israelis also hold a militant moslem cleric captured last year

freeing such prisoners would not necessarily get the western 
hostages out of captivity but even a gesture toward that end might 
take a little of the strain out of usisraeli relations under 
stress since the persian gulf crisis began and worsened by the 
killings of 19 palestinian arabs in rioting at temple mount in 
jerusalem on oct 8 israel has refused to accept a united nations 
investigation of the shootings an inquiry supported by the united 
states which also voted for a un resolution denouncing the 
shootings 
that episode posed a problem for the fragile us alliance with 
arab states in opposition to the iraqi occupation of kuwait and 
the israelis suspect washington of tilting away from them in favor 
of the unsanctioned front against saddam 
the original ransom demand for at least some of the american 
hostages has ironically been met or rendered moot by the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait it was a demand for the release of 15 
shiite moslems imprisoned in kuwait since 1983 for terrorist 
bombings at the us and french embassies government buildings and 
oil facilities that price tag for the freedom of western hostages 
had been repeated periodically in messages from islamic holy war 
the group holding two us hostages 
its captives are terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
of the associated press now in his sixth year as a hostage and 
thomas sutherland a dean at the american university in beirut 
kidnapped later in 1985 the western hostages in lebanon all are 
believed held by factions linked with a proiranian group called 
hezbollah or party of god 
the kuwaiti prisoners are out now the two lebanese shiites 
among them said to be back in lebanon the others most of them 
iraqis who had opposed saddam hussein are believed to be in iran 
although middle east analysts say there is no firm information on 
their whereabouts nor is it known whether they escaped or were 
freed or were sezed by the iraqis in the invasion and later 
turned over to iran as part of saddams effort to improve relations 
with his old enemy 
in opposing saddam hussein the united states is aligned with 
syria another power in the hostage situation a move to free 
hostages could help make that alliance of necessity into a more 
durable relationship the syrians hope eventually to gain us 
support for a general middle east peace conference a forum in 
which they would seek to reclaim territory lost to israel 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with syrian president 
hafez assad in damascus on sept 14 and said he raised the hostage 
question then he said assad did not indicate any expectation 
that they would be released soon 
a month later the syrians used the military forces with which 
they dominate much of lebanon to put down the rebellion of a 
christian faction in beirut backing the government in imposing a 
settlement under which rival militias are to withdraw from the 
capital ending a long civil war there are about 40000 syrian 
troops in lebanon 
hezbollah has moved its militia from southern beirut to villages 
in eastern and southeastern lebanon syrian forces controlled the 
roads from beirut and in moving eastward the captors would have 
had to take their hostages across those lines 
syrian officials have said repeatedly that they want to help 
gain release of the hostages to end a situation they say they do 
not control 
iran is said to wield a more powerful influence although it 
too is indirect the latest in a series of reports of imminent 
release for british hostages came this week from a radical iranian 
leader who said he opposed it 
more moderate iranian officials are said to favor release of the 
hostages this year as a step toward improved relations with the 
west as president bush said when he came to office good will 
begets good will

get the facelift right away but put off the 
wedding until january 
people used to get advice like that from palmreaders 
astrologers or the person who cut their hair today it could just 
as easily come from a tax accountant 
that numbercrunching counsel has a special immediacy at the 
moment with an incometax year about to end and a set of new 
rules passed by congress a few weeks ago ready to take effect in 
1991 
any financial adviser with a reasonable sense of perspective 
will hasten to acknowledge that man or woman does not live by 
calculator computations alone 
still experts on these matters say if there arent any other 
overriding factors involved some judicious tax timing right now on 
matters ranging from cosmetic surgery to marriage or divorce can 
make a significant dollarsandcents difference 
consider the common tummy tuck hair electrolysis or any other 
procedure designed to improve ones appearance 
the cost of cosmetic surgery has heretofore been eligible for 
inclusion in the list of medical expenses that may qualify for a 
tax deduction if the total exceeds 75 percent of your adjusted 
gross income 
but starting jan 1 that will no longer be the case the revenue 
reconciliation act of 1990 decrees that costs of cosmetic surgery 
will no longer be deductible except in cases arising from injury 
disease or congenital defect 
whats more note the professional taxwatchers at the new york 
firm of matthew bender amp co if you get reimbursed for 
nondeductible surgery expenses by a health insurance plan at work 
the money paid is not excludable from gross income in other 
words it could result in a bigger tax bill 
the logical response to all this as summarized by another tax 
reporting firm the research institute of america consider 
having the surgery done in 90 if the expenditure will yield a 90 
deduction 
the think taxes first message also applies to a couple who 
are mapping plans for a wedding or a divorce around new years 
schedule the nuptials or the official divorce date for the right 
side of midnight dec 31 tax experts advise and maybe you can use 
the tax savings to pay for a chunk of the honeymoon 
a taxpayers marital status for the entire year is determined 
as of dec 31 the research institute of america points out if 
he gets married or divorced on that date he will be treated as if 
he were married or single all year long 
because of various quirks in the tax system money owed to uncle 
sam can vary substantially with marital status 
to illustrate the ria cited the example of two people making 
50000 each filing jointly as a married couple the firm 
reckoned they would owe about 1625 more in federal income taxes 
than they would as separate single filers 
but if one half of the couple has a large income and the other a 
relatively small one the effect can be reversed giving a savings 
of a few hundred dollars to the marrieds 
therefore says the accounting firm of ernst amp young a couple 
with approximately equal incomes might opt for a january marriage 
or a december divorce a couple with a big difference in incomes 
might be better offer choosing marriage in the old year or divorce 
in the new 
some years ago the existence of the marriage penalty gave 
rise to an especially exotic tax dodge to save on taxes a couple 
could theoretically divorce each december and remarry in january 
that trick wont work now the internal revenue service asserts 
people who get a temporary tax divorce will be required to file 
as a married couple anyway

while some of americas larger companies have 
been loading up on debt some of the countrys smaller businesses 
have been heading in the opposite direction 
the tendency to avoid debt largely has been overlooked in part 
because the borrowing binge of larger companies stole the 
headlines that binge was spectacular as you might agree after 
reviewing some of the evidence to wit 
nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross 
national product rose to 67 percent in 1989 from 47 percent 20 
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago 
in the 20 years through 1989 the ratio of interest expense to 
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent 
in the late 1980s half of all funds raised by nonfinancial 
corporations came from debt as recently as the 1960s and 1970s 
the average was about half that 
those increases resulted largely from activity among the biggest 
companies and of course they involved junk bonds used in 
takeovers since 1983 more than 500 billion of equities have 
disappeared largely replaced by borrowed funds 
smaller businesses however seem not to have steered in that 
direction but to have taken a more conservative and by most 
measures a more responsible course they seem to have become 
averse to debt 
indications of that choice are contained in the latest quarterly 
report on small business financing based on more than 2000 
detailed responses from members of the national federation of 
independent business to wit 
the percent of firms borrowing on a regular basis fell to 34 
percent a recordlow for borrowing activity among small firms 
credit demand is not strong 
that alltime low the survey was begun in 1974 did not make 
a sudden midappearance either the trend has been toward less 
borrowing since the 1980s the very time during which the big 
companies were loading up on debt 
economist william c dunkelberg who devised the survey and now 
interprets its findings observes that average debt among the 
companies studied runs less than 100000 with the median debt 
about 50000 
according to dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of 
business and management the responses reflect attitudes and 
experiences of a smallbusiness community that produces 50 percent 
of americas gross private product 
why such a pronounced difference of attitudes between the 
bigbusiness sector and the small the surveys goal was to 
determine attitudes rather than probe the reasons why but 
possibilities are obvious 
many small businesses reflect the attitudes of the founder the 
founder might still be the active head of the operation and as 
such more personally concerned with its wellbeing and that of its 
employees 
such people guard their companies from danger one of which is a 
heavy debt load to them the company is a lifes work rather than 
an impersonal operation whose goal is to grow at any cost they are 
highly competitive and not averse to risk but prudence guides 
their every move they are likely to finance from within from 
sales rather than by borrowing from outsiders 
in contrast larger concerns may be run by hired management 
such managers earn stripes by forever raising sales and earnings 
they are under constant pressure to take risks from shareholders 
stock analysts and competitors 
because of this they might do as so many did during the 1980s 
and that is seek growth and earnings through acquisitions financed 
of course with borrowed money 
experience in the 1980s also shows that large public companies 
are subject to being raided by outsiders if they fail to maintain 
constant growth and if they are raided the raiders financing 
might come from junk bonds 
the phenomenon may not have been studied in enough detail to 
determine all the reasons but it is there to be seen and studied 
while big business loaded up on debt smaller companies watch their 
budgets and are better off for it

some captains of industry offer a perennially 
repeated message to their fellow americans read the bible each 
day its the key to good and productive lives they say 
a group founded by business people has been stressing that 
advice for half a century in its sponsorship of national bible 
week which this year is nov 1825 
on the 50th anniversary observance of the event the current 
national chairman richard m devos president of amway corp 
said 
my goal is to encourage every american to make daily bible 
reading a personal commitment god interacts with us in many ways 
i believe one of the best ways to find and follow him is through 
the pages of your bible 
special events for the week are planned in about 10000 
communitities along with public service media ads and state and 
local proclamations to sress the bibles importance in american 
history and culture 
the sponsoring laymens national bible association was started 
in 1940 by a small group of new york businessmen it since has 
expanded to include businessmen throughout the country as well as 
public officeholders 
the bible gives us a positive pattern to live by and also a 
program to die by said devos a member of the christian 
reformed church other patterns are some persons theory but the 
bible is what god says we ought to be 
its vital to our behavior and society its the guidebook to 
life 
while presidents governors and mayors also lend backing to the 
associations bible campaign leading businessmen have been its 
working mainstays 
there are a tremendous number of business people throughout 
the country who are very good and devout people interested in this 
cause said victor w eimicke the associations president the 
last nine years as well as president of vw eimicke associates a 
bronxville nybased producer of business forms 
eimicke a dutch reformed church member who holds a doctorate in 
industrial psychology said recent wall street scandals produced a 
feeling that something was very wrong with the ethics of 
businessmen 
but thats a mistaken image he said its not 
representative he said 99 percent of the business people he has 
known were fine upright people many of strong faith 
noting that a different national business figure each year is 
chairman of the bible drive he said they are a whos who of the 
business world wonderful wonderful people 
the executive chosen as national chairman recruits about 100 
business people as associate chairmen who in turn each recruit 10 
to 15 others thus totaling 1000 to 1500 each year 
over the years youve had 50000 or more business people 
participating eimicke said 
eimicke whose family has a longtime custom of reading from the 
bible each morning at breakfast said i believe that unless we 
get back to the basic principles in the bible were not going to 
solve the many problems around us 
he cited the drug problem saying more spending and legal 
crackdowns wont solve it 
well stop it when families again start gathering around the 
breakfast table each day and give young people some selfesteem 
enabling them to know their own worth so they will spurn drugs he 
said 
president bush and his wife served as honorary chairmen of this 
years bible week new york gov mario cuomo was the governors 
chairman and new york city mayor david dinkins was the mayors 
chairman 
at a luncheon friday preceding this weeks observance the 
association planned to accord special recognition to the 
translation committee of the new revised standard version of the 
bible which was sponsored by the national council of churches and 
issued this year by eight publishers 
the rev reuben h gums executive director of the association 
said gallup surveys indicated 8 million people increased bible 
reading as result of a recent years observance of bible week 
for the current observance president bush said 
the bible has not only influenced the development of our 
nations values and institutions but also enriched the daily lives 
of millions of men and women who have looked to it for comfort 
hope and guidance

a united church of christ policymaking 
board says women should have access to a controversial french 
abortion pill if the drug meets federal safety standards 
believed to be the first major denominational agency to take 
such a stand the 50member board of directors of the churchs 
board for homeland ministries voted to urge us testing of the 
pill known as ru486 
if scientific experts find the pill meets federal standards of 
safety and effectiveness the food and drug administration should 
ensure it is available to women the board said 
the denomination is among the few taking a clearly prochoice 
view about abortion 
the board also voiced strong support for a universal health care 
system and urged president bush to refrain from striking iraq 
unless the iraqis attack first 
 
nashville tenn ap the united methodist publishing house 
reported sales of 1004 million at the end of its 1990 fiscal 
year 
that included 36 million in sales of the new united methodist 
hymnal and better than predicted sales of 270000 copies of the new 
revised standard version of the bible 
 
washington ap bishop james malone of youngstown ohio 
chairman of the domestic policy committee of the us catholic 
conference voiced deep disappointment at the failure of 
congress to override president bushs veto of the civil rights act 
of 1990

robert k lifton president of the american jewish congress 
called the veto a cruel slap in the face of thousands of 
africanamericans women hispanics jews and other minorities who 
are victims of employment discrimination 
 
new york ap two us moslem leaders have urged an 
international commission to investigate charges of violence 
looting and rape by iraqi soldiers in kuwait

the walk encouraged people to see things differently to ask 
new questions about the high amounts of energy and food we consume 
said the rev judith ain of watsonville calif who ended 
her walk oct 24 at the united nations it helped to model some 
new ways of living more conscious of the environment 
she estimated more than 1000 people took part in the global 
walk for a more livable world at some points along the way 
participants spoke at churches and schools in behalf of ecological 
concerns sleeping in tents on church property and sometimes under 
the open sky 
ms ain who wore out three pairs of shoes on the walk said 
it is so clear that our way of life is out of balance with the 
planet in our patterns of consumption and a willingness to go 
to war in the persian gulf for our lifestyle we go on as if were 
having a party but what we really need is a time of repentance and 
fasting

the harvest has been abundant this year 
fat tomatoes sweet potatoes melons pecans and purplehull peas 
the rains came as farmers gathered in a spring field prayed they 
would 
we were blessed produce grower louis lazzari said 
at thanksgiving dinner in annie whites house the grace her ill 
80yearold husband jack plans to say will be simple hell say 
he hopes it continues 
by that she meant not just the fecundity of the good earth here 
by mobile bay but the sharing of its riches between farmers like 
lazzari and families like hers families in need through people 
known as gleaners 
from beangrowing time in the spring to the gathering of mustard 
greens turnips and broccoli in cool weather farmers invite the 
gleaners into their fields to take whats left behind after 
harvest 
on one afternoon this summer 200 hands picked 16220 pounds of 
tomatoes altogether last year the gleaners organized by a local 
group called ecumenical ministries carried away 100000 pounds of 
vegetables and fruits 
the pickers must be needy they cannot sell anything they glean 
and they must share it with someone else in need such as the 
whites who cannot pick on their own because theyre disabled 
the rules are as simple as the verses from the old testament 
that underlie the 10yearold project 
when thou cuttest down thine harvest and hast forgotten a 
sheaf in the field thou shalt not go again to fetch it enjoins 
deuteronomy 241921 
it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the 
widow that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of 
thine hands 
mrs white who at 69 has heart trouble and more other ailments 
than she can name and whose husband has cancer learned of 
ecumenical ministries about eight years ago on a day she was 
desperate for food that day i really didnt have anything to 
cook she said 
before i looked around it was no time before they were out 
with boxes and bags of groceries she said 
after that gleaners brought regular deliveries of whatever 
vegetable was in season without the food she said i guess id 
starve 
the program began a decade ago with dot threadgill who saw a 
television news item about people from a california senior citizens 
center who supplemented their diet by picking leftovers in the 
fields 
mrs threadgills energy seems to keep the gleaning operations 
going and growing from about 300 pounds of food distributed 
during the first year about half of that out of my garden she 
said 
now 15 farmers call her or she calls them as harvests near and 
shes learned tricks over the years 
mechanical harvesters cant pick where they turn at the end 
of the rows she said referring to potato picking machines so 
we know where to be 
she scouts the fields estimating how many gleaners the crop 
will feed plentifully we dont want them to use their gas money 
and not have sufficient for several days then she quickly goes 
to the telephone tree to mobilize pickers before the farmer 
plows the field under to prepare for the next crop 
suzanne zellner got a call when a turnip patch was offered 
recently she and her husband have five children the youngest 
2yearold twins besides improving nutrition and stretching 
grocery money gleaning has an educational value she said 
teaching children how to pick how to know when somethings ready 
or when its too ripe 
another regular in the fields is gussie winston 53 who first 
went gleaning because her family had nothing to eat but now makes 
ends meet with housekeeping jobs and gleans and cans vegetables for 
herself and a list of mostly elderly people unable to get out 
themselves 
when you become a gleaner youre an emissary she said 
looking across a sunny field to pickers stooped at their work 
youre supposed to see that no one goes hungry 
for mrs threadgill that requires judicious juggling of her 
phone list for instance she said i know that mary jones has 10 
or 15 people under her so i know that if theres only enough for 
10 or 15 i dont need to call but mary 
and if we get peas for mary this week we call somebody else 
and kind of divide around the wealth 
and the wealth keeps blooming 
around the fourth of july one farmer makes sure to call the 
gleaners to gather ripe watermelons 
just before christmas last year a rare spell of extreme cold 
brought a call from another farmer who said he couldnt protect all 
of his broccoli crop the gleaners cut 1200 pounds 
a grower who has a upick operation with tomatoes planted in a 
staggered schedule offers the gleaners whats left in deadripe 
patches that his paying customers picked through the week before 
standing in the shade of an old pecan tree on his farm 
60yearold louis lazzari said the vagaries of the market sometimes 
open his fields to the gleaners 
this year one day i sold my broker 240 bushel boxes of beans 
and he wanted the next day 340 he said i had the beans some 
of the prettiest i ever raised in my life but the going price 
wouldnt have covered expenses after i paid the help i paid for 
the box i paid the freight to the place of business i dont know 
honestly but i may have went backwards 
i could have plowed em under lazzari said but really he 
couldnt it hurts me so bad to see something go to waste 
he said and he knows there are plenty of people here who havent 
had his good fortune 
i was born in the depression he said but i never had to 
go to bed one day in my life without a decent meal im thankful to 
say 
instead of plowing those pretty beans under he phoned mrs 
threadgill 
once a few years ago lazzari spontaneously called and offered 
sweet corn 30 big croker sacks of sweet corn 
mrs threadgill went back a few days later to thank him with a 
cake he said you know i had that big field of corn and it 
wasnt moving after i gave you that 30 sacks that evening a man 
came and bought the whole field from me

the 1991 mercury capri xr2 is a pleasant surprise 
its lowslung body and sporty styling hint at a jolting sporty 
ride but the capri xr2s allstrut suspension is damped somewhat 
giving passengers a softer ride that doesnt rattle the bones 
the capri xr2s convertible top could make for a loud tiring 
trip full of engine noise but the engine sound and road noise on 
this frontdrive car while noticeable are not overbearing 
the cute appealing look of this funabout as ford motor co 
likes to call the capri also could tempt the company to set high 
prices but the capri ranges from 12990 to 15920 attractive 
enough to invite comparisons with its two main competitors the 
mazda miata with a base price of 13800 and volkswagen cabriolet 
base price 15500 
the capri is designed to be a funtodrive car but we 
didnt forget value and versatility said ross h roberts a ford 
vice president and lincolnmercury general manager 
it took seven years for the capri to evolve out of a concept car 
called the barchetta italian for little boat that appeared at the 
1983 frankfurt motor show in germany in the end the capris 
outside design came from the ghia studios of turin italy its 
powertrain and chassis were built with the help of mazda of japan 
and assembly is done in australia 
the blended heritage works well the test car an upscale xr2 
turbo seemed at ease in many sport maneuvers as well as on 
leisurely sunday drives 
the capri handled easily fitting into tight parking spaces and 
dodging between cars in passing maneuvers without a lot of effort 
fuel economy was commendable about 24 miles per gallon in 
demanding cityhighway driving 
the 16liter fourcylinder turbo teamed with a fivespeed 
manual transmission provided up to 132 horsepower in the xr2 and 
was peppy thats compared with the 116 horsepower produced by the 
miatas 16liter engine turbo lag in the capri wasnt troublesome 
in most instances the transmission shifter felt a bit notchy 
however 
the cloth driver seat had adjustable lumbar support and was 
quite comfortable there was an air bag in the leatherwrapped 
steering wheel and the interior design of gauges including turbo 
boost was commendably functional 
the cloth back seat was another matter it was benchlike and was 
a stiff resting spot with a straight seatback i hit my head on a 
bar on the convertible roof while sitting there i could not hold 
my head up straight yet i couldnt scrunch down more in the seat 
because my knees were already hitting the front seatback 
the convertible top fit tightly and there were no whistles 
rattles or wind noise though it wasnt as easy to put down as the 
miata ragtop the capri involved a couple more steps than the 
miata both cars have cloth tops that must be put up and down 
manually but a plastic boot covered the capri convertible roof 
neatly while the miata canvas cover does not provide such a smooth 
appearance both vehicles offer optional hard tops for cold weather 
travel 
the capri trunk was nicely carpeted and offered space for two 
golf bags or a half dozen grocery bags the rear seat also folds 
down to allow more cargo space 
ford expects to produce 30000 capris annually once production 
reaches full speed in the next year since introduction in 
midjuly more than 4600 capris have been sold 
because the capri is a new vehicle consumer reports magazine 
does not list owner complaints

come on says mother wonderful have some 
cheesecake it wont kill you 
no one ever got cardiovascular disease from a sliver of 
cheesecake now and then says mother wonderful alias myra 
chanin dont eat cheesecake three times a day but when you do 
have it enjoy it to the max 
chanins book mother wonderfuls cheesecakes and other 
goodies first came out in 1982 and went out of print the second 
edition now is in its second printing 
chanin whose cheesecakes come in flavors like ginger pear 
mocha blanca and honey fig isnt surprised she sees good food as 
essential for marital bliss 
soft lights sweet music and diaphanous gowns may create an 
evenings diversion but comes the dawn and even casanova must 
eat she says in the books introduction 
professional bakers agree that cheesecakes havent lost their 
attraction 
were selling more than ever said janet rosing owner of 
cheesecakes by jr in chicago 
ms rosing estimates she sells more than five tons of cheesecake 
a week its fun to visualize isnt it she said 
nancy bier owner of miss grimble associates in new york says 
people think of cheesecake as something special 
when people want dessert and want to splurge they say lets 
have a piece of cheesecake everyone likes the flavor and the fact 
that its so rich 
miss grimbles has been in business for about 20 years and turns 
out about 50 different cakes and pies but mrs bier said 
cheesecake still is the no1 item 
the classic vanilla with a sour cream topping is the best 
seller she said 
several qualities come together to make a good cheesecake ms 
rosing said 
its a combination of creamy texture which is very 
satisfying and the flavors of the cream and the sweetness she 
said people feel theyre really getting value in cheesecake 
theres really something substantial there its not some light 
fluffy thing 
even a doctor from the american heart association went along 
somewhat with mother wonderfuls idea that a sliver of cheesecake 
once in a while isnt all that bad 
i would certainly agree with a sliver now and then but what 
does one call a sliver said dr alan chait chairman of the 
ahas nutrition committee and if you bake a whole cheesecake 
whos going to eat just a sliver 
chait a professor of medicine at the university of washington 
said the aha doesnt preach the idea of good or bad food 
the important thing is a persons total diet a diet that is 
low in saturated fat and cholesterol rather than the individual 
food he said 
both the ahas cookbook and mother wonderful offer lowfat 
cheesecake suggestions 
chanin also offers encouragement to the nervous cook 
cheesecake is the easiest dessert to make how did it get such 
an awesome reputation bakers lie when you find out how easy it is 
to make cheesecake youll stop paying 25 for theirs and start 
baking your own 
she thinks the problem is the oldfashioned ways of baking 
people are still using recipes that were created in 1850 
ovens then had no thermostats so theyd tell you to bake the cake 
in the oven for half an hour and leave them in the oven with the 
door ajar you couldnt leave the house 
then there are those recipes that tell you to put your 
cheesecake pan in a pan filled with boiling water i think that one 
was invented by johnson amp johnson to sell more bandaids theres 
no better way in the world to scald yourself 
theres none of that in this cookbook what chanin does offer is 
advice such as how to get that creamy custardlike texture 
since i never want to unwrap another package of cream cheese 
i pass on all my secrets to you she confides before introducing 
her ten commandments for making perfectly baked cheesecakes every 
time 
actually there are 17 commandments which chanin admits tends 
to prove her husbands contention that she is bossier than god 
among them 
thou shalt not chintz on ingredients 
thou shalt never defile thy crusts with graham cracker crumbs 
thou shalt never even think about using those gunky cornstarch 
toppings 
thou shalt measure out ingredients before beginning to bake 
thou shalt always add eggs to thy batter with thy mixer on the 
lowest speed 
she really means it about using the best ingredients 
the cost differential between a sublime cheesecake and a 
thirdrate one is less than 3 if money is a problem make an 
8inch version and serve petite wedges but always make sure anyone 
who tastes it will rave about your skill and beg for more

they make an odd trio tom selleck the 
easygoing sleuth of magnum pi ted danson the libidinous 
barkeep of cheers and steve guttenberg the feckless recruit of 
police academy 
the obtuse combination plus a captivating infant helped make 
touchstone pictures three men and a baby the biggest 
moneymaker of 1987 
the three stars have reunited for three men and a little 
lady in which they play the concerned guardians of a 6yearold 
played by a precocious floridian named robin weisman 
selleck is a californian who parlayed exposure as a marlboro man 
into an acting career discovered as a guest star on the rockford 
files he played magnum for eight years winning an emmy his 
films include high road to china her alibi and the current 
quigley down under 
brooklynborn guttenberg also won his start in commercials then 
attracted notice as one of the baltimore buddies in diner he 
starred in the hit series of police academy farces as well as 
in cocoon the bedroom window short circuit and the tv 
film the day after 
danson grew up near flagstaff ariz attended stanford 
university and graduated in drama from carnegie tech after soap 
operas and the new york shakespeare festival he made his film 
debut in the onion field he recently began his ninth season on 
the emmywinning cheers 
the three actors sat down recently for a group interview with 
the associated press here are the highlights 
q how do you feel about sequels 
danson i probably wouldnt choose to do one but i did and i 
had a ball i think we all felt why mess up a good thing by 
doing a sequel they touchstone came up with a good idea 
selleck i was real trepidatious about doing a sequel 
guttenberg what 
selleck trepidatious obviously there was financial incentive 
involved but thats the wrong reason to do a sequel three men 
and a baby was a special thing for me a landmark and i think 
it was for steve and ted what im proudest of is that we all 
worked real hard to make a better movie the second time 
guttenberg ive had some sequels that worked and some that 
didnt im thrilled that we came out with one that works in our 
opinion when you do a sequel you have a great responsibility to 
the audience youre telling them you liked the first one were 
going to fulfill another promise you have to adhere to that 
responsibility 
q what about acting with children isnt that a nono 
selleck thats why we got a middleaged kid to do the role 
robin is actually 63 years old seriously i dont think kids do 
scenestealing i think everybody including young actors and dogs 
make you look better 
q ted you play a very selfabsorbed actor in the film are 
actors really like that 
danson oh yes oh yes i think the more mature you become 
you realize and recognize this neediness and youre more at ease 
with it if you need a stroke you just turn to the closest person 
and say i need a stroke 
selleck i think theres some truth in it and thats why we 
laugh at it 
guttenberg i think selfinterest is probably a healthy feeling 
when its taken in the right doses but we can all get carried 
away what we want as actors is attention if you keep it under 
control and have a reality factor going on its ok 
q what impelled you to become actors 
selleck i dont know what impelled me i was just going to 
meander along with a management training program with united air 
lines i didnt have a desire to do a school play or perform 
except shooting spitwads behind the teachers back i was a bit 
directionless in college but i got lucky 
guttenberg i went to college for a little while and dreams of 
going into dentistry i was drunk one night and talking to friend 
about what we wanted to do he said dentists made 80000 a year 
and i said that sounds good i always wanted to tell stories 
and i sort of fell into it when i was a messenger when i saw 
envelopes filled with money at commercial agencies i had a friend 
take some photos and i used them for auditions 
danson i didnt even get close to a profession until acting 
came along thank god im an actor boy would i be a mess 
without it 
q if you had the power to change the movie industry what would 
you do 
guttenberg i dont really know i think the industry needs some 
changes and i think those changes come about because of necessity 
i wouldnt know im just trying to make my way through it 
selleck seriously i would keep the testing of motion pictures 
at the level of a tool i think its rapidly becoming a sanitizer 
of good controversial product they get three bad preview cards and 
say lets take that part out so we wont offend people 
i would also educate the public so theyd know theres a lot 
more to films than the boxoffice score when one film is in 2000 
theaters and another is in 800 theaters people say im going to 
the one thats making all the money 
danson i think you should somehow stimulate writers because 
thats the beginning and the end of films

billy joel once epitomized the angry young man he 
sang about in the mid1970s 
now at age 41 hes still angry hes also broke 
joel is almost a year into a 15month world tour to promote his 
tripleplatinum storm front lp and get himself out of a sea of 
red ink 
althouyh one of the biggest selling solo artists in the history 
of colombia records with 14 albums and 25 top40 singles in his 
catalog joel has little financially to show for it 
still in litigation is a 90 million lawsuit he filed in 
september 1989 against his former manager and brotherinlaw frank 
weber for fraud and breachofcontract the suit asks for 60 
million in punitive damages and alleges that weber duped joel out 
of 30 million losing 10 million of it in unsafe investments 
i havent gotten a penny back yet joel said in an interview 
before a recent soldout concert here the bulk of the lawsuit is 
still with the lawyers 
the reason for the length of this tour is financial look at 
this age you dont want to go out on the road for fun and games 
when i started the tour i was in deep financial straits the 
accounting firm im with now said i was looking at a deep deep 
deep deep financial hole that would take two years to get out of 
so i said ok and put my head down and went to work and im 
getting back in the black 
am i angry about it bitter is a good word the worst thing is 
having to spend so much time away from my kid added joel who is 
married to supermodel christie brinkley they have a 4yearold 
daughter alexa ray when i was a kid my dad was gone a lot and 
i swore to myself that when i became a father im going to be 
home so here i am on the road away from my kid 
thats the thing that gets me the most ill make up the money 
somehow ill make good on that but the time spent away from my 
kid isnt something you can make back thats what im really 
bitter about 
joel is well aware that his cashflow problems would be history 
if he agreed to tour sponsorship but the subject makes him 
bristle 
im not comfortable with it whatever celebrity i have was 
given to me by people to trade in on it would be a betrayal to 
that he said coke asked me it was a lot of money millions 
and millions of dollars george michael got that deal pepsi made 
me an offer i turned that down and madonna got that deal 
part of me was saying to myself what are you nuts take the 
money the funny thing is i actually drink the stuff but i cant 
really recommend it to other people 
if he did accept sponsorship joel is wary of another round of 
bashing from some segments of the media the fivetime grammy 
winner said certain music critics have been on his back ever since 
the stranger album produced four top20 singles in 1978 
as soon as i started selling records i was perceived in some 
circles to be this commercial wunderkind a tunesmithballadeer a 
tin pan alley man you know need a hit let me grind it out 
thats not how i write any hit ive had is an accident he said 
born william martin joel he grew up in hicksville ny and 
discovered mozart at age 4 before taking 10 years of piano lessons 
as a secondgrader joel remembers watching elvis presley 
perform on television one night and then trying to duplicate his 
moves at school the next day 
i got up on stage during lunch hour in the gym and did my 
elvis impersonation and the girls in the third grade started 
screaming because i was shaking my hips and doing hound dog the 
teacher dragged me off the stage thinking i had done something 
really nasty hey you dont even have hips in the second grade 
but i was thinking this is great i knew there was something to 
this and it stayed with me he said 
when i saw the beatles on the ed sullivan show i looked at 
them and said thats it thats what i want to do those guys 
didnt look like frankie avalon or fabian they wrote their own 
songs played their own instruments and they had the coolest hair 
in the world 
the first gig i did was when i was 15 in 1964 i played in a 
band at holy family church in hicksville girls who wouldnt look 
twice at me now liked me at the end of the night the priest came 
over and gave us 5 each you got paid for this stuff that locked 
the backdoor there was no way out for me i was hooked 
i didnt graduate from hicksville high too many absences i 
was working until 3 oclock in the morning in clubs who could wake 
up at 7 oclock 
in 1971 joel was homeless sleeping on laundromat floors and 
surviving on peanut butter sandwiches when he signed a solo 
recording contract with family productions

but his debut lp in 1972 cold spring harbor was mastered 
at the wrong speed so he played piano bars under the name bill 
martin and gathered material for his hit debut album for columbia 
piano man in 1973 
his problems however were far from over 
i signed away a lot of things in those early days he said 
i signed away publishing rights copyrights a lot of record 
royalties i tell you im not a businessman but i assumed in this 
just land of ours that theres some law against indentured 
servitude you cant pay for a mistake for 20 years 
the ongoing legal hassles are the main reason why joel cant 
help out other aspiring acts 
people send me tapes all the time they either want me to do 
their material or they want to know what i think i used to like 
that now i send them right back he said a laywer can say 
billy joel used the word the in a song didnt you use the word 
the in the song that you sent him hey sue him 
its a total defeat for the little guy because no one will 
listen to their tapes now because of all these lawsuits added 
joel who once was unsuccessfully sued by someone who claimed he 
wrote my life joels no 1 single in 1978 
guys who do what i do we dont need to steal we write our 
own stuff all the music i write ive dreamt i dream music all 
the time i dont dream scenes and scenerios like most people do i 
dream abstractions shapes colors sounds symphonies i wake up 
and i dont remember what i dreamt but its in my subconscious 
like a filing cabinet 
when i sit down to write i try to get into that filing 
cabinet and once in a while a little window or drawer will pop 
open with the music in it and ill be able to write it very 
quickly 
the formula has produced a string of hits including we didnt 
start the fire which topped the charts earlier this year 
the song which featured a barrage of headline events over the 
past 40 years was widely used as a historyteaching tool for 
junior high and high school students across the country 
joels storm front tour began dec 6 1989 in worcester 
mass and is scheduled to end in march in new zealand by the time 
its over he and his sevenpiece band will have played 165 shows 
to more than 35 million fans on five continents 
on dec 5 he will take a oneday break from the tour and return 
to new york city to receive a humanitarian award from the cathedral 
of st john the divine and a grammy legends award in a 
television ceremony 
past humanitarian winners include leonard bernstein and duke 
ellington joel will be honored as a grammy legend along with 
three of his idols quincy jones aretha franklin and johnny cash 
how does a little pup like me get in there its wild 
id like to be remembered as a writer i believe in the stuff 
ive written those are the things that really end up being your 
legacy im not a showman and i dont really feel like im an 
entertainer 
but joel can relate to his past and shakes his head in disbelief 
over all hes survived 
his father left home when joel was 7 he considered suicide and 
checked himself into a mental institution in his early 20s 
fractured his right wrist and left thumb in a 1982 motorcycle 
accident that put his career in jeopardy and was divorced in 1982 
after a nineyear marriage to elizabeth weber his nose still shows 
signs of the 26 amateur fights he had at age 19 
it always amazes me the resilience of human beings its 
unbelievable but im happy to be anywhere he said with a laugh 
im as old as a 49 studebaker ever look at a car from 1949 
the steel is all rusted out the body is all dented and falling 
apart the upholstery is all ripped and the engine doesnt work 
i look in the mirror and say well you aint cary grant but 
you aint in the junkyard either but im happy with my life 
very happy its nothing at all like i pictured it would be

todays generation of selma blacks take integration for granted 
and view bloody sunday as something from long ago that they learn 
about during black history month like slavery 
and yet not unlike cities of all sizes in every region selma 
still feels the ache of what has become a national migraine reduced 
to a single syllable race 
black eligible voters in selma and dallas county now outnumber 
whites barely under smitherman selma has gerrymandered its wards 
so that four blacks and four whites sit on the city council the 
council president elected atlarge is currently white council 
members have an unwritten agreement that a person of the same race 
will be appointed to replace any one of them leaving office in 
midterm 
very often in selma seemingly neutral issues that come before 
the council are resolved along racial lines many chalk it up to 
the citys heritage of confrontation it seems to have left selma 
as fragile as a house of cards the whole town hoping nobody will 
bump the table 
somehow smitherman has managed to keep the balance to walk the 
tightrope as he says without losing control 
joe smitherman is a man of great cunning says the rev fred 
reese he knows how to manipulate the white people to accept 
changes that will benefit the black people and them too really 
he knows just how far to go and still keep white support without 
losing black support 
reese is the principal of selma high school back in 1964 he was 
the head of the dallas county voters league the person who lured 
martin luther king to selma for the voting rights crusade he was 
also one of the few blacks who managed to register to vote despite 
the obstacles of the time in the 1964 mayors race he voted for 
smitherman 
joe and i are the same age we grew up in the same part of 
town in similar circumstances said reese blacks can identify 
with him 
for the 30 years before smitherman ran there hadnt been a real 
race for mayor selmas ruling gentry passed the office from one of 
their number to the next like a fiefdom the only requirement was 
to keep things as is 
smitherman then was a brash upstart he was a gawky young 
appliance salesman with a long neck and big ears and no friends at 
the country club he managed to get elected to the city council 
where he became a royal pain he wanted to do city business in the 
open for example instead of the back room brash 
he ran for mayor pledging to represent all the people not the 
favored few and his campaign flyers underlined the word all 
i figured everybody had a favored few they didnt like he 
said i was right when i won the old guard wouldnt even give 
me a key to city hall i had to get one made 
the civil rights demonstrations behind him smitherman became 
the busiest man in town he pushed through a penny sales tax and 
did things people could see and touch paved and lighted streets 
new garbage trucks fire engines sewer lines 
he became an expert at wheedling money out of washington money 
the old guard shunned as tainted inviting federal 
interference 
only thing tainted about it smitherman told them is 
taint enough of it 
and more visible and touchable things appeared each new project 
overlapping the last new libraries new city hall new housing 
projects schools museums fountains trees and flowers and parks 
train crossings were a hazard he stopped a 180car freight with 
a police car and ticketed the conductor for blocking streets the 
railroad rescheduled 
he refused to pay the citys electric bill until the power 
company explained its passon charges so the people could know 
what they were paying for 
when ku klux klansmen showed up on the city hall steps he called 
them white trash and ran them out of town blacks applauded he 
padlocked the antipoverty office because only 5 percent of the 
paid employees were white not enough whites applauded 
at the 20th anniversary observance of bloody sunday smitherman 
went to the pulpit of brown chapel where martin luther king had 
preached and said my hands are as dirty as the others we were 
wrong im sorry he shared a hymnal with jesse jackson and sang 
we shall overcome 
i suppose ive been the most visible person in the state short 
of the governor smitherman said and a lot of people expected 
me to run for higher office 
when i was younger i gave some thought to it but after a few 
terms i discovered its hard for mayors to do that 
mayors cant duck issues or avoid taking sides for mayors 
the public is as close as the sidewalk you either get the garbage 
picked up or you dont you either remove the dangerous tree or you 
dont you cant tell an angry citizen that youll have a committee 
look into it not if you want to get reelected 
also you need what i call the big mules the money boys who 
finance your campaign and dont let you forget where you got the 
money ive shifted around so much politically backing democrats 
republicans whatever that the big mules who know me could never 
be sure if id stay hitched 
anyhow selma is all i really care about and being mayor of 
selma has been sufficient two more years and im history

when steve friedman took over as executive 
producer of the thirdplace nbc nightly news one staffer 
recalls he spoke in dire terms of doom maybe the end of the show 
if he didnt succeed 
the message wasnt that strong friedman says of that june staff 
meeting 
but i said that if we didnt change what we did or how we did 
it there was no hope to survive in the long haul he says 
when nbc news president michael gartner introduced the brash 
shootfromthelip friedman at the nbc affiliates meeting in june 
he called him a show doctor who would make nightly 
sparkle 
then came a vow from friedman we are going to do a show of 
interest not the show of record 
as traditionalists shuddered he went to work having earlier 
put nbcs today on top when he was its executive producer then 
foaled a 40 million syndicated bomb usa today the television 
show 
his nightly priority to make the program more lively 
more active than passive 
that included more live interviews he said reports that 
werent a daylater echo of those in major newspapers and even 
entertainment news 
in one of the most noticeable changes he installed an array of 
graphics tv headlines which critics said hed used to wild 
excess on his failed effort at a tv version of usa today 
some graphics on the newlook nightly are sedate no 
flashier than those on abcs firstplace world news tonight 
but others well in a recent broadcast one report on the 
troubles of eastern airlines carried a mystifying graphic goin 
south it said a story on prevention of child abuse was entitled 
kid protection and the shows final report on the auction of 
greta garbos goods was headlined going going garbo 
several nightly staffers who asked not to be identified 
hes the boss after all said friedman is usa todaying nbcs 
show 
nonsense he responded hes not taking time away from the news 
the purists have had their run on these shows for a long time and 
the audience has spoken he added theres no honor in going 
out of business 
i dont think our graphics are any more usa today than cbs 
or abc said tom brokaw the nightly anchor and managing 
editor 
i think it adds a real television vitality to it that i 
certainly welcomed and i think most people do as well he said 
including what he called highchurch journalists 
brokaws new producer is not what youd call traditional 
executive in the december esquire magazine a report on the new 
nightly news includes a picture of friedman his head in an 
empty tv set hes holding he appears to be yelling 
friedman returned to nbc at a tough time for network evening 
newscasts 
in the 197980 season just before the onslaught of cable news 
network and when local newscasts were expanding the evening 
newscasts of cbs nbc and abc had a combined 77 percent share of 
the national audience 
six weeks into the current season the combined figure was 57 
percent 
brokaw whose ties with friedman go back 20 years when both 
worked at knbctv in beautiful downtown burbank concedes that to a 
certain extent nightly is ceding to cnn and local newscasts 
some types of breaking news 
the program cant be above the news and if theres a 
gotohell fire of some kind or flooding in the northwest were 
going to touch on that he said but its not the staple it 
once was 
we have to be more analytical we have to be ahead of the 
curve on the news do the kinds of stories that will prepare the 
audience for the next wave of change in their lives 
brokaw doesnt think its lastgasp time for his show or its 
rivals despite financial crunches at network news divisions and 
the insistence by the networks bottomline managements that these 
divisions earn money 
but obviously we cant go through the precipitous decline that 
weve gone through in audience share the last 10 years he said 
stopping that drop was friedmans mandate when in a surprise 
move in may gartner named him to succeed the programs former 
executive producer bill wheatley now director of nbcs political 
coverage 
as we used to say in the trade you have o stop the bleeding 
before you can fix the patient friedman said and we had to 
stop that downslide where this program was a consistent falling 
third 
he thinks thats been done but the verdict isnt in yet 
since friedman took over nightly has continued to battle 
dan rathers cbs evening news for second place abcs 
broadcast anchored by peter jennings has consistently led the 
ratings pack 
the pugnacious friedman professes not to worry about where we 
are with dan rather because ive dismissed dan rather as a threat 
to us i worry about where we are with peter jennings 
as part of the nightly revamp friedman began in september 
what he calls the daily difference daily segments on the 
family what works in america health issues guns and drugs and 
on friday a followup report on some major story 
he readily admits its what he calls a variation on the 
2yearold american agenda segments of abcs world news 
tonight a program he admires 
he makes no apologies for adding more reports on sports issues 
or personalities and entertainment to the shows mix 
i believe part of our job is to talk about what people do and 
the culture of the country and i think thats more important 
than some senate committee hearing on some topic that will never 
get voted on 
what hes done so far with nightly has its critics but they 
dont include one key nbc affiliate executive who in the past has 
been critical of nbc news failings eric bremner now president of 
the nbc affiliates board 
my reaction to the changes is positive said bremner 
president of king broadcasting co in seattle i think we see 
progress in acceptance of the show i think theyre on an 
upward trend 
on a relatively slow news day this month nightly opened 
with more than seven nonstop minutes devoted to various aspects of 
the persian gulf crisis 
but its showclosing final moment little cartoon sketches now 
sometimes signal the end of a broadcast indicated another change 
in the oncetraditional newscast 
longer than most of the thatsallfolks notices on nightly 
it took 29 seconds which no doubt agonized correspondents known to 
go bonkers when told to cut say just 15 seconds from their piece 
pegged to a preceding report on the garbo auction it was a clip 
from one of the late stars films in it garbo accused by her 
escort of lacking humor laughs hysterically when he accidentally 
tips over in his chair 
his huffy reaction whats so funny about this 
on that note that evenings edition of the newlook nbc 
nightly news concluded

ruth knows that smoking marijuana once 
virtually ignored by the public and police is now considered a 
very deviant thing its very taboo 
the 40something san francisco professional is married has 
children and a respectable job she knows that even though 
californias marijuana law is still relatively lenient a drug bust 
could threaten her livelihood 
yet she still smokes highgrade sinsemilla several times a week 
why 
its a very nice high she said often in these drug 
stories people forget to mention that part 
ruth is far from alone marijuana is the most popular illegal 
drug today the crack epidemic notwithstanding 
perhaps as a result most states arrest more people for 
marijuana than for cocaine and heroin combined government 
statistics show last year almost 400000 people were busted on 
some kind of marijuana charge 
the drugs popularity stems in part from the fact that it is a 
known quantity almost 66 million americans have tried it at least 
once many of them during its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s the 
1988 national household survey on drug abuse found that 66 million 
americans used it once a week or more and 116 million had used it 
in the previous month 
it is considered relatively safe todays marijuana may be far 
stronger than its counterpart a decade ago as the government says 
but harvard psychiatrist lester grinspoon notes there is no 
reliable evidence of death caused by cannabis in a human being 
and its relatively cheap john a scientist who uses sinsemilla 
several evenings a week says one ounce lasts him six months that 
ounce could cost as little as 100 and the same amount of 
lowergrade marijuana can run 40 
other drugs especially cocaine and heroin are associated 
with high crime and violence and nationally police officers 
arrest far more people on cocaine or heroin charges than any other 
illegal drug 
but in some states nearly every drug arrest involves marijuana 
86 percent in vermont for example 82 percent in north dakota 
and 81 percent in maine according to fbi figures for 1988 
eight of every 10 marijuana busts is for possession of the drug 
the fbi says 
the reason so many people are arrested on marijuana charges 
seems obvious to one group the national organization for the 
reform of marijuana laws which has advocated marijuana 
legalization for two decades 
marijuana users are easier targets than say cocaine 
traffickers said norml spokesman john dunlap theyre a much 
more passive lot the government knows its an easy public 
relations victory 
dunlap also contends there are just more marijuana smokers out 
there he estimates 30 million people use it once a week far more 
than the government estimate of 66 million 
many police departments that once paid little attention to 
marijuana users have changed as attitudes harden toward all illegal 
drugs an example is arizonas maricopa county which includes 
phoenix 
the cops basically sort of ignored it a few years ago said 
bill fitzgerald spokesman for county attorney richard romley 
today the county boasts a do drugs do time program 
targeting all drug users 
every arrested person will be booked into jail for at least a 
few hours said romley and county sheriff thomas agnos in a paper 
describing the program for a casual user even a brief jail stint 
drives home the gravity of the offense 
firsttime offenders may enter a diversion program and 
according to fitzgeralds figures threequarters of the people who 
did had been arrested on marijuana charges 
across america government agencies have staged widely 
publicized raids on outdoor marijuana fields indoor growing labs 
and stores that sell equipment for such labs in an attempt to 
curtail domestic crops that provide an estimated 25 percent of the 
us supply 
the government admits it conducts these raids in large part to 
impress a foreign audience 
we cannot expect foreign countries to undertake vigorous 
antidrug efforts inside their borders if we ourselves fail to do 
likewise says the national drug control strategy issued in 
january 
perhaps another reflection of changing attitudes about drugs 
laws themselves are becoming more stringent 
of the 11 states that decriminalized marijuana possession for 
personal use during the 1970s four have reversed course in recent 
years 
alaska which had actually legalized possession of up to four 
ounces at home or other private places voted nov 6 to make 
possession of small amounts a crime again 
maine ohio and oregon had already tightened marijuana 
restrictions but in seven other states california colorado 
minnesota mississippi north carolina nebraska and new york a 
marijuana arrest is more akin to a traffic ticket than a criminal 
charge 
william j bennett who resigned after 20 months as national 
drug control policy director championed the stricter attitude and 
campaigned for alaskas marijuana measure 
although bennett told the associated press last december that he 
believed marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol he rejected 
legalization the last thing i would want to do is recommend the 
wider use of a drug that makes young people stupid 
despite the increased risks many longtime marijuana smokers 
cannot imagine giving it up 
john the scientist who asked that his real name not be used 
said a single puff of sinsemilla facilitates the imagination and 
has allowed occasional creative breakthroughs some of whch have 
led to papers published in reputable journals 
his employers do not require random drug tests but if they did 
that would be enough of an insult to my freedom that i would quit 
and contribute to the brain drain said john who is single 
steven a 34yearold massachusetts attorney and father of two 
said if i didnt use it i think id be an alcohol abuser 
alcohol would hurt his health far more he said 
steven who did not want his last name used recognizes the 
legal dangers but believes he would face only a reprimand not 
disbarment if he were arrested on marijuana charges 
to ruth who also did not want her last name used marijuana is 
the best aphrodisiac there is alcohol is not an acceptable 
substitute 
you get drunk with alcohol she said you get sloppy and 
the next day you have a hangover the worst that can happen with 
marijuana is you get sleepy

when the wall street recession gobbled 
her highpowered marketing job in new york city sara lewis packed 
her skis and headed for the mountains of northern new england 
not for recreation but a new career 
as the ski season gets under way new englands largest ski 
resorts are swamped with employment applications from professionals 
who lost jobs in the yuppie recession sweeping the financial 
services and computer industries 
as they comb through employment applications for the coming 
season resort officials are marveling at the qualifications and 
skills possessed by many of those seeking jobs that pay a fraction 
of their former salaries 
weve had an overwhelming number of applications quite a 
number of them from professional people wanting jobs at seasonal 
wages said kirby goode a personnel assistant at vermonts 
sugarbush resort 
applicants include engineers and other professionals laid off at 
general electric co in burlington vt and banking people from 
maine boston new york all over the northeast goode said 
i heard about a fellow who had worked in the hightech 
business around route 128 in boston and he was begging for a job 
working with the ski school said kathe dillmann of waterville 
valley in new hampshire 
ms lewis lucked out when she applied at sugarloafusa a vice 
president of a design and marketing firm until its biggest client 
merrill lynch retrenched she was expecting a laborers job at the 
maine resort 
but she got a fulltime job in the marketing department 
allowing her to live in the country ski all she wants and use 
some of her professional skills 
i was planning on being a lift attendant if thats what i had 
to do this winter she said i have a good marketing 
background and its a lot more fun marketing skiing than marketing 
mutual funds or limited partnerships 
the new jobs are an adjustment for the displaced professionals 
for some its like joining the circus a chance to indulge in a 
sport they previously could only enjoy on vacations or weekends 
but the drop in pay can be as precipitous as the toughest 
slopes lift operators at sunday river start at 525 to 550 an 
hour while most jobs at sugarloaf range from 2 an hour plus tips 
for serving food to 7 or 8 an hour for veterans at snowmaking 
even with a bluechip resume theres some tough competition to 
overcome 
sunday river for example gets 100 applicants a week for 500 
seasonal jobs sugarloafs annual job fair last weekend drew more 
than 400 applicants although the resort estimates it will need 
fewer than 100 new employees 
but resort officials see it as a winwin situation they say 
a seasonal stint on the slopes gives displaced workers a chance to 
sort out their lives and mull their utures while the resorts can 
pick and choose from a personnel pool thats wellqualified and 
easily trained 
this is very exciting for us because the quality of the 
applicants is just overwhelming said nancy marshall a 
spokeswoman at sugarloaf 
the resorts meanwhile are optimistic the bad times that are 
helping employment wont hurt other aspects of their business 
curiously that same economic slump does not seem to pose any 
kind of problem for us said skip king of sunday river our 
vacation bookings are up considerably and our season ticket sales 
are right where they should be

federal regulators have renewed their 
conflictofinterest allegations against neil bush summing up 
their case against the presidents son in a document submitted to 
an administrative law judge 
the office of thrift supervision in a brief filed with 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson reiterated its 
position that bushs business relationships conflicted with his 
role as a former director of a failed colorado savings and loan 
bush for his part continues to insist that he committed no 
wrongdoing in voting to approve loans to developers kenneth good 
and bill walters who invested in bushs oil company in addition 
bush told davidson in his brief there is no likelihood that the 
alleged unsafe or unsound practices will continue 
the two sides submitted briefs monday to davidson who will make 
a recommendation in the case the documents were made available by 
the ots on tuesday 
bush 35 breached his duty to shareholders and depositors of 
silverado banking savings and loan association of denver and 
engaged in other unsafe or unsound practices the ots said in 
its 56page brief 
the thrift agency is seeking an administrative order against 
bush that could lead to barring him from the banking and savings 
industry the regulators contend that bush failed to adequately 
inform fellow silverado directors of his business ties with good 
and walters who eventually defaulted on more than 132 million in 
loans from silverado 
davidson held an administrative hearing in denver in late 
september at which both bush and government witnesses testified 
the judge will examine the testimony from the hearing as well as 
the latest briefs submitted by both sides and is expected to 
recommend by jan 2 what sanctions if any should be taken against 
bush 
ots director timothy ryan is scheduled to make a decision in 
early april and bush would have the right to appeal it to a 
federal court 
bush has evinced no recognition that his conduct was 
improper the ots brief states his conduct is capable of being 
resumed at another institution 
the ots repeated its charge for example that bush violated his 
duties to silverado by doing everything in his power short of 
voting to approve it to procure a 900000 line of credit from 
silverado to a partnership formed by bush and good to explore for 
oil and gas in argentina the credit line intended to convince 
argentine officials that the venture had strong financial 
resources was never used 
under questioning from a government attorney at the denver 
hearing bush said lawyers for goods company suggested that bush 
present the credit line proposal to silverados board 
i was a gobetween bush said at the hearing 
he maintained there was no conflict in his role because he 
didnt stand to gain any financial benefit from the credit line 
which he described as a sort of letter of referral and because 
he abstained from voting on the proposal 
pressed by the government attorney however bush later admitted 
he had hoped the partnership would eventually benefit from the 
credit line since it would persuade the argentine government to 
permit the venture to drill wells in that country 
in his new brief bush said he presented the credit line request 
to the silverado board because it was not to be funded or drawn 
upon bush said he would not have presented the proposal if it had 
involved funding the credit line 
in addition to the governments conflictofinterest case bush 
also faces a 200 million negligence lawsuit filed against him and 
other former silverado directors by the federal deposit insurance 
corp

eastern airlines and its creditors were at odds 
today over a multimilliondollar cash infusion that would keep the 
troubled airline flying into december 
the creditors argued in us bankruptcy court that eastern 
cannot become viable they want to sell the remaining assets and 
close the final chapter in the tortuous legacy of the 
strikeplagued carrier 
their opinion is in a court filing made tuesday in reponse to 
miamibased easterns request to withdraw 30 million from an 
escrow account to keep operating through the middle of next month 
eastern rejected the creditors contentions saying it would 
present full arguments in a hearing late this afternoon before us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
eastern has been protected from creditors operating under 
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code since march 1989 when the airline 
was crippled by a strike the company has been flying with 
nonstrikers and replacements and repeatedly has sought to win 
understanding from creditors for more time to become profitable 
but the creditors who range from aircraft giants like airbus 
industrie and boeing to momandpop travel agencies have grown 
increasingly frustrated and impatient about getting at least some 
of their money 
their fears have been heightened amid an uncertain economic 
environment marked by rising fuel prices and sluggish demand for 
air travel 
the unsecured creditors committee made up of the 12 largest 
creditors of eastern said it will file a liquidation plan and if 
necessary seek to force the airline into chapter 7 bankruptcy 
proceedings so assets can be sold 
the committee regrettably but firmly takes this position after 
thoroughly deliberating and weighing all of the facts and 
alternatives and after supporting easterns effort to reorganize 
for more than 20 months said the filing signed by creditors 
attorney joel b zweibel 
eastern has been losing some 1 million a day but 
courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue jr has predicted the 
losses can be turned around early next year eastern nonetheless 
said it needs another infusion of cash to stay in business 
we feel that in all respects the money is justified because 
eastern right now is showing the strongest recovery trend since the 
strike began spokesman jim ashlock said tuesday 
creditors disagreed 
eastern is not and is not likely to become under any 
realistic scenario a viable standalone airline the unsecured 
creditors committee said the court filing went on to say that the 
creditors are the owner of this airline and firmly believe that 
the airline should be closed their representative the trustee as 
a matter of law and equity should be required to abide by their 
wishes 
airlines have been hit hard the past three months by fuel prices 
that skyrocketed after iraqs invasion of kuwait in august the 
eastern creditors said that if oil prices stay in the 35 per 
barrel range eastern will lose between another 882 million and 
1234 million in november and december 
the creditors said shugrues claims that eastern can be made 
viable by early next year are based on an unrealistic assumption 
that oil prices will fall to about 30 per barrel even if that 
happens the creditors said eastern would only break even for the 
year

michael milken in an emotional letter to his 
sentencing judge acknowledged his crimes and pleaded for the 
opportunity to rebuild his life but not in the securities 
industry 
my priorities today are different milken said in the 
11page letter to us district judge kimba wood its hard for 
me to conceive of ever having the desire to enter into a commercial 
transaction again i dont see that changing in the near future 
milken the former head of the highyield junk bond division of 
drexel burnham lambert inc said he wrote the letter because he 
would be unable emotionally to speak at his sentencing 
the letter was the first time milken publicly described his 
feelings during the governments fouryear investigation of his 
activities at drexel 
i allowed myself to get too caught up in what i was doing to 
consider the consequences or to stop myelf from doing what i knew 
was wrong for that i am truly sorry and ashamed milken said 
i did break our nations laws 
milken said he wanted to testify at a presentencing hearing but 
that he followed his attorneys advice not to even though it was 
terribly difficult and frustrating sitting in the courtroom and not 
being able to speak 
his letter dated nov 5 was filed in court tuesday after 
portions were deleted to protect the privacy of milkens children 
milken who pleaded guilty to six felony counts earlier this 
year faces up to 28 years in prison a date for his sentencing has 
not been set but it is expected to take place later this week or 
early next week 
while milken did not specifically ask to be spared a prison 
sentence he spoke of his fear of incarceration and his desire to 
continue working with disadvantaged children 
much of the rambling letter was about milkens love for his 
family and the loss of privacy he and his wife lori and children 
experienced during the past several years 
let me return to a life of anonymity if humanly possible for 
myself and my family he said i think i can accomplish more by 
blending back into society and quietly seeing what i can do 
milken also claimed he had been falsely represented as a symbol 
of the greed and power that swept the financial world during the 
1980s 
i am a person not a symbol he said i like other 
individuals have strong beliefs and ideals and as i have 
acknowledged by my plea before your honor i have made mistakes 
milken described how his lifes work had been based on a belief 
that he could improve the society and initiate change by making 
capital available to those who previously had no access 
i went to wall street with the desire to help change society 
for the better not to find a fortune he said 
but the insider trading scandal resulted in a different public 
perception milken acknowledged 
i have been forced to face the challenge that not only am i 
portrayed as a fraud but everything my life stood for is called a 
fraud and all the principles i have spoken about my whole life are 
hollow he said at times this has been almost too difficult 
to bear 
he described his recent activities with disadvantaged children 
in the los angeles area and asked to be allowed to continue his 
work there 
i recognize that because of what i did going forward with my 
life will always be one of walking around with the label of 
admitted felon he said i recognize i must conduct myself by 
the standards that i believe in 100 percent of the time now i 
recognize that by accomplishing less i might even accomplish 
more

the wall street journal is closing its 
philadelphia news bureau to save money and plans to either transfer 
or layoff the offices 10 news workers 
a union official said six reporters would lose their jobs 
roger may a spokesman for dow jones amp co inc which publishes 
the journal said he could not confirm the contention of the union 
the independent association of publishers employees that six will 
be laid off 
the philadelphia bureau will by closed at the end of the year 
the company said tuesday 
dow jones and other media companies are suffering through an 
advertising slump that has prompted widespread costcutting in the 
industry dow jones recently announced a 175 percent drop in 
thirdquarter profit reflecting declining ad linage and the costly 
acquisition of the financial information service telerate inc 
dow jones believes it can maintain the same quality of news 
coverage by transferring stories handled by the philadelphia office 
to the new york staff may said 
the president of the 1800member union ronald chen disagreed 
obviously some things have to be affected but theyre 
willing to take that tradeoff chen said quality will suffer 
unless theyre going to tell you people who are working 10 or 11 
hours a day can heap two hours on top of that 
dow jones has no plans to close any of its remaining 13 domestic 
news bureaus may said but chen said editorial employees had 
become concerned about their job security 
if they can close a bureau like philadelphia other bureaus 
might be being looked at chen said 
dow jones has offered older editorial staffers a buyout 
package that is available until nov 30 chen said the union was 
advising workers against accepting the deal which chen called a 
very lowball offer to get people out the door 
in another costcutting move may said dow jones plans to 
relocate certain overseas editors to consolidate all copy editing 
in new york some of the overseas workers particularly foreign 
nationals will likely lose their jobs he said 
the company also will close its newspaper composing operation in 
naperville ill leaving the paper with three other sites for 
newspaper makeup around the nation chen said that closing and 
other recent layoffs had cost 46 employees their jobs 
may was unable to give precise figures for layoffs or the 
potential savings from the cost reductions

the personal computer of 1995 will recognize 
its owners handwriting and voice and display crystal clear 3d 
images on a thin flat screen computer experts predict 
it also will be smaller and lighter than todays machines in 
fact it may be so portable it may be carried by users everywhere 
they go much like an appointment book a panel of indusry 
officials predicted tuesday at the weeklong comdex computer show 
in addition the 1995 models will be in constant contact with 
the rest of the world through builtin cellular phone or radio 
hookups enabling them to send and receive messages as well as news 
reports faxes and documents 
in case that sounds like a delirious dream consider how far 
computers have come in the past five years the power of the 
processor chips at the heart of the machines has increased 
exponentially todays screens produce sharp color images instead 
of black and white and many portable models already fit into a 
briefcase though they lack the power predicted for the future 
machines 
dan bricklin who coinvented the first computer spreadsheet 
visicalc believes the computer keyboard will go the way of the 
computer punchcard 
it will be as quaint as people who use calligraphy pens he 
quipped the keyboard will be considered an accessory in the 
future 
bricklin is so confident that handwriting recognition will be 
the way many computers take in information he started a software 
company to develop programs for the machines 
so far only a few rudimentary handwritingbased computers are on 
the market one sold by grid systems corp a subsidiary of tandy 
corp is a flat 4pound handheld device that resembles an 
etchasketch it recognizes numbers and capital block letters 
written with a special pen on its screen 
among sample uses for the grid machine shown at comdex are an 
entryorder system for food companies that supply supermarkets and 
an electronic accident report for police 
with the retail order form the user writes in the quantity of 
various products using the special pen the computer then 
reproduces the figures in its own typeface 
with the accident report the officer writes his name and the 
computer reproduces it the officer then depicts the accident scene 
by selecting from various road diagrams traffic signs and 
vehicles all represented by pictures that can be moved when the 
pen is touched to the computer screen the reoprt later can be 
printed on almost any computer porinter 
as computers become smaller the keyboard becomes impractical 
said robert carr of go corp which also is developing software 
for handwritingbased machines 
the keyboards dont shrink down very well he said you 
have to file your fingertips to a tiny point 
bricklin believes handwriting recognition will be combined with 
voice recognition to virtually replace keyboards 
he showed a videotape of two voice recognition systems already 
on the market one can be used by doctors to enter patient records 
into a computer it recognizes a limited vocabulary of medical 
terms the other device can draw certain objects on a macintosh 
computer screen by recognizing words for certain objects such as 
circle 
while neither is very sophisticated bricklin said they are a 
vast improvement over machines of a few years ago 
carr believes keyboardless computers will be more socially 
acceptable he said keyboardbased portable computers can seem 
intrusive while a penbased computer is similar to taking notes on 
a pad that will make them more practical when they are toted 
around to meetings or other social situations 
part of the advancement in personal computers will be enabled by 
vastly more powerful microprocessors the experts said by 1995 
the chips used in personal machines will exceed the power of 
todays roomsized mainframe computers they said

regulators are overreacting to the savings 
and loan crisis and risk deepening the current real estate 
recession according to experts appearing at the thrift industrys 
annual convention 
bank and sampl executives began complaining more than a year ago 
of a shortage of credit induced by regulators in new england the 
complaints spread as teams of examiners worked their way through 
institutions in the midatlantic states florida and more recently 
in california 
regulators in forcing banks and sampls to establish reserves 
against possible future losses maintained they simply were 
responding prudently to a weakening economy 
but two real estate experts addressing the 98th annual 
convention of the us league of savings institutions said tuesday 
it is now time to ease up or risk making the situation worse 
if youre a lender this is not a recession this is close to 
a depression said kenneth t rosen chairman of the real estate 
center at the university of californiaberkeley 
rosen called on the bush administration to address the problem 
with a highlevel meeting of treasury department officials and 
financial institution regulators he said institutions with problem 
real estate loans should be permitted to absorb the losses over 
several years 
the approach worked in the mid1980s when problems emerged for 
large banks that had made loans to third world countries he said 
anthony downs a fellow at the brookings institution a 
washington think tank took a softer tone saying regulators were 
forced to crack down hard on real estate lending because bankers 
ignored earlier milder warnings 
he said a neartotal ban is probably warranted on new lending 
for commercial projects because so many of them are vacant but 
added that regulators should soften their stance toward loans to 
home builders 
remarks from the two drew applause at the convention which is 
closing today with the installation of donald shackelford a 
columbus ohio thrift executive as the leagues new chairman 
speakers at the meeting say real estate problems likely will get 
worse before they get better 
rosen is predicting only 900000 units of housing will be built 
next year a twodecade low lynn michaelis chief economist of 
weyerhauser company a lumber corporation is forecasting 105 
million units and martin perlman president of the national 
association of home builders expects 115 million 
federal reserve policymakers who held a closeddoor meeting 
tuesday in washington were expected by economists to approve a 
slightly easier monetary policy which should translate into lower 
interest rates for home mortgages and other consumer loans 
normally lower interest rates stimulate home buying but 
convention participants said only dramatically lower rates would 
overcome public fears of the economic consequences of war in the 
mideast 
immediately after the kuwaiti invasion we saw a sharp shift in 
buying habits its a confidence problem said gerald j levy 
chairman of guaranty bank milwaukee

china 
the united states as the largest stockholder has 1537 or 
1741 percent of the voting power in the world bank depending on

media baron rupert murdochs news international 
said tuesday it is examining a merger proposal between one of its 
british newspapers called today and another london paper the 
sunday correspondent 
the company said in a statement it had been approached last 
weekend by the weekly sunday correspondent suggesting the merger 
with the daily today 
the proposal was to have a roundtheweek operation in which 
news international would have a minority share news international 
said 
the sunday correspondent was launched sept 17 1989 there are 
11 papers published in britain on sundays and they compete 
ferociously for readers 
in a bid to win greater popularity with a mass national 
readership the sunday correspondent abandoned its broadsheet 
format on sept 30 to become a tabloid 
this followed a fall in sales to below the 350000 copies needed 
to break even a financial rescue package and the resignation of 
editor peter cole in what it called the interests of the 
continued shareholder support 
the times of london another murdoch paper said the papers 
current circulation is below 300000 
sunday correspondent shareholders include the chicago tribune 
the british daily newspaper the guardian robert maxwell owner of 
mirror group newspapers whose british tabloid flagship is the daily 
mirror and saudi arabian investor wafiq saeed 
publisher eddie shah launched today in march 1986 as britains 
first electronically produced national daily paper it accelerated 
a technological revolution in britains national newspaper 
industry which until 1986 was dominated by outdated production 
methods largely as a result of union militancy 
but today did not thrive under shah and businessman tiny 
rowlands international conglomerate lonrho plc bought it from him 
later in 1986 
lonrho cut todays heavy financial losses and increased its 
advertising revenue and circulation but sold it to murdoch in 1987 
for 38 million pounds which was then worth about 608 million 
the paper now sells 588000 copies a day 
the times reported a merger would result in significant cost 
savings involving job losses at both newspapers 
news international said no deal had been reached and that it had 
issued the statement simply to avoid unnecessary and inaccurate 
rumors whilst this approach is being examined 
it said it was continuing efforts to make today profitable 
murdoch who was born in australia but has become a us 
citizen controls about a third of britains national daily and 
sunday newspaper circulation in addition to the times and today 
he owns the the sun and two sunday newspapers 
on nov 2 his fourchannel sky television service announced it 
would merge with its rival british satellite broadcastings five 
channels to form a new fivechannel network called british sky 
broadcasting

gap inc is a proud parent again 
after downscaling its trendy gap apparel line into kid sizes 
the california retailer has further miniaturized its offerings for 
the newborntotoddler set 
the first babygap appeared just nine months ago in a corner of a 
gap store in san francisco since then the company has spawned 
babygap departments within 50 of its 150 gapkids stores that dot 
the nations shopping landscape 
though still in its infancy industry analysts say babygap has 
become a roaring success story based on the same formula that 
catapulted the company to the status of industry darling durable 
clothing in comfortable generous cuts at affordable prices 
indeed gap went against the tide by selecting quality suppliers 
that do not normally manufacture childrens clothing to create a 
hybrid of better quality and fun fashion which is unique in kids 
merchandising said thomas tashjian an analyst with seidler 
amdek securities inc in los angeles 
for parents who cringe at swathing their little ones in 
synthetic fabrics babygap offerings are strictly 100 percent 
sturdy cotton banished from shelves are those anemic 
genderidentifying pastels only deep bold hues can be found on 
everything from rugbystriped jumpsuits to raime vneck pullovers 
and crisp embroidered blouses in tiny sizes where else can you 
find a singlepocket tshirt in black for a 1yearold a gap 
spokesman asked rhetorically 
the seasonal color palette and natural fibers are what attracted 
laura cooper a mother from brooklyn ny to the babygap shops in 
manhattan shortly after they opened 
what they do well is edit each of the lines so that youre not 
overwhelmed with what to choose from cooper said and individual 
items available in an array of colors make for an easy way to put 
together a complementary wardrobe she said 
because gap turns over its merchandise very frequently cooper 
heads straight for the sale sign though gap spokesman richard 
crisman said the company is not in the business of offering sale 
racks he conceded merchandise is set aside to make way for fresh 
offerings which arrive every six weeks or so 
you will find a new color palette and new designs every six 
weeks it may be the same tshirt but it might be in a new 
color or we may have added a detail he said 
the babygap was the logical outgrowth of gapkids which was 
created in 1985 out of gap president millard mickey drexlers 
search for stylish but longlasting clothing for his own young son 
drexler who rarely speaks to the press voiced his frustrations to 
staff members and realized how tired others also were of pink and 
blue crisman said 
originally the kids clothes were simply scaleddown versions of 
the adult line but once executives realized what a hit they had on 
their hands gap established a team to design just the childrens 
line 
because the kids stores are smaller partially to minimize the 
risk in launching the line and also because the merchandise is 
well smaller sales per square foot outpace that of gap stores 
already among the highest in the industry analysts have estimated 
gap sales at about 360 a square foot babygap at 400 
even in this dismal retail environment the gap is expected to 
fare well during the crucial holiday season mainly because it is a 
lean operation with low fixed costs and price tags that will not 
send recessionweary consumers into cardiac arrest bigsellers in 
the baby department are the denim overalls for 28 embroidered 
blouses for 16 and longsleeve tshirts in bright blue purple 
yellow or red for 10 
donald trott an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
estimates that gap will report earnings of 182 a share for the 
fiscal year ending jan 31 1991 up from 138 the previous year 
sales are expected to total 194 billion up from 159 billion 
their growth rate has been running at around 20 percent a 
year and it is expected to continue to run at that pace he 
said gapkids is certainly helping that growth rate in terms 
of total contribution babygap is not significant yet but we think 
it has good potential 
many gapkids stores are located either within or in sight of 
regular gap stores in an effort to piggyback customer traffic 
theres a benefit to both crisman said 
having childrens and adult clothing under the same roof allows 
consumers to do all their shopping at one time but separate 
childrens stores eliminates the problem of kids who dont want 
to be shopping in the same store as their parents crisman said 
the companys latest strategy is to open even bigger stores that 
can expand the product line and incorporate adult kids and baby 
gear all under one roof 
gapkids and babygap are a significant part of gaps future the 
company plans to open more than 40 new gap stores in 1991 it will 
open just as many gapkids with babygap departments 
we dont do anything here in a big way until we are entirely 
sure of it and this is going gangbusters crisman said 
the company which also owns the banana republic chain is 
expanding its gap stores in britain and canada the first 
freestanding gapkids store opened in london earlier this year 
the regular line already has 750 stores and there isnt 
any reason why the kids line cant follow along the parents 
coattails in terms of success analyst tashjian said 
perhaps gaps greatest achievement has been its ability to 
capitalize on the handing down of tradition most middleclass 
babyboomers grew up with some relationship with the gap now their 
children can be clad in similar fare all exclusive to the gap

it was founded as an example of economic hope 
and inspiration for black harlem but now freedom national bank of 
new york has closed its doors for good 
federal officials began paying off customers insured deposits 
tuesday at the bank which was established in 1964 and was one of 
the largest minorityowned banks in the country 
freedom national lost nearly 4 million over the last two years 
and was expected to lose at least an additional 2 million this 
year said the federal deposit insurance corp 
the federal agency declared the bank insolvent friday and 
community leaders scrambled during the veterans day holiday weekend 
to find 6 million need to stop the banks closing 
us rep charles rangel of harlem said enough money had been 
committed to save the bank but the cash could not be moved to the 
right hands by a 7 am tuesday deadline set by fdic regulators 
rangel said there was no question that a days grace would have 
saved the bank whose first chairman was baseball immortal jackie 
robinson 
the bank had assets of 1019 million 22000 depositors and 97 
employees 
had this been a white bank in a white community im sure they 
wouldnt have done this so precipitously the rev wyatt tee 
walker said outside the banks main office in harlem where some 
400 depositors waited on line to get their money the bank also had 
two branches in brooklyn 
it looks like freedom never had a chance black people come 
last in this countrys agenda said walker whose canaan baptist 
church had more than 500000 deposited in the bank 
few of those who started forming a line at the bank before dawn 
expressed fear about the safety of their money 
when the doors opened federal banking officials were sitting at 
long tables covered with checks to close out all of freedom 
nationals accounts of 100000 or less said fdic spokesman caryl 
austrian

soviet economists have been looking to 
their colleagues in the west for both guidance and reassurance as 
they struggle towards a market economy soviet and american 
economists meeting at yale said 
economists from the soviet union can read about how the federal 
reserve system works but its not quite the same as talking to 
someone who knows how it functions said merton j peck a yale 
economics professor involved in an international effort to assist 
the soviets 
peck said tuesday the soviets are also looking for reassurance 
as they make a tremendous leap of faith 
while sharp divisions exist in the soviet union over how to go 
about restructuring their economy the interesting thing to me is 
there is current no discussion that we the soviets dont go to 
the market peck said 
several soviet economists including a member of the group that 
drafted the socalled shatalin 500day plan are meeting at 
yale this week with economists from the united states japan and 
europe 
the economists are part of a group established by the 
international institute for applied systems analysis an eastwest 
organization based near vienna austria 
the group was formed last year at the request of stanislav 
shatalin economic advisor to mikhail gorbachev and head of the 
task force that wrote the 500day plan previous sessions were held 
in austria and hungary 
we need to rethink the questions that have been raised in the 
context of where the soviet union is going now peck said 
eugeny yasin an economist and member of the shatalin group 
told a news conference tuesday that he was initially skeptical that 
the soviets could gain much from meeting with foreign experts 
but after taking part in the meetings with economists from the 
west i completely changed my mind yasin said through a 
translator a fellow soviet economist 
peck said one of the problems in the past was that economists 
from the west used to go over and lecture their soviet 
counterparts 
we try to think of this exchange more as a dialogue and as 
problem solving that is the distinguishing feature of our group 
he said 
while the international conference is under way at yale another 
soviet exchange is taking place at southern connecticut state 
university in new haven 
five faculty members and nine students from the moscow financial 
institute as well as the institutes director will be learning 
about entrepreneurship marketing and productivity at scsus school 
of business

british airways plc said wednesday its 
secondquarter profit rose 94 percent but its chairman warned that 
a profit in the second half was unlikely 
for the three months ended sept 30 aftertax profits for 
britains biggest airline came to 116 million pounds or 217 
million compared with 106 million pounds in the same period a year 
ago 
sales rose 46 percent to 14 billion pounds or 26 billion 
from 135 billion pounds a year earlier 
for the first six months of the year aftertax profit jumped 35 
percent to 227 million pounds or 424 million from 168 million 
pounds a year earlier 
halfyear sales gained 87 percent to 275 billion pounds or 
51 billion from 253 billion pounds a year earlier 
the airlines chairman lord king said the company was 
unlikely to show a profit in the second half of the year 
because of higher fuel costs that have resulted from the middle 
east crisis 
he said fare increases wont recoup the extra costs associated 
with fuel costs and expected lower traffic growth 
the group is carrying out a series of cost cutting exercises to 
minimize the impact of the problems the airline faces in the 
short term he said 
british airways said that the increase in fuel costs over the 
halfyear was limited to 74 percent because arrangements to buy 
fuel were made in advance of the actual purchases and because of 
exchange rate benefits fuel costs generally increased 23 percent 
in the second quarter from a year earlier 
british airways said 107 percent or 136 million more 
passengers were carried on scheduled services in the half year 
the figures were converted into dollars at exchange rates 
provided by the company of 187 to the pound

investors in the taj mahal casino 
resort and casino owner donald trump blame each other for breaking 
off debt restructuring talks just before a 473 million payment 
comes due thursday 
no new negotiations were scheduled after talks broke off tuesday 
between trump and holders of 675 million in bonds used to finance 
the taj mahal the most ostentatious casino in atlantic city 
wilbur ross senior managing director for new yorkbased 
rothschild inc which is negotiating for bondholders said theyre 
willing to renew negotiations if trump is reasonable 
its up to them ross said in a telephone interview from new 
york were perfectly willing to return 
but ross said bondholders remain willing to take their chances 
at throwing trump into bankruptcy rather than accept the offer 
trump made to restructure the money he owes the bondholders are 
secured or first in line in any list of creditor demands he said 
trump has a 30day grace period to make the payment after 
thursday with failure opening up the prospect that the taj mahal 
could be thrown into bankruptcy months after it opened april 2 as 
atlantic citys newest and biggest casino 
trump said in a news release tuesday that the bondholders 
represented by rothschild inc presented unrealistic demands 
we saw no point in going forward trump said 
unfortunately this case will be in court for many years to 
come 
trump said numerous bondholders have contacted his new 
yorkbased trump organization seeking to deal apart from rothschild 
inc trump did not elaborate 
calls to the trump organization seeking comment were referred to 
chief financial officer stephen bollenbach telephone messages left 
for bollenbach were not immediately returned but he was quoted in 
new yorkarea newspapers today as saying he believed a compromise 
deal could still be struck 
ross said bondholders remain united 
an ageold strategy is to try to divide and conquer your 
enemy ross said 
he said trump failed to budge on four bondholder demands the 
amount of interest that trump would pay whether excess cash in the 
casino would be earmarked as supplemental interest for bondholders 
the amount of equity that trump would sacrifice in exchange for 
restructured terms and bondholders influence over a board of 
directors 
ross would not be more specific about the negotiating terms but 
trump said in a filing last month with the securities and exchange 
commission he would offer the bondholders 199 percent in the 
casino 
the state casino control commission is scheduled to hold a 
hearing dec 3 
on the financial stability of trumps three casinos which 
include the trump plaza hotel and casino and trump castle casino 
resort by the bay 
the commission scheduled the financial stability hearing after 
approving in august a 65 million emergency bank loan to trump 
castle designed to stave off a default at that property 
all three casinos have suffered this year along with the entire 
gaming industry in atlantic city gross gaming revenues at trump 
plaza and trump castle plunged after the taj mahal opened 
the taj mahal has posted the citys highest gross gaming 
revenues since gambling came in 1978 but the mammoth casino which 
cost 1 billion to build has failed to make the 13 million a day 
that analysts said it would need to break even on its debtfinanced 
property 
rothschild represents a steering committee of about 35 percent 
of the bondholder interests the steering committee was elected by 
about 85 percent of the bondholder interests ross said

cs first boston inc will lay off about 200 
workers by the end of the year and surrender majority ownership to 
the parent of credit swisse in a major rescue effort for the 
struggling investment bank 
first boston will sell 300 million in equity to cs holding 
raising the swiss companys stake to 60 percent from 445 percent 
also cs will give cs first boston 425 million in cash for the 
bulk of its troubled loan portfolio the weak loans have weighed 
heavily on its balance sheet and led to a potentially damaging 
credit rating review 
the rescue is the latest fallout from wall streets lingering 
recession that has eliminated tens of thousands of jobs dried up 
profitable business sectors and forced major firms to seek help 
from corporate parents 
the deal also marks the first time a foreign company has taken 
majority control of a major us investment bank cs first boston 
is the parent of first boston corp which had about 3850 
employees at the end of october 
we want to be certain that the depth of our commitment to cs 
first boston is clear and that the strength of our investment 
banking affiliate is beyond question cs holding chairman rainer 
s gut said in a statement 
the bailout by cs holding is the second this year by the parent 
of an ailing wall street subsidiary american express co early 
this year injected 13 billion into shearson lehman holdings inc 
and took the company private 
the first boston restructuring rids the firm of the majority of 
11 billion in temporary bridge loans made to corporate 
clients that the firm has been unable to sell because of the 
collapse of the junk bond market 
under the plan cs first boston will place all its bridge loans 
except for those to campeau corps federated department stores 
subsidiary and to jerrico inc into a special limited partnership 
in exchange cs first boston will receive a stake in the 
partnership which also will contain some equity investments and 
the 425 million in cash the firm still will hold 377 million in 
the troublesome bridge loans however 
additionally cs first boston announced it was writing off 360 
million in soured investments including the federated and jerrico 
bridge loans and some real estate venture capital and leveraged 
buyout investments 
that action is expected to reduce the firms 1990 earnings 
first boston made just 11 million last year and reportedly has 
losses so far this year 
wall street analysts said the moves were favorable and could 
head off a potential downgrade in first bostons credit rating 
which would make the firms daily borrowing requirements more 
costly 
the closer relationship with cs holding and the strenghtening 
of the financial structure are positive steps said john j kriz 
a vice president with moodys investors service inc a major 
credit rating agency 
moodys several weeks ago placed first bostons credit rating 
under review kriz said moodys would evaluate the rating in light 
of the recapitalization plan 
the 200 layoffs are in addition to about 100 firings in recent 
weeks in the firms stock and operations departments by the end of 
the year first boston will have reduced its total us employment 
by nearly 8 percent the company employs 5800 people worldwide 
the firm was taken private in 1988 in a merger between first 
boston and its european affiliate but it fell on hard times last 
year particularly because of the collapse in the market for junk 
bonds the highyield securities in which the company was a major 
player

the german government on wednesday 
announced plans to cut defense spending by 25 billion marks or 
17 billion next year and impose no new taxes in the first budget 
of united germany 
partial budget proposals approved by the conservative cabinet 
on wednesday and outlined by finance minister theo waigel also 
called for setting a federal deficit cap of 70 billion marks or 
47 billion for 1991 and reducing the federal deficit to 30 
billion marks or 20 billion by 1994 
the 1990 federal deficit was 668 billion marks or 45 billion 
a detailed budget is expected to be presented to the new unified 
german government next spring 
the partial proposal did not give an overall spending figure for 
the united country but waigel said he expected spending to be no 
more than 2 percent higher than the combined 1990 budgets of east 
and west germany 
officials said the two countries had total budgets of 396 
billion marks or about 265 billion before they unified on oct 
3 
waigel said he did not expect there would be tax increases 
if decisive measures are taken tax increases will not be 
necessary waigel said it would be counterproductive to take 
measures that weaken the german economy 
the two german governments spent about 57 billion marks or 38 
billion on defense in 1990 an official in the finance ministry 
said the 1991 cuts of 25 billion marks would represent a 4 
percent reduction in defense spending 
earlier in the week defense minister gerhard stoltenberg 
outlined plans to cut germanys armed forces to 370000 from about 
525000 over the next four years germany agreed to the troop 
reduction in exchange for the soviet unions blessing of united 
germanys continued nato membership and the gradual withdrawal of 
soviet troops from former east german territory 
waigel told reporters the government expected the economy to 
grow 3 percent to 35 percent in what used to be west germany in 
1991 he said projected growth for a united germany in 1991 would 
be 2 percent to 3 percent 
inflation was expected to run about 3 percent next year but 
could decline to 25 percent waigel added 
western states must show solidarity and bear more of the cost of

the european community commission on 
wednesday proposed to cancel 43 billion in debt that 69 
developing nations owe the european community as a whole 
the debt worth 31 billion european currency units is owed by 
african caribbean and pacific nations that have special trade ties 
with the ec 
ec development commissioner manual marin said his debt 
cancellation proposal does not cover bilateral debt between 
the acp and the 12 ec states but between the acp nations and the 
community as a whole 
the acp nations are mostly former european colonies 
their debt to the ec stems from special loans and risk capital 
the ec has granted through trade and aid treaties over the past 15 
years 
marin said his proposal for debt cancellation would be a new 
political signal of the communitys willingness to help some of 
the worlds poorest nations 
while some have a poor record in repaying debts to individual 
donor nations marin said the acp nations have always paid back 
their debts to the community 
his called his proposal for a blanket cancellation of debt an 
overall gesture of goodwill to developing nations regardless of 
their human rights records or efforts to overhaul their economies 
linking debt cancellation to respect for human rights he said 
was a delicate matter that was not for the ec commision to 
decide he added

gerrard w haworth was a high school shop 
instructor with a hobby shop on the side when he was turned down 
for a bank loan to start a wood products business 
that was in 1948 it was probably one of the few setbacks 
haworth encountered in his business venture and even that one was 
temporary his parents wound up lending him the 10000 needed to 
get started 
today haworth inc is a global office furniture company with 
worldwide sales that approached 550 million in 1989 4200 
employees and 370 dealers 
sometimes i have to pinch myself to realize how far weve 
come said the spry 79yearold haworth who remains the 
companys chairman it all started as a little hobby shop on the 
side i bought a few tools and started building this and that in my 
spare time 
among his sparetime projects was a request from a philadelphia 
client to build wood dividers for an office a new concept at the 
time and one that has revolutionized the layout of offices around 
the country 
office partitions were the focus of haworths business until 
1975 when he sold the 10 million business modern products inc 
and son richard helped transform the family company into a 
fullline office furniture supplier 
from 197888 the company grew at more than twice the industrys 
rate with sales increasing annually anywhere from 20 percent to 
60 percent 
a few years before my father died i took him to this 
600000squarefoot building we had built here and he took it all 
in and said gerry why do you want to get so big the elder 
haworth recalled i said dad i dont know how to control 
it 
indeed growth at haworth has been practically uncontrollable 
since 1976 when the company introduced a prewired office panel 
it further revolutionized office design by eliminating the need for 
new electrical wiring or extension cords every time an office was 
created or altered 
the electrified panel put them on the map people went nuts 
for it said alan zimmerman president of radley resources a 
westfield nj marketing and consulting firm to start from 
nothing and suddenly have a halfbilliondollar company is 
incredible 
despite its success haworth kept a relatively low profile in 
the industry until five years ago when it accused industry leader 
steelcase inc of grand rapids of stealing the technology for the 
patented panel 
after a prolonged court fight haworth won the two sides now 
are negotiating what haworth is owed and analysts say the figure 
may be in the tens of millions 
the company is facing off with another competitor thats 
threatening its no 3 spot in the industry 
westinghouse electric corps kentwoodbased furniture division 
went on a buying spree this year snapping up several companies 
including knoll international of new york the acquisitions are 
expected to boost westinghouses furniture sales to about 600 
million which is what haworth is predicting for 1990 
i dont really consider ourselves out of the no 3 slot 
though we dont have the clarity of being there that we had 
before said richard haworth president and chief executive 
officer but i dont really think thats the point the point is 
that we can still provide better quality and service 
still haworth isnt sitting back the company has made several 
recent purchases of smaller companies and product lines and says it 
still is looking toward more expansion especially in europe 
and like the company that bears his name the elder haworth says 
he has no plans to slow down 
when people ask gerry why dont you hang it up i laugh i 
started this business as a hobby why shouldnt i continue it has a 
hobby said haworth who traded his teaching job at the local 
high school for a chance to start a business and better support his 
wife and four children 
he remains keenly interested in the education field he recently 
donated 5 million for a new business college at his alma mater 
western michigan university in kalamazoo the building which will 
open in january will be called the haworth college of business 
a mildmannered man with an easy smile that shaves at least 10 
years off his age haworth has a paternalistic quality and commands 
respect as he addresses new employees called members at the 
start of a twoweek orientation at the companys headquarters 
one of the first to arrive for the 730 am session haworth 
makes sure the groggyeyed trainees are wellacquainted with the 
haworth creed the customer comes first 
you are the ones on the front line the first impressions you 
make with the customers are the lasting ones said haworth a 
bespectacled man with a receding white hairline 
he speaks for just a few minutes before giving the floor to his 
son who closely resembles his father in appearance and 
personality but with a slightly harder edge 
i think its great having dad talk to them the employees 
the younger haworth said it adds a feeling of stability and 
i think they sense he really does care

robert kearns who owns the patent for 
intermittent windshield wipers today settled a 12yearold lawsuit 
against ford motor co for 102 million 
us district judge avern cohn approved the settlement after 
spending most of a 20minute court hearing making sure kearns 
understood terms of the deal 
kearns lawsuits against 19 other automakers remain active he 
contends that each failed to pay him royalties for using his 
invention a windhield wiper that starts and stops at intervals 
bill durkee kearns attorney said the next target probably 
will be chrysler corp the nations no 3 automaker behind general 
motors corp and ford has agreed not to argue about whether kearns 
patents are valid a contention that had been argued during the 
suit against ford 
durkee said he would have liked to continue the case against 
ford but as a practical matter with all the other cases 
pending there was a logjam 
when you step back and look at all this sometimes its better 
to get on with other things he said 
said kearns i dont think the goal was the magnitude of the 
money what i saw my role was to defend the patent system said 
kearns if i dont go further there really isnt a patent 
system 
kearns 63 and a former resident of gaithersburg md now 
lives in a onebedroom rented apartment in houston texas he is a 
former engineering professor at wayne state university in detroit 
he said he planned to use the money to pay legal bills and 
perhaps buy a house in texas 
he also said proceeds from the ford case would be used in 
lawsuits against the other defendants including gm chrysler and 
japanese and european automakers 
durkee said preliminary work still needed to be done in many of 
the cases all pending before cohn 
ford attorney malcolm wheeler said the company had resolved all 
disputes with kearns 
were pleased to be done with the litigation he said we 
still believe that if we had another shot at it the patents would 
have been held invalid we think this is an extremely reasonable 
settlement 
originally kearns sought 141 million and had rejected a 30 
million settlement offer from ford 
last july after one mistrial a federal jury ordered ford to 
pay 52 million plus interest which pushed the award to between 
85 million and 115 million 
by the end of this week durkee said a 102 million check in 
kearns name will be put in an escrow account to which kearns would 
have immediate access

while some car buyers are drawn to big rebates 
others cant resist paying 40000 over list price for a new set of 
wheels 
the acura nsx is commanding that kind of money from those who 
want an exotic car without a ferrari or lamborghini price tag 
its a bargain said sales manager betsy volaric of sunshine 
acura in farmington hills 
the nsx which looks a bit like a shrunken ferrari testarosa 
carries a list price of 60000 with a manual transmission and 
63000 for one with an automatic 
but since acura the luxury division of honda motor co ltd of 
japan plans to import just 3000 of them a year demand is far 
outpacing supply 
that pumps up the price 
premiums on cars are nothing new to the auto industry last 
year buyers shelled out up to 25000 for the hardtoget mazda 
miata which carried a base price of 13800 
volaric said her dealership one of 300 acura dealers in the 
country is tacking 20000 to 25000 onto the price of the nsx 
because thats what the market will bear 
anybody who is familiar with the exotic car market realizes 
that 85000 is a bargain she said ferraris and lamborghinis 
begin at more than 100000 and stretch past 300000 each before 
any premium 
acura spokesman mike spencer said dealers in markets with high 
exoticcar interest such as los angeles and miami are getting up 
to 100000 for an nsx 40000 over sticker price 
legally we cant tell the dealers what to sell the cars 
for he said at the same time they look at this as geez if 
isell the car to a speculator for 60000 and he turns around and 
sells it for 80000 to 90000 whos the fool here 
a fool has no place behind the wheel of an nsx the sleek 
twoseater packs a 3liter v6 engine which puts out 270 
horsepower its top speed is rated around 165 mph and it can go 
from a standing start to 60 mph in about 55 seconds 
tooling around detroit freeways in an nsx causes normally vacant 
highway stares to come alive even at highway speeds motorists 
hover around the nsx for a closer look 
in a recent test drive 
the driver of a mazda rx7 on the right looked for a minute 
dropped back for a different view came up on the left for another 
peek and moved to the front to take a look at the nsx in his 
rearview mirror 
afterwards he dropped back to the right nodded his head up and 
down vigorously and flashed a thumbsup sign 
a load of what appeared to be teenagers in an oldsmobile 
pulled alongside and accelerated appearing to dare a highway race 
the nsx is a conspicuous car and the offer was ignored 
parked at a local mall the car was a magnet for nearly everyone 
who walked by including car crazies and store clerks 
i thought it was a ferrari said denise didonato of 
rochester hills a cosmetics clerk at saks fifth avenue in a 
suburban detroit shopping mall its cute very cute 
she owns a 1990 lincoln town car 568 inches longer and 1000 
pounds heavier than an nsx 
kevin corcoran of franklin could have been doing an 
advertisement for the car its extraordinarily flashy and 
reasonably priced as far as these things go theres a lot of 
italian in it 
corcoran owns a pickup in which he spends most of his highway 
time and a mclaren an extremely lowvolume exotic sports car 
with a target volume of 3000 annually the nsx doesnt pose a 
significant volume threat to any car now being sold in the united 
states 
its priced somewhere around a porsche 911 the mercedesbenz 
300series a bmw 7series or a chevrolet corvette zr1 the 
hottest car made by a major american manufacturer 
the nsx doesnt look nearly as muscular as the zr1 and it 
isnt the zr1s 57liter v8 engine produces 375 horsepower 
nearly 30 percent more than the nsx 
the allaluminum nsx makes up for some of that difference in 
weight coming in at 3010 pounds compared with the zr1 at 3465 
pounds 
canadian visitor craig donnelly is an nsx fan he said he had a 
poster of a black one back home in ottawa where he also has a 
pontiac sunbird 
its got the same size engine as that he said nodding to 
the nsx but it doesnt go like that

us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
said wednesday the united states would not budge on its demand for 
sharp cuts in agricultural subsidies in the current round of world 
trade talks 
at a joint news conference with yeutter us trade 
representative carla hills said agriculture was the key to 
resolving the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade 
mrs hills said quick progress was possible only if the european 
community showed the political will to achieve it but she doubted 
whether negotiators could have a deal ready for signing by the end 
of the weeklong meeting which begins in brussels on dec 3 
however an american official in brussels told reporters that 
the united states has no intention of walking out of the talks 
despite the acrimonious dispute with the european community 
we want to keep at this it is important even if the 
prospects are unpromising you soldier on said the official 
who demanded anonymity 
i dont think the united states would be the first to walk 
away from the table and i think we would discourage others from 
walking away he said 
the united states has asked its trading partners to slash farm 
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent 
over a 10year period starting in 1991 
the united states hopes that lowering trade barriers will enable 
its farmers to sell more goods on the world market other 
farmexporting countries like argentina and australia also would 
like a chance to export more 
the european community however contends it needs its vast 
network of agriculture supports to protect its farm community of 
some 10 million farmers many of whom have small operations 
the ec has suggested trimming subsidies on major farm crops by 
30 percent over 10 years retroactive to 1986 it has made no 
promises to reduce export subsidies 
yeutter said the europeans have already cut about half of the 
offered 30 percent reducing their actual offer to a 15 percent 
cut 
yeutter who is visiting european capitals in search of a 
compromise said he has encountered a view among europeans that the 
united states will back down on its demands 
that is a dangerous impression and one that is doomed to be 
incorrect yeutter said 
german economics minister helmut haussmann said after a meeting 
with yeutter that germany hoped the talks could proceed on 
technical questions despite the agriculture impasse but yeutter 
said the heart of the issue must be addressed 
hills said many of the 105 nations involved in the uruguay round 
will not be interested in making progress in other areas of the 
talks such as intellectual property or services if they do not 
achieve progress in the agricultural talks 
hills us secretary of states james a baker iii and commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher will travel to brussels for another set 
of talks on friday top ec officials were in washington earlier in 
the week to address the dispute

marketing campaigns aimed at blacks hispanics and asians its 
clients have included honda the us census bureau southern 
california gas co and home savings of america 
ken smikle president of the african american marketing amp media 
association a chicago trade group said nikes move appeared to be 
motivated by a boycott led by operation push the civil rights 
group founded by the rev jesse jackson 
after months of denial nike has admitted that it can use the 
expertise of minority marketers smikle said the major concern 
that we have is that they be given a significant account one that 
involves product advertising 
but nike spokeswoman liz dolan said the search for an agency to 
handle a minority campaign started two years ago and was not 
inspired by the boycott 
dolan said the boycott made us aware that a multiethnic 
agency is what we were looking for our thinking changed from just 
looking for a hispanic agency to one that could do hispanic 
african american and asian ads 
agency president j melvin muse said his firm has not place a 
dollar value on the nike account the agency handles about 16

mca inc stock climbed wednesday after a 
published report suggested talks are intensifying over the 
possibility that japans matsushita electric industrial co will 
make a definitive bid to acquire the entertainment company 
mca and matsushita confirmed in september they were in talks 
about a buyout and there was speculation the japanese electronics 
manufacturer would offer about 85 a share for mca owner of 
universal pictures and universal television 
in trading late wednesday on the new york stock exchange mca 
was up 425 a share at 6250 
the wall street journal reported that officials of mca and 
matsushita have scheduled talks for monday and hope to agree within 
days on terms of a buyout 
a spokeswoman for mca in universal city calif said the 
company had no comment on the report a spokesman for matsushita 
failed to return a phone call 
with about 92 million shares outstanding a bid of 85 a share 
would value mca at about 78 billion 
the journal story said that a specific price is still up for 
negotiation and it cautioned that there is no certainty that a 
deal will be negotiated or that the timetable will be followed 
if a deal were worked out it would be the latest example of 
foreign ownership of a major american movie studio 
in the biggest such deal to date japans sony corp bought 
columbia pictures entertainment inc last year for 34 billion 
plus debt that raised the total value of the deal to about 5 
billion

christmas was on its way lovely glorious 
beautiful christmas around which the entire kid year revolved 
that was how humorist jean shepherd summed up the holiday season 
in the 1983 film a christmas story the tale of a little boys 
quest for the christmas present of his dreams an air rifle 
and so it is for millions of children christmas is the high 
point of their year but this christmas is a difficult one for many 
of their parents who are concerned about the economy and the 
middle east and have less money to spend on toys 
consumers are in a quandry caught between financial restraints 
and wanting to fulfill their childrens christmas wishes 
toy retailers and manufacturers already have felt the pinch 
toys r us inc the nations biggest toy retailer suffered a slump 
in sales after the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august that mirrored 
the dropoff in business throughout the retail industry 
robert nakasone a toys r us vice chairman acknowledged that 
these are uncertain times but he expected a merry christmas 
nonetheless 
people may cut back for durables but when it comes down to 
your kid at christmas its pretty hard to say no to them he 
said 
even in relatively poor economic years he said toys r us has 
had some of its best holiday seasons in 1982 in the midst of the 
countrys last recession toy sales for the entire industry rose 13 
percent 
but some industry analysts were not as sanguine daniel barry 
of kidder peabody amp co said toy sales could slip along with other 
merchandise sales this season 
retailers and manufacturers are concerned because even one less 
toy under a christmas tree when multiplied by the more than 60 
million children age 16 and under in the country can make for a 
poor christmas season 
perhaps the most sensitive area is video games which again are 
on many wish lists this christmas 
retailers and video game manufacturers face several unknowns 
given the uncertain business environment no one is sure how many 
parents are willing to invest big on nintendo and other more 
expensive video systems 
the biggest question is whether the new systems which offer 
more advanced technology and more sophisticated graphics and sound 
effects than nintendo can take market share from the industry 
leader 
children who have tired of nintendo games or whose nintendo 
systems have worn out are asking for the new units known as 
16bit systems a bit is the smallest unit of information in a 
computer and 16bit systems can process more information and 
instructions than eightbit systems like nintendo 
the 16bit systems which include nec corps turbografx16 and 
segas genesis must overcome a big obstacle their price 
the basic genesis unit has a list price of 18995 while the 
basic turbografx16 goes for 159 those prices dont include game 
cartridges which can run 50 or more apiece 
in comparison nintendo looks like a bargain its basic unit can 
be found for under 100 in many stores and many of its cartridges 
sell at a discount because there is a glut of them on the market 
nintendos handheld model game boy also has a price edge over 
its new competitor necs turboexpress game boy has a list price 
of 100 while turboexpress lists for 249 
it all comes down to how much parents want to indulge their 
children and how much they can and want to spend 
manufacturers say they already are feeling the effects of a 
cautious consumer 
in a normal year retailers in october would purchase enough 
to take them all the way through christmas said ken wirt necs 
vice president for home entertainment 
but this year he said storeowners so far have ordered enough 
merchandise to last them only through the thanksgiving weekend 
paul valentine an analyst with standard amp poors corp said 
manufacturers of traditional toys such as dolls and action 
figures have had similar experiences 
the turmoil in the retail industry has definitely had an 
impact on the toy industry he said 
but some traditional toys are expected to be sure winners this 
season analysts say 
childrens love affair with teenage mutant ninja turtles is 
continuing so the playmates toys inc action figures and their 
spinoffs which include videos books clothes watches and games 
should do well 
the simpsons are expected to be found in varying forms under 
plenty of christmas trees manufacturers have licenses from the 
producers of the popular television series for a range of 
merchandise including dolls and plastic figures 
dolls based on the rock group new kids on the block have been 
selling well ever since their introduction earlier this year by 
hasbro inc and theyre expected to be a hit again at christmas 
barbie mattel incs longreigning queen of toys continues to 
dominate the doll business with new outfits a swimming pool and 
her own corvette among the offerings 
meanwhile theres been an explosion of baby and toddler dolls 
as that segment continues to thrive a parent shopping in a 
wellstocked toy department or store may dozens of dolls to choose 
from with most ranging from 20 to about 60 
there are dolls that drink wet their diapers fall down cry 
shiver or take baths and dolls that can be dressed up made up or 
have their hair dyed the toy companies have tried to outdo one 
another in making their dolls stand out hasbro created baby uhoh 
which soils its diapers after it has been fed the idea turns some 
adults off but little girls love it and the dolls have been 
selling well according to valentine 
another toymaker ideal has aimed straight for mothers 
heartstrings by bringing back some of the most popular dolls from 
30 years ago betsy wetsy one of the drinkandwet dolls of the 
early 1960s and tiny tears who weeps having her bottle 
besides video games and ninja turtles and other action figures 
boys are expected to receive toys based on hulk hogan and other 
wrestling stars standard amp poors valentine said tonka incs 
wrestling buddies and hasbros world wrestling federation figures 
have sold well

both retailers were adversely affected by the slowdown in consumer

government lawyers charged wednesday that a 
former philips industries inc executive avoided nearly 570000 in 
personal losses by selling company stock while he had inside 
information 
robert h brethen a former philips vice chairman is accused of 
selling the stock when he knew that a proposed leveraged buyout was 
in jeopardy because of low earnings projections 
during opening statements at brethens civil trial securities 
and exchange commission attorney jim tyne said brethen sold 109733 
shares of philips stock in january while possessing information 
about the projections 
the sec sued brethen in federal court in february the agency is 
asking us district judge walter rice to order brethen to give up 
the 570000 plus interest and to pay a 17 million penalty 
tyne said brethen who retired last december knew through 
internal reports that company officials were forecasting lower 
earnings in the fall of 1989 and that philips was failing to meet 
the lower projections 
tyne also said brethen knew that failure to meet the projections 
threatened a proposed leveraged buyout of the daytonbased building 
and transportation products maker by merrill lynch capital partners 
inc 
no one outside the company knew these projections and 
particularly the public didnt know about these projections tyne 
said 
but david cupps brethens attorney said questions about the 
financing for the buyout as well as changes in philips operating 
costs were included in a public proxy statement filed dec 20 
1989 that disclosure was not secret he said 
cupps said published reports had stated that banks were backing 
away from helping to finance the buyout 
william mccanna philips chief operations officer testified 
that brethen had access to three sales forecasts prepared by the 
company in october 1989 that were decreasingly optimistic he said 
the forecasts were not public 
tyne said brethen was told by company officials shortly before 
he retired that merrill lynch was disappointed with the companys 
thirdquarter earnings and there could be difficulties arranging 
bank financing 
right after his retirement he started talking to lawyers 
about selling his stock tyne said 
tyne said one attorney told brethen the information was 
confidential and another told him he shouldnt sell his stock 
the evidence will show he was warned not to sell his stock he 
said 
the government alleges brethen sold 100000 shares of philips 
stock at 22 per share on jan 9 and an additional 9000 shares at 
19 per share two days later 
at the end of trading that day philips announced merrill lynch 
was unable to proceed with the buyout because of philips 
thirdquarter earnings the price of philips stock fell to 1550 
per share the next day 
tyne said brethen later told the sec he sold the stock to pay 
off some debts but that evidence shows he had enough assets to 
cover those obligations 
last august philips shareholders approved the acquisition of 
the company by tomkins plc of the united kingdom

chrysler corp has signed up for a multimedia 
marketing package from time warner inc that will draw upon the 
media and entertainment giants farflung interests in magazines 
records movies videos and cable tv 
under terms of the deal chrysler will tout cars and trucks in 
multipage advertising inserts or special issues of magazines such 
as people time and fortune and in commercials on time warners 
cable tv systems 
chrysler also will be given the chance to place its products in 
warner bros films and to offer warner bros records timelife 
books and timelife videos as premiums in such promotions as 
getting people to take a test drive 
spokesmen for chrysler and time warner said the program was the 
biggest marketing package time warner has assembled for a single 
advertiser 
terms of the deal were not disclosed but it was believed to be 
in the 40 million range covering two years starting in 1991 
diversified media companies such as time warner created last 
year with time incs acquisition of warner communications inc 
have often argued that their vast array of media holdings make them 
more attractive to advertisers 
those capabilities have taken on even more importance in recent 
months as the advertising market has slumped and media companies 
scramble to compensate by tailoring programs that suit particular 
advertisers needs 
while the details of some of chryslers plans with time warner 
remain to be worked out the companies said one of them will

mca inc stock climbed wednesday after a 
published report suggested talks are intensifying over the 
possibility that japans matsushita electric industrial co will 
make a definitive bid to acquire the entertainment company 
mca and matsushita confirmed in september they were in talks 
about a buyout and there was speculation the japanese electronics 
manufacturer would offer about 85 a share for mca owner of 
universal pictures and universal television 
in trading wednesday on the new york stock exchange mca rose 3 
a share to close at 6550 
the wall street journal reported that officials of mca and 
matsushita have scheduled talks for monday and hope to agree within 
days on terms of a buyout 
a spokeswoman for mca in universal city calif said the 
company had no comment on the report a spokesman for matsushita 
failed to return a phone call 
with about 92 million shares outstanding a bid of 85 a share 
would value mca at about 78 billion 
the journal story said that a specific price is still up for 
negotiation and it cautioned that there is no certainty that a 
deal will be negotiated or that the timetable will be followed 
if a deal were worked out it would be the latest example of 
foreign ownership of a major american movie studio 
in the biggest such deal to date japans sony corp bought 
columbia pictures entertainment inc last year for 34 billion 
plus debt that raised the total value of the deal to about 5 
billion

a 583 million pipeline that would pump 
canadian natural gas to the northeast won federal approval 
wednesday over objections from hudson valley and connecticut 
propertyowners whose land would be crossed 
the unanimous decision by the federal energy regulatory 
commission in favor of the iroquois pipeline came after four years 
of debate among environmentalists homeowners and rival energy 
suppliers 
opponents included oil wildcatters in the southwest as well as 
psychologist dr joyce brothers whose hudson valley estate would 
be crossed by the pipeline 
but tight energy supplies in new england new york and new 
jersey apparently outweighed environmental arguments and the 
protests of domestic oil and gas suppliers 
the gas is needed in the area to be served by iroquois said 
ferc chairman martin allday it is my personal goal to get pipe 
in the ground to serve customers 
ferc board member jerry langdon said the decision would help 
move the united states toward relying on energy supplies in north 
america if not within its own borders 
canada is going to play a role in our natural gas supply in 
the future and i think that the iroquois pipeline is going to be an 
integral part of that langdon said 
supporters of the project include massachusetts gov michael s 
dukakis sen daniel patrick moynihan dny and new york gov 
mario cuomo 
the pipeline will extend 370 miles from the st lawrence river 
through the woodlands of upstate new york beneath the hudson 
river into affluent sections of western connecticut and across 
long island sound to long island iroquois officials hope to have 
gas flowing to new york and new england by november 1991 and to 
complete the line by january 1992 
its a great day said robert j reid president of the 
iroquois gas transmission system a consortium of us and canadian 
gas companies and utilities based in shelton conn it was 
imperative that we receive ferc approval in november to maintain 
our timetable for constructing the pipeline 
iroquois is designed to deliver 575 million cubic feet of gas 
daily or enough to meet the energy needs of 15 million homes 
iroquois still has regulatory hurdles to clear including permits 
from the us army corps of engineers and the department of energy 
thousands of property owners along the route have not yet agreed to 
let iroquois pay for rightofway privileges across their land 
iroquois may have to settle some of those cases in court 
a hudson valley citizens group called gasp has promised to file 
an immediate appeal with ferc and if that fails to appeal the 
decision in federal court 
domestic energy suppliers complained that iroquois will 
discourage domestic energy exploration and production and will 
compete unfairly with us pipelines and oil companies 
iroquois affiliates include connecticut natural gas corp 
brooklyn union gas co transcanada pipelines ltd and the new 
york power authority customers include long island lighting co 
boston gas co and consolidated edison co of new york

southland corp which filed for bankruptcy last 
month said wednesday it lost nearly twice as much money in the 
third quarter as it did in the same period last year 
southland showed a smaller loss for the nine months that ended 
sept 30 than in the same period of 1989 however and it reported 
higher revenues 
southland owns 7eleven the nations largest convenience store 
chain

of 226 billion in the third quarter that compares to a loss of 
634 million or 33 cents a share on revenue of 223 billion in 
the same quarter a year ago 
the burden of paying off a 49 billion takeover financed with 
debt forced the company to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
last month the filing allows southland to operate under court 
supervision while it develops a plan to pay creditors 
southland submitted a prepackaged reorganization plan that 
had won approval from 90 percent of its creditors us bankruptcy 
judge harold c abramson set a dec 14 confirmation hearing for the 
plan 
on wednesday the company said it had sufficient working capital 
to maintain normal operations at its convenience stores 
distribution and food centers 
sales at comparable stores rose 11 percent during the quarter 
and 24 percent during the first nine months but gross profits 
from those sales declined in the quarter and was up only slightly 
for the nine months because there were fewer 7eleven stores 
for the ninemonth period southland lost 2500 million or 
126 a share on revenue of 635 billion in the 1989 period it 
lost 2998 million or 155 a share on revenue of 629 billion

attorneys representing both sides in a 700 
million classaction lawsuit against chevron usa corp met for the 
first time wednesday under a federal judges order a lawyer said 
the attorneys who discussed the lawsuit for about six hours 
planned to meet again thursday said jo wilson attorney for the 
plaintiffs who would not comment on the discussions 
were hopeful we will be able to report some progress to the 
judge on monday she said 
the lawsuit was filed in 1986 on behalf of more than 40000 
former gulf oil corp employees retirees and chevron employees who 
previously worked for gulf and their family members 
plaintiffs allege san franciscobased chevron violated the 
federal employment retirement income security act when it merged 
the chevron and gulf pension plans two years after it acquired gulf 
oil of pittsburgh 
they also complained that many gulf employees who did not end up 
with jobs at chevron were unjustly denied pension benefits 
ms wilson has said the gulf plan had 700 million in surplus 
funds when chevron merged the plans in 1986 since the merger she 
said gulf retirees have found their benefits reduced by about 20 
percent 
chevron attorneys say the company has not touched any of the 
money in the merged pension fund for other corporate purposes and 
an ongoing pension plan cannot have excess assets 
us district judge simeon t lake iii last week ordered 
attorneys from both sides and chevron officials to begin 
negotiations in good faith towards a settlement ms wilson 
said 
houston attorney robert j malinak who represents chevron in 
the case did not return a telephone call wednesday

exchange in a session marked by growing recession fears and 
reaction to white house actions concerning the situation in the

on other commodities markets silver platinum and energy 
futures prices slipped grains and soybeans prices collapsed 
cattle futures rose and pork futures were mixed 
gold settled 870 to 850 lower with december at 37850 a 
troy ounce 
gold began falling in early trading amid profittaking from 
tuesdays gains and closed sharply lower after trading was stopped 
several times by an automatically triggered mechanism activated 
when prices go below a set figure 
basically two events caused the drop said peter cardillo 
director of commodities research for jesup josephtal amp co inc in 
new york there was confusion over whether or not the federal 
reserve has eased interest rates and statements out of the white 
house suggesting they were not going to call a special session of 
congress to debate the gulf crisis 
silver and platinum prices followed gold cardillo said silver 
settled 43 cents to 34 cents lower with december at 4175 an

settled 272 cents to 141 cents lower with december at 8039 cents 
a gallon 
grains and soybeans futures prices tumbled for the fourth 
consecutive session on the chicago board of trade as speculators 
fretted over abundant supplies and poor demand 
followthrough selling from tuesdays poor close pressured 
futures throughout the day as commercial firms cashed in in light 
of good harvesting weather in the regions where the crops are 
grown 
corn soybeans and wheat are all suffering from nearrecord 
harvests and little export demand and prices have slumped as 
speculators move to the sidelines waiting for activity 
we havent seen any things confirmed in terms of export 
activity said mark weidner an analyst for cargill investor 
services inc without confirmation or seeing shipments going out 
rumors of activity will be just that and well continue to see 
falling prices 
soybeans also have suffered from a government report issued last 
week that found a higher than expected supply of the crop than was 
previously expected 
reports of taiwans purchase of 20000 tons of the crop and talk 
that israel and mexico also may be in the market failed to slow the 
futures slide 
wheat futures settled 7 cents to 6 cents lower with december at 
255 a bushel corn futures were 6 cents to 5 cents lower with 
december at 224 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 4 cents lower 
with december at 107 a bushel soybeans were 10 cents to 5

market sales on the chicago mercantile exchange but pork futures 
prices were mixed to lower as trade took profits on gains made this 
week

184 million payment to bondholders 
the chicagobased company said the loss of 302 per share for 
the three months ending sept 30 compared with a loss of 371 
million or 21 cents per share for the same period a year ago 
the results for the latest quarter included 91 million in 
litigation costs and a 69 million writeoff in intangible assets 
all related to a missed payment oct 15 on 18 billion in debt 
from a restructuring of ballys nevada casino subsidiary 
wednesday ended a 30day grace period for bally to make the loan 
payment said bally spokeswoman janie lewis she said the company 
was still in negotiations with our bondholders on a debt 
restructuring plan 
the thirdquarter 1989 results included an 84 million expense 
associated with the refinancing of ballys park place casino hotel 
in atlantic city 
excluding extraordinary items bally posted a net loss of 65 
million in the third quarter compared with a gain of 47 million a 
year ago

securities fraud at sentencing by us district judge miriam 
goldman cedarbaum 
mulheren did not address the court before sentencing he relied 
on statements by puccio who asked for leniency because mulheren 
suffered from manic depression and because of his many charitable 
acts 
the most we have here is someone who momentarily strayed and 
committed one act on one day against a lifetime of honesty and 
respectability puccio said 
cedarbaum said mulherens crimes required incarceration 
anyone who tampers with the integrity of the stock market will go 
to prison 
after sentencing mulheren to a year and one day in prison 
cedarbaum allowed him to remain free pending appeal if his 
conviction is upheld it is unlikely mulheren will serve the entire 
sentence because he will be eligible for parole after serving four 
months 
asked his reaction to the sentence mulheren said nobody 
likes to go to jail right 
prosecutors had charged that mulheren bought 75000 gulf amp 
western shares at boeskys behest driving the stock to 45 a 
share the price at which boesky wanted to sell about 35 million 
shares back to the company 
boesky the exstock speculator whose admissions led to several 
prominent indictments on wall street agreed in 1986 to plead 
guilty to one count of lying to federal investigators and pay 100 
million in fines he was released from custody in april after 
serving two years of a threeyear term 
the high point of mulherens trial came when boesky was called 
as a prosecution witness against his former business associate and 
friend boesky admitted he traded suitcases stuffed with cash for 
confidential information about imminent takeovers 
mulheren a laidback multimillionaire who often flew by 
helicopter to his trial flouted convention in court as he had in 
his wall street career during testimony mulheren wore a tennis 
shirt blue jeans and boat shoes 
in 1988 after learning boesky had implicated him mulheren was 
arrested leaving his rumson nj mansion carrying a loaded 
assault rifle police said he planned to shoot boesky 
authorities in new jersey last year dropped weapons possession 
charges mulherens lawyers blamed the incident which was not 
disclosed at the trial on his failure to take lithium prescribed 
to treat manic depression 
some criminal charges against mulheren remain because the jury 
was unable to reach a verdict on 26 additional counts of securities 
fraud mail fraud and recordkeeping violations 
cedarbaum declared a mistrial on that portion of the case and 
the government has yet to decide whether to retry mulheren on the 
pending counts 
those charges alleged mulheren parked for boesky securities 
of unocal corp warner communications inc storer communications 
inc boise cascade corp american hospital supply inc and rh 
macy amp co 
parking is the illegal practice of disguising ownership of 
securities to avoid federal reporting requirements 
mulherens codefendant leonard destefano 34 a former trader 
at mulherens defunct firm jamie securities co was acquitted of 
all conspiracy and recordkeeping violations charges brought 
against him

mcdonalds corp on wednesday announced it is 
test marketing a lowfat hamburger that trade groups said could 
help woo healthconscious consumers 
but nutrition experts cautioned that the efforts of mcdonalds 
and its competitors such as hardees and wendys do not mean 
fastfood has become health food 
the new hamburger called the lean deluxe boasts a 91 percent 
fatfree beef patty counting the sesame seed bun and fixings 
ketchup mustard pickles onions lettuce and tomatoes it has a 
105 percent fat content and 310 calories that compares to a 207 
percent fat content and about 410 calories in a quarter pounder 
the burger is currently being testmarketed in 54 franchises in 
the harrisburg pa area said chuck rubner a spokesman for the 
oak brook illbased company 
were excited about it and are very optimistic rubner said 
they like the taste of the product and they like the fact that 
its a lowfat alternative 
there currently are no plans to nationally market the hamburger 
the patty is composed of 90 percent lean beef 9 percent water 
and 1 percent seasonings rubner said 
among the items listed as seasonings is carrageenan a gumlike 
product used in meats and other foods to bind the ingredients 
the carrageenan which does the binding job of fat is the 
secret to the patty said mary adolf a spokeswoman for the beef 
industry council of the meat board the board funded work by auburn 
university to develop the lowfat beef and ms adolf said 
mcdonalds is the first to testmarket the technology 
hardees food systems inc earlier this year test marketed in 
four cities an 84 percent fatfree hamburger and plans to sell it 
nationally in 1991 said john merritt a spokesman for the rocky 
mountain ncbased company 
the dallasbased american heart association and the center for 
science in the public interest in washington dc said there 
currently is no other fastfood chain marketing a hamburger with as 
low a fat content as mcdonalds claims 
nutrition experts welcomed the development but cautioned that 
one new product in a menu loaded with fat and cholesterol is not a 
healthy substitute 
one has to look at a foods place in relation to the total 
diet said karen millerkovach a spokeswoman for the american 
dietetic association if you go into a restaurant order the 
fatfree burger and an extralarge order of fries then you may 
not be doing yourself any favor 
the new hamburger also does little to reduce sodium content 
said michael jacobson director of the center for science in the 
public interest 
the regular quarter pounder has 660 milligrams of sodium 
compared to 650 milligrams in the lean deluxe that level is what 
i consider a dangerously unhealthy amount he said in a telephone 
interview 
millerkovach said the lean deluxe is part of a growing health 
trend for fastfood companies like mcdonalds and wendys which 
recently introduced a grilled chicken breast sandwich 
what were seeing is a change in the fastfood menu not 
necessarily away from the oldtime fatfilled and greasy foods that 
have made fastfood companies fat and happy but to provide other 
alternatives for customers she said 
rubner noted that mcdonalds has also added lowfat milkshakes 
and yogurt whole grain cereals and switched to cooking its french 
fries in allvegetable oils instead of beef tallow
