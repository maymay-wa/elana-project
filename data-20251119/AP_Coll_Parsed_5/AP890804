the pilot who brought a crippled 
piedmont airlines jet to a safe landing with one engine cowl 
scraping the ground said thursday hes tried since to think of a 
better way of bringing in the plane 
i landed that aircraft probably a thousand times last night to 
see if i could have done any better and i couldnt pilot larry 
fuda said during a news conference thursday at piedmont triad 
international airport 
flight 1489 originated at washington national airport and was 
bound for columbia sc with a stop in charlotte it was diverted 
to greensboro when the crew couldnt get the left landing gear down 
fuda said he decided to go to greensboro to avoid the more 
congested charlottedouglas international airport fuda said he 
liked the emergency equipment at greensboro and knew greensboros 
runway was as long as charlottes he also knew a large contingent 
of piedmont people were close by 
fuda set the boeing 737400 down on its right and nose landing 
gear then settled the plane onto its left engine and skidded to a 
halt on the 10000foot runway a shower of sparks coming from the 
dragging metal 
i hardly knew that the wheel wasnt there when we touched 
down fuda said 
fuda said he had no previous experience like wednesdays in his 
21 years of flying for piedmont i always wondered what i would 
do if it did happen he said 
passengers aboard piedmont flight 1489 which made the landing 
at piedmont triad international airport said later they thought 
fuda was a hero 
there was no hysteria said richard kochan of washington a 
lobbyist who says he flies a lot but there were a lot of trips 
to the bathroom 
fudas wife margaret said her husband doesnt think of himself 
as a hero 
hes just glad it worked out she said the whole crew did 
just what they were supposed to do he says he doesnt consider 
himself a hero 
this time it worked out the way it was supposed to work 
sometimes the crew does the right things and things dont work out 
as well she said hes pooped ive been giving him kisses and 
hugs since he got home 
fuda was not originally scheduled to pilot flight 1489 said his 
neighbor donnie campbell a retired piedmont pilot 
he was supposed to work friday night but theyre having a 
farewell to piedmont party in roanoke va friday night and he 
wanted to go to that so he just picked up a flight that somebody 
dropped 
im waiting to see the pilot i picked it up from fuda said 
the party is to celebrate piedmont final flight on saturday 
before its merger with usair is completed to which fuda made 
jocular reference 
i have made my last and best landing for piedmont he said 
the 94 passengers and six crew members safely jumped down 
emergency chutes 
a rubber wheel chock found wedged in the wheel well had 
prevented the left main landing gear from deploying said the 
national transportation safety board 
piedmont spokesman david shipley said thursday it would be mere 
speculation to suggest that the chock a triangular rubber block 30 
inches long and 6 inches high used to keep planes from rolling when 
theyre parked was left in the wheel well at washington national 
theres really nothing else to say shipley added the 
airplanes in the hangar and we estimate it to be in service 
saturday 
only the left engine housing was damaged during the landing 
shipley said the 11monthold planes left wing and skin were 
unharmed the planes engine housing is designed to hold up during 
that type of emergency landing he said 
apparently the wing never touched the ground he said 
the engine itself is apparently undamaged but we will remove it 
and replace it and run it through a complete structural check as 
well 
phillip powell an ntsb air safety investigator said 
investigators found the chock wedged between two wheels on the left 
landing gear 
while airline officials doubt the chock was deliberately placed 
they declined to rule out any possibility pending further 
investigation shipley said 
the washington post in friday editions quoted powell as saying 
the right landing gear might also have been obstructed 
two bent hydraulic lines were found in the right wheel well 
raising the possiblity that a chock might also have been stuck in 
the right landing gear and fallen out powell said

the united states should warn iran that 
support of terrorism in lebanon will result in a military strike 
said the ground force commander in the illfated 1980 iran hostage 
rescue attempt 
president bush also should pressure the central intelligence 
agency to get information he has indicated the united states needs 
to rescue american hostages to take a strong stand against 
terrorism retired army col charlie beckwith said thursday 
if we dont do this its going to keep on getting worse and 
worse beckwith said 
terrorists claimed they killed one american hostage marine lt 
col william higgins on monday and have threatened to kill 
another joseph cicippio after israel captured a shiite moslem 
religious leader accused of promoting terrorism 
id like to see the united states be able to go in there and 
eliminate all of those terrorists and bring those beautiful 
hostages home beckwith said id like to see us do it in such 
a vigorous way that we tell the rest of the world never fool with 
the united states again 
beckwith a security consultant led troops in the aborted 1980 
attempt to rescue american hostages being held by iran eight 
americans died in that mission 
beckwith criticized the cia as not being active enough since 
director william casey died in 1987 
the cia relies too heavily on electronic wizardry and has 
forgotten about the need for a pair of good solid eyeballs and a 
good human being on the ground he said

house republican whip newt gingrich said today 
the democratic congressman threatening to expand allegations of 
possible misconduct against him is almost irrational 
rep bill alexander of arkansas on thursday made public a letter 
to the house ethics committee in which he predicted his original 
complaint may have only scratched the surface 
there could well be over 200 additional instances of 
potentially unethical illegal or criminal conduct by mr 
gingrich alexander said declining to give reporters specific 
information on the allegations 
i think in terms of the substance of the charges you have an 
almost irrational democrat in bill alexander who is wandering 
around wildly saying things and i am comfortable after the ethics 
committee investigates it that they are going to say there is 
nothing to the charges gingrich rga said on abctvs good 
morning america program 
gingrich who filed charges that led to the resignation of jim 
wright dtexas as house speaker said a number of very powerful 
democrats said they were going to destroy me that they would get 
even and in that sense of course im battling for my political 
life 
in an interview thursday with wagatv in atlanta the georgia 
lawmaker said when you hear a politician say he has 200 hidden 
charges he may eventually file you know he has a lot of baloney 
alexander said he wouldnt file an expanded complaint against 
gingrich until at least september 
his april complaint to the ethics committee focused on an 
investment partnership formed by gingrich to promote a book he 
wrote with his wife and another person 
alexander accused gingrich of possibly violating campaign 
finance law house limitations on outside income and a rule 
prohibiting receipt of gifts from people with a direct interest in 
legislation 
the ethics panel has hired a chicago law firm to recommend 
whether it should begin a formal investigation 
alexander said other allegations could involve 
the possible failure of gingrich to disclose substantial and 
potentially illegal campaign contributions he made through his 
campaign committee during 1986 
information that contributors to the book promotion partnership 
were recipients of substantial federal grants and loan 
guarantees including at least one major award under the 
politically controlled housing programs maladministered by the 
department of housing and urban development 
the propriety of gingrichs management of a former political 
action committee that may have raised hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for candidates but only donated a miniscule portion of the 
money to those running for office 
use of official stationery and congressional free mailing to 
promote the personal business endeavors of friends 
improper settlement of personal and corporate debts incurred by 
gingrichs campaign committee and the possibility that gingrich 
improperly enriched himself in a questionable real estate 
transaction

israeli officials said today they will consider 
making a hostage exchange with shiite moslems in lebanon if they 
provide a list of prisoners they want freed from israeli jails 
prime minister yitzhak shamir told reporters in jerusalem that 
israel was waiting for proposals from the shiites we 
hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of the 
crisis 
shamirs top aide avi pazner said israel was awaiting the 
specific list of prisoners whose freedom the shiites seek the list 
was promised in a statement from a militant shiite faction in 
beirut on thursday night 
after the faction the revolutionary justice organization on 
thursday suspended its threat to kill us hostage joseph cicippio 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel will examine the demands 
on a positive basis 
the freezing of the death threat came just minutes before a 
deadline set by the group for killing cicippio unless israel handed 
over the shiite clergyman it kidnapped last week from his home in 
south lebanon 
another shiite moslem faction that was holding marine lt col 
william higgins hostage said it killed him monday because the 
clergyman sheik abdul karim obeid was not freed by israel 
israel radio quoted shamir as saying israel was moving closer to 
starting negotiations to free three captured israeli soldiers in 
lebanon israeli said it abducted obeid on july 28 hoping to swap 
him for the three soldiers 
israel has said it will also try to secure the release of 16 
western hostages including cicippio and seven other americans 
earlier today shamir discussed with rabin foreign minister 
moshe arens and finance minister shimon peres the demands made by 
the revolutionary justice organization an offshoot of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
peres who is also vice premier was asked after a meeting with 
shamir whether iran was actively involved in the process im 
hopeful he replied 
in its first statement the revolutionary justice group demand 
that obeid be freed after suspending the threat to kill cicippio 
it also demanded that israel release a number of lebanese and 
palestinian prisoners 
while the statement did not mention israels offer to exchange 
shiite prisoners for israeli pows and foreign hostages israeli 
officials and commentators saw the halting of the threatened 
killing of cicippio as a sign the shiite radicals were ready to 
deal 
if indeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposal 
for prisoners exchange we shall examine it on a positive basis 
rabin told reporters in jerusalem thursday night 
israeli officials noted the shiite demands did not mention the 
israeli air force navigator and two soldiers believed held by 
hezbollah and said rabins statement was meant to solicit a 
specific response regarding them 
akiva eldar a leading columnist for the daily haaretz said 
israeli officials were not taking seriously demands to release 
prisoners from the 19month palestinian uprising which could 
include more than 8000 detainees 
peres told an american jewish group that any negotiations would 
be complicated and lengthy and an army general who managed 
israels last prisoner exchange said it would take a long time 
and great patience to make a deal 
maj gen moshe nativ told israel radio that the process would 
begin with unreasonable shiite demands and israel would counter 
with insistence on first seeing the three soldiers believed held by 
hezbollah or allied factions 
nativ was in charge of negotiations that led to the exchange of 
three israeli soldiers for 1000 palestinian prisoners in a deal 
with the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command in 1985 
he said any negotiations over the 16 western hostages would be 
more complicated because other countries were involved 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

the first senior us official to 
visit ethiopia since its 1974 marxist revolution arrived today for 
talks on this nations 27year civil war and stability in the horn 
of africa 
herman j cohen assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs told reporters after arriving that he has a long agenda 
of issues he is prepared to discuss in a frank and fair 
manner 
he is to spend two days in this strategic but impoverished 
nation that is the soviet unions staunchest ally on the continent 
that friendship with moscow soured oncewarm relations between 
washington and addis ababa after president mengistu haile mariam 
mengistu and a clique of fellow military officers ousted the 
emperor haile selassie in 1974 and the soviet union became 
ethiopias biggest patron in 1977 
cohen was expected to meet foreign minister berhanu bayih this 
afternoon and mengistu on saturday before leaving sunday for sudan 
he said that besides ethiopias civil war and regional conflicts 
he plans to discuss economic issues and the return of refugees in 
the region 
he also was expected to discuss money the united states says 
ethiopia still owes from weapons it purchased years ago 
discussions on economic growth will be handicapped by us laws 
that deny development aid to countries that owe money for arms and 
are accused of human rights abuses 
cohens visit comes a day after amnesty international published 
a report charging that ethiopia is among the worst offenders in 
africa in failing to ratify international human rights covenants 
the londonbased organizations report said thousands of 
suspected political opponents in ethiopia are imprisoned for months 
or even years without trial and that many are tortured others 
vanish without explanation it said 
cohens concern for refugees involves hundreds of thousands who 
have fled wars in neighboring sudan and somalia and are living in 
refugee camps in ethiopia while large numbers of ethiopians have 
fled to sudan to escape their countrys northern civil war 
ethiopian refugees also remain in somalia where they fled a 
decade ago after ethiopian troops backed by soviets and cubans 
repulsed a somali invasion 
the american officials visit comes after several appeals from 
mengistu for improved relations 
after he seized power mengistus government threw out the us 
military assistance group and closed the american governments 
information service washington retaliated by suspending its 
technical assistance program then the largest in africa 
the united states and ethiopia also withdrew their ambassadors 
leaving charge daffaires to head their embassies 
there was little contact until the 198485 famine when the 
united states was the biggest donor of emergency food 
cohen initially was to visit ethiopia at the end of may but that 
trip was postponed by an attempted coup in addis ababa 
he arrived from egypt where he met with president hosni mubarak 
and reportedly discussed the civil wars in ethiopia and sudan 
guerrillas in northern eritrea want independence from ethiopia 
while southern sudanese want more autonomy all the rebels belong 
to ethnic minorities 
the us embassy said cohen is the first us official to visit 
ethiopia in the 15 years

sen brock adams says he will press on with 
his proposal to require new oil tankers to be built with double 
hulls despite its narrow rejection by the senate 
we were close and there is no stopping me now adams 
dwash said thursday following the 5149 vote to table and thus 
reject his amendment to a pending bill tightening oil tanker 
safety regulations and creating a special fund to clean up oil 
spills 
adams amendment would have required double hulls and double 
sides on all new tankers over 20000 deadweight tons that operate 
in us waters 
it was prompted by the exxon valdez oil spill in alaskas prince 
william sound earlier this year which adams said might not have 
grown into the nations largest oil spill ever if the vessel had 
been equipped with a double hull 
the pending bill would require that the secretary of 
transportation study for one year the use of double hulls and 
require them in new tankers unless it is found they wont enhance 
tanker safety or other structural requirements were found to be 
better 
none of us are naval architects said sen john breaux 
dla who moved to table adams amendment i dont think we are 
absolutely competent to make a final decision

china said today that its crackdown on dissent 
will not endanger intellectuals but it also announced that a 
prominent dissident holed up in the us embassy has been fired 
from an academic board 
also today the government declined to comment on a report that 
senior leader deng xiaoping is seriously ill with prostate cancer 
the official xinhua news agencys hong kong office described the 
report as a mere rumor 
an unsigned commentary in the communist party newspaper peoples 
daily said china will continue to respect its intellectuals 
knowledge and talent even though some participated in the recent 
prodemocracy movement that the government calls a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
china needs a strong intellectual force for modernization 
we should thoroughly implement deng xiaopings policy to respect 
knowledge respect talent and use intellectuals to achieve the 
modernization goal it said 
the crackdown ended a period of relatively free political 
debate chinese now are urged to report on friends and family and 
must participate in political study sessions reminiscent of the 
ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
the commentary called those who took part in the student 
movement scum and enemies of the party and of the people 
it said it is in the interest of the workers peasants and 
intellectuals to punish them 
those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeois 
liberalism will elevate their understanding and continue to 
make contributions to chinas modernization program the 
commentary said 
fang lizhi the dissident who evaded arrest by seeking refuge at 
the us embassy has been relieved of his position on the academic 
degrees committee under the state council chinas cabinet is no 
longer qualified to tutor doctoral students xinhua news agency 
reported 
fang who entered the us embassy with his wife shortly after 
the june crackdown on the prodemocracy movement already had been 
relieved of his posts at the natural dialectics research society 
but apparently still retains his main job at the beijing 
observatory 
several other dissident intellectuals also have been removed 
from peripheral positions 
the government issued arrest warrants for fang and his wife 
professor of physics li shuxian for allegedly inciting the 
prodemocracy protests and has demanded that the us embassy turn 
them over to chinese authorities 
chinas foreign ministry refused to comment on the report by 
japans jiji press today that deng is seriously ill with prostate 
cancer 
quoting unidentified chinese sources the japanese news agency 
said the senior chinese leaders condition had suddenly worsened a 
few days ago emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him 
at his summer resort near bo hai bay east of beijing jiji said 
an employee at the foreign ministrys information department 
said he had received many queries about dengs health but could 
respond there was no answer tonight at the communist partys news 
office 
deng was last seen in public june 9 when national television 
showed him congratulating top army officers on having ended the 
prodemocracy protests he spoke in a strong voice and appeared 
more alert and healthy than he had for some months he is widely 
believed to suffer from prostate problems and over the past few 
years there have been periodic reports he is very ill or dying 
the beijing daily today said the army has chosen 36 people to 
travel around the country to tell the whole nation how they 
bearing the fate of the party and the country protected the 
socialist system by helping troops crack down on the popular 
student movement 
the group includes soldiers armed police and a woman who said 
they helped 164 soldiers hide from angry protesters 
the move is part of a campaign to publicize the official version 
of the events of june 34 when troops marched through beijing and 
fired on unarmed civilians to drive student protesters from 
tiananmen square 
xinhua has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that 
thousands were injured while about 100 civilians died and nearly 
1000 were injured

various forms of segregation that isolate blacks 
in major cities depriving them of opportunities and resources are 
creating a separate society of underachievers researchers say 
the authors of a study released thursday by the university of 
chicago call such multilayer discrimination hypersegregation 
professors douglas massey and nancy denton say they found that 
hypersegregation exists in 10 cities and that those cities account 
for 29 percent of the countrys urban black population chicago was 
found to be the most hypersegregated city 
there is a small set of cities in the united states where 
blacks experience more extreme segregation than believed in the 
past said massey a professor of sociology and director of the 
schools population research center 
while the cities are small in number they house a relatively 
large percentage of blacks 
in the study published in todays editions of demography the 
journal of washingtonbased population association of america 
massey and denton focused on five measures of segregation 
the degree to which neighborhood percentages of minoritygroup 
residents correspond to the citywide minority percentages 
the degree of potential contact between whites and members of 
the minority group where the latter live and work 
the extent to which minority neighborhoods are clustered 
the degree to which minorities are settled in and around the 
city center 
the amount of physical space occupied by a minority group 
hypersegregation occurs when at least four of those measures 
apply massey and denton said 
using data gathered in 1980 by the us census bureau the 
researchers used the five measures to compute housing patterns for 
blacks and hispanics in 60 metropolitan areas 
in chicago blacks had an index above 750 on each of the five 
measures a reading of 600 is considered high researchers say 
the study found hypersegregation of blacks in nine other cities 
baltimore cleveland detroit gary ind los angeles milwaukee 
newark nj st louis and philadelphia 
the researchers found no hypersegregation of hispanics in the 
nations urban areas 
housing patterns that fall into any one of the five categories 
are troublesome because they isolate a minority group from 
amenities opportunities and resources that affect social and 
economic wellbeing the researchers said 
language is the best and most sensitive indicator of social 
isolation and creation of a divergent cultures massey said 
black english vernacular is becoming more prevalent and almost 
a separate language he noted it has its own diction and 
structure and it is because of isolation the two groups dont 
interact they are not sharing a common language 
the demographics of blacks and whites are different with blacks 
having a higher infant mortality rate and a shorter life 
expectancy massey said black childbearing is concentrated 
between ages 18 and 25 while whites generally delay having 
children until later in life 
it is like living in two different nations massey said 
hispanics experienced lower degrees of segregation overall 
the differences in treatment of the two minority groups are not 
easily explained by socioeconomic factors he said which leaves 
racism 
hispanics are primarily white he said they are 
apparently more accepted as neighbors than blacks there is 
something about blacks that disturbs whites it is a complex 
psychological process

irans president hashemi rafsanjani 
today said he would help find a solution to the hostage situation 
in lebanon and urged the white house to approach the problem in a 
reasonable manner tehran radio said 
these bullyings arrogant approaches and tyranny will not 
solve the problems the president said during his weekly prayer 
sermon at tehran university come let us approach the problem 
reasonably we too will help solve the problems there so the 
people of the region can live in peace and harmony he said in 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia cyprus 
i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has solutions 
the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable prudent 
solutions rafsanjani said 
however rafsanjani also said the united states must take the 
initiative by pressuring israel to free sheik abdul karim obeid a 
shiite moslem cleric it kidnapped from south lebanon a week ago 
if the us responds by saying it cannot do so this isnt 
acceptable to us he said 
israel has offered to swap obeid for the 16 foreign hostages in 
iran and three israeli soldiers held there 
the proiranian group hezbollah of which obeid is reputed to be 
a member rejected such a swap hezbollah is believed to be the 
umbrella for factions holding most of the foreign hostages 
on thursday one of those factions the revolutionary justice 
organization suspended a threat to kill american hostage joseph 
cicippio but demanded that israel free obeid and palestinian and 
lebanese prisoners it holds it did not say what would happen if 
israel refused 
on monday another faction the organization of the oppressed on 
earth claimed it killed american hostage william higgins a marine 
lieutenant colonel in retaliation for israels refusal to free 
obeid 
we do not make any judgment about the group which executed the 
american colonel rafsanjani said 
you cannot condemn the innocent people of lebanon on the 
vague basis that some group has possibly killed someone higgins 
for a crime he added 
higgins captors accused him of being a spy 
rafsanjani known as a pragmatist who wants to improve irans 
ties with the west has not said whether iran played a role in the 
reprieve granted cicippio a knowledgeable shiite moslem source in 
beirut speaking on condition of anonymity said the final word on 
cicippios reprieve came from him 
the 54yearold rafsanjani is believed to want to end the 
international terrorist image iran developed under the leadership 
of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini

rescuers crawled on their hands and knees 
today to reach the site of an olympic airways crash but they found 
no survivors from the aircraft that slammed into a mountain with 34 
people aboard 
the britishbuilt short plane crashed thursday into 4800foot 
mount kerkis on samos island airline officials blamed the accident 
on heavy fog that covered the mountain the highest in the aegean 
sea 
rescuers searched for the flight recorders which should contain 
information on the planes equipment and any conversations 
involving the pilot 
transport and communications minister nikos gelestathis said the 
plane which was flying to the island from salonica in northern 
greece carried 31 passengers including an infant and three crew 
members all were greek 
rescuers said they apparently were killed instantly when the 
aircraft hit the mountain 
unfortunately we could do nothing i checked every body i 
could find said emmanuel karlas a doctor from a village on this 
eastern aegean island within sight of turkeys southwestern coast 
the propellerdriven plane gave no sign of trouble before it 
disappeared from radar screens officials said 
only a wing and twintail section of the aircraft was 
recognizable the front disintegrated on impact and was just a 
black scar on the mountainside 
police could identify only four of the charred bodies olympic 
greeces national carrier was flying in relatives to help identify 
victims 
helicopters could not land close to the crash site and rescuers 
crawled up the mountainside on hands and knees for 90 minutes in 
the dark 
the steep terrain prevented them from carrying down the dead 
well have the helicopters hoist out the human remains 
said police officer panayiotis kourdonouris 
officials ruled out foul play as the cause of the crash 
an olympic official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
it appears that thick fog in the area at the time played the 
villains role as the pilot flew blindly into the mountain 
gelestathis told lawmakers in parliament today that a terrorist 
act was out of the question 
military teams were dispatched to the crash site after a 
shepherd reported seeing an explosion on the mountain 
the athens airport duty officer emmanuel fragiadakis said the 
control tower lost contact with the plane at about 455 pm an 
hour after it left salonika it was scheduled to land on samos at 
530 pm the plane disappeared from radar screens when it was 25 
miles northwest of samos 
olympic officials said the pilot petros moutzoureas was a 
veteran with an excellent flight record they said the aircraft was 
bought in 1981 and was used for interisland flights

syrian and christian forces battled with 
howitzers mortars and tank cannons across beiruts dividing green 
line today police said two people were killed and seven wounded 
the shelling kept many moslems from attending their weekly 
friday prayers 
the latest casualties raised the overall toll to 516 killed and 
2183 wounded in the 20weekold confrontation between gen michel 
aouns predominantly christian troops and syrian soldiers in 
lebanon 
theyve started early today grocer najib masoud said as he 
closed his store in west beirut and headed for a bomb shelter 
what a life we are living under the ground like the dead we 
might as well die 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said the clash involved the christian district of ein 
rummaneh and the adjacent syriancontrolled moslem neighborhood of 
chiyah 
he said the clash started with an exchange of sniper fire then 
developed into an artillery duel it was not immediately clear who 
started the clash 
shells crashed into apartment buildings on both sides of the 
green line which has divided beirut into moslem and christian 
sectors since the civil war broke out in april 1975 
the two fatalities occurred in the densely populated slum of 
chiyah a stronghold for the syrianbacked shiite moslem amal 
militia 
amal did not take part in the confrontation the spokesman said 
shell explosions echoed across chiyah and residents rushed to 
underground bomb shelters as calls were blared from mosque minarets 
for noon prayers 
the police spokesman said the shelling of chiyah did not reach 
the nearby slum of bir elabed where followers of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god attended prayers at the 
main mosque friday is the moslem holy day 
syrian gunners deployed in chiyah fired their 130mm 
sovietdesigned howitzers at the christian suburb of kfarshima 
southeast of beirut where aouns forces maintain some artillery 
batteries 
aouns gunners the spokesman said responed by shelling chiyah 
and the druse suburb of choueifat with 155mm usdesigned 
howitzers deployed northeast of the capital 
the thuds of shell blasts resounded across the bombravaged 
lebanese capital forcing the few businesses that opened early in 
the morning to close 
only 200000 people of beiruts original 15 million population 
still live in the city which has been the site of ferocious 
shelling duels since the confrontation broke out march 8 most of 
the evacuees have settled in safer areas in south lebanon the 
eastern bekaa valley and the christiancontrolled mountain resorts 
northeast of beirut 
the confrontation broke out over a blockade imposed by aoun on 
illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut for 
denying the ailing state treasury about 100 million in lost 
customs dues annually 
the syrians and allied moslem and leftist forces retaliated by 
shelling and besieging the 310squaremile christian enclave home 
to about one million people northeast of the capital 
aoun 54 a maronite catholic escalated the confrontation with 
the syrians by declaring a war of liberation against their 
40000 troops deployed in predominantly moslem sections of the 
nation 
an arab mediation committee has failed to solve lebanons 
crisis rooted in an effort by the moslem majority to wrest more 
power from christians who traditionally have dominated lebanon 
the panel blamed syria for blocking a settlement

theres an athletic shoe company that urges 
just do it but when it comes to losing weight a federal study 
indicates that millions of hefty americans just dont 
the national centers for disease control said thursday that none 
of 32 states in a cdc survey could report even half their 
overweight people taking the recommended twofold approach to losing 
weight eating fewer calories and getting more exercise 
the cdc estimates that 34 million americans about one in four 
adults are overweight by 20 percent or more 
the data suggest that significant numbers are eating fewer 
calories but its the physical activity that we dont have enough 
people doing said eddas m bennett a cdc epidemiologist 
in the cdc survey conducted in 1987 in 32 states and 
washington dc an average of 20 percent of the overweight men 
reported that they were following the fewer caloriesmore exercise 
approach for women the percentage was somewhat better 31 percent 
an average of 44 percent of the overweight men said they were 
eating fewer calories compared with 64 percent of overweight 
women but only 24 percent of the men and 35 percent of the women 
said they were increasing their physical activity 
physical activity appears to be the limiting factor the 
atlantabased cdc concluded in its weekly report the low 
prevalence of increasing physical activity to lose weight may 
reflect the sedentary lifestyle of us adults and the emphasis on 
diet as a means of weight loss without adequately addressing the 
benefits of physical activity 
overall the percentage of overweight men trying both the 
lowcalorie and moreexercise approach ranged from a high of 36 
percent in missouri to a low of 13 percent in maine and hawaii for 
women the range was from 19 percent in washington dc to 42 
percent in utah with all percentages rounded 
ms bennett noted that an official 1990 health objective for the 
nation calls for at least half of overweight adults to follow the 
fewer caloriesmore exercise regimen were not going to meet 
that objective in any state she said 
overweight is defined as being about 20 percent above ideal body 
weight for the persons age

fullest but that he did not want to raise the hopes of the 
hostages families bush also refused to confirm reports he had 
planned to take military action if another hostage had been killed

these bullyings arrogant approaches and tyranny will not 
solve the problems come let us approach the problem reasonably we 
too will help solve the problems there so the people of the region 
can live in peace and harmony he said in the broadcast monitored 
in nicosia cyprus 
rafsanjanis comments were made during the weekly friday prayer 
session at tehran university 
he said if the united states wants hostages in lebanon freed it 
must take the inititive by asking israel to free sheik abdul karim 
obeid a shiite moslem leader abducted by israeli commandos one 
week ago 
we do not make any judgment about the group which executed the 
american colonel rafsanjani said referring to mondays reported 
slaying of marine lt col william r higgins by the proiranian 
organization of the oppressed on earth 
but if the united states wants to take the inititative in 
freeing hostages it must ask israel to free the friday prayer 
leader of jibchit rafsanjani said 
if the us responds by saying it cannot pressure israel into 
freeing the moslem cleric this isnt acceptable to us he 
added 
israeli commandos last week stole into jibchit in south 
lebanon and kidnapped sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem 
clergyman who is the local prayer leader obeid also is reputed to 
be a spiritual leader of the proiranian group hezbollah believed 
to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 16 foreign

cicippio but announced thursday it had suspended the death order 
it also demanded that israel free not only obeid but also 
palestinian and lebanese prisoners within days the group did

engaged in an extroardinarily broad exercise of diplomacy over 
the last several days on behalf of the hostages

today that bush planned to target for attack the baalbek base of 
4000 iranian revolutionary guards in eastern lebanon the guards 
work closely with hezbollah 
asked about the report bush responded if i had made such a 
decision i expect this would be the last place id be talking 
about it 
in jerusalem defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel would 
examine the new demands on a positive basis four top israeli 
leaders including rabin and prime minister yitzkhak shamir met 
today in jerusalem to fashion a response to the shiite radicals

shiites it holds for foreign hostages and three israeli soldiers 
held in lebanon 
hezbollah has rejected such a swap sheik naim qassem a 
hezbollah leader said there had been no direct or indirect 
negotiations with israel on a prisoner exchange and would not be 
the revolutionary justice organization granted cicippio a 
reprieve 45 minutes before the deadline thursday that it had set 
for killing him 
it was the third time the group held off on its death threat 
out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states 
with whom america pleaded to mediate and stop the execution we 
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution 
with an initiative said a statement by the group 
none of the mediating nations was named but press reports in 
beirut have said iran syria and algeria were believed to have 
interceded algeria helped secure the release of american diplomats 
taken captive at the us embassy in tehran in 1979 
rafsanjani known as a pragmatist has not commented on whether 
iran played a role but a knowledgeable shiite moslem source in 
beirut speaking on condition of anonymity said the final word on 
cicippios reprieve came from him 
rafsanjani is believed to want to improve ties with the west and 
to change irans image as a sponsor of international terrorism

throwing flowers candy and coins 
more than 1000 cheering residents of this key black sea port gave 
a riotous welcome today to us navy warships cruising into 
sevastopols historic harbor 
thats for ice cream when you come ashore called one woman 
in the crowd as she lobbed a 20kopeck coin toward the american 
sailors lined along the ships decks in their blinding summer 
whites 
the visiting seamen who sent dozens of round sailor hats 
whizzing to the whistling waving crowd were equally excited 
it just feels great to be making history said greg marlatt 
medical officer aboard the cruiser uss thomas s gates 
the goodwill port call by the gates and the frigate uss 
kauffman mirrored a visit last month by three soviet ships to 
norfolk va in the first such sovietamerican naval exchange in 
14 years 
the us sixth fleets flagship the uss belknap also was to 
join but was diverted to be at president bushs disposal during the 
hostage crisis in lebanon 
the ships visit to sevastopol is the first since world war ii 
three us warships docked in leningrad in 1975 
sevastopol headquarters of the soviet black sea fleet normally 
is a closed city even to soviets but today it opened its gates 
wide to greet the american sailors 
crewmen were mobbed by beaming soviets handed babies to kiss 
asked to pose for snapshots and given rubles souvenirs and food a 
brass band played marches and two women in traditional costume met 
the ship with bread and salt symbols of hospitality 
my whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thing 
and that we will be friends said 18yearold zinaida 
kolisinchenko and the american sailors they are so attractive 
vladimir zverev the military commandant of sevastopol look 
with bemusement at the crowd on the pier we didnt expect so 
many people he said this is the biggest reception for a ship 
i have ever seen here 
zverev admitted the city is not accustomed to giving such an 
open welcome to western guests but said it is appropriate given 
the state of our relations today 
the american sailors too commented on the strange sensation of 
suddenly being treated as such good friends 
aviator matt zentry of seattle wash recalled going through 
recognition training to learn how to pick out soviet ships from 
afar and now here were are right next to them he said 
for so long we thought of them as possible adversaries and 
all of a sudden that is gone in a minute said public affairs 
officer paul weishautt 
above counts pier where the american ships docked a red 
banner proclaimed in english mutual understanding and trust 
between the people of the usa and the ussr is the path to 
peace and security 
the americans will tour state farms a vineyard an art museum 
an aquarium a war museum and naval installations they will be 
entertained at concerts eat meals aboard soviet ships and play 
basketball soccer and volleyball with their soviet counterparts

the government said today it is closing 
its investigation of felix s bloch the us diplomat suspected of 
spying for moscow after determining that austrias interests 
were not affected 
however interior minister franz loeschnak also told austrian 
radio that 10 politicians have been asked about their relationship 
with bloch and that their answers will be forwarded to washington 
for its investigation 
the austrianborn bloch served at the us embassy in vienna in 
198087 and was friends with many politicians including foreign 
minister alois mock 
in the radio interview loeschnak refused to identify the 
austrian politicians asked to fill out questionnaires about their 
dealings with bloch 
he also said that austria is leaving it up to the politicians to 
respond at their own discretion 
some of the 10 have promised to comply he said without 
identifying them 
loeschnak said police interviewed an austrian woman with whom 
bloch had an extended friendship but their questioning yielded no 
evidence that the woman suspected anything about blochs alleged 
spying activities he said 
no charges have been brought against bloch who has been 
stripped of his diplomatic passport and placed on administrative 
leave he is under constant surveillance in washington by the fbi 
bloch 54 reportedly had broad contacts with austrian 
politicians and officials and he regularly attended all kinds of 
diplomatic and other parties while he was economics chief at the 
embassy in 198083 and then the no 2 until his return to 
washington in july 1987 
loeschnak noted the americans contacts with the austrian 
politicians have no relevance for austrias security 
interests 
at a news conference july 28 loeschnak said the suspicions 
against bloch are the affair of the united states 
bloch is the highestranking us diplomat to be investigated 
under suspicion of collaborating with the soviets us officials 
were alerted to blochs possible links with the kgb when they 
intercepted an international telephone call arranging a meeting in 
paris in may 
there bloch was filmed exchanging briefcases with a man known 
as pierre whom the fbi considers a soviet spy bloch says he knows 
pierre as a stamp collector

the battle over abortion will involve 
young people today as the vietnam war did in the 1960s former us 
rep bella abzug told female political activists today 
abortion is the vietnam of this nation for young people 
everywhere abzug told the opening session of the national 
womens political caucus biennial convention 
abzug a former democratic representative from new york and a 
founder of the caucus 18 years ago was the first of several 
speakers who are expected to address the abortion issue the caucus 
runs through sunday 
no civilized nation can be allowed to declare an unborn fetus 
a person under the constitution before women are declared persons 
under the constitution abzug said 
on thursday democratic national committee chairman ron brown 
told the steering committee that the democrats lost a chance to win 
the 1988 presidential election by not doing more to garner votes 
from women 
in fact we blew a major gender gap that might have carried 
the democratic candidate for president to the white house brown 
said 
brown said he understands the frustrations of working in the 
coalition but he said those who counsel the formation of a third 
party ignore the second half of the adage that begins united we 
stand 
no matter where the struggle for justice divided we will 
indeed fall and fail to reach our goals he said 
i have worked in the struggle for civil rights my entire adult 
life and i do not deny the problems of advancing a cause through 
the democratic party brown told the steering committee of the 
national womens political caucus 
but the alternative is selfrighteous failure it may feel 
good when the first speeches are made but it will be very very 
tragic when the votes are counted 
brown told reporters later that the creation of a womens 
political party probably would hurt democrats more than 
republicans but he added i dont think its going to hurt 
anybody because i dont think its going to happen 
no action similar to nows is expected at the national womens 
political caucus biennial convention according to irene natividad 
head of the caucus the convention which officially convened 
today is expected to attract 1500 delegates and guests 
brown also touched on the battle over abortion because of 
restrictions allowed under a july 3 us supreme court ruling 
the supreme court and the right wing of this country threaten 
womens rights and all of our rights brown said 
he said the democratic party platform supports the right of a 
woman to choose whether to have an abortion as well as such 
proposals as an equal rights amendment 
an invitation to republican national committee chairman lee 
atwater to address the leaders of the nonpartisan caucus was 
declined natividad said

bophuthatswana is intensifying its crackdown on two communities 
that have violently resisted incorporation into the territory an 
antiapartheid group said today 
also today police imposed restrictions on the funeral of two 
slain activists in a township near cape town and reported a series 
of skirmishes between police and mixedrace youths 
in other incidents police said five blacks were killed in three 
separate clashes in natal province where supporters of militant 
and relatively conservative political factions have engaged in a 
threeyear power struggle claiming hundreds of lives 
bophuthatswana one of south africas four nominally independent 
homelands has arrested a local leader banned antiapartheid 
groups and restricted a lawyers access to people in the 
communities of braklaagte and leeuwfontein 
lydia kompe spokeswoman for the transvaal rural action 
committee which is opposed to the tribal homeland system said the 
bophuthatswana government is still increasing its efforts against 
its opponents in the two communities 
the two neighboring villages were incorporated into the homeland 
on jan 1 despite protests by many of the estimated 25000 
residents 
the residents of braklaagte and leeuwfontein say they want to 
remain part of south africa and fear they will be discriminated 
against by the bophuthatswana government because of their 
opposition to incorporation 
the homelands are not recognized by any foreign countries 
eleven people including nine policemen were killed july 1 when 
authorities sought to break up a rally in leeuwfontein arranged by 
residents who opposed joining bophuthatswana 
thirtythree people charged with involvement in the fighting 
were to appear in a bophuthatswana court 
pupsey sebogodi leader of the braklaagte community has been 
arrested three times this year and remains in detention said the 
transvaal rural action committee which was banned from 
bophuthatswana by the homeland government 
authorities have threatened to deport the rev eberhard richter 
a german citizen and luthern missionary who has served the 
braklaagte community since 1981 ms kompe said 
a south african lawyer representing the defendants james 
sutherland has been ordered to apply for a visa before he can 
return to the homeland the homeland has few formal border posts

the house deliberating less than an hour and 
ignoring talk of a possible veto today approved a 2865 billion 
military spending bill that makes wholesale changes in president 
bushs defense program 
by a vote of 312105 the house voted to adopt a spending plan 
that slashes nearly 2 billion for star wars from the presidents 
request strictly limits the b2 stealth bomber program and makes 
drastic cuts in the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles 
despite the unusually rapid approval of the costly bill by the 
democraticcontrolled house the ranking republican on the house 
armed services committee rep william dickinson of alabama said 
bush may veto the measure 
and in advance of the vote the white house budget office said 
the presidents senior advisers would recommend a veto on grounds 
the measure would severely compromise the administrations 
objective of providing adequate defense capabilities within 
constrained resources 
they have conformed dickinson said of the appropriations 
measure that conforms to the separate defense authorization bill 
the house adopted last week but that still makes it vetobait in 
my opinion 
the bill approved as congress rushed to complete pending 
business before starting a monthlong recess later today slashed 
2 billion from classified programs that include the advanced 
fighter and advanced cruise missile 
the money bill also incorporates the cuts the house made in the 
star wars antimissile program the b2 stealth bomber and the mx 
and midgetman nuclear missiles in the policysetting authorization 
bill 
the house cut bushs request of 49 billion for star wars by 
18 billion imposed strict limitation on production of the 
radarevading b2 trimmed 502 million from the 11 billion 
sought for the mx railgarrison system and eliminated all 100 
million sought for the midgetman 
dickinson said he hoped that when members of the the senate and 
house meet early in september to craft a final version of the bill 
the most egregious addons and deletions can be modified and 
limited to make it acceptable to the administration 
but he said as they stand now he does not support the 
authorization and appropriations bills and would recommend that 
bush veto the legislation 
i think it will be vetoed dickinson said 
but rep ted weiss dny complained about suggestions that 
housesenate conferees will change what the house did after the 
chamber worked its will on the defense authorization bill 
that really borders on the ridiculous the house has spoken 
weiss said 
the bill adds 893 million to the administrations budget for 
the purchase of 24 new f14 jet fighters and 12 ea6b prowlers 
both manufactured by grumman aerospace corp 
bush has proposed canceling the f14d a carrierbased fighter 
plane the house restored in its authorization bill the house 
earmarked about 1 billion for 24 planes over two years 
rep john murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee criticized the increasing costs of the 
advanced tactical fighter and favored spending money on 
conventional projects 
the appropriations bill is designed to provide the money for the 
defense programs approved by the house last week the measure calls 
for 2865 billion in budget authority and 2819 billion in 
outlays but doesnt include money for the department of energy and 
military construction 
the house defense authorization bill totals 305 billion 295 
billion for the defense department and 10 billion for military 
nuclear programs handled by the energy department

a government report today said a failure of 
police control led to the deaths of 95 people who were crushed in 
a surging crowd at a soccer match and it recommended new safety 
measures for all stadiums 
the 71page report said authorities at hillsborough stadium in 
sheffield did not recognize how big their job would be or know how 
to cope when problems developed in the opening minutes of an april 
15 football association cup semifinal 
after the reports release sheffields top police officer 
south yorkshire chief constable peter wright submitted his 
resignation and david duckenfield who was in charge of police at 
hillsborough was suspended pending further review 
wright said he accepted full responsibility for police 
action which had unraveled like a handknitted rug with 
terrible consequences to the families who lost loved ones 
the report said drinking by an unruly minority of fans and 
confused and inadequate signs and tickets issued by the clubs 
aggravated the problem 
but it primarily blamed senior police officials 
neither their handling of problems on the day nor their 
account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership 
expected of their rank it said the main reason for the 
disaster was the failure of police control 
the crush occurred when fans in a standingroom section near the 
field were crushed against a steel fence by hundreds of people who 
surged into the stadium behind them 
the report recommended a 15 percent reduction in standingroom 
sections at british soccer stadiums and better safety procedures 
near the steel fences designed to keep rowdy fans off the field 
the report was sent for review to the home office where 
secretary douglas hurd said officials had failed to learn from past 
problems including the heysel riots in brussels and the bradford 
city fire that killed more than 50 people in britain 
the tragedy would not have occurred if lessons learned in the 
past had been properly applied hurd said 
rogan taylor president of the football supporters association 
said he was pleased with the report but that it did not eliminate 
the possibility of future stadium tragedies 
when 50000 people gather together theres a risk of 
something like this happening he said i think his report is 
trying to reduce that risk 
a lack of advance work and inadequate communication led to a 
buildup of fans outside the leppings lane entrance to the stadium 
where liverpool was playing nottingham forest the report said 
once police ordered a large gate be opened to let fans in just 
before kickoff there was inadequate effort to direct them away 
from an already packed standingroom section 
a surge of hundreds of liverpool fans into the area known as 
pen 3 pushed those already there forward crushing victims against 
metal fences or concrete floors and walls it said 
failure to cut off access to the central pens was the main 
cause of the tragedy justice peter taylor who headed the inquiry 
said in the report 
they were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities 
had been laid down when the influx entered pen 3 the layout of 
the barriers afforded less protection than it should and a barrier 
collapsed again the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish 
reaction 
the club and police should have realized that the turnstile 
area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it 
unless they fans arrived steadily over a lengthy period 
officials said the reports recommendations should be 
implemented to insure safety during the new english soccer season 
starting aug 19

a concert violinist once billed as the mick 
jagger of classical music has reportedly entered a new hampshire 
drug clinic after being arrested on drug charges last week in 
massachusetts 
susan davis the exwife of eugene fodor jr told the denver 
post that fodor entered the clinic tuesday but she did not 
identify it 
an official with new hampshires office of alcohol and drug 
abuse prevention told the associated press the state has at least 
10 private substance abuse treatment programs of the program 
officials reached by telephone thursday and today none offered any 
information about fodor being in treatment 
fodor a 39yearold denver native and winner of the 1974 
tchaikovsky violin competition in moscow was arrested july 27 on 
charges including possession of heroin and cocaine he was released 
from the edgartown mass jail monday on his own recognizance 
fodor also was charged with breaking and entering with intent to 
commit a felony after allegedly entering an unoccupied room at a 
marthas vineyard hotel police said they seized 20 grams of 
heroin some cocaine and a dagger from the violinist 
davis who lives in the washington suburb of vienna va said 
fodor called her before entering the 12step drug rehabilitation 
and counseling program he wants to do it she said 
davis who married fodor in 1978 and divorced him in 1985 said 
she could not explain how he apparently became dependent on 
narcotics 
i think everyone is confused she said however if your 
identity is tied up in what you do and things are not going the 
way you think they should youre totally frustrated and very 
vulnerable and emotional 
after great initial promise including an rca records contract 
fodors international career failed to take off and was in relative 
decline recently though he had concert bookings 
early in his career before his feet ever touched this country 
from moscow he was billed as the mick jagger of classical music 
and a playboy he came back to this whirlwind and had 90 
engagements in his first year davis said

about 1000 chinese swamped government 
offices for a third day in a row friday apparently prompted by 
rumors it was easy to gain asylum in belgium officials said 
we dont know who started the rumors but there is not a grain 
of truth to it said justice ministry spokesman jeanfrancois 
raskin 
almost all of the chinese have been coming from the netherlands 
he said others have driven in from france and west germany most 
work illegally in restaurants or the garment industry in those 
countries and have no official documents he said 
since wednesday they have lined the street leading to the main 
refugee center in brussels they have not been deterred by official 
leaflets explaining the difficulties of gaining refugee status 
raskin said all requests that have been investigated during the 
recent surge have been turned down instead the applicants have 
received orders to leave belgium police have increased controls 
along the border he said 
newspapers reported the confusion may have arisen after the 
justice ministry said that following the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in beijing chinese already living in 
belgium could ask for an extension of their residency permits 
belgium approved legislation last year to limit foreign 
refugees arguing it wanted to stop those people who falsely claim 
to be political refugees but only come to belgium to find work

president daniel ortega said today the 
sandinista government and opposition groups have agreed that the 
ussupported contra rebels should be disbanded 
the government also said it would suspend the military draft for 
five months starting in september to ease tensions with the 
opposition and to help keep the war from flaring up 
ortega who will attend a twoday central american summit this 
weekend said he will insist at the summit that camps housing 
12000 contras and thousands of their dependents in southern 
honduras be disbanded 
honduran president jose azcona hoyo has also been saying for 
some time that his country finds the contras a burden 
the summit involving the presidents of el salvador nicaragua 
guatemala and costa rica is part of a regional peace plan that 
aims to negotiate an end to the contra conflict and to the leftist 
guerrilla war in el salvador it is being held in the caribbean 
beach resort of tela 
the talks saturday and sunday will concentrate mostly on 
nicaragua 
both the united states and contra leaders are resisting the move 
to disband the contras and want to postpone such a move until after 
nicaraguas government holds free and fair elections feb 25 as 
promised 
the agreement to back disbandment was reached after 22 hours of 
talks between sandinistas and leaders of 20 opposition parties the 
talks recessed thursday night 
sandinista leaders also said they planned to suspend the 
military draft from september until after the february elections in 
an effort to ease tensions with the opposition and deescalate the 
war 
the talks were called by the sandinistas to reform nicaraguas 
election laws to accomodate opposition objections that their 
candidates were not allowed to campaign freely in past elections 
past constraints on the opposition included news censorship 
the agreement on disbanding the contras calls on the 
presidents of central america to push forward the plan to 
demobilize and repatriate voluntarily the rebels 
it also called on the regions governments to abstain from 
carrying out undercover activities during nicaraguas electoral 
process 
the sandinistas also pledged to grant unconditional amnesty to 
all people arrested for inciting political disorder 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs visited guatemala and other central american nations this 
week to urge against disbanding the contras until after elections 
adolfo calero a member of the rebel political directorate said 
he was elated that president bush has come out unequivocally in 
favor of having the resistance remain as a viable force 
the process of democratization in nicaragua promised by the 
leftist sandinista government remains to be seen calero said 
you do not take down the scaffold before the building is 
finished he said 
a senior state department official in washsington briefing 
reporters on the aronson trip cited complaints that the sandinista 
government is mounting raids against suspected contra sympathizers 
in northern nicaragua and has failed to create fair conditions for 
political opponents 
all us military aid to the contras was cut off a year ago and 
the rebels now receive a trickle of nonlethal assistance such as 
food and boots

japans largest automobile manufacturer said friday 
it will stop using chlorofluorocarbons which are blamed for 
hurting the earths protective ozone layer 
by 1995 toyota motor corp will discontinue use of the gas 
which it uses for cleaning cooling and foaming during 
manufacturing said spokesman anthony mcmillan 
toyota used 2800 tons of cfcs during 1988 he said the toyota 
group which includes affiliated parts suppliers used 9500 tons 
in that year mcmillan said 
toyotas action follows a move by nissan motor co and honda 
motor co japans second and thirdlargest automakers to cease 
using the gas by the mid1990s 
the auto industry consumes 14 percent of all cfcs used in japan 
makers say 
in 1987 38 countries agreed in montreal to reduce production 
and use of the gases under the montreal protocol participating 
countries must have frozen their consumption of cfcs at the 1986 
level by july 1 1898 and reduce consumption to 5 percent of the 
1986 level by the end of 1999

hurricane dean turned away from puerto rico and the 
virgin islands and moved slowly northward to the open atlantic 
today apparently rendering its 85 mph winds harmless 
all hurricane and flood warnings and watches have been lifted 
throughout the eastern caribbean officials at the national 
hurricane center in suburban coral gables said today 
the main thing is that it did what we wanted it do in that it 
missed the islands down there said forecaster bob case of the 
hurricane center it appears now that its going to be a marine 
problem for the next couple of days 
the waters north of the islands are heavily traveled by local 
craft and cruise ships but case said the vessels will be able to 
steer around dean 
looking at the satellite it looks like its going to drift 
northward said forecaster jesse moore dean wont threaten any 
land for days unless something really strange happens he added 
at noon edt the storms center was located 210 miles northeast 
of san juan puerto rico near latitude 212 north and longitude 
639 west it was drifting slowly northward and was expected to 
pick up speed later today 
a weakening of upper atmosphere winds that steer the storm kept 
dean away from the islands on thursday 
the puerto rican national guard canceled plans to evacuate 2000 
people from floodprone areas 
earlier repeated warnings on television and radio that dean was 
headed for the virgin islands and puerto rico caused a shopping 
rush as people stocked up on food drinking water and buckets 
batteries candles and tape 
dean was not expected to gain much strength today 
it may pulsate a little bit in strength forecaster hal 
gerrish said normally when hurricanes slow down they strengthen 
in this particular case i think thats being offset by deleterious 
winds at the upper level 
dean the second hurricane of the atlantic season became a 
tropical storm monday night and on tuesday passed the hurricane 
threshold of 74 mph winds

president bush said today he would explore 
to the fullest an offer by irans new leader to help end the 
hostage crisis in lebanon saying it sounded encouraging but 
emphasizing that i dont want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment 
this is a brutal process bush said of the hostages plight 
one day after terrorists suspended a threatened death sentence 
against hostage joseph cicippio bush told reporters i was 
certainly pleased that the brutal murder that had been threatened 
was set aside 
i dont know the total role of any individual country in that 
area in all of this but when you see a statement that offers hope 
for the return of our hostages i want to explore it to the 
fullest the president said 
bush answered several questions from reporters after posing for 
pictures in the oval office with republican senators sponsoring 
legislation to authorize a presidential lineitem veto 
irans new president hashemi rafsanjani said during a weekly 
prayer sermon today at tehran university these bullyings 
arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems come 
let us approach the problem reasonably we too will help solve the 
problems there so the people of the region can live in peace and 
harmony 
i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has solutions 
the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable prudent 
solutions rafsanjani said in a broadcast monitored in nicosia 
cyprus 
iran is thought to have strong influence over shiite moslem 
militants holding americans captive 
while bush called rafsanjanis statement encouraging white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said were always 
skeptical of what we hear from iran 
bush refused to confirm numerous reports that he had been 
prepared to order retaliatory military action if cicippio had been 
killed 
if i had made such a decision i expect this would be the last 
place id be talking about it he said 
fitzwater talking with reporters later said emphatically that 
bush had not made a final decision on military action i talked 
to the president about this very question before he came out i 
know what he intended to say i know what he said and i know what 
the truth is and i know he did not make a final decision the 
spokesman said 
moreover with hostages still in captivity fitzwater said it 
is not helpful to be flexing our muscles in public 
bush said he had been engaged in an extroardinarily broad 
exercise of diplomacy over the last several days on behalf of the 
hostages white house officials said he called upwards of a dozen 
world leaders to seek their help 
as for the offer from rafsanjani bush said i am pleased 
about that i dont know what it means fully but i think the world 
is familiar with our policy that there will be nothing done ever 
that will create a new incentive for taking somebody else hostage 
i feel the burden of going to every end possible to try to 
find the return of these americans to their loved ones and to 
find out the truth about col william higgins a hostage 
reported hanged in lebanon on monday by kidnappers 
asked if recent developments suggest a break in the hostage 
crisis bush said im encouraged but i dont want to get the 
hopes of the hostages loved ones up once again to have those hopes 
dashed 
this is a brutal process where you see people paraded before 
cameras and the families get their hopes up my heart is still with 
mrs higgins 
noting that the united states is not absolutely sure that 
higgins is dead bush said we cant tell her with any definition 
what of her husbands fate 
the president added i dont want to raise hopes beyond 
fulfillment but theres reason to be somewhat encouraged 
asked what prompted the freeze on cicippios death sentence 
bush said i like to think a broadspread appeal to nations in 
every corner of the globe had something to do with it i dont know 
for sure the response i have had on my personal calls and that the 
secretary had on his has been heart warming and its come from all 
sectors and i have been very very encouraged by that and where we 
go from here well just keep on trying 
asked if cicippio deserved the full backing of the united 
states in view of the fact that he ignored us warnings to leave 
lebanon bush acknowledged that indeed americans had been urged 
not to stay in that strifetorn country 
even so bush said hes an american hes entitled to the 
concern of the president of these senators of everybody in our 
administration 
us navy units remained in readiness today as reports 
circulated that bush was prepared to use carrierbased aircraft 
from the 6th fleet in a strike against lebanese terrorists if any 
american hostages were harmed 
television evangelist robert schuller who prayed thursday with 
bush in the oval office for hostages said the president had made 
it clear he would take appropriate action if another hostage was 
killed 
the new york times reported today that bush had all but 
decided to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern lebanon 
including the baalbek base of 2000 iranian revolutionary guards 
if a hostage had been killed 
a white house spokesman reached at home thursday night who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity said to my knowledge that 
is not true but added we just dont discuss those sorts of 
things 
cicippios captors indicated he still could be killed within 
days unless israel releases unspecified palestinian and lebanese 
guerrillas as well as the moslem cleric kidnapped by israeli 
commandos sheik abdul karim obeid 
asked thursday if bush would recall any ships presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said i urge everyone to keep in mind 
especially in regard to the ships that we still have a serious 
problem in the middle east 
asked whether the united states was considering asking israel to 
extradite obeid for possible involvement in the kidnapping of 
higgins fitzwater said only that the justice department is 
looking into the case 
a law enforcement source said the fbi is reviewing laws that 
allow the arrest and prosecution of terrorists for the kidnapping 
and murder of us citizens overseas 
fitzwater said the president called at least a dozen leaders in 
the middle east and elsewhere over the past two days

the house ethics committee has voted to 
investigate three lawmakers accused in complaints of sexual 
improprieties two of the members and congressional sources said 
today 
the committee voted in secret session thursday to conduct 
preliminary inquiries into the conduct of reps gus savage dill 
donald e buz lukens rohio and jim bates dcalif 
william jarrell press spokesman for lukens said the 
congressman confirmed to him that he has been formally notified by 
the ethics panel of the decision bates said he was also was 
formally notified of the committee action 
savages office had no immediate comment but house sources 
speaking only on condition they not be named confirmed that he 
also would be investigated 
three house democrats filed a complaint against savage this 
month after news accounts said a peace corps volunteer complained 
the lawmaker fondled her while he was traveling in zaire 
since the incident the state department inspector general has 
sent investigators to collect information on savages actions 
during official foreign travels according to a house member who 
would speak only as an unnamed source 
news accounts this week said that when savage was in china as 
part of a delegation from the house science and technology 
committee he revised his schedule and went to hong kong and south 
korea for shopping and sightseeing 
before he moved to hong kong savage locked himself in a hotel 
room to protest the us embassys failure to immediately get him 
on a flight the accounts said 
savage told reporters two weeks ago i did nothing thats 
what i did this lie was leaked by the state department for 
political reasons 
they tried to destroy dr martin luther king with a lie 
im in good company he said at the time 
the house republican caucus composed of all republicans asked 
the ethics panel to investigate lukens who was convicted in ohio 
on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a 
child lukens was sentenced june 30 to 180 days in jail and fined 
1000 for having sex with a teenage girl he is appealing 
lukens has said his conviction is no worse than drunk driving or 
shoplifting he has criticized house republican leaders for seeking 
the ethics investigation 
jarrell the lukens aide said the ohio republican has already 
said he welcomes a full and open investigation where his accusers 
motives and the full record can be brought forth 
he added that lukens would be able to bring the committee 
information about the credibility of the teenage girl and her 
mother which was inadmissible in the courtroom thats a 
positive for lukens he said 
the complaint against bates was filed last year by two former 
aides who alleged he sexually harassed female members of his 
staff and pressured congressional employees into doing campaign 
work 
bates said the committee told him there were sworn complaints 
from two individuals saying they were sexually harassed and that 
congressional resources were used to perform political activity i 
would deny they were sexually harassed and that the staff and 
resources were used to perform campaignrelated activities at 
least under my direction 
bates added i look forward to having the matter resolved it 
has gone on for a year without any action i would like it 
resolved i dont think it warrants a preliminary inquiry but if 
the committee does well cooperate in any way we can

a senior romanian diplomat charged with 
passing secrets to a foreign power has gone on trial in 
bucharest and faces the death penalty if convicted an emigre 
source said friday 
the trial for mircea raceanu is taking place behind closed 
doors said the source a spokesman for the parisbased romanian 
league of human rights 
raceanu served for several years in the romanian embassy in 
washington in the 1970s 
the trial was not reported by romanias statecontrolled media 
and a league spokesman told the associated press in vienna it was 
not known when it would end 
a brief announcement from the general prosecutors office 
carried by romanian dailies in march said state security bodies had 
uncovered a grave action of betrayal of the interests of the 
romanian people and state by raceanu 
raceanu last held the post of deputy head of the foreign 
ministrys us desk in bucharest he was said by emigre sources to 
have been detained jan 31 as he went with his wife to the us 
ambassadors residence to see a movie 
being caught in the act and following the investigations it 
has been found that since 1974 when mircea raceanu was recruited 
by a foreign spying service and became its agent he has been 
engaged in steady treasonable action the official agerpres news 
agency said last spring quoting the general prosecutors statement 
it said he managed to supply unspecified secret data and 
intelligence to the unidentified power for which he allegedly 
worked 
the maximum penalty for treason is death if the alleged 
espionage is deemed to have caused grave damage to state security 
the next most severe penalty is 20 years in jail 
the prominent media attention given to the arrest indicated 
authorities wanted to make an example of him following signs of 
domestic resistance to the tough policies of president nicolae 
ceausescu 
emigre sources and western diplomats in bucharest linked 
raceanus arrest to a protest letter to ceausescu signed by six 
communist party figures including raceanus father ion

the national organization for women is using 
personal checks to lobby against the supreme court decision giving 
states greater leeway to regulate abortion 
people who advocate the right to choose can purchase bright 
yellow checks that say pro choice protect our right to choose 
and send a political message each time they use their checkbooks 
now spokeswoman patricia ireland said thursday 
the average person writes 300 checks a year and the recipients 
are a captive audience said priscilla fenton founder of the 
seattlebased messsagecheck corp 
about six to 10 people see each check as it goes through the 
banking system from the people you write the check to all the way 
to the federal reserve said company spokeswoman jane lockwood 
asked what sparked the idea prochoice checks ireland replied 
money 
everybody has to spend it and this is a way that sends a 
message with the money she said its much more of a 
consciousnessraiser than a fundraiser and it demonstrates the 
economic clout of prochoice supporters 
a lot of people have been supporters but not activists since 
the supreme court decision went down said ireland adding that 
the checks which have been available about three months give them 
a chance in everyday life to show their support for the prochoice 
cause 
if im standing in a supermarket line and i write my check to 
the cashier in some way it gives you the opportunity to talk to 
people about the issue she said 
now has been distributing checks that say equality for women 
through messagechecks for about four years ireland said 
fenton a former fundraiser formed messagechecks about four 
years ago to help nonprofit organizations get their messages 
across without spending much money 
in addition to now the company prints checks with messages for 
the vietnam veterans of america greenpeace mothers against drunk 
driving and several other groups

china said friday it would not crack down on 
intellectuals even though some participated in recent prodemocracy 
protests but it also stripped leading dissident fang lizhi of his 
post on an academic board 
the foreign ministry meanwhile refused immediate comment on 
reports by a japanese news agency that senior leader deng xiaoping 
is gravely ill with prostate cancer 
an unsigned commentary in the communist party newspaper peoples 
daily appeared aimed at reassuring chinas educated elite some of 
whom have come under sharp attack for supporting what the party 
calls bourgeois liberalism western liberal ideas and the 
studentled prodemocracy movement 
there has been some concern as to whether the partys policy 
toward intellectuals would change it is necessary to reaffirm that 
it has not changed and will not change the commentary said 
it called the intellectuals who took part in the student 
movement scum of the intellectuals who do not represent the 
intellectuals and enemies of the party and of the people 
it is in the interest of the workers peasants and 
intellectuals to punish them and the party will protect that 
interest it said 
those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeois 
liberalism will elevate their understanding and continue to make 
contributions to chinas modernization program it said 
the armys violent crackdown on mass demonstrations in early 
june has ushered in a new era of repression chinese are urged to 
turn in friends and family members who participated in the 
protests and many must attend weekly political study sessions 
reminiscent of the ultraleftist cultural revolution 
the crackdown has brought an end to a period of relatively free 
political debate newspapers once more are under strict party 
control and the works of 10 writers including fang have been 
banned 
the official xinhua news agency said friday that fang an 
astrophysicist was relieved of his position on the academic 
degrees committee under the state council chinas cabinet and of 
his qualification to tutor doctoral students 
fang who took refuge inside the us embassy in beijing with 
his wife shortly after the crackdown already had lost another 
minor post but apparently still retains his main job at the beijing 
observatory 
the government has issued arrest warrants for fang and his wife 
physics professor li shuxian for allegedly inciting prodemocracy 
protests and has demanded that the us embassy turn them over to 
chinese authorities 
thousands of students intellectuals and others are believed to 
have been arrested for participating in the sevenweek movement 
during the 196676 cultural revolution intellectuals were 
severely persecuted as class enemies since then deng hasd 
emphasized the need for skilled and talented intellectuals to help 
china modernize 
the educated elite however remains among the lowest paid and 
most politically vulnerable of all chinese 
in japan on friday the jiji press quoted unidentified chinese 
sources as saying the health of deng 84 had deteriorated 
seriously a few days ago and that emergency medical personnel were 
sent to care for him at a coastal resort east of beijing it quoted 
doctors as saying they were discussing whether deng was too ill to 
be moved to beijing where better facilities were available 
an employee in the information department of chinas foreign 
ministry said he had received many queries about dengs health but 
could issue no immediate response there was no answer friday night 
at the communist partys news office 
in another development britains home ofice said it has granted 
political asylum to three chinese diplomats and is considering an 
application from a fourth 
a home office spokesman identified one of the diplomats given 
asylum nin hongshan a second secretary in the embassys 
educational section he said the others were all middleranking 
diplomats but would not identify them 
in new york two chinese exiles said a group that aims to 
provide a democratic alternative to chinas communist party will 
hold its inaugural congress of 120 delegates from around the world 
next month 
the congress will be held secretly in the west and will involve 
exiled student leaders and intellectuals as well as individuals 
traveling surreptitiously from china said the exiles wan runnan 
and yan jiaqi

it because she sat for it but we do not issue statements on silly 
little things like this

the house today passed a 2865 billion 
defense spending bill and lawmakers struggled to find final 
agreement on a savings and loan bailout as congress rushed toward 
its summer recess 
the military bill which was approved on a vote of 312105 
eliminates funds for president bushs proposed advanced tactical 
fighter and advanced cruise missile but restores money for the 
f14d jet that he wants to kill 
it also slashes nearly 2 billion for star wars from the 
presidents request strictly limits the b2 stealth bomber program 
and makes drastic cuts in the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles 
the white house budget office said before the vote that bushs 
senior advisers would recommend he veto the measure because it 
would severely compromise the administrations objective of 
providing adequate defense capabilities within constrained 
resources 
meanwhile house speaker thomas s foley urged his democratic 
colleagues to support a compromise 159 billion savings and loan 
bailout plan saying congress cannot start its summer recess 
without acting to stem continuing losses in the industry to 
delay it or defeat it that will cost money he said 
bush added his endorsement of the compromise plan in a letter to 
congressional leaders that said this legislation has been 
developed in a bipartisan process it is badly needed and must be 
enacted without further delay i ask that the house and senate 
approve this legislation today 
foley told reporters that many in his party have misgivings 
about the latest deal negotiated to salvage a rescue plan that has 
gone through a host of changes in recent weeks 
i think this bill needs to be passed he said although the 
washington democrat said his party had been reluctant to agree to 
any plan that would put bailout spending off the federal budget 
as the latest compromise proposes 
this is a compromise that we didnt prefer to make he said 
but he said that because bush has been adamant about taking it 
off budget we had to deal with that 
the senate today also passed on a 990 vote legislation to 
boost financial liability for oil spills create a nationwide 
system to clean them up and establish a 1 billion trust fund to 
help compensate for damages the bill was prompted by the accident 
involving the tanker exxon valdez this year 
and the house approved a compromise proposal to provide 895 
million to farmers suffering crop losses this year from drought and 
other weatherrelated damage the measure was passed on unanimous 
consent without a recorded vote and sent back to the senate 
during a frenetic day of lawmaking thursday there were these 
other developments 
the house approved an 119 billion measure to finance 
transportation department operations in the new budget year 
starting oct 1 the measure included language making permanent a 
ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights of two hours or less 
this is probably the most popular bill weve passed around 
here in two years said rep richard durbin dill sponsor of 
both the existing and the new restrictions 
the house brushing aside a bush veto threat gave final 
passage to a district of columbia appropriations bill that included 
a provision easing restrictions on public financing of abortions in 
the nations capital 
the senate appropriations committee approved legislation that 
would reduce the amount of money congress is expected to spend next 
year on mail the nearly 2 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill 
earmarks 80 million for lawmakers postage compared with 1247 
million in the bill the house approved earlier this week 
the senate approved legislation that would give vietnamera 
veterans disability benefits for certain illnesses associated with 
us use of agent orange 
the bill provides payments on an interim basis through april 
15 1992 while providing for subsequent congressional votes to 
make the benefits permanent benefits would be paid to veterans 
with nonhodgkins lymphoma and softtissue sarcoma 
a broader version is pending in the house 
bush administration and congressional negotiators working late 
into the night thursday reached agreement on a plan they said 
would be acceptable to their colleagues and the white house 
a housesenate split over how to pay for some elements of the 
relief program had forced new negotiations raising doubts about 
whether lawmakers could meet todays target date for starting the 
annual getaway 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and budget director richard 
darman took part in the talks 
obviously weve only had an opportunity to make a quick 
review but based on that review in the spirit of which the 
president sent us here which was one of compromise we accept 
brady said 
the pact set the stage for final action today by both chambers 
and gop leaders voiced confidence they could muster sufficient 
votes to pass the bill and send it to bush 
reflecting lawmakers growing restiveness in the wake of a 
series of long work days rep joe moakley dmass chairman of 
the house rules committee groused at one point during the sampl 
fight that 90 percent of the people want to get out of here they 
have reservations for vacations 
aside from the sampl bailout the only legislation that had to be 
acted upon before recess was a bill to temporarily extend the 
governments debt limit by 70 billion to 287 trillion 
that was needed to grant the government authority to borrow 
enough money to function for the next three months 
lawmakers continued to work on 13 government appropriations 
bills but they have until sept 30 to get them approved and thus 
were under no pressure to finish the measures before heading home 
although much of the argument about financing the sampl bailout 
was framed around the technical question of whether the 
budgetbalancing act could be stretched to accommodate a 44 
billion chunk of the overall price tag the tinge of partisanship 
was unmistakable 
many democrats were loath to let bush use offbudget techniques 
to mask the impact of the new spending on the overall federal 
budget deficit which is estimated in the range of 148 billion for 
the current fiscal year 
some democrats still believe tax increases eventually will be 
necessary to curb the redink problem even though bush has 
reiterated his nonewtaxes pledge of last years presidential 
campaign 
the compromise reached late thursday is a hybrid of two 
conflicting plans to avoid automatic spending cuts under the 
deficitreduction law

sailors of the first us warships 
to visit this black sea port were treated like celebrities friday 
posing for snapshots signing autographs kissing babies and even 
dodging coins tossed by admirers 
more than 1000 whistling waving soviets climbed on the pier as 
the aegisclass cruiser uss thomas s gates and frigate uss 
kauffman pulled into the headquarters of the soviet unions black 
sea fleet 
the port call mirrored a visit last month by three soviet ships 
to norfolk va in the first such sovietamerican naval exchange 
in 14 years 
thats for ice cream when you come ashore called one woman 
in the crowd as she lobbed a 20kopeck coin toward the sailors 
lined along the ships decks in their summer whites 
you have to understand for americans to visit us is about the 
same as if martians visited you said a soviet navy officer who 
would not give his name 
this is great said us navigator george hughes dodging a 
coin i cant wait to hit the beach 
crewmen were handed babies to kiss asked to pose for photos and 
given rubles souvenirs and food a brass band played marches and 
two women in traditional russian costumes met the ship with bread 
and salt traditional symbols of hospitality 
my whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thing 
and that we will be friends said zinaida kolisinchenko 18 of 
sevastopol and the american sailors they are so attractive 
the americans were equally excited 
it just feels great to be making history said greg marlatt 
medical officer of the cruiser gates 
the city hosted former us defense secretary frank carlucci a 
year ago but navy public affairs officer paul weishautt said this 
was the first time us warships had docked at sevastopol the 6th 
fleets flagship the uss belknap also was supposed to visit but 
was diverted to be at president bushs disposal during the lebanon 
hostage crisis 
sevastopol is normally a closed city even for soviets but it 
opened its gates wide to greet the american sailors 
throughout the day crewmen could be see strolling the citys 
streets often surrounded by female admirers the carnival 
atmosphere lasted into friday evening 
vladimir zverev the military commandant of sevastopol looked 
with amusement at the crowd on the pier we didnt expect so many 
people he said this is the biggest reception for a ship i 
have ever seen here 
but he said the welcome was appropriate given the state of our 
relations today 
adm mikhail n khronopulo head of the soviet black sea fleet 
said friday he could not have imagined even two years ago he would 
be receiving senior us navy officers in such a friendly 
atmosphere 
but now he said the idea that soviet and us captains might 
share a cup of tea as their ships pass is difficult to imagine 
but not impossible 
the american sailors too commented on the strange sensation of 
suddenly being treated as such good friends 
aviator matt zentry of seattle recalled having been trained to 
recognize soviet ships from afar and now here were are right 
next to them he said 
the agenda for the american sailors includes a tour of state 
farms a vineyard an art museum an aquarium a war museum and 
naval installations they will be entertained at concerts eat 
meals aboard soviet ships and play basketball soccer and 
volleyball with their soviet counterparts 
sevastopol in its strategic position on the crimean peninsula 
has been the target of many invasions since it was founded on a 
greek colony in 1422 bc 
a monument stands in the town harbor to russian ships that were 
intentionally sunk there to block the way for invaders during the 
crimean war in the mid1850s 
modernday sevastopol despite its many navy installations 
conveys an atmosphere of seaside ease with its classical 
architecture and many rose bushes

a former highranking aide to mayor edward i 
koch has been indicted for perjury in testimony regarding political 
patronage officials announced today less than six weeks before 
the mayoral primary election 
joseph devincenzo former special assistant to koch was accused 
of lying to the new york state commission on government integrity 
on july 13 and 21 last year and in a public hearing of that 
commission this past jan 11 
devincenzo 46 told the commission that politically connected 
job applicants were not given favorable treatment a position 
contradicted by other witnesses 
devincenzo appeared in state court today pleaded innocent and 
was released on his own recognizance pending an aug 11 hearing 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky who announced 
today that the 11count indictment issued up thursday noted that 
patronage is not illegal perjury however is punishable by a 
maximum of seven years in prison 
devincenzo was responsible for the citys talent bank which 
ostensibly recruited minorities to fill city posts critics claim 
the program actually was a patronage mill doling out the highest 
paying jobs to whites 
files relating to the programs operations were destroyed at the 
beginning of city corruption scandals devincenzo and others told 
the commission that the destruction of those records was routine 
and not part of a coverup 
the talent bank which operated out of an office in the basement 
of city hall has become a campaign issue as koch seeks the 
democratic nomination to run for a fourth term in november 
district attorney robert morgenthau in an telephone interview 
defended the timing of the indictment 
we did consider it morgenthau said but we could not be 
in the role of censor deciding what the public could and could not 
hear 
he said that if possible the charges would have been filed 
earlier but we moved as expeditiously as we could 
the commission was told that some of the files at the talent 
bank were marked with color codes indicating a party leader or 
other political sponsor who might have referred an applicant to 
devincenzo 
his own assistant james g hein testified that devincenzo had 
ordered him in february 1986 to cleanse the employment computer 
and paper files of any references to political figures 
in february koch announced that he had asked for devincenzos 
resignation but devinenzo had already filed papers to resign 
ensuring his pension of 52000 a year

guerrillas after vietnams pullout in september the cambodian 
defense minister said 
on the diplomatic front a un factfinding mission dispatched 
by an international conference in paris prepared to visit cambodia 
next week before touring the embattled thaicambodian border a 
thai official said friday 
defense minister tie banh said new military hardware helped make 
the military a regular force with infantry navy and air force 
components according to a report by the official spk news agency 
that was seen in bangkok on friday 
besides the unit of mig21 forces of armored cars tanks and 
artillery have also shaped and become ever more effective in 
fighting spk quoted him as saying without giving any numbers 
sovietbacked vietnam installed the phnom penh government after 
invading cambodia in late 1978 and ousting the brutal khmer rouge 
rulers the khmer rouge with up to 40000 fighters the largest of 
the three guerrilla forces poses the greatest threat to the 
government 
the first squadron of mig21s piloted by cambodians landed in 
phnom penh in june spk earlier reported 
on july 27 thai army spokesman lt gen naruedol dejpradiyuth 
quoted a report that the jets were dispatched from vietnams bien 
hoa airbase to boost the cambodian army in anticipation of the 
pullout 
before the jets arrived the soviet union sent tanks artillery 
guns and a vast amount of war materiel to cambodias kompong 
som port on june 12 according to the army radio of the khmer rouge 
western analysts have judged the cambodian army unimpressive on 
the battlefield the united states says cambodias army has about 
40000 troops and is relatively inexperienced poorly led and prone 
to defections to the guerrilla side

vadset is to arrive in bangkok sunday and leave for cambodias

israeli analysts said friday the apparent 
willingness of proiranian kidnappers to suspend threats and start 
talking has vindicated israels decision to abduct a shiite moslem 
cleric 
they say creating movement on the hostage issue is an 
achievement even though there is no guarantee negotiations will 
start in earnest or result in freeing either israeli soldiers or 
western hostages 
the israelis have offered to trade sheik abdul karim obeid for 
three of their soldiers held prisoner in lebanon and the 16 western 
hostages who include eight americans obeid is a spiritual leader 
of hezbollah a shiite group believed responsible for kidnappings 
of foreigners 
israel put the issue of hostages back on the international 
agenda said shlomo avineri a former directorgeneral of the 
foreign ministry 
until the current crisis the west accepted people being 
captured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be done 
about it he said in an interview 
shlomo gazit a former chief of military intelligence said the 
abduction was a catalyst for a new willingness by hezbollah to 
trade hostages without it nothing would have happened and all 
the existing hostages would be in the same hopeless situation as 
before he said 
gazit said it also put the israeli hostages on the agenda and 
that was the exact purpose 
zeev schiff a leading military commentator was among the few 
public critics writing in the liberal daily haaretz on friday he 
called the abduction a policy of restrained lunacy but added 
that it might help deter future acts of terror 
defense minister yitzhak rabin authorized the july 28 abduction 
by israeli commandos after coming under intense pressure to get the 
israeli soldiers home 
dore gold of tel aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic 
studies said there was a special sensitivity in israel about not 
abandoning soldiers in the field 
failure to act he said would have a very deleterious effect 
on the morale of the army when it goes into battle so that leaves 
an activist policy as the only choice after efforts to arrange 
negotiations failed 
sometimes there is a misunderstanding why israel is not more 
aggressive in offering peace he said adding that the weeks 
events show that the middle east is a violent region and you 
have to understand israels caution 
obeids abduction brought criticism from the united states 
especially after the captors of lt col william r higgins a us 
marine kidnapped while on un duty said monday they had hanged 
him in retaliation they released a videotape of a man who appeared 
to be higgins on a gallows 
some critics said israel had failed to consider the effect of 
its actions on american hostages even though israeli officials and 
some other reports say higgins was killed several months ago 
such attacks caused concern in israel which depends on 
washington for 3 billion a year in economic and military aid but 
avi pazner chief spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
there was no lasting damage 
the attempt by hezbollah to drive a wedge between israel and 
the united states failed pazner said all and all we are 
pleased to see our standing in public opinion is very high on this 
issue this is very gratifying 
israel may not be out of the woods however some analysts 
believe the final evaluation of israels actions will depend on the 
results of negotiations 
avineri of hebrew university in jerusalem said the action 
will be judged by its outcome if the outcome is horrible and 
hostages are killed israel will be condemned if some or all the 
hostages are freed no one will split hairs about marginal 
mistakes 
how far israel will go in meeting shiite demands for release of 
an unspecified number of palestinians remains a question about 
8000 palestinians have been jailed since an uprising against 
israeli occupation began 20 months ago in the west bank and gaza 
strip 
officials are likely to oppose allowing hardcore activists and 
convicted killers to return to the occupied lands which happened 
after 1050 arabs were traded in may 1985 for three soldiers held 
by a radical palestinian group led by ahmed jibril 
moshe nativ a retired general who helped negotiate that 
exchange said on army radio obeid was the strongest card for 
getting hostages out of lebanon in 1985 he noted there was no 
movement in negotiations until we kidnapped jibrils nephew

course in time management that is how to have a tidy desk and 
presumably tidy habits 
the offer comes from priority management which trains people in 
how to arrange their day manage their time keep their files and

desks to separate the truly disgusting from the merely slovenly it

scrutinized for these symptoms 
multiple calendars they lead to overbooking says ms rozzo 
those little pink phone messages scattered around one may 
return yesterdays call more than once 
reminders on scraps of paper strewn about tch tch 
someday files as in someday ill get around to it 
leaning towers in the in box 
open files atop the desk 
open files distract from the task at hand ms rozzo said 
yielding to an impulse to instruct 
lets say you have four projects going on at the same time 
people usually have files from all four on their desks we show 
people they shouldnt do that we say put three of the files on 
some other piece of office furniture we love credenzas people who 
make credenzas love us 
ms rozzo said her firm teaches people how to organize their 
day how to say no i cant talk to you how to delegate and 
how to keep a boss or colleague from laying on an unscheduled chore 
by asking is it urgent and important can it wait 
instead of saying ill get back to you says ms rozzo 
you should say i will call you on aug 9 
one should not say i will call you on aug 9 if i can find my 
telephone under this pile of stuff that is very untidy it will 
not do

the underground leadership of the palestinian 
uprising friday denounced groups that have threatened arab 
nationalists claiming the infighting is inspired by israel 
nationalists have been accused of collaboration and their cars 
have been burned in the name of the uprising said a leaflet 
signed by the unified leadership strike forces and circulated in 
the west bank 
it urged palestinians to declare war on those issuing false 
leaflets which it said were inspired by suspicious elements 
working in the enemys israels intelligence 
the statement comes amid a growing trend of violence threats 
and factional rivalry within the arab community in the 20monthold 
uprising 
at least 87 palestinian deaths have been blamed on other arabs 
since the revolt against israeli rule began in december 1987 army 
gunfire and israeli settlers have killed 527 palestinians 
thirtyeight israelis also have died 
the army said friday it is investigating the stabbing death of 
an arab man whose body was found near kufr zibad village 30 miles 
northwest of jerusalem 
israel radio quoted residents as saying the man was suspected of 
collaborating with israel and had been interrogated by uprising 
leaders before he was slain 
the underground leaderships leaflet condemned statements issued 
by 10 largely obscure groups including the palestinian popular 
army 
a statement issued in the name of the popular army on july 16 
threatened bir zeit university professor sari nusseibeh for 
allegedly misusing uprising funds and cooperating with israel 
prosecution papers filed in an israeli case against several 
uprising leaders alleged nusseibeh was paymaster of the uprising 
but the professor a palestine liberation organization supporter 
never was charged 
jamil tarifi a west bank lawyer was threatened by wall slogans 
signed by the marxist popular front for the liberation of 
palestine the leaflet did not refer to that group which 
participates in the unified leadership 
tarifi recently announced that he took part in talks with 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir several arabs have met with 
shamir to discuss his peace initiative but tarifi is the only one 
to publicly admit it 
the initiative calls for elections in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip to select palestinians to open talks with israel on 
limited autonomy 
shamir on friday again ruled out any dealings with the plo 
which israel brands a terrorist organization but many palestinians 
consider their sole legitimate representative 
we will not meet and talk with the plo shamir told a 
delegation from the united jewish appeal they are not partners 
to peace they are the very opposite of peace their objective is 
to eliminate the jewish state and replace it with another arab 
state 
his comments coincided with the general congress of the plos 
dominant fatah faction in tunisia where chairman yasser arafat is 
seeking support for his recent moderate stance and calls for peace 
with israel

the bush administration expressed optimism 
friday over signs that iran is pursuing a more moderate course 
under its new president but said relations cannot improve unless 
iran helps secure the release of american hostages in lebanon 
the reactions came after the iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani said there are reasonable prudent solutions to the 
hostage problem 
rafsanjanis comments appeared to be the most hopeful indication 
of a possible accommodation between the two countries since islamic 
fundamentalists ousted the proamerican monarchy in iran 10 years 
ago 
the loss of iran into the antiamerican camp was considered one 
of the worst strategic setbacks for the united states since world 
war ii given irans location and abundant oil reserves 
for the third day in a row the state department on friday 
issued a cautious but upbeat statement citing evidence that iran 
was moving away from its policy of unswerving hostility toward the 
united states 
we do not have a full text of president rafsanjanis remarks 
and we are reacting cautiously to the reported excerpts said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler however based on 
the excerpts we have seen president rafsanjanis remarks appear to 
be moderate and are therefore encouraging 
we have reason to believe that iran is genuinely engaged and 
no reason to believe that its engagement is not focussed in a 
positive direction she said 
but she added that any improvement in relations will be 
contingent on iranian willingness to act responsibly in the world 
arena to include an effort to resolve the hostage issue once and 
for all by producing release of all our hostages and by making it 
clear that they have turned away from support of terrorism 
for his part president bush said he would explore to the 
fullest rafsanjanis offer of cooperation but he added i 
dont want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment 
hours earlier rafsanjani had said in his weekly prayer sermon 
at tehran university that iran will help solve the problems in 
lebanon 
i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has solutions 
the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable prudent 
solutions rafsanjani said 
but like the state department statement rafsanjani attached 
conditions to his offer of cooperation 
he said the united states must take the initiative by pressuring 
israel to free sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem cleric it 
kidnapped from south lebanon a week ago 
if the united states responds by saying it cannot do so this 
isnt acceptable to us rafsanjani said 
still iranian behavior for much of the hostage crisis this week 
has been in marked contrast to what the united states was 
accustomed to under the rule of the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini who died in june 
the first hint of a new iranian approach occurred tuesday when 
rafsanjani and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze issued a 
statement in tehran expressing regret over the reported killing 
monday of lt col william higgins 
the statement appeared to put iran at odds with the proiranian 
group in lebanon that claimed to have carried out higgins 
execution 
then on thursday the revolutionary justice organization in 
lebanon indicated in a statement announcing a reprieve in the death 
sentence for american hostage joseph cicippio that it was bowing to 
irans wishes 
in the past iran has also linked improved relations to us 
release of iranian assets frozen after the seizure of the us 
embassy in tehran in 1979

a paraplegic park service ranger who used only 
his arm strength to climb a 3200foot rock face in yosemite 
presented president bush on friday with an american flag that he 
and his partner carried 
this is great the president told climber mark wellman who 
came to the oval office in his wheelchair you certainly captured 
the imagination of the whole country 
wellman later said the park service needs more federal money to 
spend on making the national parks accessible to the handicapped 
but he said he did not have time in his brief meeting with bush to 
discuss such issues 
we just need more attention brought to it he told reporters 
after the meeting 
wellman a naturalist for the park service and director of 
yosemites program for the disabled said he and bush discussed the 
presidents love of the outdoors and fishing 
the 29yearold climber dressed in his park ranger uniform and 
his fellow climber mike corbett gave bush an american flag that 
was in the gear they cut loose before they reached the summit of el 
capitan on their climb of seven days and four hours 
also attending the meeting were park service director jim 
ridenour and jack moorehead associate director of operations for 
the park service 
wellman and corbett completed the climb on july 26 
wellman hauled himself six inches at a time to the top of the 
cliff one of yosemites most wellknown landmarks 
their climb captured widespread media attention including a 
news conference attended by some 55 reporters and rangers when they 
reached the summit 
wellman whose legs were paralyzed in a 1982 fall from another 
yosemite peak was the first paraplegic to make the vertical trek 
doing 7000 pullups on ropes placed by corbett 
wellman chose a route that was almost straight up because it was 
more practical for him 
the route included tackling the shield roof a ledge jutting 40 
feet out from the monolith at 2000 feet above yosemite valley 
wellman and corbett had to dangle beneath it and hoist themselves 
up a rope with the valley floor far below them

a plea bargain involving one misdemeanor 
charge each against the captain and owner of the tanker that 
spilled 300000 gallons of oil off newport awaits only a judges 
approval a prosecutor said friday 
us attorney lincoln c almond would not identify the charge or 
the penalties that the government will recommend but said the 
charge carries a potential jail term and fines totaling twice the 
cleanup costs 
the captain of the greek tanker world prodigy iakovos 
georgudis was charged last month with misdemeanor violations of 
federal antipollution laws that carry up to a year in jail and 
fines of twice the cleanup costs the owner ballard shipping co 
has not been charged 
the tanker struck brenton reef near the mouth of narragansett 
bay on june 23 and ruptured its hull most of the heating oil was 
quickly cleaned up or dissipated but the spill killed dozens of 
young lobsters and crabs 
most beaches that were affected by the spill reopened within a 
week but one in jamestown remains closed indefinitely because oil 
has soaked into the sand 
georgudis has admitted he erred by not waiting for a harbor 
pilot familiar with the area 
almond and defense attorneys met for about 40 minutes with us 
district judge ernest c torres and said later they were waiting 
for the judge to set a court date to confirm the agreement almond 
said it could be as early as next week 
georgudis free on 50000 bail did not attend the closeddoor 
hearing his attorney john a macfadyen declined to comment on 
the case or say where his client was 
hes being hounded terribly people pounding on his hotel 
room door at four in the morning macfadyen said 
almond said the cleanup costs on which the fine would be based 
had not yet been calculated but added you can rest assured they 
would be substantial in excess of a million dollars 
georgudis was indicted last month on state felony charges of 
polluting coastal waters and failing to have a harbor pilot on 
board he has not yet been arraigned on those charges

said the propellerdriven plane had not experienced any serious 
problems since it went into service in 1981

officials said pilot petros moutzoureas was an hour into his 
domestic flight from salonica in northern greece when he radioed 
his final position as he made his approach for landing

where president kennedy allegedly had trysts with marilyn monroe 
the pierre hotel where aristotle onassis kept a suite and the

the years and i have all of them he said ive seen her 
several times about four years ago we were walking up fifth 
avenue when my friend screamed there she is i tripped and fell

pro football hall of famer roger staubach has 
made an appeal to president bush to help out some of his pilot 
friends at eastern airlines which has been on strike for five 
months and is in chapter 11 bankruptcy 
the former dallas cowboys quarterback asked in a letter dated 
aug 1 that a meeting be set up between representatives of the 
eastern pilots union and roger porter bushs domestic policy 
adviser 
staubach said the striking pilots include the best man at his 
wedding football teammates and classmates at the us naval 
academy where staubach also was a quarterback 
from his conversations with those friends and from all other 
accounts staubach wrote it is obvious that the eastern 
situation is far more than a traditional labormanagement dispute 
it goes to the very root of the free enterprise system within our 
country 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami said he had no comment 
on staubachs letter or speculation that the former football 
player who now runs a real estate company in dallas might get 
involved in making a buyout offer for the company

rhode islands smallest and poorest 
city eager to relieve its financial crisis and downtrodden image 
is staking its future on something nobody else wanted a trash 
incinerator 
other rhode island communities have fought expensive legal 
battles against landfills and incinerators but mayor carlos a 
silva jr offered central falls as a site for a state disposal 
plant in hopes of raising from 750000 to 15 million a year in 
revenue from the state waste agency the exact amount of revenue to 
be paid is under negotiation 
residents who voted for the incinerator in a july 25 referendum 
said they accepted silvas argument that it was the citys only 
available source of new cash even though the plant faces a barrage 
of environmental hearings and cannot open for at least three years 
nobody wants us everybodys trying to put us down and heres 
this man the mayor trying to boost us up by saying lets have 
the incinerator said anne marie healey who voted in favor i 
think we have to trust him 
the incinerator one of three wastetoenergy plants the states 
solid waste management corp is required to build already has been 
rejected on environmental grounds by woonsocket and north 
smithfield another plant in north kingstown has been tied up in 
legal battles for 1 years by residents and town officials who fear 
the pollution it could cause 
opponents of the central falls plant raised similar concerns 
saying the states smallest most densely populated city with an 
estimated 17556 residents packed into 12 square miles was no 
place for a trash incinerator 
some residents fear the 1447to1274 vote in favor of the 
plant means critics of the town will have a new reason to look down 
on it 
i work with a lot of people from neighboring communities and 
they say burn the city they think its all druggies said a 
35yearold nurse who voted against the incinerator 
officials in the neighboring communities of cumberland lincoln 
and pawtucket are threatening to do what they can to block the 
project but the threats have added to the fighting spirit among 
those who remember the slights their city received from its 
neighbors over the years 
i think its good to put it on the pawtucket line because they 
didnt regionalize the schools and on the lincoln line because 
they wouldnt rent us their school said the nurse all the 
garbage trucks are going to go through their towns im glad about 
that 
the nurse like some other residents would discuss the volatile 
issue only anonymously for fear of antagonizing her neighbors 
central falls has a large population of poor latin american 
immigrants crammed into decaying threedecker tenements and a 1980 
median annual family income of 14721 lowest in the state and far 
below the statewide median of 19448 in 1980 
the median home price 100000 is the lowest anywhere in rhode 
island except for the slums of providence 
the city raised taxes 18 percent recently trying to cope with 
potential deficits of 11 million this year and 400000 next year 
caused by a stagnant tax base federal revenue sharing cuts and a 
15 million settlement with a man who claimed he was paralyzed by 
police brutality in the city jail 
it was against that background that city leaders began 
campaigning to get the incinerator saying that with virtually no 
open land left to develop the city has no other way to boost its 
tax base 
the dollars this facility is talking about would take 
something like 750 new homes to bring in said state rep robert 
r brousseau thats physically impossible 
opponents placed fliers throughout the city warning anyone 
who is living in central falls above the fourth floor will be even 
with the incinerator smokestack you may have to keep your windows 
closed on nice days depending on the direction of the wind 
those arguments apparently aimed at residents of highrise 
seniorcitizen housing did not impress elderly residents who 
remember when the incinerator site was used as a city dump and 
sewage filtration pond 
nobody died nobody got sick said a 67yearold man they 
used to play baseball down there 
healey whose back yard is within view of the incinerator site 
said she was also comforted by the track record of a nearby 
crematorium you cant smell a thing she said

american military bases in the 
philippines play a vital role in regional stability and should be 
maintained despite favorable changes in the soviet political 
climate the us ambassador said friday 
ambassador nicholas platt told a seminar at the university of 
the philippines that economic development in the philippines and 
elsewhere in asia cannot happen without security 
there is a regional consensus that the us security umbrella 
is as important now even in this changing era as it was before 
platt said 
if we are to have a successful new partnership we will need 
continuing american involvement in the security of this region 
platt said our military facilities here in the philippines are 
one element of the security equation 
the united states and the philippines are expected to begin 
preliminary talks this year on whether to extend the lease on the 
six american installations which expires in 1991 
after 1991 any extension must be approved by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate 
opposition to the bases has been growing here several leading 
politicians have called for the bases to be closed in 1991 or 
phased out over a 10year period 
president corazon aquino has refused to say whether she will 
support an extension 
platt said the economy of the philippines depends on trade and 
the bases play a vital role in protecting sea lanes 
there is a balance between the united states the soviet 
union japan and china platt said and the maintenance of that 
balance creates the stability that everybody is trying to preserve 
the maintenance of that stability provides the background for the 
progress the economic progress that everybody wants 
platt noted that the soviet union is undergoing political 
changes that are welcome to us 
but we dont think it is smart and we dont think it makes 
sense to dismantle the alliance relationships that we have while

mikhail s gorbachev on friday hailed the 
inaugural session of the revamped soviet legislature as a 
successful exercise in democracy that produced important laws and 
heralded the beginning of genuine oversight of government 
the supreme soviet has become not a parade but a working 
legislative body the president told lawmakers gathered in the 
kremlin for the final day of the session 
the supreme soviet once was dominated by communist cogs who 
approved government proposals with no criticism but under 
gorbachevs political reforms the body was revamped into a 
fulltime legislature with new powers of generating legislation and 
reviewing candidates for top government jobs 
during the session that started june 26 the supreme soviet 
rejected several cabinet nominees and approved legislation to 
increase pensions and grant a measure of economic independence to 
the baltic republics 
in earlier speeches gorbachev called the supreme soviet and its 
larger parliament the congress of peoples deputies a school of 
democracy but he said friday of the recent session by its 
intensity it was a whole university 
criticism came from deputy igor n gryazin a constitutional law 
professor from estonia who said the session was flawed by 20 major 
constitutional violations 
he said one violation occurred friday when it reversed an 
earlier rejection of nikolai s konarev for railway minister 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov who had nominated konarev as well as 
half a dozen other cabinet candidates rejected by the supreme 
soviet told reporters he did not mind the oversight he called it 
a big step forward in democratization and in the formation of a 
completely new system of government 
gorbachev said in his 40minute address that the new legislature 
met during a stormy period with not one quiet day as ethnic 
violence flared in several republics and hundreds of thousands of 
coal miners walked off their jobs 
he pressed the legislature to approve a resolution strengthening 
the fight against a burgeoning crime rate 
later legislators passed the resolution that will increase the 
number of interior ministry soldiers in case of mass disobedience 
by criminal elements it is the interior ministry soldiers that 
have restored order when ethnic violence has broken out in several 
soviet republics 
local ad hoc groups of police prosecutors and court officials 
will organize the anticrime effort and vice president anatoly i 
lukyanov will oversee it 
ryzhkov told reporters government ministers had canceled their 
summer holidays which traditionally begin in august to work on 
implementing the new legislation 
gorbachev said the next session of the supreme soviet which he 
said is scheduled to start sept 25 should adopt laws on property 
leasing taxation and strikes 
showing his political skill gorbachev deflated demands that 
constitutional changes be made before local elections are held the 
interregional deputies group whose leaders include communist 
maverick boris n yeltsin had wanted the congress of peoples 
deputies to meet soon to adopt changes that would ensure local 
elections would be completely democratic 
gorbachev in a proposal yeltsin welcomed suggested the changes 
be informally approved by deputies in a poll and that local 
authorities be guided by them in holding the elections the 
congress would then meet in a scheduled session in december 
deputies said

two education leaders said friday it will take 
money as well as leadership to turn president bush into the 
education president he has said he wants to be 
as long as there is a budget deadlock and the administration 
has its hands tied by its own budget policies its going to be 
very difficult for bush to be the education president said 
robert atwell president of the american council on education an 
umbrella group for all us colleges and universities 
atwell and dick rosser president of the 830member national 
association of independent colleges and universities said they 
hope bushs education summit next month with the nations governors 
will include higher education as well as the elementary and 
secondary grades 
there are very serious problems in higher education rosser 
said among them an incredible need for science facilities and 
more federal money for research support and student aid 
it cannot be simply leadership at the national level its got 
to be money he said 
atwell and rosser said higher education did not fare as well as 
the lower grades in the house appropriations bill for fiscal 1990 
that passed earlier this week 
the house appropriations overall are really quite insufficient 
and could do great damage to students atwell said were going 
to be working very hard to do better in the senate in higher 
education than we did in the house 
atwell and rosser also pledged to continue fighting for a 
separate aid program for students at forprofit schools which have 
a loan default rate four times as high as the 9 percent average for 
fouryear institutions 
the house committee said it was concerned about skyhigh default 
rates at some trade schools and said there would be a full 
review of defaults and other problems in the financial aid 
program next year when the higher education act comes up for 
reapproval 
the forprofit schools are attracting an evergreater proportion 
of grants and loans some of them for classes of dubious value or 
students with dubious ability educators say 
the shift prompted atwells controversial call for a separate 
aid program and has also resulted in colleges and universities 
devoting more of their own resources to campusbased student aid 
rosser said schoolsponsored aid rose from 900 million in 1979 
to 35 billion in the past year at the private nonprofit schools 
he represents 
rosser said faculty salaries still dont match the purchasing 
power they had in 1972 while staff salaries are much lower and 
probably in much worse shape 
in addition he said schools are spending money on science 
equipment that cant wait and a whole array of new services 
designed to meet student needs and help schools stay competitive 
career placement departments security forces drug and alcohol 
abuse programs and counselors to help minority students and others 
with special needs

west berlins leftleaning government 
said friday it wants to improve the environment by reducing flights 
in and out of the city but federal authorities say that could 
increase west berliners isolation 
west berlins government headed by the social democrats in a 
coalition with the environmentalist alternative list proposes that 
36 daily flights be eliminated from tegel airports schedule 
spokesman werner kolhoff said friday 
kolhoff told the radio station sender freies berlin that the 
plan which would cut commercial air traffic by about 15 percent 
is aimed at cutting down on noise and exhaust emissions from 
jetliners servicing west berlin 
horst wagner west berlins transportation minister says that 
while the number of commercial flights increased 236 percent in 
1988 from the previous year the number of passengers increased 
only 62 percent in the same period 
die welt the conservative daily said lowload flights 
would be affected by the reduction meaning flights that do not 
normally carry many passengers 
the united states britain and france formally administer west 
berlin under postworld war ii agreements and would have to approve 
the proposal the federal government also must be consulted 
the three allied air attaches probably will meet with west 
berlin and federal officials next week to discuss the matter said 
an allied official in bonn speaking on condition of anonymity 
herbert schmuelling a federal government spokesman said the 
cut in flights could run counter to the berlin initiative of former 
president ronald reagan who while he was in office called for 
improved access to the divided city 
schmuelling said air traffic is the only uncontrolled access 
to the city and that a major reduction of flights would have a 
pyschological effect on residents of the western enclave 
surrounded by east germany 
eduard lintner a federal lawmaker with chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic union said the proposal sends a dangerous 
signal and would be a serious setback for the city 
rudolf kraus a leading official with the christian social 
union kohls bavarian sister party said the plan bears the 
clear signature of the alternatives alternative list who want to 
turn berlin into an island uncoupled from the federal republic 
allied civil air officials based in bonn said the allied civil 
air attaches must weigh the needs of the traveling public and the 
berlin population as well as commercial and practical aviation 
considerations 
the allies intend to ensure that the high quality of aviation 
services in berlin will be maintained and that measures to protect 
the berlin environment will be implemented as appropriate the 
officials said 
people can also reach west berlin by vehicle and by train which 
must pass through east german border control points 
officials say about 7000 flights in and out of west berlin are 
scheduled every month averaging about 220 a day flights in june 
had about 400000 passengers

what to call a merger of baltimore and 
washington for statistical purposes 
washimore could be confused with that monument in south 
dakota 
baltiwash sounds like a new laundry detergent 
balington washbal these and other names are facetiously 
being considered if the us census bureau decides after the 1990 
census that the two cities populations have grown close enough to 
combine into one statistical entity 
it doesnt really change anything don starsinic chief of 
the population estimate office in the census bureau said friday 
it creates one large metropolitan area rather than two fairly 
large metropolitan areas 
he added that the government could still provide statistics 
tailored to each population center if local officials desired 
the washington area has more than 37 million people and the 
baltimore area has 23 million people ranking the two cities ninth 
and 17th respectively in the nation 
if combined they would become the nations fifthlargest 
metropolitan area starsinic said 
census officials said two areas are combined when the areas 
expand so far as to meet each other with at least 10 percent of 
the smaller citys workforce crossing the border each day to work

friday affirmed its support for the declaration of a palestinian 
state and the recognition of israels right to exist the 
palestinian news agency reported 
the declarations were contained in a program adopted in november 
by the palestine national council the plos parliament in exile a 
third element renunciation of terrorism also was supported by 
fatah the news agency wafa said 
about 1000 delegates to the general congress of fatah the main 
component of the palestine liberation organization are meeting 
behind closed doors in tunis where the plo has its headquarters 
at the congress arafat had been expected to come under fire 
from fatah members who opposed concessions to israel but the wafa 
dispatch suggested he was able to beat back the challenge 
the second day of the congress was characterized by a frank 
and animated discussion concerning internal and political problems 
which shows that the fatah movement has restored its unity and 
solidarity wafa said 
the congress opened thursday and was expected to last about five 
days 
wafa said participants called for support for the intefadeh or 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the occupied 
territories the delegates accused israel of a policy of the iron 
fist against the palestinian people in order to neutralize the 
intefadeh 
fatah spokesman ahmed abdelrahman said the congress decided not 
to admit any nonpalestinian reporters and foreign reporters were 
not allowed in the vicinity of the tunis congress hall where the 
meeting was held 
several palestinian reporters were allowed into the meeting but

delegates were in tunis on friday but that others were arriving 
from many parts of the world

lawyers for the state of vermont said 
friday that they are appealing a federal judges ruling that a 
70yearold state supreme court justice cannot be forced to retire 
because of his age 
lawyers for the state of vermont on friday filed a notice in 
us district court in rutland that the case was being appealed to 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals based in new york 
at issue is whether a federal law prohibiting age discrimination 
applies to appointed state judges us district judge lee 
gagliardi ruled last month that it does and struck down a state 
order that justice louis peck retire 
his ruling in effect nullified a section of the vermont 
constitution that requires all judges to retire at age 70 peck 
turned 70 last december but refused to retire and filed suit when 
the state ordered that he do so 
lawyer william gray representing the state said he filed a 
notice in us district court in rutland that the state was 
appealing to the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york 
the decision by the district court is inconsistent with other 
rulings on the question and we feel it appropriate that the issue 
be addressed by the 2nd circuit he said 
even though peck won in the first round he said he welcomed the 
appeal i think it is fair to say that both sides want this to go 
as high as it can said the justice one of five on vermonts 
only appeals court 
the higher it goes the greater an impact it will have peck 
said what we really hope is that the us supreme court will 
agree to hear this so that we can finally settle the question once 
and for all 
gagliardis ruling within the territory covered by the 2nd 
circuit conflicts with rulings by a federal judge in massachusetts 
and the 1st us circuit court of appeals which said the federal 
law prohibiting discrimination does not apply to appointed state 
judges 
we believe that the confusion coming out of these cases may 
make it more attractive for the us supreme court to agree to 
hear this said peck 
the disagreement is whether the federal age discrimination in 
employment act supersedes state mandatory retirement provisions for 
judges the law prohibits age discrimination but excludes certain 
groups from the provision 
the equal employment opportunity commission which represents 
peck argues that judges dont fall under any of the exceptions 
gray argues that judges fall under the exception granted for 
policymakers and that the constitution requires congress to state 
its intention clearly when it wants to regulate qualifications for 
such important state offices as judges 
i expect our brief will address both the interpretation of the 
statute and the constitutional implications gray said 
if the ruling stands under appeal peck can remain on the 
supreme court until his term expires in three years he could also 
seek another sixyear term

antiapartheid church leaders 
said friday they will play a leading role in a mass defiance 
campaign that is likely to intensify in the days leading up to 
segregated elections sept 6 
the defiance campaign expresses the will of the majority of 
our population whilst the elections will reflect the concerns of a 
very small proportion of south africans the rev allan boesak 
said on behalf of the south african council of churches 
south africas tricameral parliament has separate houses for the 
5 million whites 3 million people of mixed race and a million 
asians but excludes the 28 millionmember black majority 
protests began wednesday when 270 blacks and indians sought and 
received treatment at segregated white hospitals there were no 
incidents despite government warnings the campaign will lead to 
violence 
the council of churches which includes almost all leading 
protestant denominations said future protests will be initiated 
by the church others will be supported by the church 
churchmen said the new protests will be launched later this 
month but declined details 
its supporters hope the defiance campaign will be the largest 
civil disobedience action in south africa since the 1950s it has 
been organized by the mass democratic movement a loose coalition 
replacing the united democratic front which was the countrys 
largest antiapartheid federation when it was banned last year 
police made no attempt to confront protesters on wednesday 
authorities have not said how they will respond in the future 
though law and order minister adriaan vlok said such activities 
are a timebomb that could explode at any moment 
election campaigns in recent years have been marked by numerous 
bombings and there have been several attacks in the past two weeks 
in johannesburg and cape town the only fatality has been a man 
planting a bomb that exploded on a johannesburg railroad line 
several other people have been wounded 
no one has claimed responsibility but police blame the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement which has called for 
a boycott of the mixedrace and asian elections 
also friday the church leaders condemned 16 british cricket 
players who have agreed to tour south africa in 1990 and 1991 
i think it is an obscenity for them to come to south africa at 
this stage of our crisis said anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
white south african sports officials have hailed the tour as a 
major breakthrough in the international sports boycot imposed to 
protest pretorias legal policy of race discrimination

friday before the two sides ended a weeklong talk in new delhi 
aimed at finding ways to make india withdraw its troops 
at this moment i can say that the talks went on well sri 
lankan high commissioner or ambassador sspp kalpage said 
there are proposals and counterproposals and also there are ifs 
and buts kalpage said in new delhi the indian capital 
but sri lankian foreign ministry sources in colombo said india 
agreed to withdraw 1500 troops a week provided the main tamil 
guerrilla group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam observed a 
ceasefire and that no indians are attacked 
the withdrawal also was conditional on sri lanka agreeing to 
give more powers to the tamil adminstration in the north and east 
of sri lanka where tamils are a majority 
indian government officials in new delhi were not available for 
comment on the proposal india has said that a hasty withdrawal 
could cause even more bloodshed 
sinhaleselanguage posters signed by the guerrillas of the 
sinhalese peoples liberation front warned businesses to close 
friday to protest the killing of 150 people by security forces a 
week ago 
police and witnesses said the daylong strike appeared to be 
successful as the usuallybustling capital was deserted shops and 
offices were closed and vehicles stayed off the street 
at least 150 people were killed july 28 when supporters of the 
radicals defied a nationwide curfew and demonstrated against the 
continued presence of indian troops sinhalese radicals also oppose 
the autonomy plan for tamils 
the government had said curfew violators would be shot on sight 
to prevent what it calls a campaign of terror by the militants the 
curfew remains in effect from dusk to dawn

indian officials in new delhi speaking on condition of anonymity 
some civilians were also killed they said

killings and a series of crippling strikes since the start of an 
antigovernment uprising two years ago 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the 6yearold tamil insurgency 
india became involved in the peace plan because of pressures 
from its own 60 million tamils who are sympathetic to the rebel 
cause 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983 claiming 
they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population and control the government and the

fast forward 130 years to 1984 the ryukyu america historical 
research society an okinawa civic organization comes to 
washington to see the famous ryukyu stone and discovers it isnt 
there 
now it is the first friday in august 1989 the temperature is 94 
degrees almost too hot even for tourists at a ceremony on the 
south side of the monument a replacement stone is unveiled by two 
of 10 students who came from okinawa for the occasion 
this is a very important day for okinawa says yukiko koja 
one of the student delegates this stone is important because it 
symbolizes our long friendship with the united states of america

todays happiness can be compared with the blossoming of a flower 
when touched by dew 
retired us navy capt roger pineau who organized perrys 
papers in the 1960s tells the gathering that the last mention of 
the original stone was when it was transferred in hong kong when 
perry received the stone from the okinawan people he said there 
also was a bill for 80 embarrassed okinawan officials pineau 
said apparently said they would take care of it 
the new stone measures two feet by four feet by three inches and 
weighs 396 pounds part of it was hollowed out for 53 pebbles from 
nine okinawa cities and 44 villages it will be the 193rd 
commemorative stone in the monument only 15 of them from foreign 
countries 
it will be placed at the 310foot level where the only people 
who will see it are those who make arrangements to go down the 
stairs of the 555foot monument 
as for the gokokuji bell it was never put in the monument 
instead it was on display at the us naval academy in annapolis 
md until 1986 when it was returned to the people of okinawa as a 
gesture of good will

communist party membership dropped by 
35000 in the first half of 1989 and the party has lost more than 1 
million members in the last decade a leading party weekly reported 
the article in the saturday edition of polityka also pointed out 
that nearly onefifth of party members are retirees and that 
workers are a minority in the party whose formal name is the 
polish united workers party 
party membership stands just below 21 million compared to 315 
million in 1980 the article said and most members occupy 
management posts 
the article noted that the communist coalition received only 
about 25 percent of the vote for the freely elected senate in june 
so it is a minority though a significant minority 
this year 42000 members left the party while only 7000 
joined among those who left 11500 quit 8800 were dropped from 
party rolls for showing lack of interest in party life 8000 
changed jobs and did not reregister with the party at their new 
workplaces and 1300 emigrated 
the article did not specify what accounted for the remaining 
drop 
the article quoted party documents as estimating only onefourth 
of the party membership is active 60 percent do not meet the 
partys rules for minimum participation and the remainder is 
generally passive 
about onethird of the party membership thinks other political 
groups do more to aid societys interests than the party does and 
about the same number do not believe it will be able to work out a 
program that will keep it in power past 1993 the article said 
under this years accords fully democratic elections are to be 
held that year 
the article said retirees now account for a record 176 percent 
of the membership and the average age of a party member is 46 
compared to 40 in 1980 
although it claims to be the party of the working class only 
375 percent of the party are workers compared with 521 percent 
who are in the intelligentsia which refers to professions 
requiring higher education such as managers teachers professors 
journalists doctors and lawyers the rest are in agriculture

the acting head of the department of housing 
and urban developments new york regional office is being 
transferred to agency headquarters pending the outcome of three 
investigations of her conduct a department official said friday 
geraldine mcgann was told to report to washington effective 
monday and will be assigned to nonmanagerial duties in the 
departments office of housing said the official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
housing secretary jack kemp last month placed mcgann on 
administrative leave from her 68500ayear job because of 
questions about her role in awarding federal subsidies to housing 
in island park a small beachfront village that is home to sen 
alfonse damato rny 
mcgann who in addition to her hud job served as a village 
trustee and other island park officials have been accused of 
rigging the distribution of hudsubsidized houses in the early 
1980s ensuring that they went to politically connected townspeople 
instead of minorities as the program intended 
mcganns son purchased one of the houses although he did not 
qualify under hud guidelines according to a 1984 investigation by 
huds inspector general a cousin of damatos also bought one of 
the houses although the senator maintains that he played no role 
and that the man was qualified 
mcgann has also been accused of voting on hudrelated matters 
before the town board she has denied casting such votes but the 
former town clerk recently said he was ordered to alter minutes to 
show mcgann had abstained 
her conduct is being investigated by huds inspector general 
the us attorneys office in new york and the nassau county 
district attorney hud general counsel frank keating wrote to us 
attorney andrew j maloney on thursday asking for a quick 
resolution of the investigation and information about its scope 
we are anxious to resolve her status as an employee but 
obviously cannot do so as long as your investigation is under 
way keating said in the letter a copy of which was obtained by 
the associated press 
kemp last month prohibited hud managers from serving on 
government boards and said all hud employees will be barred from 
serving on government or other panels that could have hudrelated 
dealings or benefit from agency programs 
mcgann was told she will be reassigned to washington for up to 
120 days the official said the department had to make the move 
because it can put an employee on administrative leave for only 30 
days she is the highestranking hud official to be affected in a 
number of recent personnel moves related to the investigations of 
abuse influencepeddling and mismanagement 
hud has initiated the process of firing three former officials 
at its washington field office including the offices former head 
because of alleged mismanagement the head of the richmond va 
field office also was recently reassigned to nonmanagerial duties 
as acting head of the new york regional office mcgann was 
repsonsible for hud programs and officials in new york new jersey 
the us virgin islands and puerto rico

final autopsy results friday failed to 
explain the death of an aviation officer candidate from wisconsin 
during an abandonship drill in a training pool a navy spokesman 
said 
michael fedie 22 of altoona wis died of a seizure 
disorder of unknown cause accompanied by acute cerebral edema 
said cmdr dennis hessler of the naval education and training 
command which has its headquarters at pensacola naval air station 
the autopsy found no indication of trauma preexisting 
disease or congenital abnormalities and no evidence of 
hemorrhage hessler said although inconclusive the autopsy was 
still valuable because it did exclude those possible causes he 
said 
hessler also said the autopsy by the armed services institute of 
pathology in washington dc did not change a preliminary finding 
that no wrongdoing is indicated in the june 23 death 
that was not the case in the death last year of another 
wisconsin trainee also in a pensacola training pool five enlisted 
instructors were punished including one sentenced to 90 days in 
the brig for negligent homicide and an officer was reprimanded for 
the march 2 1988 death of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of 
appleton wis 
mirecki was undergoing rescueswimmer training when he panicked 
during a strenuous rescue drill climbed from the pool and shouted 
that he was quitting courtmartial testimony indicated he had an 
unusual fear of being pushed under water and suffered heart failure 
and drowned after instructors pushed him back in the pool and held 
his head under water 
the death of fedie drew unusual attention because of the 
previous mirecki investigation which was pressed by mireckis 
congressman after complaints were raised by his family about the 
navys handling of the case 
fedie died during a different type of drill one in which 
aviation trainees jump off a 12foot tower and swim about 15 yards 
under water while wearing their flight suits most sailors go 
through similar drills during basic training 
fedie completed the exercise and was walking from the pool when 
he collapsed back into shallow water witnesses said medical 
examiners said there was little doubt of a seizure but they were 
uncertain whether it was triggered by the central nervous or 
cardiovascular systems hessler said

the governments concessions to improve living and 
working conditions for hundreds of thousands of coal miners will 
cost more than 3 billion premier nikolai i ryzhkov said friday 
ryzhkov told official media that coming up with that sum will be 
difficult for the financially strapped government and cautioned 
other workers not to expect the same concessions if they walk off 
their jobs 
the package of financial measures is not an easy one and it 
will require mobilization of the financial and material resources 
of the country ryzhkov said in an interview on staterun 
television 
if we follow the road of strikes no one will benefit from it 
and lowpaid sections of the population will be hit first the 
official tass news agency quoted him as saying one should 
understand that if others follow the miners example the country 
may find itself in a most difficult situation 
the current package will cost 2 billion rubles 32 billion 
previous estimates of the cost of the package ranged up to 5 
billion rubles 8 billion 
ryzhkov said the government had put together a series of 
measures many of which were submitted to the supreme soviet 
legislature which ended its first session friday 
the legislature presumably will be able to approve those 
measures only when it resumes its work sept 25 
hundreds of thousands of miners in siberia and the ukraine 
walked off their jobs in july in frustration over poor living and 
working conditions 
they returned to work after the government promised improvements 
miners of 17 mines in the kuznetsk coal region of western 
siberia went on strike for two hours thursday because they said the 
government was not living up to its pledge to halt the operation of 
a hydroelectric station they say is harming the environment

two more politicians of the governing liberal 
democratic party declared their candidacies friday in next weeks 
election to choose japans new prime minister throwing open what 
once looked like a walkover election 
former welfare minister yoshiro hayashi 62 and former 
transport minister shintaro ishihara 56 a prominent author said 
they will seek the party presidency in tuesdays balloting 
until friday former education minister toshiki kaifu 58 had 
been considered a shooin for the job 
the party president is assured of becoming prime minister 
because of the liberal democrats large majority in the lower house 
of parliament which selects the prime minister 
the winner tuesday will be japans third prime minister since 
june 
the party has been crippled by an unpopular new sales tax and 
money and sex scandals noboru takeshita was forced to resign in 
june sousuke uno announced he would resign after only two months 
in office following july 23 elections in which the liberal 
democrats lost their majority in the upper chamber for the first 
time since the partys formation in 1955 
our party must reform itself radically and reform politics 
with an eye toward the future hayashi told a news conference 
late friday i am determined to devote myself entirely to the 
task 
ishihara also called for party reforms and said politics do 
not exist for politicians but for the country if we leave the 
situation as it is now factionalism and power politics will 
continue to prevail 
uno asked party members on friday to refrain from factionalism 
in the presidential race 
half a dozen major factions in the party are separated more by 
personal and financial allegiances than their conservative 
political leanings 
the large faction led by former finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
decided on friday to support hayashi who belongs to one of the 
partys smallest groups 
seiichi ohta a leading member of the miyazawa faction branded 
kaifus candidacy a product of back room deals involving large 
factions 
it will disappoint the public he said 
analysts said kaifu remains the frontrunner because of strong 
backing from factions led by former prime minister noboru takeshita 
and former foreign minister shintaro abe 
the partys popular no 2 official ryutaro hashimoto 52 
formally declined to run friday saying his candidacy would further 
split the party 
former defense agency head ganri yamashita 68 had said he 
would run but had to drop out friday when he failed to draw enough 
support from party members to become a candidate he said he and 
his supporters would back hayashi

a parliament committee proposed friday 
that a minister of the former socialist government be charged with 
complicity in an agricultural fraud that cheated the european 
economic community 
the 12member committee investigated whether nikos 
athanassopoulos former deputy finance minister was involved in 
the alleged forgery of harbor logs and customs invoices to show 
that 9000 tons of yugoslav maize sold to the community in 1986 was 
from greece an eec member 
in may the european court issued a ruling against greece 
citing lost revenues to the eec of 116 million the sentence is 
expected to be announced later this year 
athanassios tsaldaris speaker of parliament said floor debate 
on the committees proposal would take place late this month 
after inconclusive elections in june communists and 
conservatives formed a coalition government to prosecute those 
involved in several financial scandals that arose during the 
socialist administration of former premier andreas papandreou 
they said the coalition probably would stay in office only about 
three months 
the committee report indicated athanassopoulos had tried to 
cover up for whoever was behind the scheme which defrauded the eec 
of import duties on the maize and caused it to pay subsidies for 
produce from a nonmember nation 
all five socialist members of committee voted against the 
proposal which was supported by the six members from the 
conservative new democracy party and the single deputy from the 
coalition of the left and progress which is dominated by the 
communist party 
new democracy has claimed the 116 million obtained by the 
staterun itco trading company in the fraud is missing the 
socialist party denies it

prime minister yitzhak shamir expressed hope 
friday that the hostage crisis can be ended when proiranian 
radicals provide specifics of their demands 
he defended the action that precipitated the crisis israels 
abduction of a spiritual leader of hezbollah an iraniansponsored 
shiite moslem group believed responsible for the kidnappings of 
westerners in lebanon 
shamir said israel had the right to act on its own to rescue its 
captured soldiers whether the rest of the world agrees or not 
israel has offered to trade sheik abdul karim obeid and other 
lebanese shiite prisoners for three israeli soldiers and western 
hostages held in lebanon 
the prime minister and other top officials consulted on a 
response to the revolutionary justice organization which suspended 
its plans to kill an american hostage thursday night and made new 
demands on israel 
he said israel was waiting for proposals from the captors of 
joseph cicippio who issued a statement saying they would provide a 
list of palestinian and lebanese prisoners to be released 
we hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of 
the crisis shamir said 
israel radio said israeli leaders had hoped to receive a 
response within hours but now are convinced it will take much 
longer 
a prisoners exchange with hezbollah is a complicated affair 
and it would last for a long time before a solution is found it 
quoted finance minister shimon peres as saying 
on monday three days after commandos abducted obeid from his 
home in south lebanon a group of kidnappers calling themselves the 
organization of the oppressed on earth said they had hanged lt col 
william r higgins in retaliation 
they released a poorquality videotape of a man who appeared to 
be the us marine colonel hanging from a gallows but there was no 
way of knowing when the tape was made some reports have said 
higgins kidnapped in february 1988 while on un duty in south 
lebanon had been killed months ago 
hashemi rafsanjani irans new president was quoted as saying 
friday the first step toward ending the crisis would be for the 
united states to ask israel to free obeid israel claims obeid 
planned guerrilla attacks against it and directed higgins 
kidnapping 
israeli analysts said the developments indicate a willingness by 
shiite radicals to consider releasing hostages and that vindicates 
israels decision to kidnap obeid 
israel put the issue of hostages back on the international 
agenda said shlomo avineri a former foreign ministry 
directorgeneral 
until the current crisis the west accepted people being 
captured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be done 
about it he said 
shlomo gazit a former military intelligence chief said the 
abduction triggered a new willingness by hezbollah to consider 
trading hostages 
without it nothing would have happened and all the existing 
hostages would be in the same hopeless situation as before gazit 
said it also put the israeli hostages on the agenda and that was 
the exact purpose 
a government official said privately he doubted israel would 
free obeid without something in return and did not believe the 
united states would ask that 
if its only freeing obeid what do the americans get out of 
it what do we get out of it he said 
the statement from cicippios kidnappers repeated obeid must be 
released and added the demand for a number of palestinians and 
lebanese it did not say what would happen to cicippio if the 
israelis refuse 
more than 8000 palestinians have been jailed since an uprising 
against israeli occupation began 20 months ago in the west bank and 
gaza strip israel also has more than 60 lebanese shiite prisoners 
and its allied militiamen in south lebanon are believed to hold 300 
more 
while israel has proposed an exchange of shiite captives for the 
israeli soldiers and 16 western hostages eight of them americans 
israeli officials continue emphasizing that the first objective is 
freeing the soldiers 
on israel radio shamir was quoted as saying he believed 
negotiations on freeing the soldiers were closer asked about 
freedom for the foreigners he replied if it will happen we will 
be very happy 
the radio quoted officials as saying israel would leave it to 
the united states to ensure the safety of the american and other 
hostages 
in his defense of obeids abduction shamir said in a speech to 
the united jewish appeal that jewish tradition requires israels 
unrelenting efforts to free its captured soldiers 
we have no alternative but to apply pressure on the most 
sensitive nerves of those holding them 
of course we would prefer to have the civilized world 
participating actively with us the prime minister said in any 
case we will stay our course

the environmental protection agency on friday 
banned household ant killers containing the chemical sodium 
arsenate because of the danger of small children ingesting the 
compounds 
the epa said the chemical is used to kill ants that are merely a 
nuisance and do not threaten human health food crops or wood 
structures 
epa spokesman ed heier said the product is a surgary liquid made 
by several companies and sold under numerous brand names he said 
that because the purchaser normally applies the ant killer and 
leaves it exposed it is not childproof 
most often the epa said the compound is applied to carboard 
wax paper bottle caps or food to attract ants 
the epas ronald mccallum who wrote the order banning the 
pesticide said that manufacturers of such compounds have failed to 
show that the benefits of continued use of open sodium arsenate 
baits to control household ants justifies the risks to human health 
associated with the baits particularly the risk to small 
children 
in other action the epa said it had reached agreement with the 
international paper co in a case involving violatios of federal 
clean air requirements at the companys androscoggin mill in jay 
maine 
the settlement part of a consent decree calls for the company 
to pay a 900000 fine for air pollution and begin a program to 
reduce emissions from the plant 
the agreement involved federal and state environmental officials 
and the paper company 
the epa also announced a proposed 253200 fine against monsanto 
co for its failure to promptly report to the epa test results on 
a new chemical even though the tests indicated the chemical may 
pose a risk to public health 
the agency said the test results were provided the epa five 
years late 
monsanto may appeal the proposed fine and request a formal 
hearing officials said 
the chemical is called santogard pvi and is used in the 
processing of natural and synthetic products

the financially plagued denver symphony orchestra 
is making plans to play this season after all thanks to a survival 
plan approved friday that includes shortening the season by half 
and cutting musicians salaries 
the final two months of last season were canceled because of 
lack of money and observers had thought the odds were good the 
upcoming season would be canceled outright 
terms of the plan approved by the orchestras board include 
negotiating pay cuts and concessions from its 81 musicians 
cutbacks in staff and operating costs and winning writeoffs of 
32 million of the symphonys 4 million debt 
the 198990 symphony season which usually lasts 41 weeks and 
begins in september was pruned to 21 weeks and will begin jan 21 
1990 the board approved a 35 million budget for the limited 
season down from last seasons 73 million 
although we regret the need to shorten the season we feel 
this is the financially prudent way to proceed said denver 
symphony association board chairman john low 
he said that the season could still be canceled if the 
orchestras creditors refuse to forgive the debts 
i want to emphasize i am optimistic about getting that debt 
forgiven he said but if the goal of 32 million in forgiven 
debts is not reached he said were going to have to look very 
hard at what that does to our ability to proceed 
among the debts is 700000 owed to the city for back rent for 
boettcher hall some city council members have said they would 
oppose any debt forgiveness 
earlier in the summer the board rejected a proposed 27week 
season that was to have begun in november citing the unresolved 4 
million debt and the fact that musicians had not agreed to contract 
concessions 
earlier this week the symphony notified its musicians that 
their health and dental benefits were canceled saving the 
association about 30000 a month three years ago the musicians 
agreed to 20 percent pay cuts to keep the symphony solvent 
the symphonys financial problems have been blamed on denvers 
recession the citys 10 percent seat tax continual turnover in 
management and the 600000amonth cash flow needed to operate the 
symphony

just weeks before the mayoral primary a former 
top aide to mayor edward i koch has been indicted on charges he 
lied when he denied that a city agency he ran was really a 
patronage mill a prosecutor said friday 
joseph devincenzo 46 indicted on 11 counts of perjury ran the 
citys talent bank set up ostensibly to recruit women and 
minorities to fill city posts critics said the agency was really 
used to handle patronage requests and doled out the highest paying 
jobs to whites 
the indictment said devincenzo lied when he told the state 
commission on government integrity at a public hearing that 
politically connected job applicants were not given preference for 
city government posts other witnesses contradicted this 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky who announced the 
indictment noted at a news conference that patronage is not 
illegal and said there was no underlying crime in the case 
but he said the grand jury found that devincenzo committed 
perjury by lying to cover up his patronage dealings at commission 
hearings on july 13 and 21 last year and jan 11 this year 
the indictment was filed thursday cherkasky said devincenzo 
pleaded innocent at his arraignment and was released on his own 
recognizance a hearing was scheduled for aug 11 
the indictment comes less than six weeks before the primary 
election in which koch is seeking the democratic nomination for an 
unprecedented fourth term his opponents sought to capitalize on 
the indictment but koch declared i dont think it does anything 
to my campaign theres nothing to hide here 
the koch administration has been shaken by several scandals 
particularly since his election to a third term in november 1985 
six of the mayors appointees have been jailed and about 200 
lowerlevel city employees have been convicted of various crimes 
the scandals have ranged from the serious kickbacks from 
collection agencies hired by the parking violations bureau to the 
trivial the chef at the mayoral gracie mansion used city 
equipment for his catering business bess myerson a city 
commissioner was acquitted of charges she tried to fix her 
boyfriends divorce case 
speaking about the job bank case koch said friday that compared 
with patronage at the state capital in albany and in washington 
the use of patronage in his administration is piddling and

but koch said lying to the commission is simply unacceptable 
and that he would have counseled devincenzo to tell the truth 
some witnesses testified to the commission that files at the 
talent bank were sometimes marked with color codes indicating a 
political sponsor might have referred an applicant to devincenzo 
his own assistant james g hein testified that devincenzo had 
ordered him in february 1986 to cleanse the computer and paper

ensuring his pension of 52000 a year

could not hear

archbishop chrysostomos of cyprus on 
friday hailed a us court decision restoring looted mosaics to his 
church as opening the way for the recovery of stolen archaelogical 
treasures worldwide 
we are overjoyed by the decision of the american court said 
chrysostomos head of the greek orthodox church in cyprus 
this encourages us to seek the recovery of other looted 
treasures because it will discourage international art merchants 
who deal in such stolen property he said in an interview 
us district judge james e noland in indiana ruled thursday 
that four 6thcentury mosaics purchased by an indianapolis art 
dealer were the property of the cyprus church and should be 
returned to it 
but attorneys for both sides were unable to reach an agreement 
on when the artwork would be released and they were back before 
noland in indianapolis late friday afternoon 
in his ruling thursday noland said dealer peg goldberg never 
obtained title to the mosaics which she bought last summer in 
switzerland 
the ruling did not address damages custody or transfer of the 
mosaics which remained locked in an indianapolis vault while 
attorneys negotiated for their release 
the mosaics depict the virgin mary jesus christ and the 
apostles they were removed from the walls of the church of the 
virgin of kanakaria in the village of lythrangomi in north cyprus 
which has been under turkish occupation since 1974 
ms goldberg of suburban indianapolis bought the mosaics from 
a turkish middleman aydin dikmen for 11 million and offered 
them for sale to the paul getty museum in california for 20 
million 
the cyprus government has accused turkish authorities and the 
breakaway turkish cypriot state in north cyprus of allowing the 
systematic looting of churches and rich archaelogical sites to 
eradicate the christian and greek cultural heritage of the island 
going back more than three thousand years 
the cyprus church and the cyprus government sued for the 
recovery of the mosaics when informed by the getty museum of the 
development 
the indiana court decision had been awaited eagerly by 
international art circles as a precedent for the recovery of looted 
artifacts worldwide 
on the basis of this decision we shall now proceed to demand 
the return of numerous other ecclesiastical treasures looted from 
churches and monasteries in the turkishoccupied region 
chrysostomos said 
cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since a turkish 
invasion in 1974 the breakaway state established in north cyprus 
in 1985 which is only recognized by turkey argued unsuccessfully 
in the indiana court that the mosaics should be returned to it

president bush vowed friday to explore to 
the fullest an overture by irans new leader to help resolve the 
hostage crisis while decrying the brutal process the hostages 
and their families are undergoing 
i dont want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment but theres 
reason to be somewhat encouraged bush said when asked about 
comments by iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
rafsanjani said there were prudent solutions to the hostage 
situation and offered to help find them while bush voiced guarded 
optimism his chief spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are 
always skeptical of what we hear from iran 
fitzwater said that while no efforts had been made by the 
president or other top us officials to deal with iranian 
officials directly information was being exchanged with that 
countrys leaders on the situation through thirdcountry 
intermediaries 
meanwhile the president and his aides sought to play down talk 
of a possible military strike against targets in lebanon if another 
us hostage were killed 
if i had made such a decision i expect this would be the last 
place id be talking about it bush said speaking with reporters 
during a picturetaking session in the oval office 
fitzwater meanwhile denied that bush had selected specific 
targets in lebanon for an air strike if kidnappers had carried out 
a threat to kill american hostage joseph cicippio 
i will say he did not make final decisions fitzwater said 
referring to a story in fridays new york times that bush was 
prepared to order the sixth fleet to launch air strikes against 
suspected terrorist strongholds including a base in eastern 
lebanon 
it does not help the united states government or the united 
states to be discussing military tactics to be flexing our 
muscles in public fitzwater said we do not believe its in 
the best interests of releasing the hostages 
a day after cicippios captors said they had spared him at 
least for the present bush said he was certainly pleased that 
that brutal murder that had been threatened had been set aside 
on rafsanjanis offer to help bush said when you see a 
statement that offers hope for the return of our hostages i want 
to explore it to the fullest iran is thought to have strong 
influence over shiite moslem militants holding americans captive 
bush continued im encouraged but i dont want to get the 
hopes of the hostages loved ones up once again to have those 
hopes dashed this is a brutal process where you see people 
paraded before cameras and their families get their hopes up 
bush called the head of the genevabased international red 
cross cornelio sommaruga to voice support for that humanitarian 
agencys efforts to win freedom for the hostages according to 
fitzwater 
he bush wanted him to know we appreciated their efforts we 
hope theyre successful said fitzwater the united states is 
willing to be of any help we can 
efforts by the red cross were alluded to in rafsanjanis 
statement fitzwater noted 
he said the united states would stand firmly behind its vow not 
to negotiate for the release of hostages we have our policy and 
thats what we follow he said 
rafsanjani made his comments during a prayer sermon at tehran 
university broadcast on tehran radio while warning against us 
bullyings arrogant speeches and tyranny rafsanjani said 
come let us approach the problem reasonably 
i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has solutions 
the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable prudent 
solutions 
however rafsanjanis offer appeared conditional he urged the 
united states to take the initiative by pressuring israel to 
release the shiite moslem cleric it abducted a week ago sheik 
abdul karim obeid 
the kidnapping triggered the apparent execution of lt col 
william r higgins and the death threat against cicippio 
although officials have said the united states would not seek to 
dictate hostage policy to israel bush on friday reiterated an 
appeal he first made monday night for all countries holding 
hostages to release them 
i would just appeal to the civilized world or any country 
anywhere in the world to lay aside this holding of people against 
their will hostages and do what is right and decent and 
honorable in terms of the release of those hostages that are still 
held the president said 
bush who white house aides said had called more than a dozen 
world leaders over the past few days in an effort to bring pressure 
on the kidnappers cited a very extraordinarily broad exercise of 
diplomacy here in the last couple of days 
fitzwater later said diplomatic contacts were continuing 
there are still a lot of people talking to a lot of people in the 
region about how to get the hostages out he said 
he also said that weve had high level and continuing talks 
with israel even though the president himself hasnt talked 
directly with israeli leaders 
bush was asked if cicippio deserved the full backing of the 
united states in view of the fact that he ignored us warnings to 
leave lebanon 
that doesnt mean we wash our hands of it bush said hes 
an american and he is entitled to the concern of the president and 
every one of these senators and everybody in our administration 
and hes got a great big wonderful family up there that are 
eating their hearts out in norristown pa 
bush said he had not talked with members of the cicippio family 
but the state department has been in daily contact with them

a group of adoptees birth mothers and 
adoptive parents wound up a 250mile march from new york to the 
nations capital friday pressing for the unsealing of confidential 
birth records 
but the president of another adoption group disagreed with their 
point saying people have a right to privacy 
forty members of the american adoption congress ended the 
2week trek by rallying in front of the district of columbias 
office of vital records while five members went inside to request 
original birth certificates 
the three birth mothers and two adoptees were turned down as 
other members of the group had been in new york philadelphia and 
baltimore after they spoke to dc registrar jack crandall 
crandall an adoptive father himself explained i have the 
old nothing answer i guess because its the law the law says 
that when a person is adopted we create a new birth certificate 
and the old certificate is under seal and can only be opened by 
order of the court 
birth mothers told of the pain of giving up their infants and 
then struggling to find them years later 
its understood that youre giving him up to people who are so 
much better and you dont have any rights at all said laura 
lewis 39 of suburban maryland 
adopted children spoke of their frustrations in trying to trace 
their blood roots while being denied access to original birth 
records including medical histories 
ive just been diagnosed as hypoglycemic said jannine 
sutherland 42 of gaithersburg md and i want to know does 
diabetes run in my family 
but william pierce president of the national committee for 
adoption which represents 141 adoption agencies and 2000 
individuals said in a telephone interview the courts have said 
rather clearly that a persons right to privacy is greater than 
the right to the information 
adoption congress president kate burke said if a birth mother 
doesnt want to be found all she has to say is i dont want a 
relationship when her child contacts her 
pierce said he favored a middleoftheroad compromise 
there should be a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to 
get together if they both want to he said describing a mutual 
consent arrangement in 22 states that allows birth mothers and 
their adult children to meet if both register to express such a 
desire 
ten states have a system that allows adult adoptees to request a 
search for their mothers said pierce if she is located the woman 
can decide whether she wants to meet the child 
three states alaska alabama and kansas open records once an 
adoptee reaches age 18 and the remainder of the states have sealed 
records pierce said

seven people were indicted friday on money 
laundering charges stemming from a nationwide irs investigation 
that has already netted 19 convictions including that of former 
rep pat swindall of georgia 
the seven men are charged with laundering money they were told 
was the profit of a south florida drug trafficker the cash 
actually was supplied by an undercover irs agent according to the 
indictment 
the money laundering investigation has been under way since 1987 
and has so far resulted in 19 convictions in baltimore atlanta 
tulsa okla dallas and san juan puerto rico the irs said in a 
statement 
former rep robert hanrahan rill has pleaded guilty to 
violating currency laws and last month swindall was convicted of 
10 counts of lying to a grand jury about his involvement in the 
scheme 
the irs sting also has nabbed attorneys bankers and a former 
nixon aide 
according to fridays indictment the seven massachussets and 
connecticut men tried to circumvent federal laws that require banks 
to report cash transactions of more than 10000 dividing up money 
into smaller sums exchanging cash for checks which they swapped 
amongst themselves and buying insurance annuitites under fake 
names 
charges against them include conspiracy to defraud the 
government of over 1 million lying to the government and filing 
false currency reports 
indicted were peter e knox 42 of littleton edmond p 
lafrance 44 of stoneham richard a lafrance 51 of acton 
alfred g maroun 57 of boston donald j mackinnon jr 55 of 
boston william h oleary sr 65 of westwood and frank s 
sottile 60 of simsbury ct 
two massachusetts businesses were also charged maroun brothers 
inc a food distributor in lawrence and fdm corp doing business 
as barnabys restaurant in littleton 
reached at his business friday maroun said the indictments came 
as a total surprise 
he said he did not know any of the other defendants and had 
never met charles lechasney an informant who has figured in 
several of the cases 
this is sort of a very odd situation he said referring 
other questions to his attorney 
richard lafrance said federal investigators had asked to examine 
his books about a year and a half ago they didnt really ask 
anything they just took the records and left he said 
the other defendants could not be reached for comment knox and 
oleary were not listed in the telephone directory edmond lafrance 
and mackinnon did not return telephone calls to their homes and 
calls to sottiles home went unanswered 
prosecutor patrick walsh a special attorney with the department 
of justice in washington said edmond lafrance was arrested but 
has not yet entered a plea the others face arraignment next week 
he said 
walsh said the investigation in each city has relied on the same 
undercover irs agent posing as a front man for drug dealers and 
the same confidential informant 
an admitted con man convicted of money laundering lechasney 
testified in june against swindall and also figured in the case 
against robert c schultz a washington banker prosecutors said 
schultz advised lechasney and hanrahan on how to set up bank 
accounts to shield money laundering activities schultz pleaded 
guilty and is to be sentenced sept 20 
walsh would not comment on whether any of the new england men 
also had dealings with lechasney 
the indictment alleges that the defendants received commissions 
of 6 percent to 8 percent on the money they laundered and filtered 
the money through more than a dozen massachusetts and connecticut 
banks

mayor tom bradley has missed a deadline to 
correct what state officials said were four years worth of 
omissions in his financial disclosure statements according to a 
published report 
the state fair political practices commission told the mayor 
whose financial dealings are under investigation by state local 
and federal officials in a june 23 letter to provide the 
information within 20 days the los angeles herald examiner 
reported friday 
among the information requested were exact dates and details 
involving stock transactions with which the fiveterm mayor was 
involved 
the commission first asked bradley to amend his financial 
disclosure forms in may 
they keep saying soon commission spokeswoman sandra 
michioku said of the delay by bradleys people 
mark fabiani one of bradleys attorneys said amending the 
financial statements has taken longer than was expected he said 
the commission would have the forms by next friday 
we have simply been trying to reconstruct the last four years 
of the mayors financial life and that has involved a search for 
original source material including account and bank statements 
fabiani said 
bradley has scheduled a meeting of close political advisers 
saturday at his hancock park home to discuss the mounting legal 
bills he faces as a result of the various probes 
fabiani said the group would look into ways of raising money for 
the newly formed bradley officeholder committee which could use 
the funds it collects to pay bradleys legal bills

shrimpers could abandon turtle excluder 
devices in favor of limited trawls to keep endangered sea turtles 
from drowning in their nets under proposed temporary commerce 
department regulations completed friday and scheduled to take 
effect tuesday 
department spokesman reed boatright said secretary robert a 
mosbacher finished the proposal friday and would submit the plan 
limiting trawl times to 105 minutes to us district court judge 
thomas hogan on monday 
in a court hearing thursday hogan gave mosbacher until monday 
to draft a plan to protect endangered sea turtles from becoming 
entangled in shrimpers nets 
environmentalists however said friday that the kemps ridley 
sea turtle faces quick extinction if the government abandons turtle 
excluder devices in favor of limited shrimpfishing trawl times 
the center for marine conservation and other organizations want 
mosbacher to require shrimpers to use turtle excluder devices 
shrimpers however say the devices reduce their catch and threaten 
their livelihood 
the centers marydele donnelly said limited trawl times 
condemn the kemps ridley sea turtle to extinction within this 
century 
a major confrontation looms ahead on sea turtle protection 
ms donnelly said secretary mosbacher needs to move swiftly to 
enforce federal environmental laws protecting endangered species 
restricted tow times unlike teds will hasten the day when sea 
turtles will no longer exist in american waters 
uhder mosbachers proposal shrimpers would have about 7 
minutes to get their nets in and 7 minutes to get them out with 
actual trawl time limited to 90 minutes boatright said 
while the commerce department contends that sea turtles can 
survive submerged for 90 minutes conservationists argue limited 
trawl times are ineffective in reducing turtle mortality and cannot 
be enforced 
the center said the governments most recent analysis found that 
one in four sea turtles will drown during a tow time of 105 minutes 
it said gulf shrimpers normally leave their nets in the water 
for two to 10 hours 
mosbacher suspended enforcement of the turtle excluder device 
regulations july 24 after shrimpers protested the law

reporters bowed in respect as japans emperor 
akihito broke with imperial tradition friday and held the thrones 
first televised news conference since 1975 
akihito seated beside empress michiko began the news 
conference by expressing gratitude to 10000 people who attended 
the state funeral and the hundreds of thousands who lined the 
streets after his father hirohito died in january at 87 
what i felt while i was in personal contact with emperor showa 
gives me i think an important guideline in what an emperor should 
be said akihito referring to hirohitos posthumous name 
hirohitos 62year reign the longest in japanese history 
covered japans disastrous war in asia and its subsequent rise to 
an economic superpower 
because of the constitutions strict ban on his exercising 
political powers akihito could not comment on the crisis facing 
japans governing conservatives plagued by money and sex scandals 
he said he would be willing to visit china and korea two 
victims of japanese aggression if the government decided it was 
appropriate he said the same for okinawa japans southernmost 
prefecture where many people remain bitter about the casualties 
and destruction they bore in the us military assault hirohito 
never visited okinawa after the war 
akihito said the daijosai an elaborate ascension rite with 
strong shinto significance should be carried out in accordance 
with the law many critics already argue that by its very nature it 
violates the constitutions ban of state involvement in religious 
affairs 
in that mystical ceremony to be held next year akihito is to 
have his first communion with the gods and then be reborn divine 
media reports have estimated it could cost as much as 70 million 
the government is studying how to conduct the rite 
reporters representing 43 japanese and 12 foreign news 
organizations attended the news conference journalists were given 
a detailed explanation of when to rise and bow and who would sit 
where in the palaces stone bridge room a large hall with japanese 
sliding paper doors and westernstyle red carpeting 
sitting behind a low table draped with gold brocade cloth 
embroidered with chrysanthemums the imperial symbol the royal 
couple spoke slowly and distinctly at times the empress wearing a 
light green dress spoke so softly her voice was drowned out by the 
clicking of cameras 
akihito also spoke in polite but common japanese unlike his 
father who often used archaic or stilted words no longer 
understood by the general public 
akihito repeatedly stressed that his proper role is to uphold 
japans postwar constitution which limits his role to that of a 
symbolic figurehead 
four of the 12 main questions all submitted weeks in advance 
and subject to government approval were about hirohito along with 
the main questions several followups were allowed but by 
predecided japanese questioners 
one imperial household agency official requested the scheduled 
time limit of 30 minutes be carefully observed because traffic 
restrictions had been set for streets on the imperial couples way 
home the conference lasted 37 minutes 
akihito is the first emperor to ascend the throne under the 
postwar constitution which limits his role to mostly ceremonial 
tasks the previous constitution gave hirohito nominal powers and 
the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name 
the constitution also omits all references to the emperors 
special relationship with the gods of shinto japans indigenous 
religion which angers some conservatives 
japans monarchy can trace its history to at least the 8th 
century and by legend until the 6th century bc and emperor 
jimmu who is said to have descended from the sun goddess 
amaterasu 
michiko rarely changing her expression of polite concentration 
said that because of her husbands heavy responsibilities she must 
make the home a place where he canfind peace and relaxation 
with his family 
the royal couple split with the past by raising their two sons 
and daughter by themselves akihito was raised by chamberlains from 
age 3 
their eldest son crown prince naruhito 29 is now seeking a 
bride and when asked about his growing independence michiko said 
it would make me happy if he would come even if only from time 
to time to play the viola for us

better market for american newspapers chilcott said 
american newspapers describing the civil war they were most 
eagerly sought after they were the ones we had the most 
competition for from the bidders he said 
the oldest newspaper in the sale the perfect diurnall of aug 
28 1648 fetched the highest price about 246 
the newspaper which reported oliver cromwells new model army 
capturing the town of colchester was produced by parliament and 
was principally a record of parliamentary debates 
the older newspapers were generally in better condition because 
the quality of modern paper is such that a newspaper exposed to 
light can turn yellow within a week 
the most modern newspapers for sale recording the falklands 
war and the wedding of prince charles and diana didnt sell 
chilcott said

president daniel ortega signed an 
accord with opposition leaders friday urging that the contra rebels 
be disbanded and he said he would press for the breakup at a 
summit of central american leaders 
i hope the us government will respect this sovereign 
decision of the nicaraguan people and change us policy toward 
nicaragua and that it puts an end to the 1985 economic 
embargo ortega said before leaving for the weekend conference in 
tela honduras 
the united states wants the rebels to stay organized until after 
nicaragua holds general elections next year 
ortega talked to reporters shortly after he signed the 
agreement worked out during 22 hours of talks between the leftist 
sandinista government and leaders from 20 opposition parties 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said in washington that the 
rebels support the same principles that were laid out in fridays 
agreement adding we are not opposed to the question of 
reintegrating ourselves into nicaragua under democratic conditions 
but those conditions have to be negotiated 
in the accord the sandinistas pledge to hold free and fair 
elections feb 25 without any restraints on campaigning or news 
censorship they promise to suspend the military draft from 
september until after the balloting to prevent it from interfering 
with electoral activity 
the sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaints 
by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in 
earlier elections their movements constrained and their exposure 
to the public restricted by news censorship 
the presidents of honduras el salvador costa rica and 
guatemala will join ortega in tela 
adolfo calero a member of the rebel political directorate 
already has expressed his determination to keep the contras 
operating 
opposition leaders told reporters they were generally satisfied 
with fridays agreement even though it was not all they wanted 
no country however powerful has the right to interfere in 
the nicaraguan electoral process jaime bonilla of the 
independent liberal party said speaking for a coalition of 14 of 
the 20 parties 
even though the opposition is not completely satisfied the 
electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition 
wants the accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the 
peace process at the summit 
the tela summit saturday and sunday will be the fifth held under 
a peace plan that president oscar arias of costa rica drafted in 
august 1987 to negotiate an end to nicaraguas civil war and 
leftist insurrections in el salvador and guatemala 
the focus will be on nicaragua and the 12000 contras now 
living with their dependents in base camps in southern honduras 
the united states provided the contras with military aid until a 
year ago it now sends them only nonlethal aid such as clothing 
and food 
president jose azcona hoyo of honduras says the contras are an 
economic burden and that he wants them out of his country 
ortega said he hoped the honduran government feels stronger 
now to push for the demobilization of the contras in honduran 
territory 
fridays accord also calls for undercover activities to halt 
during nicaraguas electoral process the sandinistas also promise 
to grant unconditional amnesty to all political prisoners a move 
that will benefit 1605 rebels in nicaraguan jails 
the united states began supporting the contras in 1982 and 
declared an economic embargo on nicaragua three years later 
arguing that sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and 
the sandinistas close military ties with moscow and havana 
threatened security in central america 
the bush administration supports the arias peace plan but says 
the contras should not be disbanded until after the elections 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs visited guatemala this week to press that point 
a senior state department official in washington briefing 
reporters on the aronson trip on condition of anonymity cited 
complaints that the sandinista government is mounting raids on 
suspected contra sympathizers in northern nicaragua and failed to 
create fair conditions for political opponents 
the contras calero said he was elated that president bush has 
come out unequivocally in favor of having the resistance remain as 
a viable force 
he said the process of democratization in nicaragua remain only 
promises by the sandinista government adding you do not take 
down the scaffold before the building is finished

president bush complained to senate majority 
leader george mitchell on friday that 120 of his appointments are 
languishing in the senate as lawmakers prepare to begin a long 
summer recess 
mitchell said he told the president he wasnt dragging his feet 
that some delays had been requested by republican senators and that 
he would be as prompt as possible 
mitchell also said he turned down a request by bush for an 
immediate vote by the full senate on the presidents nomination of 
willliam lucas to head the justice departments civil rights 
division 
lucas nomination was rejected last week by a 77 vote of the 
senate judiciary committee 
the president asked me to bring the nomination to the floor 
today for a vote i refused his request pointing out this is the 
last day of the session and the senate was working hard to complete 
action on the savings and loan bill and extension of the debt limit 
both urgently requested by the president himself mitchell said 
in a statement after a private meeting with the president 
mitchell also indicated he warned bush in a letter not to seek 
to reappoint lucas during the upcoming recess such recess 
appointments which expire at the end of the next senate session 
are sometimes used as a method of temporarily bypassing the 
confirmation process 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president 
was concerned about the delay in his nominations 
the president wanted to register his deep concern that these 
were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the 
candidates themselves fitzwater said 
but mitchell said that 186 of bushs nominations had been 
approved with several more scheduled to be confirmed soon 
several of those delayed were at the request of republican 
senators mitchell said i assured the president we would 
continue to move on his nominations as promptly as possible 
consistent with careful review of their qualifications 
the white house and the democraticcontrolled senate have been 
wrangling for weeks over the backlog of bush nominations not yet 
acted on by the senate 
white house officials and senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan have claimed that many of the nominations are being held up 
for purely political purposes 
among those nominations caught in the logjam is bushs selection 
of donald gregg who had been his national security adviser when he 
was vice president as ambassador to south korea greggs 
nomination politically controverisal because of greggs alleged 
familiarity with the reagan administrations irancontra dealings 
was approved by committee but has yet to receive a floor vote 
also on hold is a batch of nominations to toplevel positions in 
the department of housing and urban development the agency is the 
target of influencepeddling inquiries 
fitzwater claimed thta some of the nominations were being held 
hostage to legislation sought by individual members while in 
some cases they senators want commitments on their own candidates 
for other jobs 
some cases it appeared to be just political fitzwater 
added 
the white house and the senate are also feuding over whether 
senate staff aides should be allowed to study confidential fbi 
reports on bushs nominees the white house now only permits 
senators to review this material 
we feel very strongly that the privacy of individual nominees 
is such that members of the staff should not be able to rummage 
trough peoples private backgrounds and resumes and fbi files and 
we register a very strong protest against that idea the 
spokesman said 
he feels very strongly that senators are elected to make these 
kinds of judgments fitzwater said

inc which controls united press international have been accused 
in a civil lawsuit of making illegal stock transactions to ward off 
possible takeover bids 
infotechnology said friday that it had not yet reviewed the 
complaint but there was no basis whatsover for claims 
contained in a news release which announced the filing of the 
lawsuit 
the accusations were made thursday in a lawsuit filed in 
delaware chancery court by avacus partners lp which owns 78 
percent of infotechnology stock and indicated in march it might 
launch a takeover bid 
avacus said chairman earl brian engineered stock transactions 
involving infotechnology and two other companies it controls in an 
effort to frustrate takeover interest in infotechnology and 
entrench current management 
it said infotechnology received inadequate consideration in the 
deals and that the transactions enabled brian and his allies to 
boost their interest in the company to 32 percent from 13 percent 
in addition to brian the lawsuit named infotechnologies four 
other directors as defendants 
the lawsuit asked that the court rescind the stock transactions 
in question and place infotechnology under control of a receiver 
infotech is confident that the lawsuit is entirely without 
merit fridays statement read 
the lawsuit stated that infotechnology agreed in late february 
to issue 15 million shares of its common stock valued at 1615 
million in exchange for the stock of wnw group inc a privately 
held company set up and managed by brian 
wnws main assets are the right to control upi wire service 
which has not been profitable in the last decade and continues to 
report losses since emerging from bankruptcy law protection in 1986 
avacus said brian had obtained those assets for wnw a year 
earlier for 110000 and noted that infotechnology paid 150 times 
the price he paid the previous year 
the lawsuit also said brian had infotech provide unspecified 
millions of dollars in loans to underwrite upis losses in 1988 and 
1989 
avacus partners is based in washington and consists of several 
limited partners the largest of which is the dutch investment firm

an alleged cocaine dealer and two former 
bodyguards to hustler publisher larry flynt pleaded innocent friday 
to the murder of theatrical producer roy radin in a dispute over 
the cotton club movie 
the prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty against one 
or more of the defendants at their upcoming trial 
karen delayne lanie greenberger who is accused of ordering 
radins killing in 1983 answerednot guilty in a soft voice 
and said she denied special circumstance allegations that the 
killing was for financial gain and committed during a kidnapping 
codefendants william molony mentzer and alex lamota marti 
pleaded innocent in the radin murder as well 
deputy district attorney david conn said outside court i can 
say we will be seeking the death penalty on one or more defendants 
as to which defendants has not been determined at this time 
radin an obese cocaine sniffing producer who was collaborating 
with hollywood movie mogul robert evans on finances for the 
cotton club disappeared on may 13 1983 he was last seen 
stepping into a limousine with mrs greenberger en route to a swank 
beverly hills restaurant for a meeting 
the case lay dormant nearly six years until flynts 
brotherinlaw and former chief of security william rider came 
forward and gave damaging evidence 
he linked mentzer and marti the former bodyguards to the 
slaying and said he was told that evans and mrs greenberger paid 
for the hit 
radin died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head his body was 
found in a dry riverbed 60 miles north of los angeles where rider 
said the flynt bodyguards often held target practice 
mrs greenberger a reputed cocaine dealer who was once evans 
girlfriend was ordered to stand trial along with mentzer and marti 
after a fourmonth preliminary hearing which focused on radins 
fast life in a drug infested circle of celebrities and shady 
characters 
conn has alleged that mrs greenberger hired mentzer and marti 
as hit men because she saw radin as an obstacle to her share of a 
lucrative deal with evans for money from the cotton club 
evans refused to testify at the preliminary hearing on fifth 
amendment grounds but his lawyer has said he had nothing to do 
with the radin murder 
mentzer and marti also pleaded innocent to charges in a second 
murder of a prostitute june mincher which is unrelated to the 
radin case 
superior court judge gary klausner ordered the defendants to 
return to his court aug 11 for assignment to a trial judge the 
three who are being held without bail waived their right to a 
speedy trial until 60 days after that hearing at which conn said he 
would announce which defendants will be the subject of his efforts 
to gain death sentences

disease lost a chance at the transplants they desperately need when 
their insurance company went bankrupt and their family is 
struggling to raise money for the surgery 
if the 60000 needed for bone marrow transplants cant be 
raised in a few weeks 5yearold anna marie and mary beth heinz 
will be hooked up to transfusion needles eight hours a day five 
days a week said their uncle andy willoughby 
these kids have gone through so much already willoughby 
said friday 
the girls who suffer from congenital anemia and cannot produce 
enough red blood cells have already undergone 72 transfusions 
which are causing spleen and liver damage 
the twins older brother and sister have tissues that match 
perfectly with their sisters and an operation was set for july 5 
at the university of nebraska medical center at omaha 
but on july 3 the familys insurance company amalgamated labor 
life insurance co went bankrupt the hospital would not admit the 
twins without insurance 
they urgently need to have something done said the twins 
doctor who asked that her name not be used 
the girls father dan heinz had lost his job as a meat cutter 
and was working two jobs delivering newspapers and hauling trash 
to pay insurance premiums 
last winter he went into the country and chopped wood to save 
money on heating bills willoughby said basically hes been 
working 16hour days for five years in all that time i dont

the main opposition party and a human 
rights group called friday for the justice minister to resign 
because of the deaths of two leftist prison inmates on a hunger 
strike 
social democrat populist party spokesman cevdet selvi said 
justice minister oltan sungurlu was responsible for the deaths of 
the two inmates who had been on a hunger strike for 35 days 
the inmates died wednesday after they were transfered along with 
310 other prisoners from eskisehir province to a prison in aydin 
about 300 miles to the west 
prosecutors said the inmates mehmet yalcinkaya and huseyin 
husnu eroglu died of dehydration 
the inmates were among 280 prisoners who began a hunger strike 
at eskisehir prison june 28 to protest restrictions imposed by 
authorities following the discovery of an escape attempt 
the hunger strikers claimed they were not fed sufficient meals 
and were not allowed to go outside for air 
sungurlu told reporters friday that the hunger strike was a 
political action and the fasting prisoners refused any kind of 
medical help 
the independent human rights association said friday that 
sungurlu should resign and should also face prosecution for what it 
called his irresponsible attitude toward the problem 
authorities said the transfer of prisoners from eskisehir was 
necessary so that workers could repair the damage to the prison 
caused by the digging of two escape tunnels 
yalcinkaya 28 had been sentenced to death for being a member 
of the outlawed kurdish labor party eroglu 31 was on trial on 
charges of being a member of the same party

military leftist groups against extreme rightists claimed 5000 
lives in turkey prior to the military takeover at the end of last 
decade 
according to statistics complied by the human rights 
association 1542 terrorist suspects are still in prison and still 
on trial and 1357 are serving sentences

mystery fans expecting to help solve a mock 
murder at a seacoast restaurant this weekend now have to untangle a 
real crime who took the money that was supposed to pay for the 
weekend fun 
a woman posing as the organizer of the mystery weekend put out a 
brochure advertising the fake murder and got people to pay up to 
500 for rooms meals and the staged mystery the attorney 
generals office says 
lukas greenhouse restaurant in hampton falls never scheduled 
the event because the woman failed to make a down payment on a 
room said attorney general john arnold he is urging people who 
paid for the weekend to notify his office 
mock murders are a relatively recent phenomenon people pay 
hundreds of dollars to take a cruise stay at a hotel or ride a 
train where a fake crime takes place they are given certain clues 
by the mystery organizers and then have to solve the puzzle 
usually a murder using only the clues and their ingenuity 
the management at lukas is trying to come up with some clues to 
the whereabouts of maria who told the restaurant she wanted to 
rent a room for a murder mystery 
tracy fosterhill functions sales manager at lukas said she 
talked to the woman several times 
the woman never gave her last name fosterhill said but left a 
telephone number for a beverly mass residence she said maria 
was told she would have to send in a deposit before the room could 
be reserved for her and she never did 
i called her a few times and told her we had to have the money 
before we could give her a room fosterhill said she kept 
saying she wouldnt send any money until we sent her a menu so she 
could see our food selection we sent her at least four menus but 
never got any money 
fosterhill said the last time she called the beverly number 
about three weeks ago the line was disconnected 
assistant attorney general donald feith said he has talked to 
three people all from out of state who mailed checks to a post 
office box in plaistow and received confirmation letters for the 
mystery weekend 
feith said the plaistow post office has told him no one has been 
checking the box lately and that when it was opened by 
authorities it was empty 
feith said the people he has spoken with dont seem to realize 
that the mystery weekend is off and wont be held at a later date 
our fear is that lukas will be visited by a number of people 
this weekend expecting to see some kind of show feith said we 
expect to be pretty busy with calls from the people on monday or 
tuesday 
fosterhill said a man called lukas last week to find out where 
he was staying for the weekend and was told there would be no mock 
murder 
he wasnt too happy fosterhill said 
fosterhill also said she was contacted recently by a hotel in 
gloucester mass that had paid 600 to advertise in marias

government ordered schools closed friday after government 
plainclothesmen fired on demonstrators at the national university 
killing one student and wounding at least six 
an education ministry statement said public and private schools 
were being closed nationwide until further notice for the 
safety of students to preserve the peace of mind of their families 
and peace throughout the community in general 
the order did not affect the university of panama but it 
announced earlier it was closing down its campus to protest the 
thursday night shootings 
university officials in a statement friday accused panamas 
defense forces of acting brutally against unarmed students and 
for the excessive and indiscriminate use of toxic gases and 
shotguns 
in a veiled reference to foes of noriega who have been pressing 
for his ouster the education ministry statement accused those 
who have been advocating violence and confrontations among 
panamanians of encouraging the students to demonstrate 
an estimated 700000 students were left without classes about 
half of them were in panama city and the port of colon located 
across the isthmus at the northern entrance of the panama canal 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said plainclothes 
members of the defense forces fired shotguns at a student protest 
demonstrators were protesting an organization of american states 
proposal to end panamas political turmoil by holding a plebiscite 
aug 20 
the students and opposition parties insist that elections may 7 
which their candidate guillermo endara won overwhelmingly should 
be declared valid the noriegacontrolled government annulled the 
elections claiming fraud 
noriega runs panama through his command of the defense forces 
which include both soldiers and police

minister diego cordovez was not welcome any more in panama 
because of the plebiscite proposal cordovez heads an oas mission 
of diplomats trying to mediate here

mission until sept 1 to mediate a solution 
the united states has tried to oust noriega since he was 
indicted in february 1988 on us drug trafficking charges but 
trade and economic sanctions have failed to budge the general 
noriega denies the charges and says the united states is 
attacking him as part of a plan to abrogate the panama canal 
treaties which call for the canal to be turned over to panama at 
the end of the century 
early friday about 200 us soldiers stationed at the canal 
staged the latest of a series of military shows of strength 
the southern command said the fivehour exercise involved 
combatequipped soldiers backed by helicopters and armored 
vehicles established blocking positions at fort amador which 
the united states shares with the panamanian defense forces 
the positions were established at the intersections near the 
amador officers club and the golf club the command said only a 
block or so from noriegas fort amador office

president hashemi rafsanjani of iran said 
friday a reasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and he 
was willing to help the united states find it algeria later 
reported progress in hostage talks in beirut 
i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has solutions 
the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable prudent 
solutions rafsanjani said in his sermon in tehran at weekly 
moslem prayers 
official algiers radio said saturday that progress was made in 
talks on friday in which algerias ambassador in beirut khaled 
hasnawi was involved 
it said hasnawi met with the spiritual leader of hezbollah 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah and with un envoy marrack 
goulding in talks involving all hostages whether lebanese 
palestinians americans europeans or israelis 
progress in this mediation was accomplished friday the 
official state radio said without elaborating 
in washington state department spokeswoman nancy beck said she 
was aware of the report from algeria but added i have nothing 
specific on that 
algeria while proud of its role in mediating past crises 
including the january 1981 release of american hostages held in the 
us embassy in tehran usually is closemouthed about its 
involvement until an issue is settled the radio report was seen as 
a sign that algerian authorities think a deal is close 
goulding met with hasnawi for 30 minutes in beirut and said he 
sought algerias help in determining the fate of lt col william 
r higgins 
higgins a us marine was kidnapped on un duty in february 
1988 his captors said they hanged him monday in retaliation for 
israels abduction of a shiite moslem cleric 
a videotape was released showing a man on a gallows who 
appeared to be higgins but no body has been found some reports 
said he was killed months ago 
in the streets of beirut proiranian shiite zealots of 
hezbollah the group believed to hold the western hostages paraded 
to denounce the united states at weekly prayers before the 
demonstration fadlallah urged those holding the hostages not to 
harm them 
president bush said he would explore rafsanjanis offer to the 
fullest but added i dont want to raise hopes beyond 
fulfillment 
the international committee of the red cross expressed 
willingness to relay to israel the demands for a prisoner release 
made thursday by the kidnappers of american hostage joseph cicippio 
when they suspended plans to kill him 
a knowledgeable shiite source in beirut speaking privately 
said the final word on cicippios reprieve came from rafsanjani 
who must have used his first day in office to pressure the 
kidnappers to spare cicippios life 
rafsanjani who was inaugurated thursday is believed eager to 
improve ties with the west and erase irans image as a sponsor of 
international terrorism in his sermon he sought a conciliatory 
tone with the united states 
these bullyings arrogant approaches and tyranny will not 
solve the problems come let us approach the problem reasonably 
we too will help solv the problems there so the people of the 
region can live in peace and harmony he said in the sermon 
broadcast by tehran radio 
rafsanjani said that if the united states wants hostages freed 
it must ask israel to free sheik abdul karim obeid 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the statements 
encouraging but said the hostage situation was a serious 
problem and he did not expect changes in the increased deployment 
of us navy forces in the mediterranean 
israel sent commandos to southern lebanon on july 28 to abduct 
obeid a spiritual leader of hezbollah or party of god israel 
offered to trade obeid and other shiite prisoners for three israeli 
soldiers held in lebanon and for the western hostages 
rafsanjani said about the higgins killing we do not make any 
judgment about the group that executed the american colonel you 
cannot condemn the innocent people of lebanon on the vague 
basis that some group has possibly killed someone higgins for a 
crime 
if america responds by saying it cannot pressure israel into 
freeing obeid this isnt acceptable to us rafsanjani said 
sixteen westerners are captives in lebanon including eight 
americans held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was seized march 16 
1985 
in south beirut fadlallah said those holding the hostages 
should not harm them 
lets be better than they he said of what hezbollah and iran 
call the arrogant powers 
lets be loftier lets be more humanitarian what we want is 
for those detained people not to be hurt 
the demonstration after his sermon was to protest obeids 
abduction men with beards and women in anklelength black chadors 
carried banners reading death to america the mother of all 
terrorism 
the revolutionary justice organization one of the kidnapping 
groups believed to be fronts for hezbollah said thursday it was 
suspending its death sentence against cicippio and replacing it 
with demands that israel free palestinian and lebanese prisoners 
it said it would provide a list to the red cross 
michel dufour chief red cross delegate in lebanon said 
weve taken notice that our services may be needed and if a 
party approaches us to transmit messages well do it 
cicippios lebanese wife elham said in beirut that her heart 
which was full of despair sadness and pain for several years 
has regained some hope and was refreshed by this encouraging 
humanitarian initiative 
in his hometown of norristown pa the hostages relatives 
decorated a sign proclaiming the number of his days in captivity 
with a dozen balloons and an american flag cicippio was kidnapped 
sept 12 1986 
in jerusalem israels top leaders conferred about a response to 
the demands which revolutionary justice said must be accepted 
within days it did not say what would happen to cicippio if 
israel refused 
in addition to algerias aid turkey announced friday it had 
been in touch with all sides

a christian science couple were 
acquitted friday of involuntary manslaughter but convicted of child 
endangerment for relying on prayer instead of medical treatment for 
their dying infant daughter 
mark rippberger 35 and susan middleton 39 members of the 
church of christ scientist face up to four years state in prison 
for the 1984 meningitis death of their 8monthold daughter natalie 
susan 
sentencing is set for oct 12 
rippberger and middleton belong to a church founded by visionary 
mary baker eddy who believed disease is a physical manifestation 
of errors of the mind 
the jury showed remarkable intelligence in handing down this 
verdict said prosecutor david dunn outside court the familys 
attorney david mackenroth of sacramento said he will appeal 
during the sevenweek trial before sonoma county superior court 
judge lloyd von der mehden the president of the american academy 
of pediatrics testified that there is a 95 percent survival rate 
when the infection is treated by a drug called defuroxime 
the 12member jury began deliberating the case wednesday 
rippberger and middleton were charged with two felonies 
involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment mackenroth 
contended the couple were guilty only of following their religious 
beliefs in seeking a cure through spiritual healing 
dunn said the couple may have acted correctly according to the 
tenets of their religion but their actions must be evaluated 
against the standards of conduct established by law that of an 
ordinarily prudent careful person

congress could make the supreme courts job 
easier by writing laws clearly eliminating the need for 
timeconsuming court interpretations justice byron r white said 
in a speech friday 
in the speech prepared for delivery at the american bar 
associations convention white said fellow justice antonin scalia 
has revived the debate over statutory language vs legislative 
history 
in the past 50 years courts trying to determine congressional 
intent have looked at the legislative history of laws as well as 
the wording of the statutes white said 
such history includes committee hearings and reports floor 
debates and conference committee actions 
white said a nearly 100yearold high court decision holy 
trinity church vs united states which allowed the interpretation 
of even a clear statute based on legislative history barely 
survived the supreme courts last session 
in their interpretations the courts begin with the statutory 
language which if thought clearly to relect legislative intent is 
followed he said 
however most statutory cases involve not plain but ambiguous 
language and in these cases resort to legislative history has been 
the usual course white said this is often a very large 
undertaking taking hours and hours of effort by judges law 
clerks and librarians to say nothing of the time lawyers spend 
and charge for seeking to present the materials that the judiciary 
has indicated are relevant to decision 
with the everincreasing complexity of subjects considered by 
courts more people including scalia advocate a return to 
interpreting statutes based almost wholly on the legislations 
text white said 
the statute as it is written it is said is what congress 
enacted not statements in hearings not discussion of statutory 
terms contained in committee reports and not statements on the 
floor said white who was appointed to the court by president 
kennedy in 1962 
white said scalia reagan appointee would confine the review of 
legislative history to cases where the statuatory language itself 
produces an absurdity 
the debate over how statutes should be interpreted is 
extremely important since it involves how the courts may best carry 
out the will of congress white said adding that in some cases 
congress may be vague on purpose to force court decisions 
white mentioned several other areas where congress as the major 
source of changes in federal law could simplify our work and at 
the same time make its intent known 
when enacting laws congress should include a statute of 
limitations he said 
congress sometimes creates what seems to be a right but fails 
to provide a remedy creating a recurring legal issue over whether 
the seeming beneficiary of the right has a private remedy in 
federal court he said 
regarding conflicts between federal and state laws white said 
congress should make its intentions clear when it plans to 
supersede state law 
white said congress should clarify obvious uncertainties 
over statutes mandating the payment of lawyers fees by losing 
defendants 
more than 8000 lawyers are attending the convention which 
continues through wednesday the dinner was sponsored by the 
american judicature society

senate debate over a routine spending bill was 
halted temporarily friday when conservatives tried using it to 
restore oliver norths 23000 annual pension forfeited after his 
felony convictions in the irancontra affair 
the proposal sponsored by sen jesse helms rnc would 
exempt the former white house aide from a law denying retirement 
pay to officials convicted of destroying government documents one 
of three felonies on which north was found guilty 
democrats reluctant to force a vote on the controversial former 
marine lieutenant colonel instead delayed consideration of the 
spending bill which would provide 184 billion for the treasury 
postal service and other agencies for fiscal 1990 
senators returned to the spending bill passing it by voice 
vote only after senate leaders promised helms that he would be 
allowed action on a separate bill on north after the summer recess 
but before nov 3 
helms complained that the government spent 40 million not 
only to prosecute but to persecute north he cited norths 
service in vietnam where he won a bronze star a silver star and 
two purple hearts 
a lot of the pygmies who criticize oliver north never saw a 
day when they were willing to lay down their lives for the 
country helms said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz countered that north was not 
only a vietnam hero but a convicted felon 
colonel north is no different than any other citizen said 
deconcini if youre found guilty you have a right to appeal if 
youre found guilty you lose certain benefits 
the debate eventually pitted a pair of senate veterans of the 
vietnam war against each other 
sen bob kerrey dneb who lost a portion of his leg in 
vietnam argued that it is wrong for lawmakers to seek exceptions 
for otherwise deserving individuals who fail to qualify for 
government benefits he cited a constituent who lost parts of both 
legs in vietnam but who failed to qualify for certain government 
payments because the amputations were not severe enough 
but sen john mccain rariz a navy fighter pilot who was a 
prisoner of war in north vietnam for 5 years countered ill 
take up his case 
the navy suspended norths pension when he was sentenced on july 
5 by us district court judge gerhard a gesell to perform 1200 
hours of community service and pay a 150000 fine he was given no 
prison time 
the navy later reversed itself arguing that north a retiree 
should not be considered an officeholder under the terms of the 
law but on monday us comptroller general charles bowsher 
rejected the navys argument 
north was convicted may 4 on charges of giving false testimony 
to congress during the irancontra hearings accepting a security 
fence for his home and shredding classified documents he is 
appealing his convictions 
the former lieutenant colonel has become a popular dinner 
speaker with reports saying he collects up to 25000 for each 
appearance 
earlier this week sen steve symms ridaho offered another 
proposal to restore norths pension democrats watered it down to 
instead require the senate judiciary committee to study the 
question and report by november 
on wednesday the ranking republican on the house armed services 
committee bill dickinson of alabama introduced a separate bill to 
restore norths pension

cuba said friday that a us spy plane nearly 
collided with a boeing 727 jetliner of colombias national airline 
according to cubas official news agency us and colombian 
aviation officials said they knew nothing about the purported 
incident 
cubas civil aviation agency reported the pilot of the colombian 
jet told the aviation agency that on wednesday he saw a 
silverblue plane flying from east to west at the same altitude 
as that of aviancas flight 63 the prensa latina dispatch said 
the news agency reported the pilot said that if the other plane 
had been flying at a greater speed a collision would have been 
inevitable 
the news agency said at the same time that the incident occurred 
a us rc135 spy plane was flying over cuba engaged in espionage 
activities 
it reported the avianca pilot filed complaints with air traffic 
control authorities in colombia cuba and miami the dispatch was 
monitored in mexico city 
arlene salac spokesman for the federal aviation 
administrations regional office in atlanta said it had not 
received such a report and if one had been made with the miami 
control center the atlanta office would have been notified 
in miami airport officials and the local avianca office said 
they had not heard of such a report 
faa spokesman fred farrar said in washington that he had checked 
with several faa offices about the cuban account and i cant find 
anyone who knows about it 
colombian civil aeronatic officials in bogota said the only 
information they had was a report from havana carried in the local

a state judge on friday ruled against three 
french quarter strippers who are challenging a new city ordinance 
that bars striptease dancing by those under 21 
shannon arendt josette barry and laura folks contend that the 
city is unconstitutionally denying them employment because of their 
age and they sought an injunction against enforcing the ordinance 
state district judge george c connolly jr set an aug 9 
hearing on the lawsuit the women who are over 18 but under 21 
said they chose their profession or occupation because they enjoy 
being entertainers and dancing 
the law went into effect july 26 no arrests had been made as of 
friday an assistant city attorney said 
in their lawsuit filed thursday the women said the ordinance is 
based on a request and false representations of an entity which 
is trying to impose its religious views and values on plaintiffs 
and other citizens of new orleans 
the city council passed the ordinance last month after james 
kelly director of covenant house which cares for runaways and the 
homeless charged that stripping could lead to prostitution and 
drug use 
kelly said he had to compete with drug dealers and flesh 
peddlers in trying to find jobs for young drifters however many 
club operators say the job of striptease dancing gives young people 
a haven from street life 
deputy city attorney william d aaron jr said he believes the 
ordinance is on solid legal ground 
the law says youve got to be 21 to buy an alcoholic drink in 
a bar he said it just seems inconsistent for people under 
21 to work in that environment when the obvious intent of the 
drinking age law is not to have them in that environment in the 
first place

the foreign ministry issued a terse statement 
saturday denying a japanese news report that 84yearold senior 
leader deng xiaoping is seriously ill 
the report is sheer fabrication with ulterior motives the 
statement said in full 
the ministry rarely comments on news reports about major chinese 
leaders particularly deng who repeatedly has been rumored ill 
dying or dead over the last few years however the latest report 
came weeks after deng purged his no 2 man communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang setting the stage for a power struggle after 
his death 
the report by japans jiji press quoted unidentified chinese 
sources as saying dengs health deteriorated seriously a few days 
ago and emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him at a 
coastal resort east of beijing 
it quoted doctors as saying they were discussing whether deng 
was too ill to be moved to beijing where better medical facilities 
are available 
the report sent hong kongs stock market plunging 5551 points 
the only official comment friday came from the hong kong office 
of the official xinhua news agency which called the report a mere 
rumor 
no signs emerged of special activity friday night inside 
communist party headquarters zhongnanhai although lights burned 
late into the night at the great hall of the people soldiers 
stationed around beijing to enforce martial law were not increased 
in number 
deng was last seen in public on june 9 when national television 
showed him meeting with top army officers and congratulating them 
on having ended student prodemocracy protests in beijing 
the official xinhua news agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and 
police died on june 34 in quelling the protests and that thousands 
were injured while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1000 were 
injured chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources said 
the death toll may have been as high as 3000 
at that time deng spoke in a strong voice and appeared more 
alert and healthy than he has for months he is widely believed to 
suffer from prostate problems and over the past few years there 
have been periodic reports that he is seriously ill or dying 
chinese sources long have reported that he has little energy and 
is able to work only a few hours each day

the senate on friday night approved an 184 
billion spending bill including 200000 to remodel the vice 
presidents official residence to accomodate the young family of 
dan quayle 
the appropriations bill for the treasury the postal service 
the office of the president and other smaller agencies for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 was approved by voice vote after the 
senate put aside a controversial amendment to restore oliver 
norths military pension that issue will be taken up as a separate 
bill later this year 
the house version of the spending bill approved july 28 also 
provides money for the renovations to the vice presidential mansion 
work that the family had previously said would be done with 
private funds 
the money would go toward work on the third floor of the 19th 
century mansion on the naval observatory grounds in an exclusive 
washington neighborhood 
the three quayle children ranging in age between 15 and 10 
live on that level when president bush lived in the home as vice 
president the third floor was used for barbara bushs office a 
maids bedroom and for storage 
the quayles have raised 200000 but intend to use it for 
furnishings instead according to denise balzano aide to quayles 
wife marilyn 
the overall bill contains 55 billion for the internal revenue 
service 300 million more than this year and 13 billion for the 
customs service 100 million above 1989 spending both are 
treasury agencies 
it also cuts 30 million out of postal service funds used to 
allow charities and institutions to enjoy low mailing rates the 
provision is aimed at preventing credit card companies from joining 
with charities to seek business and thus taking advantage of 
subsidized mail rates 
another part of the bill would suspend enforcement of a tax law 
for one year that encourages companies to bestow health insurance 
on lowlevel workers and discourages greater benefits for 
highlevel executives than for other employees business groups 
have complained that the requirement is expensive and 
timeconsuming 
like all annual spending bills considered by congress the 
treasury measure is riddled with special projects for certain 
lawmakers 
thus it orders treasury to transfer an aircraft it has seized 
to the arizona health sciences center in tucson ariz the chairman 
of the senate appropriations treasury subcommittee is dennis 
deconcini dariz 
the senate also eliminated money to keep a post office 
functioning in holly springs miss 
holly springs happens to be in the district of rep jamie 
whitten dmiss chairman of the house appropriations committee 
rejecting the money for a project of interest to the other chamber 
is a favorite tactic in congress to enhance ones bargaining 
position when a compromise bill is fashioned 
the two chambers will have to work out compromise legislation 
after congress returns from its recess in september before sending 
it to president bush for his signature

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlanes claim that military mismanagement thwarted two air 
raids on radical shiite moslems in lebanon in 1983 was challenged 
friday by former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
hes just as unreliable on this as he was on virtually 
everything else i ever did with him weinberger said in an 
interview with television station wcvbtv 
in an interview shown thursday on wcvbtvs show hostage 
mcfarlane said the united states came close to mounting bombing 
raids twice in 1983 when government intelligence learned where the 
shiites were training 
mcfarlane said the missions were aborted because of our own 
military chain of command 
in 1983 the truck bombing of a marine barracks in lebanon 
claimed the lives of hundreds of us servicemen mcfarlane said the 
united states had extremely good intelligence that hezbollah 
militiamen were training in barracks in a valley in eastern lebanon 
most western hostages in lebanon are believed held by factions 
of hezbollah or party of god an iranianbacked fundamentailst 
shiite group 
in the first attempt us pilots circled so long over the area 
that syrian air defenses could have been able to turn on track 
them shoot them down mcfarlane said 
mcfarlane blamed the delay on inept mismanagement by the 
pilots superiors 
mcfarlane said weinberger called off the second raid which had 
been planned with the french government because the defense 
secretary felt it was too risky 
weinbergers decision resulted in great damage to our 
credibility and put an end to any hopes of dealing with these 
terrorists the former national security adviser said 
weinberger strongly denied the allegation 
there were certainly no planes in the air about to make a 
strike that were turned back and there was most certainly no 
failure to cooperate weinberger said those are just plain 
myths 
mcfarlane was unavailable for further comment friday mcfarlane 
spokeswoman cindy carpenter said in washington he said he really 
had nothing more to say on the subject she said 
mcfarlane said thursday there was never an effort planned to 
rescue the hostages because officials never had intelligence on 
where they were 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty last year to four misdemeanor counts of 
withholding information from congress about reagan administration 
efforts to funnel military aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels he 
left his national security council post in november 1985 but 
remained active in policymaking leading an unsuccessul 
armsforhostages mission to tehran in 1986 
he attempted suicide in 1987 after the irancontra scandal 
broke but since has cooperated with prosecutors by testifying at 
the oliver north trial

the senate voted friday night to temporarily 
extend the governments debt limit by 70 billion to 287 
trillion granting it authority to borrow enough money to function 
through the next three months 
on a voice vote the senate gave final approval to the extension 
and sent it to president bush for his signature 
had the lawmakers not approved the measure before leaving for 
their fourweek summer recess the government would have run out of 
money during their vacation and toppled into an unprecedented 
default 
the bill which the house had approved on tuesday provides 
enough borrowing authority to see the government through oct 31 
on nov 1 the temporary authority would lapse and the legal limit 
on the federal debt will lapse back to its current ceiling of 28 
trillion 
by that time lawmakers hope to complete a longrange permanent 
debt limit extension to more than 31 trillion enough borrowing 
for about a year 
many legislators hope the longterm extension will contain the 
elements of a budget deal between congress and the bush 
administration for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 1990 
legislative leaders spent much of the last several weeks trying 
to dissuade lawmakers from offering amendments to the debt limit 
measure the extension considered mustpass legislation is a 
favorite target for members of congress with bills that are too 
controversial to pass if standing alone 
the government needs legal authority to borrow money because it 
runs a deficit every year a shortfall that has hovered at around 
150 billion annually for the last three years it gets the rest of 
the money it needs each year by borrowing it 
when the reagan administration took office in 1981 the national 
debt was just above 900 billion

mikhail s gorbachevs gradual approach 
to change in the soviet union may lead to economic or political 
disaster soviet human rights activist andrei sakharov told 
scholars at harvard university 
waiting longer for the radicalization of perestroika is out of 
the question the 68yearold physicist said thursday at a 
luncheon with harvard officials and soviet affairs specialists 
hosted by derek bok the universitys president 
if we allow this to go on we are threatened with chaos 
sakharov said after giving a critical review of his countrys 
problems we may be threatened with a military coup we may be 
threatened with famine 
this state is now at a historic moment it could tip left or 
right we have to find a way to hold our course 
sakharov said the most immediate danger is the economy and he 
joked that a good way to tell whether someone is an optimist or a 
pessimist is to ask whether he thinks economic disaster will 
strike in one two or five years 
the luncheon also attended by sakharovs wife elena bonner 
was held at the residence of harvard president derek bok sakharov 
spoke through a translator 
ms bonner who has also been a longtime critic of soviet 
policies urged western nations not to get carried away with 
uncritical applause for soviet reforms and not to stop pressing for 
change 
the soviet people are overjoyed to find that in fact our 
country is a living entity she said recalling the recent 
congress of peoples deputies where open debates kept the nation 
riveted to its television screens 
the whole country was amazed and enthusiastic to see that we 
are alive that we havent lost our reason because of the hunger 
the trials the falsification that weve suffered she said if 
only the west can keep itself from lousing things up 
sakharov who won the nobel peace prize in 1975 was banished to 
internal exile in the city of gorky for seven years after 
criticizing the soviet intervention in afghanistan he was released 
in 1986 by gorbachev and has since been allowed to speak out and 
travel freely 
he is a deputy in the new 2500member congress and has emerged 
as one of the leaders of an independent bloc of about 400 delegates 
calling for speedier reforms aimed at democratizing the country and 
decentralizing the economy

a lesbian minister who said she was the 
victim of two antigay attacks last month changed her story when 
police confronted her with evidence some of her injuries were 
selfinflicted authorities said friday 
lynn griffis an assistant pastor at the metropolitan community 
church of san francisco resigned from her duties two hours after 
being placed on administrative leave thursday night said rev jim 
mitulski 
as a church we have a lot of compassion for lynn and 
whatever the truth is we want to know what the truth is 
mitulski said griffis has left town and he doesnt expect to hear 
from her again he said 
griffis said she was attacked first on july 12 hit on the head 
with a shovel after surprising an assailant who broke into her 
garage and scrawled antigay graffiti on the wall she received 
eight stitches 
she later alleged that she was abducted july 27 in the 
haightashbury area by two socalled skinheads who threw her 
into a car beat her up and threatened to kill her before releasing 
her 
police chief frank jordan said her account of the first attack 
was consistent with the evidence but the medical examiner said 
physical evidence failed to match her account of a second attack 
jordan declined to detail the inconsistencies but a source 
close to the case told the associated press that medical examiner 
boyd stephens determined the injuries she allegedly suffered from 
the skinheads were selfinflicted 
jordan also said damage to griffis clothing and a subsequent 
description of how her injuries were received were inconsistent 
with the evidence or even her account there was no attack as 
described he added 
stephens did not return telephone calls made friday evening by 
the ap 
when police presented the inconsistent evidence to griffis at a 
meeting with members of the gay community on thursday griffis 
described a different series of events and said she had been 
sexually assaulted jordan said 
police have referred the case to their sex crimes unit and will 
reconsider all of the evidence jordan said 
griffis has worked at mcc for about 18 months mitulski said 
she did good work with people with aids he said she helped 
a lot of people this doesnt change that i cant understand 
why this would happen 
the church had received a written death threat against griffis 
and mitulski the night before the first attack and mitulski said 
he has received subsequent death threats over the phone 
the alleged attacks coupled with the recent defacing of a gay 
mans home prompted local gay leaders to organize selfdefense and 
gunhandling classes 
reports of inconsistencies in griffis case prompted fears among 
gay advocates that subsequent reports would not be taken seriously 
by officials or the public 
jordan and others said that regardless of the outcome of the 
griffis case hate crimes will not be tolerated he said police 
receive about 10 reports of hate crimes per month and that other 
community organizations receive more

for stephanie beacham changing jobs this 
coming season has meant a radical change of uniform 
instead of the designer clothes she wore as wealthy sable colby 
on abcs dynasty shell don a nuns habit for the title role 
in the new nbc sitcom sister kate 
thats very tiresome having six costume fittings a week 
she said its going to be heaven just being in a little 
navyblue skirt and white blouse thank you very much thats 
wardrobe now 
beacham meeting with television critics who had gathered to 
preview the new fall shows said playing a nun is actually closer 
to her own upbringing than was the role as the rich and flighty 
sable 
anybody who knows me knows it was more of a stretch for me to 
do sable in some ways than it will be for me to do kate beacham 
said 
im a little girl guide good better best never let it 
rest till the good is better and the better best 
beachams sister kate is no sappy singing nun nor is she 
anything like the earnest neophyte sister played by sally field in 
television days of yore kate is a nononsense house mother to a 
pack of often trying orphans 
beacham said she met some activist nuns who help the homeless 
and she hopes to use them as role models i will be talking to 
them a lot because theyre very keen that nuns dont seem wimpy i 
think theyre sick and tired of singing nuns and soppy nuns these 
women are dedicated to improving everybodys lives and also to not 
being seen as straight and boring and tiresome they want to help 
and they want to have fun 
beacham said she also draws from childhood experience for the 
characterization of tough sister kate having been sent to a 
convent school when she was a young child in england my early 
education was my nuns she said and i love them i love the 
nuns that brought me up and i was very frightened of them and i 
look forward to the idea of being as frightening as sister mary 
cyrill was to me 
beacham said her upbringing stuck with her and now forms a back 
story for sister kate including deviations such as posing for 
photographs that turned up later in playboy magazine i think 
those nuns getting at me at 4 was very very important she 
said i think i owe them a hell of a lot what is it give 
me a child until he is 6 and i will show you the man im sure 
thats true when these kids that shes looking after now grow old 
and get married they would always come back to visit this crusty 
nun its much deeper in my background than is some billionaires 
wife 
the show comes from three executive producers two of whom are 
veterans of barney miller 
one of the latter jeff stein told the television critics that 
in a way he was glad to be in the tough time period that sister 
kate has drawn for the fall opposite cbs powerhouse murder 
she wrote on sunday evenings 
its actually a good time slot because youre not expected to 
win stein said i mean were not expected to go in there and 
get a 45 share percentage of audience were expected to go in 
there and do a good show and survive 
stein said he and the other producers saw hundreds of people 
for the part of sister kate and even though they knew beacham was 
still under contract to dynasty once they saw her the part 
was hers 
after they cast beacham in the pilot a lot of money was tied up 
in the project stein said nbc entertainment president brandon 
tartikoff took a gamble that abc wasnt going to pick up the 
aging dynasty for another season if dynasty had not been 
canceled by abc beachams contractual obligation would have been 
to that show 
she seems happy things turned out the way they did now shes 
working with a crowd of kiddies instead of the adult cast on 
dynasty she said she learned one thing immediately joan 
collins really wasnt as difficult as i had thought she was 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
elsewhere in television 
an end for dynasty stephanie beacham who played sable 
colby on abcs dynasty says the producers of the canceled 
nighttime soap are considering doing a wrapup special when all 
the actors are available next spring beacham is doing the new nbc 
comedy sister kate in the fall i think the viewers being 
stranded is very bad and i think theres a lot of resentment and 
there is talk of doing something in europe in what would be 
everybodys hiatus next march she said it would have to be in 
europe and when i asked executive producer esther shapiro why 
she said because we havent got any sets so were all going to 
have to go and visit crystal in switzerland she said so it hasnt 
been totally laid to rest there is still a possibility

northern ireland erupted into violence on aug 
14 1969 twenty years and 2740 deaths later the violence 
continues but much has changed in recent years and some in the 
british province are beginning to see the foundations of a 
solution here is a report by an associated press correspondent who 
covers northern ireland regularly

all mrs murphys neighbors are 
gone 
the house she and her husband bought on roe st stands alone in 
a nomans land its windows protected by steel mesh and a tall 
corrugated wall separating the roman catholic couple from 
protestant families 200 yards down the street 
susan murphys neighborhood once was mixed with protestants and 
roman catholics living side by side but northern irelands 
violence came to roe st and the stonings and firebombings proved 
more than mrs murphys neighbors could bear 
they went off to live among their own and authorities tore down 
their houses 
but the murphys held out 
it all happened not 20 years ago when the troubles were at 
their worst in the british province also known as ulster but just 
five months ago and the houses razed were not hovels but new 
showcases of a belfast rising from the victorian slums 
its something of an indictment of society here says ivan 
maginnis of the housing executive that had to make the decision 
its an awful tragedy 
its easy to conclude from this milliondollar exercise that 
little has changed in northern ireland since british troops arrived 
aug 14 1969 to separate rioting protestants from their catholic 
neighbors 
the death toll is over 2740 and rising almost week by week the 
catholic unemployment rate is 2 times that of protestants a 
political solution still looks far off 
and yet one finds a glimmer of optimism in northern ireland 
today 
violence has diminished from a peak of 467 killings in 1972 to 
an average of 80 a year in the 1980s 
recent elections suggest a weakening of the hardliners on both 
sides of the divide and a boost for the moderates 
in the irish republic to the south the political mold shaped in 
the countrys 192123 civil war has cracked and opened new 
possibilities for a solution that can accommodate both unionist and 
nationalist in northern ireland 
the unionists are the majority protestants intent on retaining 
union with britain and nationalists are the 40percent catholic 
minority whose aspirations lean to the irish republic 
the irish government in dublin has not renounced its claim to 
northern ireland it simply doesnt state it too loudly it is in 
consensus with the british government that nothing can change 
without protestant consent 
in a half dozen of northern irelands 26 district councils 
moderate catholics and protestants have joined in coalitions to 
shut out the extremists on both sides 
dungannon a town of 15000 in the center of the province was 
once a bastion of unionist supremacy and discrimination now its 
mixed council has a committee to promote crosscommunity 
understanding and sends protestant and catholic children on 
vacations together 
the whole island north and south is in intellectual ferment 
over the prospect that a united europe beginning with the 
lowering of trade barriers in the european economic community in 
1992 will subsume old nationalist rivalries in ireland 
national sovereignty is changing its whole meaning in european 
terms says john hume leader of the social democratic and labor 
party the provinces main catholic nationalist party the nation 
state is disappearing so the fundamental reason for the quarrel 
between britain and ireland is now gone 
a backwater 20 years ago northern ireland now has air links to 
european resorts a burgeoning catholic middle class hungers for 
stability a retail boom has transformed the bombedblackened city 
centers of belfast and londonderry 
aidan oreillys family was driven out of their home in 1973 by 
protestant mobs married now with a baby son oreilly owns a house 
in a quiet belfast suburb he is one of the thousands who look back 
on the old days and pray theyll never return 
by pouring some 225 billion a year into the province britain 
can actually buy pockets of stability councilor anthony mcgonnell 
a 40yearold schoolteacher says dungannons new approach is 
helped along by the knowledge that if a council is seen to be 
trying to work together central government is much more 
sympathetic towards it

ralph brown a 52yearold unionist councilor whose appliance 
store on dungannons main street has been damaged 11 times by irish 
republican army bombs strongly backs municipal powersharing 
a lot of trust has been built up he says people are 
really bending over backward at the moment to try and ensure that 
nothing major goes wrong 
paul bew an analyst at queens university in belfast was 
deeply pessimistic in the mid1980s now he feels things are 
looking up 
i am more modestly optimistic about some kind of accommodation 
in ireland than i have been for a long long time he says 
hume suggests a roundtable conference of all the parties the 
irish in dublin the british and the northerners to define the 
problem then solve it 
unionists prefer some sort of powersharing arrangement with 
catholics provided the irish government is not involved that 
distance between the two positions is great but at least the two 
sides are talking about solutions 
the trouble is that life is not improving in the bluecollar 
ghettoes where pockets of 80percent unemployment provide recruits 
for the ira and sinn fein its political backer in the campaign to 
end british rule in ulster and unite it with the southern republic 
sinn feins francis mccann a belfast city councilor says none 
of the prosperity of recent years has reached his constituency and 
the dungannon spirit hasnt reached belfast whose 
unionistdominated council hasnt given a single committee seat to 
a nationalist 
mccann a 36yearold man with ireland tattooed on his arm 
says he has endured jailings internment without trial countless 
arrests and house searches and all because i believe that irish 
people have a right to resist british rule in this country 
hume the voice of catholic moderation denounces the ira 
producing statistics indicating that twothirds of those killed 
since 1969 were catholics and 44 percent of them victims of the 
ira 
the ira have killed six times more people than the british 
army and 30 times more people than the ruc royal ulster 
constabulary those figures alone would force anybody to say 
to themselves hold on a minute where are our methods leading 
us 
northern ireland was set up in 1921 as a british enclave when 
the rest of ireland won independence and became a protestant 
fiefdom rife with gerrymandering police brutality and 
discrimination in housing and jobs 
in 1968 catholics began demanding civil rights violent 
protestant reaction brought in the british army which soon found 
itself at war with the ira in 1972 the government in london 
closed northern irelands parliament and assumed direct rule 
in 1985 prime minister margaret thatcher signed the angloirish 
agreement giving dublin a say in the running of the province 
outraged unionists who regard ireland as a hostile catholic state 
reacted violently 
but their protests were ignored and they are finally beginning 
to talk about negotiating a solution 
meanwhile some catholics concede that many of the grievances of 
the 1960s have been rectified gerrymandering and housing 
discrimination have been swept away by decree from london under 
new fairemployment laws employers guilty of discrimination face 
fines the equivalent of 48000 and the loss of government grants 
and contracts 
but unemployment is around 18 percent britains highest and 
violence drives away investment and jobs 
policing remains a thorny problem the royal ulster constabulary 
went some way toward evenhandedness by standing up to the riots 
against the angloirish agreement but every catholic moderate or 
militant has a story to tell of physical or verbal abuse by the 
mostly protestant security patrols 
mcgonnell says securityforce misbehavior is one of the major 
reasons why the vote for sinn fein the political wing of the ira 
still hovers around 11 percent bew the queens university 
analyst believes that only massive aid for catholic west belfast 
can eat into sinn feins support there

it is 945 on a tuesday wednesday or thursday 
morning and you are standing by the driveway outside the rayburn 
house office building up draws a limousine and out pour the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and a squad of 
briefcasetoting colonels 
here comes another and out comes the secretary of agriculture 
then the chairman of the federal trade commission the director of 
the office of management and budget the surgeon general in starchy 
white 
it is something to see the arrival of officialdom at congress 
doorsteps to appear before committees and subcommittees to ask to 
explain to defend to dodge to woo and to demonstrate that the 
checks and balances concept is alive and well in washington 
officials arrive at other congressional buildings and the 
capitol itself but because all going to rayburn use a single 
entrance it is a fine place to behold the phenomenon tuesdays 
wednesdays or thursdays are best because those are congress three 
full workdays 
every town has a few places people or phenomena that are 
uniquely its own just as the waltz of arriving officialdom is 
washingtons alone here are a few other washington institutions 
the billy goat trail it is a hiking trail on the maryland 
banks of the potomac if you think of washington as an effete city 
where no work gets done but words get spoken the terrains 
unexpected roughness in such proximity to the city will surprise 
you 
why one could fall off the trail and roll down the steep 
hillside into the rocks of the potomac no osha to come to the 
rescue 
edward evangelidi a hiking writer says of the fourmile billy 
goat trail it is shaped by many elements of nature at times it 
is inundated and scoured by rampaging floods of the potomac its 
unusual flora barely survives in the hot dry relentless summer 
suns and rocky geography he suggests you watch out for snakes 
there are places where youll find yourself hiking on all fours or 
grabbing hold of a wedge of rock you might as well be in wyoming 
red lion row this is quintessential washington architecture 
the architecture of compromise the owners wanted to tear down the 
late federal and greek revival and victorian houses along the 2000 
block of pennsylvania avenue four blocks west of the white house 
to make room for yet another blocklong behemoth office building 
preservationists said no those little houses are vital reminders 
of the scale and style of the city as it was when lincoln paced the 
streets 
a bargain was reached the old twostory buildings were saved 
and converted to stores and offices the behemoth rose attached to 
and behind them the old houses not just their facades were 
retained this was not just another facesaving gesture like most 
compromises what results is not entirely satisfactory to everyone 
stephen wade this entertainer came here about the same time 
ronald reagan did but outlasted his fellow showman wade came from 
chicago to play the banjo and tell tall tales for a few weeks run 
in a basement theater at at arena stage washington charmed wont 
let him go 
a man of beguiling passion wade reminds people of their human 
commonality he has revised his act but the title of his first 
show best gives the flavor banjo dancing or the 48th annual 
squitters mountain song dance folklore convention and banjo contest 
and how i lost 
rock creeks meadows washingtonian peggy fleming is a citizen 
naturelover who by dint of determination became a national park 
service ranger then she persuaded the authorities to stop mowing 
the grass in a few swatches of rock creek park which runs through 
the city 
controversy as you can imagine ensued some people think 
unmowed grass is mayhem and even a park needs discipline but 
peggy fleming prevailed twentythree of the parks 3000 acres 
were allowed to go wild they are mowed once a year to keep them 
from becoming forests 
the result not lawn not woods but something in between the 
next result new flora and fauna that flourish only under such 
circumstances 
voila goldfinches shorttailed shrews purpletop grass 
sixfeet tall bull thistles owls the pearl crescent butterfly 
all thriving where they otherwise hadnt and wouldnt 
like stephen wades banjo peggy flemings meadows are a 
washington miracle the unexpected pleasure like the highstepping 
colonels the shorttailed shrews are a sight to behold

ruined medieval fortresses stand 
silhouetted against the sky on scorched mountaintops across soviet 
georgia and atop each one flies a flag of the georgian independence 
movement 
the flags fly as well on police outposts and are sold at tbilisi 
newsstands in the form of lapel pins and dashboard suction cups 
one hangs over a highway from a peasants plot 
this land of glaciered crags fruitfilled valleys and black sea 
beaches is seething with resentment against the invaders from 
russia who took over their infant republic in 1921 
since troops armed with sharp shovels and toxic gas clashed with 
proindependence protesters in this capital april 9 killing 19 of 
them sympathy has grown for those georgians who want to secede 
from the soviet union 
but the soviet socialist republic of georgia a kingdom on its 
own in the middle ages also is rent by ethnic violence much of 
it pitting christian georgians against moslem minorities 
it is an explosive combination on the heels of april 9 
this is the last thing georgia needs right now says gizo 
grzeledze an official in the georgian foreign ministry it will 
bring the troops back 
the ethnic violence is spawned in part by reaction to the 
georgians rising nationalism 
hatreds and resentments dating back to the medieval times have 
reappeared among the dozen nationalities in the republic which is 
about half the size of arkansas 
conflicts pitting georgians against moslem abkhazians and 
azerbaijanis have cost 26 lives and injured more than 450 in 
several areas of georgia since the summer began georgians in the 
meskhetian area guard their homes against ethnic turks living there 
at the same time independence activists persuaded tens of 
thousands of workers to walk off their jobs in a general strike 
crippling transport and even a military jet factory 
thousands more have gathered in daily illegal meetings in 
downtown tbilisi 
even officials in the government ministry across the street from 
the gathering were hanging out their windows one recent day to 
listen to activist sviad gamsachurdia who said that in 1976 he 
could count just 20 or 30 people willing to join his call for 
independence 
in a tbilisi suburb vandals smashed the face and tore the head 
off a statue of vladimir i lenin the revered founder of the 
soviet union while a statue of the dictator josef v stalin a 
georgian stands unscathed 
the combustible mixture of nationalist unrest and ethnic 
violence is risky not only for georgia but also the rest of the 
country said shalva shanidze communist party leader of the 
akhaltsike region in the meskhetian area 
by strengthening the hardliners he maintained the activists 
are endangering all of the soviet union and its moves toward 
democracy and economic autonomy more than 100 ethnic groups live 
in the 15 soviet republics 
but gamsachurdia a greyhaired veteran of georgias resistance 
to soviet power says he is concerned only with the fate of 
georgia not the soviet union the fate of georgia he maintains 
is threatened by what he sees as islamic fundamentalism spilling 
over the border from iran 
it is a measure of the georgian publics sharing in 
gamsachurdias belief that the question activists and georgian 
communist officials alike pose to a visitor is not whether the 
united states would help georgia break from moscow but whether it 
would help an independent christian georgia against islamic 
fundamentalist iran 
the independence demonstrations of april have turned into 
demonstrations involving ethnic differences and religious 
backgrounds 
the christian orthodox church remains deeply rooted among 
georgians and still commands respect although the soviet 
government fosters atheism a number of very old churches have been 
preserved in georgia 
conflict between christians and moslems goes back centuries in 
the soviet caucasus region particularly in georgia and neighboring 
soviet armenia 
thousands of georgians filled rustaveli ave in tbilisi daily 
demonstrations during recent ethnic rioting between georgians and 
moslems in the abkhazian region a black sea resort area 
commanders of the 4500 soviet troops sent to quell the rioting 
said there were attempts to provoke the troops into firing on the 
population in what would have been a horrifying repeat of april 9 
in tblisi 
a letter from the georgian national front to the united nations 
in new york charged that the violence in abkhazia was organized by 
moscow it asked for un troops because it claimed soviet troops 
were protecting only abkhazians not georgians 
col gen yuri shatalin of the soviet army said his troops 
confiscated thousands of weapons from both georgians and 
abkhazians including explosives and machine guns 
lovard tukhashvili of the georgian institute of history 
archeology and ethnography said he believes the rioting was 
instigated by abkhazians who stand to lose their privileges to 
gorbachevs reforms or to an independent georgia 
abkhazians number just 80000 17 percent of georgias 53 
million people but they dominate the power structure and 
managerial jobs in their region tukhashvili said 
the abkhazians contend however they are struggling for equal 
rights and feel they will achieve them only by seceding from 
georgia and becoming a 16th republic of the soviet union according 
to abkhazian legislator vladislav ardzinba 
minorities in georgia are reacting to growing georgian 
nationalism inextricably woven into the independence movement 
ardzinba said 
but georgians tell outsiders that this is georgian land 
abkhazians azerbaijanis and meskhetian turks make equally detailed 
claims to the contrary 
georgia was a kingdom from the 4th century bc to the 14th 
century ad in 1555 western georgia fell to turkey and eastern 
georgia to persia now iran it became part of the russian empire 
in 1783 and had a spell of independence in 191821 after the 
bolsheviks seized power in moscow 
because georgians resisted the new soviet power a quarter of 
their land was turned over to other ethnic groups 
tukhashvili the historian said stalin did his fellow georgians 
no favors when he had whole nationalities deported from traditional 
homelands to central asia 
for example he said the georgians who moved onto the lands of 
the deported meskhetian turks now face nearly 400000 meskhetians 
clamoring to return and reclaim their homes 
for grzeledze of the georgian foreign ministry it is no 
coincidence that the azerbaijanis turks and most of the abkhazians 
are moslems traditional enemies of christian georgia 
georgia voluntarily joined the russian empire because it was the 
only christian alternative to domination by turks and persians 
nearly two centuries have passed but the geography hasnt 
changed 
persia is now revolutionary iran under the rule of moslem 
mullahs dedicated to spreading islamic fundamentalism and the high 
birth rates of moslems have the georgians fearful of becoming 
minorities in their own land

we are not guests says achmed 
ragimov an azerbaijani engineer in this city in the south of 
soviet georgia we feel this is our land 
georgians are equally vehement that the area around marneuli is 
traditionally georgian and the dispute is not ancient history 
here in june five people died in ethnic violence in the district 
georgians claim they are gracious hosts who welcome refugees and 
bear no ill will to other ethnic groups but they infuriate the 
abkhazian azerbaijani and turkish residents of georgia by 
insisting they are just guests 
i certainly dont feel like a guest said ali gasanov who 
lives in a largely azerbaijani area of georgia around marneuli 
my family has been here for 200 years 
growing georgian demands for independence from the soviet union 
georgia is now a soviet republic have prompted the azerbaijanis 
of the marneuli area to call for secession from georgia the 
population of the area is now threequarters azerbaijani due to the 
moslem preference for large families 
one summer night in marneuli an industrial city a car full of 
youths careened about the town warning of an impending attack by 
georgians 
several thousand men gathered armed with axes iron bars 
clubs and knives said a local communist party official tg 
beridze 
but nothing happened said anna kleshnina another party 
official 
she added however that men carying green islamic flags moved 
on to the nearby towns of bolnisi and dmanisiu spreading the word 
the georgians are finished with marneuli and now they are coming 
to get you 
fighting soon broke out and the five deaths occurred there she 
said 
the 17yearold gasanov also blamed georgian discrimination for 
his inability to find a job ragimov complained that georgians 
commuting from tbilisi the republics capital are claiming all 
the local managerial jobs 
several older residents in the crowd that quickly gathered 
around a visiting correspondent insisted that the multinational 
residents of marneuli live together like brothers 
i was born here and ive never had any problems said 
farida orudjeva this land is soviet its not his or mine 
but that sentiment which native georgian josef v stalin tried 
to instill by uprooting whole nationalities from their homelands 
is proving to be rare among the myriad minorities of the soviet 
union

every day at noon estonian activists 
gather in tallinns old town to collect signatures for a proposed 
referendum on the secession of their baltic republic from the 
soviet union a right guaranteed by the soviet constitution 
five years ago before the reforms of president mikhail s 
gorbachev such a petition would have been a sure ticket to prison 
even a year ago such a notion seemed out of the question 
but for nearly 500000 nonestonians in the baltic republic it 
could mean trouble and some are raising their voices in protest 
in late july several thousand of nonestonians struck major 
factories in tallinn returning to work only when the estonian 
government set up a commission to assuage their fears that they 
might someday be exiled from estonia 
a lot of people have no other homeland where would we go 
said gennady korol of the 56member coordinating committee of 
intermovement formed last summer by russian residents of estonia 
we just want to defend ourselves we want our children to grow 
up here said korol assigned by intermovement as liaison with 
the strikers 
every day the drama is acted out at the petition table in old 
town 
a muscular man strides up to the table and writes on a petition 
in russian throw the estonians out of the ussr so they wont 
disgrace us he marches off without signing his name 
the situation is similar in the two neighboring baltic 
republics latvia and lithuanian where russianspeaking movements 
have organized to counter the march to autonomy 
the conflict stems from the molotovribbentrop pact of 1939 
which gave germany most of poland and gave moscow eastern poland 
and the baltic republics recent baltic newspaper accounts have 
reported that hundreds of thousands of balts were killed or exiled 
under red army occupation and a government commission in moscow is 
reviewing the 1939 pact to determine whether soviet annexation of 
the baltic republics was legal 
a lot of time has passed since the 1940s its not our fault 
how the war turned out said korol who has lived in tallinn 
since his mother a war widow married a red army soldier and moved 
here in 1944 when gennady was 3 
since the annexation hundreds of thousands of nonestonians 
have settled in the republic working mostly in heavy industries 
that the estonians complain pollute their environment without 
giving them material benefit 
of the 16 million people in estonia 65 percent are estonian by 
nationality and most of the rest are russianspeakers from 
slavic republics 28 percent russian 3 percent ukrainian and 2 
percent byelorussian 
the baltic republics won a major victory july 27 when the 
national legislature in moscow voted overwhelming for a law that 
would grant them economic autonomy from moscow starting jan 1 
details remain to be worked out and the law must be voted on 
twice more but mikhail bronshtein author of the idea said in an 
interview it will allow estonia lativa and lithuania to print 
their own currencies and take control of industry and agriculture 
from moscowbased ministries 
but the estonian people are realists and will not seek full 
independence said bronshtein 66 a member of the communist party 
and head of the politicaleconomic faculty at estonias tartu 
university 
the russians will not be exiled but their status will change 
said rein veidemann chairman of the estonian peoples front the 
mass movement that is working with the estonian communist party for 
greater autonomy 
until now they have lived like a privileged class he added 
in an interview they came got new apartments more quickly than 
estonians and quickly landed places in the governing apparatus 
we want an equal chance to take part in governing estonia 
russian residents want to stop what they see as the baltics 
slide toward independence they claim their rights were undercut by 
laws recently passn for office 
were against separatism said vasily anson 46 a truck 
driver and chairman of the strike committee at the tallinn 
autotransport affialiate no 8 
interviewed at the tallin ship repair yard with other strikers 
anson said his family was exiled from estonia before the 1917 
bolshevik revolution and that he settled here in 1965 
my wife a byelorussian worked for 22 years in one of the 
worst factories here and we just got an apartment in 1987 anson 
said the soviet government owns virtually all housing and much of 
its is controlled by staterun factories such as the one his wife 
works for 
now the estonian legislature has passed a law making estonian 
the official language anson added the other day we got a 
letter written in estonian saying that she must take an examination 
in estonian in two months if she doesnt pass she can be fired 
for lack of professional qualifications and we will lose the 
apartment we will have nowhere to live 
the ansons have a 16yearold son and 12yearold daughter 
another strike committee member shipyard worker mikhail 
zakariadze moved to tallinn from soviet georgia in 1983 he 
married another georgian two years ago and they now have two 
children 
after living in dormitories for five years he became elegible 
to move with his family into a tworoom apartment last year 
but the city executive committee would not let me move there 
because i had not lived in estonia for 10 years they said 
estonians should get first crack at new apartments said 
zakariadze 
the soviet communist partys central committee was scheduled to 
hold a plenum on nationality problems in july at which the baltic 
dispute would be on the agenda but kremlin leaders have postponed 
the session while they grapple behind the scenes with the emotions 
that have boiled to the surface with the greater openness in the 
soviet union

the bush administration and congressional 
negotiators reached agreement thursday night on financing a 
sweeping 159 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry 
after senate republicans torpedoed a democratic plan 
the compromise was reached after a series of fastpaced 
developments in which president bush threatened to veto the bill 
the democraticcontrolled house ignored him in on a 221199 vote in 
favor of it and senate democrats fell six votes short of mustering 
the 60 needed to complete action 
that automatically tossed the bill back into a housesenate 
conference committee which locked up the deal after 11 pm 
approval is expected by the full senate and then the house on 
friday the last day before the august colngressional vacation 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady and white house budget 
director richard darman accepted a compromise proposal splitting 
the cost of the bailout so that only 40 percent of the 50 billion 
needed immediately would balloon the federal deficit 
the deal calls for the treasury to borrow 20 billion this year 
raising the estimated deficit from 149 billion to 169 billion 
and borrowing by a new agency to raise the 30 billion balance next 
year and the year after without counting that in the official 
deficit 
obviously weve only had an opportunity to make a quick 
review but based on that review in the spirit of which the 
president sent us here which was one of compromise we accept 
brady said 
the compromise was approved on a 2622 vote among house members 
of the conference committee despite vehement objections from rep 
dan rostenkowski chairman of the taxwriting house ways and means 
committee sen paul sarbanes dmd was the only one of the five 
senate negotiators to vote against the deal 
all of the money would be used to close some 500 insolvent sampls 
the bulk of them in texas and pay off savers whose federally 
insured deposits were lost through failed an often fraudulent loans 
the administration and congress had reached agreement long ago 
on the bulk of the legislation directing a massive overhaul of the 
industrys structure and regulation in an effort to prevent a 
recurrence of the cisis 
but a confrontation over the financing which one democrat 
characterized as a game of chicken had threatened to blow the 
deal apart 
with sampl losses mounting at a rate of 20 million to 30 million 
a day both the administration and congressional leaders were 
adamant in their demands that the fix be approved before the 
vacation recess 
ninety percent of the people want to get out of here said 
rep joe moakley dmass chairman of the house rules committee 
they have reservations for vacation 
darman earlier had called the 20 billion30 billion 
onbudgetoffbudget split conceptually sound but declined to 
give it a blanket endorsement without a vote on it among the 
congressional negotiators 
prior to thursday night the administration has steadfastly 
demanded that all of the bailouts costs be raised 30year bonds 
issued outside the normal treasury borrowing process and outside 
the official deficit 
the bill also would institute a major overhaul of the 
governments regulation of the nations nearly 3000 thrifts and 
require their owners to put billions of dollars more of their own 
money at risk 
both of them are turkeys sen jake garn rutah said of 
the alternative bush and democratic plans for raising the bailouts 
costs its a question of the lesser of two evils 
democrats contended bushs plan would increase the cost by 150 
million a year over the next three decades because the bonds would 
carry higher interest rates than normal us treasury obligations 
rep charles schumer dny described the dispute as 
politics plain and simple 
the only difference now is they republicans do not want the 
deficit number to go up the first year of the bush 
administration he said if it did not cost any money to not 
tell the truth that would be fine but not telling the truth is 
going to cost 45 billion to 60 billion 
bush issued his veto threat early in the day shortly before the 
house began debating the bill that has been months in the drafting 
if the conference report is presented to me in its current 
form i will veto the bill he said while 
grammrudmanhollings is not perfect it represents the only 
available institutional requirement for fiscal discipline by the 
congress and the executive branch 
over the next 10 years the costs including interest would 
rise to 159 billion according to the latest administration 
estimates the interest costs over future years push the 
threedecade total for the rescue to more than 285 billion 157 
billion of it from taxpayers 
sampls would have to devote more of their lending to home 
mortgages their investments in risky real estate ventures would be 
curtailed and their purchases of junk bonds would be outlawed 
it also would remove five decades of prohibitions on bank 
ownership of sampls enabling banks to buy out their most competitive 
lending market rivals in many communities 
a new government agency the resolution trust corp would be 
established to dispose of between 100 billion and 400 billion in 
real estate and other property falling into the governments 
custody 
the property was used as collateral behind loans that defaulted 
when real estate markets particularly in the southwest 
collapsed with declining oil prices contributing to the failure of 
more than 200 sampls last year alone

an expert in cutting through gobbledygook is 
offering some free advice on how to cut the federal deficit and 
ease taxpayer anxieties simplify federal tax forms 
further simplification of tax forms and instructions without 
compromising technical accuracy is possible says janice 
redish a linguist the payoff would far exceed the investment 
such a project has the potential to collect billions of 
dollars in taxes that are not now paid and the potential to change 
the publics perception of the irs and of government in general 
ms redish said thursday to the house ways and means subcommittee 
that oversees the internal revenue service 
ms redish who recently wrote a userfriendly owners 
manual for the ford taurus cited the basic 1040 the most common 
individual form as visually overwhelming and incredibly crowded 
it has 65 numbered items and several unnumbered ones all 
on one piece of paper boxes on the left for some items and on 
the right for others it means that irs uses small type for most 
lines and then condenses that type even further to fit all the 
words in other lines she said 
she got no argument from the subcommittee chairman jj pickle 
dtexas had the ways and means hearing room decorated for the 
occasion with a copy of each of the 392 federal tax forms enough 
paper he said to produce a stack thicker than the district of 
columbia yellow pages 
do you need so many pickle asked a panel of irs officials 
im afraid so replied arthur altman who is in charge of 
the agencys tax forms coordinating committee 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr said that as a result of 
the big tax overhaul that congress enacted in 1986 the agency had 
to create 88 new forms and revise 162 others 
so much for simplification pickle complained 
our tax forms and publications are often the first and 
sometimes the only contact taxpayers have with the service 
goldberg said the irs has no interest in making tax forms 
complicated 
goldberg said the irs is constantly reviewing to determine how 
forms and publications can be simplified 
in the works now he said are a simplified form 1040a for older 
taxpayers which will include new lines for retirement income and 
a study to determine why only about onequarter of the taxpayers 
who were eligible to shift from the long form 1040 to a shorter 
form did so this year 
also he said there will be a study that could lead to an 
overhaul of the w2 form on which wages are reported by employers 
and new publications offering tax guidance for the military and for 
students

washington a government task force will study possible design 
changes in dc10s and other widebody airliners that will allow 
pilots to retain control after an engine blowup or other inflight 
failure 
the faa announcement thursday of the government and industry 
task force came two weeks after the crash of a united airlines 
dc10 that killed 111 people in sioux city iowa an explosive 
engine failure apparently destroyed the planes hydraulic flight 
controls 
the agency said similar incidents involving a japan air lines 
boeing 747 in 1985 and an eastern airlines l1011 in 1981 indicate 
design changes may be needed to further protect flightcontrol 
systems in flight 
all three planes each built by a different manufacturer lost 
hydraulic power that controls wing and tail surfaces 
meanwhile sen howard metzenbaum dohio called for the faa to 
consider grounding all dc10s 
in a letter to the agency metzenbaum cited news accounts saying 
that lives might have been saved in the iowa crash if the dc10 had 
four rather than three hydraulic systems or a shutoff valve to 
prevent hydraulic fluid loss 
if these allegations are true the faa should ground all 
dc10s and correct their design flaws immediately metzenbaum 
said 
tony broderick head of faa safety regulations said the planes 
would not be grounded 
there are no design flaws in the dc10 or any other aircraft 
presently flying that warrant grounding he said 
about the task force broderick said that safety improvements to 
protect flight control systems are within the realm of technical 
and economic feasibility 
the task force he said will include experts from the faa 
airlines manufacturers industry groups and foreign aviation 
safety officials the review eventually will cover all airliners 
that rely on hydraulic controls including those built by mcdonnell 
douglas boeing lockheed and the european airbus consortium he 
said 
failure of hydraulic systems broderick said indicates the need 
for considering an extra level of safety in airliners the task 
force will be asked to come up with a system or a modification of 
existing systems to allow an airliner to fly and land safely even 
with complete hydraulic failure 
the faa approves design construction testing and operation of 
all planes used by us carriers many foreign governments follow 
its lead 
the faa said the study also would cover engine design with an 
eye toward possibly preventing crippling damage to an aircraft in 
the event of an engine explosion 
in the iowa crash the faa said the center engine apparently 
ruptured sending shrapnel through the engine casing disabling the 
primary hydraulic system and its two backups 
the japan crash also involved a loss of control after a rear 
pressure wall ruptured knocking out part of the vertical 
stabilizer and rudder the faa said 
in the l1011 incident the plane landed safely after parts of 
its center engine penetrated the fuselage and three of its four 
hydraulic systems were cut and the fourth damaged broderick said 
the faa requires that jet engines be built to contain fragments 
of fans compressors or turbine blades that may break off in 
flight but the agency says its regulation recognizes that there 
is no practical way to contain the parts on which the blades are 
mounted the disks when they fail because of their weight and 
the speed at which they travel

fewer major airline flights are arriving on 
time according to the latest transportation department consumer 
report 
the department said thursday that the 13 largest domestic 
carriers reported 722 percent of their flights arrived on time in 
june compared with 795 percent for may 
the department said east coast weather was largely to blame 
delays caused by mechanical problems are not counted in the monthly 
air travel consumer report 
the report showed a surge in complaints to the government about 
airlines with 1119 received in july a 30 percent increase over 
june complaints 
the overall trend however continued to be a decline with july 
complaints down 43 percent from the 1969 filed for the same month 
last year 
the department keeps a file of consumer data on performance of 
specific flights airlines and airports much of the information is 
made available through travel agents

the food and drug administration is 
investigating another drug company to determine whether it 
misrepresented samples of one of its products to win fda approval 
bolar pharmaceutical co inc of copiague ny said thursday 
that it unequivocally denies that any of the research 
formulation manufacture or testing of its generic version of 
dyazide was compromised 
the allegation of possible fraud came from rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of a house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee which started the probe into the fdas generic drug 
division 
he said documents obtained by the panel from a baltimore testing 
laboratory show that bolar may well have substituted samples of 
the originally approved brandname dyazide made by smithkline 
beecham for its own generic version to win fda approval 
in june another company vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of 
springfield gardens ny told the fda its company employees 
appear to have switched samples of its generic dyazide with the 
brandname product to gain approval 
vitarine and bolar are the only two companies that won fda 
approval to market generic versions of the popular hypertension 
drug a combination of hydrochlorthizide and triamterene 
last month par pharmaceutical inc of spring valley ny 
recalled its generic version of the high blood pressure drug 
maxzide because samples of the product were misrepresented in a 
government inspection 
in each of the cases the fda and the companies have said they 
have found no evidence of safety problems with the drugs though 
fda officials say there are concerns the drugs may be less 
effective than they were supposed to be 
bolar vitarine and par are among 11 drug makers being 
investigated by the fda 
agency spokesman jeff nesbit said the fda is analyzing drug 
samples bolar submitted to the baltimore lab and that though the 
results are not final the preliminary data has raised some 
questions 
generic drugs are lowercost versions of brandname products 
whose patents have expired before they are approved for sale the 
fda requires that tests show they are chemically equivalent to the 
brandname products 
dyazide and its generic competitors are among the most widely 
prescribed drugs in the country 
before its first generic competition appeared in 1987 dyazide 
sales were more than 300 million annually however when bolar 
pharmaceutical put its generic version on the market smithklines 
dyazide sales dropped 45 percent to 200 million in 1988 
according to philadelphiabased smithkline 
bolar reported overall sales for the first half of 1989 of 698 
million its generic dyazide is the companys largest selling drug 
said patricia shukri a bolar vice president she declined to say 
what the companys generic dyazide sales were but said it was less 
than half of total product sales 
dingell said the testing lab pharmakinetics laboratories 
conducted a visual examination on bolars samples and compared them 
to smithklines just as the lab had done in the case of vitarine 
as with vitarine pharmakinetics found a color difference 
between the samples tested in a bioequivalency study and samples 
from more recent batches of the product according to memos from 
lab officials that were turned over to the subcommittee 
bolar said in its statement that the company reaffirms its 
complete faith in the safety effectiveness bioequivalence and 
quality of the product the test data submitted to fda to gain 
approval reflect that bolars formulation is equivalent to 
dyazide 
dingells subcommittee has been investigating fraud and 
corruption in the generic drug division of the fda for months 
information the panel uncovered and turned over to the us 
attorney in baltimore has resulted in charges against several drug 
companies and their officials as well as fda employees

two centuries after the united states was 
founded as a largely agricultural nation nearly ninetenths of the 
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas the census 
bureau reports 
almost half of all americans reside in just 37 major urban 
areas the bureau said thursday in a new analysis of the patterns 
of growth and the metropolitan share of the population is growing 
faster than that in rural areas 
the rural renaissance reported in the 1970s when small towns 
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended with increases in 
cities and suburbs now well in the lead 
the census study found that about 86 percent of the nations 
population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially 
designated metropolitan areas across the country that pattern 
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has 
been common since the era of the great depression the bureau 
reported 
the analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all 
americans 489 percent reside in the 37 metro areas with 
populations of a million or more 
led by new york and los angeles these metro areas had 119 
million residents in 1987 the bureau said 
new jersey leads the way as the only state entirely included 
within metropolitan areas the bureau noted the northern portion 
of the state is included in the greater new york metro area while 
the southern portion is part of the philadelphia region 
seven other states have more than 90 percent of their 
populations in metropolitan areas california maryland 
connecticut rhode island florida massachusetts and new york 
idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent 
of its residents in urban areas the report added 
reflecting the nations overall population trend metropolitan 
area growth has tended to flow to the south and west in recent 
years the census bureau observed in its study of growth patterns 
between 1980 and 1987 
the population loss experienced in the northeast during the 
1970s has halted in this decade the agency found while the 
midwest has continued to have net losses in recent years 
a slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in 
much of the interior of the united states especially in 
nonmetropolitan areas noted the report prepared by donald e 
starsinic and richard l forstall 
during this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10 
contiguous states ohio west virginia indiana illinois iowa 
minnesota north dakota south dakota nebraska and kansas the 
bureau pointed out 
the nations metro areas with 1 million or more residents as of 
july 1 1987 were new york 180 million los angeles 135 
million chicago 81 million san francisco 59 million 
philadelphia 59 million detroit 46 million boston 41

the agriculture department says 1988 grain 
shipments from the united states remained of high quality even 
though drought cut yields 
the report by the federal grain inspection service released 
thursday compared inspection records from 1988 and previous years 
for wheat corn soybeans and other grains 
the report said wheat moisture decreased or remained the same 
for all lots except hard red spring wheat for hard red spring 
wheat the average moisture was 119 percent up from 118 percent 
in 1987 
wheat represented 36 percent of the total 1157 million metric 
tons of grains and oilseeds exported in 1988 
nearly half the 42 million metric tons of exported wheat was 
hard red winter wheat 19 percent white wheat 15 percent hard red 
spring wheat 14 percent soft winter wheat 2 percent durum and 
less than 1 percent mixed wheat 
the report said corn moisture and the amount of damaged kernels 
decreased but there was a small increase reported in broken corn 
and the presence of foreign material 
corn represented 407 percent of the total metric tons of grains 
and oilseeds exported in 1988 except for a fraction almost all 
was yellow corn 
soybeans showed an increase in test weight and a decrease in 
amount of damaged kernels but an increase in the amount of foreign 
material and split soybeans 
soybeans accounted for 157 percent of total exports of grains 
and oilseeds in 1988 the report said 
the other products are sorghum barley sunflower seeds rye 
flaxseed and oats

the securities and exchange commission has filed 
a complaint charging two companies and 14 people with running a 
penny stock scam that bilked investors of at least 10 million 
the complaint filed thursday in us district court in chicago 
alleges the defendants secretly controlled the stock of the two 
companies and artificially raised the share price before selling at 
large profits 
when investors discovered that the companies had little or no 
real assets they were left holding the bag said stanley 
whitten chief investigator for the secs chicago office 
the sec is seeking a injunctions against the two companies gss 
venture capital corp and max inc and the 14 persons named in the 
complaint for violating federal securities laws whitten said 
he refused to say whether other federal agencies were pursuing 
criminal charges against those named in the sec complaint 
buying and selling shares in the two companies which were not 
listed on any exchange effectively ended after the sec suspended 
trading for ten days in june 1987 whitten said 
gss venture capital corp listed marina del rey calif as its 
headquarters although it was previously based in ft lauderdale 
fla and max inc gave orem utah as its headquarters whitten 
said there were no telephone listings for either company 
he said the sec also filed a motion to freeze the assets of the 
companies and the alleged ringleaders of the operation arnold 
kimmes of rancho palos verdes calif thomas quinn of new york 
city and michael wright of salt lake city 
quinn is being held by authorities in france for his alleged 
involvement in fraudulent business deals in that country whitten 
said 
the sec complaint alleges that the two companies were created by 
kimmes quinn wright and others involved in the scheme 
the complaint charges them with secretly buying the stock in an 
initial offering and then artificially boosting the price through 
such fraudulent means as announcing impending mergers that never 
happened whitten said 
they also allegedly coordinated the buying and selling of shares 
to investors at huge profits he said 
before trading in both companies was suspended maxs stock 
climbed from an original price of 15 cents per share in 1985 to a 
high of 6 per share while stock in gss rose from an initial share 
price of 15 cents in 1986 to more than 3 whitten said 
investors around the country who heard about the companies 
through news releases that the firms put out invested more than 10 
million in both companies only to find their shares were worthless 
he added 
others named in the complaint are michael kimmes arnold

prosecutors say losses suffered by victims of the 
illegal schemes that resulted in charges against traders at 
chicagos futures markets were significant but at least two 
investors expressed surprise to learn they had been bilked 
the exchanges meanwhile still feeling the sting of indictments 
against 46 traders wednesday took steps to implement tougher rules 
and penalties and increase scrutiny of the trading floor 
the head of the chicago mercantile exchange said thursday the 
measures were intended to put the fear of god into the 
membership 
the chicago board of trade took out fullpage ads in todays 
editions of several newspapers including the new york times and 
the washington post in them the exchange promises to investigate 
all reports of wrongdoing and take disciplinary action against 
those found guilty 
and the chicago suntimes reported in todays editions that more 
than 100 additional traders will be indicted this year as a result 
of the investigation according to unnamed defense and government 
sources 
david neisler of el paso ill identified in the indictments as 
one of the customers victimized by the illegal trading practices 
said thursday i dont know what to make of the whole thing 
neisler said he has used the futures markets for nearly 20 years 
as a hedge against his investment in the soybean crop he grows on 
part of a 1500acre family farm 
i dont suppose ill know how much is gone until this goes 
through trial neisler said but its like somebody telling you 
that you got gypped when you bought clothes at the department store 
not too long ago and not telling you much else he said 
you dont know how much you dont why you just know youve 
been gypped 
peter gerlikas another investor identified in the indictments 
said he lost 6000 in a year and had heard talk of illegal trading 
activities from friends at the board of trade 
id heard rumors but i traded through a reputable company and 
i didnt figure this would touch me said gerlikas a 31yearold 
who runs a string of small businesses from his home in the 
northwest chicago suburb of palatine 
looking back now i have no real way of knowing how much if 
any of the 6000 was taken through illegal trades 
gerlikas said however he might return to the merc in the 
future 
therell always be dishonesty he said but ive got a 
feeling theyre going to clean things up this time around 
both exchanges sought to get started with the cleanup thursday 
the integrity of the markets and public confidence in them is 
our highest priority leo melamed chairman of the mercs 
executive committee said at a news conference if we falter in 
this responsibility we will lose the right of selfregulation 
trading practices in the chicago markets have come under severe 
scrutiny from federal regulators and politicians since the 
disclosure earlier this year of the 2year federal undercover 
investigation that led to the indictments 
rule changes enacted and proposed by the markets which for the 
most part regulate their own trading practices appear to be aimed 
not only at cracking down on wrongdoing but also heading off 
possibly tougher restrictions by lawmakers and regulators 
one new rule adopted by the merc calls for automatic expulsion 
of any trader found guilty of a second offense involving a 
customers account 
thats what we meant by putting the fear of god into the 
membership said melamed 
but the most significant rule change approved by the mercs 
board of governors requires membership approval it would severely 
limit dual trading in which a trader is allowed to trade on his 
own account as well as those of customers 
that practice made possible many of the frauds alleged in the 
indictments prearranged trades order crossing in which a trader 
crosses buy and sell orders rather than bring them to the 
competitive auction process of the pit and frontrunning where a 
trader trades on his own account in advance of a large customer 
order knowing the price of a commodity will rise or fall because 
of the order following it 
the board of trade issued a similar response late wednesday 
proposing tougher regulations penalties and surveillance measures 
the indictments accused traders of systematically conspiring to 
skim profits from customer accounts and attempting to hide earnings 
from the internal revenue service 
in announcing the indictments us attorney anton valukas 
called the amount customers may have lost by fraud significant 
but declined to specify the amount 
brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers 
accounts were alleged to have routinely and illegally cheated 
customers with the cooperation of locals traders who traded 
only for their own accounts 
eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating the 
federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act which 
carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison the law also 
empowers the government to freeze defendants assets before trial 
for seizure upon conviction 
fourteen of those charged already have agreed to plead guilty 
and cooperate with investigators according to government sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity

convincing mexicans to keep their 
savings inside the country is essential for mexicos economic 
recovery says president carlos salinas de gortari 
salinas inaugurated the fifth national banking meeting here 
thursday with a plea to bankers to improve the quality of 
attention that customers receive 
increasing savings and providing credit to lower income groups 
is part of your responsibility he told bankers 
during the past few months mexicans brought back 23 billion 
deposited in foreign banks helping to boost the countrys foreign 
reserves to 6 billion said miguel mancera general director of 
the bank of mexico the countrys central bank 
mancera told the nearly 1500 banking and government officials 
from mexico the united states and other countries that the first 
half of 1989 saw an abundant repatriation lured by high interest 
rates 
it is estimated that mexicans have 28 billion in foreign banks 
mostly in the united states 
to entice more people to bring back deposits the government 
announced this week a plan to only minimally tax repatriated funds 
we mexicans must finance our own development we can 
accomplish that by saving more and increasing income to the country 
through exports of manufactured products salinas said 
mancera said mexicos balance of payments showed a 585 million 
deficit through july which he called relatively modest 
considering the circumstances 
mexico paid out 600 million to service its public debt and 700 
million on private debt service he said 
during the same period mancera said net foreign direct 
investments totaled 900 million 
the twoday meeting held for the second consecutive year in 
this northern industrial capital follows a july 23 accord between 
mexico and private bank creditors to restructure 54 billion of its 
107 billion foreign debt

a bank dedicated to young customers is offering 
what it says is the firstever credit card for children 
young americans bank introduced the new credit cards thursday at 
a party marking the institutions second anniversary 
like most credit cards these have restrictions youngsters must 
talk a parent or other adult into cosigning and guaranteeing 
payment on their accounts 
although cardholders must be at least 12 years old and cannot 
exceed a 100 credit limit the bank will consider increasing 
credit limits and lowering age requirements for particularly 
creditworthy children said leanne cadman who heads the banks 
loan department 
otherwise the mastercards issued by united bank of denver are 
just like moms and dads monthly statements will tell kids they 
can make a minimum monthly payment or pay off the whole balance 
interest will accrue on the balance at the annual rate of 188 
percent cadman said 
young americans bank a fullservice statechartered and 
federally insured bank already offers checking accounts for 
children 12 or older in its two years of service it has signed up 
10000 depositors 
united bank of denver officials were on hand thursday to counsel 
young applicants about using credit cars 
we tell them they need to use credit cards with care and not 
to abuse them cadman said and of course we impress on them 
that whatever you charge you have to pay back

while many other stocks have reached or 
approached new highs of late shares of the big three us auto 
manufacturers have faced trouble getting into gear 
ford motor co for example traded late last week around 50 
down from the peak of 5675 it reached early this year 
chrysler corp in the neighborhood of 24 is going for barely 
half its 1987 high of 48 and general motors corp even with a 
recent spurt from the low 40s to 45 remains short of its 
early1989 high of 4737 
the groups laggard behavior is no puzzle to followers of the 
industrys fortunes car sales have been weak for some time now 
and production plans have been cut repeatedly for the remainder of 
the year 
indeed when wall street economists argue that the economy is 
headed for a recession the state of the auto industry is usually 
one of the first pieces of evidence they cite 
the weakness in the auto market has been quite obvious for 
months in disappointing car sales said kathleen heaney an 
analyst who follows the industry for nikko securities international 
in new york 
as a result the earnings of the big three will begin to 
reflect the strain 
some observers say the industry is paying a price for the 
marketing innovations that helped sell so many cars from the 
mid1980s through last year sales incentives such as rebates and 
cutrate financing and auto loans stretching out for periods as 
long as five years 
when consumers go shopping to replace cars bought with four or 
fiveyear loans they often find themselves with little equity in 
them to use toward a down payment on a new vehicle 
incentives are now the bane of every automaker selling cars in 
the us heaney says 
automakers have discovered that while they can no longer sell 
cars without some type of incentive this year they are learning 
that they cant even sell cars with incentives 
those problems aside many analysts argue that the industry was 
due for an inevitable down stage in its business cycle 
the longterm trend is for growth of the american car and truck 
fleet at about 13 percent a year the value line investment survey 
says in its latest quarterly report on the industry 
from 1984 through 1988 the advisory service says sales of 
vehicles surpassed that level using up a lot of demand we 
expect that unit sales comparisons will be negative through most of 
1989 wrote value lines mark leach 
all that doesnt mean however that everyone on wall street is 
down on the auto stocks viewed from a longterm perspective 
leach said industry fundamentals dont look all that bad 
the quality of domestically produced vehicles continues to 
rise and operating costs are being reduced all of which should 
ultimately lift earnings 
philip fricke an analyst at prudentialbache securities has 
just raised his ratings of the big three stocks 
we think the stocks are already discounting a severe sales and 
earnings decline next year which we dont think will happen he 
said 
the stocks tend to begin to outperform when the news 
background is bad when interest rates have peaked and are headed 
down and when a cyclical trough is in sight our call may be 
early but we think the greater risk is missing the move up 
says heaney although the outlook for the next year is not 
optimistic we would be looking for an opportunity to buy these 
stocks

the federal government has yet to buy a 
single apple under its 15 million bailout of the alarplagued 
industry but its emergency program is already a rousing success in 
the orchards 
the market for apples has improved so dramatically in the past 
month that there is speculation there will not be a surplus even if 
the government fails to buy any apples there could even be 
shortages 
retailers and industry officials credit the federal buyout plan 
announced july 7 with restoring consumer confidence in apples 
which jumped 20 percent in sales and as much as 50 percent in 
wholesale price last month 
the increase in sales is because of the added reassurance to 
the public said vicky sanders a spokeswoman for vons cos a 
chain of 342 food stores based in el monte calif 
the federal government is saying that apples are safe and i 
think it has had an effect on consumers said robert keeney an 
administrator of the agricultural marketing service of us 
department of agriculture which runs the program 
while the buyout already has had the desired effect of 
increasing sales and prices the agriculture department has no 
intention of halting planned purchases keeney said from washington 
dc 
if we dont go ahead it would have an adverse effect on the 
marketplace and we would certainly lose credibility with the 
industry keeney said 
recent statistics indicate the governments plan to purchase as 
many as 2 million 42pound boxes of apples is unnecessary 
in the past three weeks washington growers have shipped 27 
million boxes of apples out of state washington grows half the 
nations apples but has about 90 percent of the remaining us 
warehouse supply 
there were just 35 million boxes of apples left in the states 
warehouses as of aug 1 and if sales continued at the same rate as 
in july the entire surplus would be gone by the end of this month 
just as havesting of the 1989 crop begins 
but tom hale president of the washington state apple 
commission said it is wrong to assume that sales will remain so 
hat high in august when there is considerable competition from 
other fruits 
to expect that we could sell that volume in august would be 
fantasy land said hale noting such sales would break records 
for the month 
the average sales in august for the past six years have been 19 
million boxes said walt shields of the yakima valley 
growersshippers association 
the industry became worried this summer when warehouse 
inventories climbed to twice the norm as concern over alar 
depressed sales 
industry leaders aggressively pursued the federal apple purchase 
as a way to clean out warehouses and boost prices that had fallen 
below the cost of production 
the market was headed for a black hole and this probably 
prevented it from going into the black hole said derl derr 
president of the international apple institute in mclean va 
which represents many of the 20000 growers in the nations 1 
billion apple industry 
under the program apples and apple juice will be shipped to 
charitable organizations with the government reimbursing 
warehouses for the fruit 
keeney said 56 apple warehouses offered apples to the buyout 
program by wednesday under the program warehouses offer a certain 
number of apples and name a price the government will not pay more 
than 820 per box 
an announcement on exactly how many apples the government will 
buy and how much it will spend will come tuesday keeney said 
the industrys troubles were created by the alar controversy 
that began in february when a consumer group said eating apples 
treated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in 
children that report by the natural resources defense council has 
been disputed but its impact on the market was undeniable 
prices for the top grade of red apples fell to 8 per box but 
since the government announcement they have risen to between 10 
and 12 per box prices well above the ceiling of 820 the 
government intends to pay

gerald lemaster has never visited japan 
but this year 75 percent of his income will come from growing 
buckwheat used to make japanese pasta 
through a contract with a japanese trading association lemaster 
directs the processing and shipment of midwestgrown buckwheat 
including a crop from his own farm in indiana 
he is one of a small group of american brokers with contracts to 
produce buckwheat for the japanese his oneyear deal with the 
buckwheat millers association to produce 22000 acres in indiana 
and ohio will pay him 9 per 100 pounds 
its a growing business last year just 25 percent of his 
income came from buckwheat production 
the japanese consume about 250000 tons of buckwheat a year 
mostly in the form of a noodle called soba a staple in their diet 
soba is made from a mixture of 30 percent to 50 percent 
buckwheat flour and hard red wheat flour 
they tell me buckwheat flour has more protein its a sweeter 
flour and gives it an added flavor lemaster said in an interview 
on his farm near portland a rural community about 100 miles 
northeast of indianapolis 
lemaster started growing buckwheat almost as an afterthought in 
1981 when rain threatened to keep him from planting 600 acres of 
soybeans 
i just thought wed feed it to livestock if nothing else he 
said but we started marketing it to some flour mills 
buckwheat is an attractive crop to farmers because of its short 
growing time and ability to produce a better crop on poor soils 
lemaster said 
its white flowers bloom four to six weeks after planting in 
midjuly and the crop matures in about 10 weeks a farmers 
investment is typically 2030 an acre lemaster said 
were not competing with any of the other crops lemaster 
said not only is it a profit to farmers it enhances the soil 
the following year 
as a protein source nutritionists say buckwheat is nearly 
unbeatable and unlike other crops its mostly free of chemicals 
twothirds of the buckwheat used in japan is produced in china 
but the recent civil unrest there has caused the japanese to search 
for alternate suppliers lemaster said 
in canada a large buckwheat producer the government subsidizes 
freight costs but the countrys cold weather has hurt crops 
the only reason were getting it instead of them is because we 
have a lot less chance of losing a whole crop lemaster said 
down here were just about guaranteed of a crop every year 
since 1981 weve only had one year where weve had a total failure 
and we were delayed over 45 days at harvest 
lemaster expresses pride in his family run farm which employs a 
handful of outsiders a rolex watch on his arm and a seldomused 
pleasure boat in his yard are evidence of lemasters success 
he said he wants to see buckwheat qualify for the federal export 
enhancement program which provides support to make certain crops 
more competitive in foreign markets 
we can be more competitive in price still maintain a good 
price to our farmers and wed probably be looking at 80000 acres 
through the corn belt region he said 
lemaster said hes been working with representatives of the 
buckwheat millers association and the other american brokers to 
arrange a meeting with indiana gov evan bayh to discuss export 
enhancement and crop insurance 
we tell all of our growers how important it is to keep the 
buckwheat clean and free from other grains because if we want their 
business we have to maintain a high standard of quality he said 
end adv for monday aug 7

the nations unemployment rate fell one notch 
to 52 percent in july as businesses added 169000 new jobs despite 
the slowing economy the government reported today 
the labor department said the growth was again found 
predominantly in the serviceproducing sector of the economy which 
added 140000 of the new jobs 
the civilian joblessness rate declined from the 53 percent 
reported for june the government also revised its figures on new 
jobs created in june to 250000 up sharply from the 180000 
reported last month 
we have a soft economy but one that appears to have been 
stronger in july than in may and june said chief economist allen 
sinai of boston co economic advisers inc this certainly should 
ease fears of imminent recession 
michael boskin the bush administrations top economic adviser 
said the report suggests the economy is continuing to expand 
he said the july job growth brought to 20 million the number of new 
jobs created during the recordlong expansion which began in late 
1982 
todays report contained further evidence of persistent wage 
inflation 
the department said hourly earnings of production and 
nonsupervisory workers increased 08 percent in july about twice 
the rate analysts had predicted while average weekly earnings 
climbed by 17 percent the jump in hourly earnings followed two 
months of modest increases 
goodsproducing industries added 29000 new positions as 
construction posted a gain of 35000 jobs helping to offset a 
decline of more than 10000 jobs in the automobile industry 
manufacturing posted a modest gain of 3000 jobs last month 
after three months of declines according to the labor departments 
survey of business establishments 
in all 1174 million americans were at work in nonfarm jobs 
last month the government said 
the average work week for production and nonsupervisory 
employees in private industry increased by 03 hours to 349 
hours the factory work week held steady at 41 hours and overtime 
in july averaged 39 hours a week up from 38 hours in june the 
labor department said 
the jump in hourly earnings brought average hourly pay in the 
private sector to 970 on a seasonally adjusted basis up from 
962 in june 
weekly earnings rose to an average of 33853 from the june 
average of 33285 
the government said the summer expansion of the youth labor 
force in the past four months has totaled about 31 million about 
the same as recent years despite a significant drop in the youth 
population 
the unemployment rate fell last month despite a dip in the 
number of americans at work from 1175 million to 1174 million 
the rate fell because the 169000 new jobs were created in a month 
in which the civilian labor force the number of people who have 
jobs or are looking for them fell by 146000 
evidence of a number of recent economic developments could be 
found in todays unemployment report the first comprehensive look 
at the economys performance in july 
the data showed employment in the mining industry fell by 11000 
jobs the result of a coal strike in virginia west virginia and 
kentucky that also has led to wildcat walkouts in other 
coalproducing states 
the rebound in construction coincides with reports showing a 
upswing in housing starts and home sales 
and the decline in auto manufacturing follows recent 
announcements by major automakers that they are cutting production 
bacause of sluggish sales 
the 140000 job growth in the serviceproducing sector came 
despite a 25000 drop in the number of government jobs 
elsewhere in that sector retail trade added 52000 jobs

jh whitney amp co under pressure from its 
bankers today cut its bid for prime computer inc by 74 million 
to 118 billion and prime accepted the new offer 
the new york venture capital firm said it will pay 20 a share 
for the outstanding common stock of natickbased prime down from 
its previous offer of 2150 a share 
after prime reported a 19 million quarterly loss last week 
whitney came under pressure from its main financing sources bank 
of boston and chemical bank to line up additional funds to ensure 
that it could ride out a period of continued losses 
whitney said thursday it had been unable to obtain the 
additional financing at 2150 per share and was entering 
negotiations with prime to reduce the offer 
don e ackerman a whitney partner said today whitney has 
informed prime that our financing sources have furnished us 
financing commitments at 20 per share 
in a statement prime chairman david j dunn said the board 
of directors of prime is very disappointed that jh whitney and 
its financial sources have not completed the 2150 per share offer 
agreed to in the original merger agreement 
however dunn said the board believed the amended whitney offer 
remained economically superior to a competing offer from mai basic 
four inc of tustin calif and recommended that prime 
shareholders accept it 
prime a manufacturer of minicomputers and computeraided design 
and manufacturing systems last month agreed to merge with whitney 
while fending off the hostile bid from mai 
mai a computer firm controlled by new york investor bennett s 
lebow had originally offered 20 a share for prime but cut its 
offer on june 1 to 1950 a share 
whitneys new offer of 20 a share applies to primes 495 
million outstanding common shares which represent about 79 percent 
of the companys stock on a fullydiluted basis whitney has 
offered to exchange securities with a face value of 22 per share 
for the remaining 21 percent of primes shares

call it the latest summer brownout 
brown suits are making a fresh appearance this year minus the 
twotone shoes and natty hats spats and cravats that your 
grandfather wore with them 
clothiers say the modern brown suit is subtler than its ancestor 
and usually has a strong tinge of blue or gray the official colors 
of the corporate office 
about 5 percent of hart schaffner amp marxs mens suits this year 
are in brown or olive shades and that share could double in 1990 
according to robert e bruno executive vice president 
last year bruno said sales were minuscule 
similar increases are being posted by greif cos whose suit 
lines include perry ellis and chaps by ralph lauren and joseph amp 
feiss co maker of cricketeer suits 
theories for the trend range from the influence of european 
fashion to nostalgia for military uniforms to attempts by the 
clothing industry to drum up sales with a new look 
chocolate brown suits are still very out despite a blip in 
sales after ronald reagan wore them 
whats in is taupe a chameleonlike brownish gray that can 
range from pale to charcoal from reddish to bluish to greenish 
brown is coming back said rick pallack a clothier to the 
stars in sherman oaks calif whose clients include talk show host 
pat sajak 
basically browns never been an important color in this 
country but taupe with off shades of different colorations that 
could be big if the retailer gets behind it said jack bier 
vice president of greif cos 
clothing manufacturers are disarmingly frank about their 
attempts to engineer interest in browns and olives to increase 
sales 
were trying to stimulate the business by obsoleting last 
years designs said bruno of hart schaffner amp marx 
jeffrey m moriber was spotted recently on manhattans 
fashionable 57th street wearing a goodlooking suit 
i would say it has a brown cast with blue influence said 
moriber creative director of a public relations agency i like 
it because it has a subtle pattern it can go either way it has 
blue tones as well as warm tones 
dressing advice books say a man in a brown suit wont be taken 
seriously but taupe may be another matter its peculiar beauty is 
that no one can quite describe it 
websters third new international dictionary says taupe comes 
from the latin talpa for mole and calls it a brownish gray that 
is paler and slightly yellower than chocolate duller and slightly 
redder than mouse gray and duller and slightly redder than 
castor 
we started seeing it about five years ago said rick white 
a salesman at the tailored man in san francisco it can have a 
green cast or an olive cast or a purple cast its hard to 
define 
for fall and winter taupe will carry on in its darker tones as 
a thread or accent color in a pinstripe windowpane or subtle plaid 
suit said tom julian associate fashion director of the mens 
fashion association of america 
europeans have always used a bigger palette of colors in mens 
suits and that influence is crossing the atlantic but the most 
interesting theory on the popularity of brown and olive is the 
military one 
men get a little leery of wearing things like taupes and 
olives when they just get out of the military right after world 
war ii or the korean conflict or the vietnam war you couldnt give 
away colors like that said sue smyth vice president for 
communications at joseph amp feiss 
now that the nation has been at peace for some time the bad 
feelings are gone she said there may even be some nostalgia 
still navy and gray are entrenched 
you cant push a man that quickly said bier of greif cos 
hes not in the same category as women we only made that mistake 
once in our business and thats with the nehru jacket

president bush today endorsed a compromise on 
his 159 billion savings and loan bailout lifting a veto threat 
after white house and congressional negotiators struck a deal in a 
latenight bargaining session 
this legislation has been developed in a bipartisan process 
it is badly needed and must be enacted without further delay 
bush said in a letter to congressional leaders i ask that the 
house and senate approve this legislation today 
house leaders scrambled to muster enough republican votes to 
compensate for defecting democrats unhappy with the pact opposing 
the deal were three influential committee chairmen reps dan 
rostenkowski dill of the ways and means committee john d 
dingell dmich of the energy and commerce committee and leon 
panetta dcalif of the budget committee 
the senate planned to vote on the deal first with leaders 
expecting passage by a wide margin house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash said despite opposition within his own party he was 
pushing for enactment in time to allow congress to leave for its 
summer vacation at the end of the day 
i think this bill needs to be passed foley said this is 
a compromise that we didnt prefer to make but because the 
president has been adamant we had to deal with that 
aides said they had collected signatures from 28 of the 55 house 
delegates to a conference committee that worked out the compromise 
late thursday night with help from treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady and budget director richard darman 
that was just enough to move the plan to the house floor but 
there were other procedural hurdles to be overcome before the house 
could act today 
foley said the compromise plan for financing the bailout will 
cost more than the method originally proposed by democrats but he 
added if we delay it or defeat it that will cost money 
the compromise would cost each american taxpayer an average 
total of 1000 over 30 years 
the administration and congress long ago agreed on the most 
important elements of the landmark bill which will close or merge 
hundreds of insolvent savings institutions hemorrhaging losses at 
an estimated 20 million a day 
it also contains a series of what bush labeled never again 
provisions designed to prevent the recurrence of what analysts 
describe as the worst financial crisis since the wave of bank 
failures in the 1930s 
in the key reform savings and loan owners will be required to 
raise billions of dollars of their own capital to discourage risky 
investments and act as a cushion between future losses and 
government deposit insurance funds 
thrift institutions will be channeled back into home mortgage 
lending and away from speculative commercial real estate ventures 
and highyield highrisk junk bonds 
the bill also gives the justice department 75 million a year to 
root out fraud at financial institutions permits banks for the 
first time to buy healthy institutions in the rival thrift 
industry and enacts the most sweeping restructuring of the 
regulatory bureaucracy in five decades 
the agency overseeing sampls the federal home loan bank board 
will be dismantled with one piece wrapped into the treasury 
department and the other coming under the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures commercial bank deposits 
while taxpayers will bear most of the bailout the savings 
industry also is contributing through higher deposit insurance 
premiums 
a dispute between the white house and congressional democrats 
over how to account for the taxpayer funds was the last snag 
shrugging off a morning veto threat the house at midday 
thursday voted 221199 to approve the legislation with its own 
financing plan but by evening the bill bogged down in the senate 
senators voted 5446 in favor of the house financing proposal 
but fell six votes short of the 60vote majority required under the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law 
that sent the bill to a housesenate conference which after 2 
hours of talks endorsed a compromise offered by four of the five 
senate delegates 
thursday nights compromise was a hybrid of two conflicting 
plans to evade automatic spending cuts under the grammrudman law 
democrats wanted to avoid the cuts by waiving the law 
the bush administration would have borrowed rescue money through 
a private agency keeping the spending out of the budget 
the compromise calls for raising 20 billion this year along the 
lines democrats had suggested ballooning the 1989 deficit from an 
estimated 148 billion to 168 billion the highest in three years 
however spending cuts would not be triggered because the deadline 
for meeting spending targets has passed 
the remaining 30 billion would be borrowed offbudget in 
1990 and 1991 as bush wanted and will not show up in the deficit 
darman questioned whether regulators could spend 20 billion 
before the end of the 1989 fiscal year on sept 30 but he called 
the compromise conceptually sound

soybean futures prices closed sharply higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade rebounding from a weeklong 
string of losses as traders evened up their positions ahead of the 
weekend 
grain futures also advanced partly in sympathy with soybeans 
and partly in reaction to a private cropproduction estimate 
pegging the 1989 corn and soybean harvests slightly below the 
agriculture departments latest projections 
soybeans for delivery in august had fallen a total of more than 
85 cents a bushel in the five previous sessions as growing 
conditions improved and supplies of newly harvested south american 
soybeans increased 
this rally was long overdue said walter spilka 
grainmarket analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york the market was oversold technically and it was just a 
matter of which day it would fall on 
he said many traders typically even up their positions on friday 
so they have no risk exposure over the weekend some of those who 
had sold at higher prices earlier in the week may have been buyers 
on friday 
another bullish factor was a report thursday on crop production 
estimates by sparks commodities inc a private analytical firm 
based in memphis tenn 
a financial news service reported that sparks had pegged the 
1989 us soybean harvest at 19 billion bushels and the corn crop 
at 73 billion bushels sparks would not confirm the report 
both reported estimates were slightly below the agriculture 
departments latest predictions the usda will issue new harvest 
projections in a crop report due out on thursday 
at the close wheat was 1 cent lower to cent higher with 
september at 387 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher 
with september at 219 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 4 cents 
higher with september at 140 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 
16 cents higher with august at 591 a bushel

pro football hall of famer roger staubach has 
joined the lineup of those backing eastern airlines strikers 
writing a letter to president bush saying that continued sales of 
eastern assets could bring the airlines eventual demise 
in a letter to bush dated aug 1 the former dallas cowboys 
quarterback asked that a meeting be set up as soon as possible 
between representatives of the eastern pilots union and roger 
porter bushs domestic policy adviser 
staubach wrote that his interest in the airline stemmed from 
personal relationships with many striking eastern pilots he said 
that group includes the best man at his wedding football teammates 
and classmates at the us naval academy where staubach also was a 
quarterback 
from his conversations with those friends and from all other 
accounts staubach wrote it is obvious that the eastern 
situation is far more than a traditional labormanagement dispute 
it goes to the very root of the free enterprise system within our 
country 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami said he had no comment 
on staubachs letter or speculation that the former football player 
might get involved in making a buyout offer for the company 
staubach who now runs a commercial real estate company in 
dallas didnt return a call seeking comment friday it wasnt 
immediately clear whether staubachs interest in eastern could 
extend to a possible bid for the crippled airline 
another sports figure former baseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth made a buyout bid for eastern in partnership with the 
unions in early april but the takeover agreement between ueberroth 
and frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
later fell apart over the unions demand that lorenzo be removed 
from daily control of the airline 
eastern pilots machinists union members and flight attendants 
are in the sixth month of a strike against the miamibased company 
which has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors since march 9 
the company is reorganizing as a smaller carrier selling 18 
billion in aircraft landing slots and other assets and hiring new 
pilots to replace the strikers 
easterns unions support an alternative buyout proposal by 
joseph ritchie a chicago businessman who has met at the white 
house with highlevel members of the bush administration 
on thursday the master executive council of easterns pilots 
union passed a resolution calling for pilots at carriers nationwide 
to undertake a temporary work stoppage to pressure congress to 
investigate lorenzos fitness to run eastern and its sister 
carrier continental airlines

market the selling binge in bonds drove interest yields higher and 
made the dollardenominated securities more attractive to global 
investors 
gold prices fell in us trading after finishing higher overseas 
the dollar remained well below the peaks reached in june in 
spite of its oneday surge which amounted to 19 percent against 
the west german mark british pound and japanese yen and an even 2 
percent vs the swiss franc

the younger brother of winemaking giants 
ernest and julio gallo has been denied a new trial in a trademark 
dispute that bars him from using the gallo name to sell cheese 
us district judge robert e coyle ruled friday that his 
association with a law firm that once represented the gallo winery 
is not a conflict of interest and that there is insufficient 
evidence to warrant a new trial 
the elder gallos sued the brother they raised after he began 
using the family name to sell cheese in the mid 1980s 
in his june 20 ruling coyle denied joseph gallo use of his full 
name as a trademark because consumers confused it with the famous e 
amp j gallo winery the ruling allows joseph gallo to use his name as 
a signature or in block letters if the label contains a prominent 
trademark without the gallo name 
a lawyer for joseph gallo joseph yanny argued in the retrial 
motion that his client didnt get a fair trial because coyles law 
firm represented gallo winery in a 1983 trademark dispute with 
gallo salame of san francisco 
coyle wrote in the decision that lawyers representing joseph 
gallo knew of his association with the law firm and hadnt 
objected when he was assigned the gallo cheese case 
coyle said he doesnt remember the earlier case which was 
settled before he became a district judge 
yanny also argued that the original ruling denied gallo his 
freedom of commercial speech as protected by the first 
amendment but coyle ruled that those arguments had been covered in 
the trial

los angeles investor alfred checchi signed 
the acquisition papers friday to complete his groups 365 billion 
buyout of nwa inc the parent of northwest airlines 
the 41yearold former marriott corp treasurer said all 
publicly held shares of nwa common stock have been purchased for 
121 each officially ending the takeover battle initiated by 
checchi in late march 
checchi has said he will spend some of his time at nwas eagan 
minn headquarters but will not take a management position steven 
rothmeier will stay on as the companys chief executive officer and 
chairman while checchi will become a board member a spokesman for 
the airline said 
as a result of the takeover moodys investors service announced 
friday it has lowered the senior debt ratings of nwa to singleb1 
from baa2 and of northwest to ba2 from singlea3 about 400 
million of longterm debt is affected the credit rating agency 
said 
checchis group described early on by rothmeier as a friendly 
suitor beat out at least three other bidders rival airline pan am 
corp the 20000member machinists union local at northwest and 
los angeles oil billionaire marvin davis who started the public 
bidding with an offer of 27 billion or 90 a share on march 28 
checchi who once worked for the bass brothers of fort worth 
texas financed the takeover with 700 million cash and another 
335 billion in financing from commercial banks led by bankers 
trust co equity partners include klm royal dutch airlines and 
elders finance group of australia neither of which are allowed a 
controlling interest under laws that limit foreign investment in 
us airlines 
the deal did not require government approval but checchis 
group will need an operating permit from the us transportation 
department which is conducting a financial fitness review of the 
new owners checchi has said it is laughable to think that the 
permit would be withheld 
he acquires an airline in the midst of tense contract talks with 
its 5000 pilots the pilots have been without a contract for about 
2 years and have asked the national mediation board to declare an 
impasse in the negotiations if the request is granted the pilots 
would be free to strike legally after a 30day coolingoff 
period 
checchi is depending on a steady cash flow to service the large 
takeover debt and a pilots strike could idle the carrier 
checchi also inherits an airline that earned the nickname 
northworst after a prolonged performance slump that followed 
the 1986 purchase of republic airlines the carrier has vastly 
improved its service however and earnings are on the rise 
after posting record earnings in 1988 of 135 million or 463 
a share nwa is positioned to surpass that mark it earned 833 
million or 282 a share in the first six months of this year 
of the 212 billion revenue passenger miles logged by 
northwests 314 planes in the first six months of the year 126 
billion miles were domestic and 73 billion were flown on routes to 
the pacific rim where northwest has the largest presence of any 
us carrier a revenue passenger mile represents one paying 
passenger flown one mile 
checchi has vowed to keep the companys headquarters in eagan a 
st paul suburb minutes from the minneapolisst paul international 
airport and he has said the jobs of the carriers 37590 employees 
are secure

theres no telling how many people will be 
indicted as a result of the ongoing federal probe into fraudulent 
trading at the worlds largest futures exchanges but it could be 
as many as 200 a defense lawyer said friday 
attorney george collins asked about a published report saying 
the next few months could bring an additional 100 indictments said 
the government could seek many more than that or less 
it could be as many as they want said collins who 
represents an indicted trader 
us attorney anton valukas office did not immediately return 
telephone calls but his office has consistently declined comment 
about the breadth of the investigation into trading at the chicago 
board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
they could potentially indict anybody who ever put a trading 
jacket on said defense attorney thomas durkin referring to minor 
violations i think it will go on for a couple of years 
the chicago suntimes reported in fridays editions that more 
than 100 additional indictments are expected this fall with 
charges ranging from minor infractions to major violations like 
those already charged 
meanwhile 25 of the 46 traders indicted wednesday were expected 
to cooperate with federal authorities in meetings next week the 
wall street journal reported in fridays editions 
a handful of traders had been cooperating for months and 14 
have agreed to plead guilty and help investigators federal sources 
have said 
collins said whether people decided to cooperate likely would be 
a matter of personal character the strength of evidence against 
them and whether they had information that was valuable to 
authorities 
its a matter of selling something valuable collins said 
youve got to sell something to get something he said 
some people as a matter of principle wouldnt even tell the truth 
to the government others would lie on their mothers to get out of 
it 
collins said his client bradley ashman would not cooperate 
ashman was indicted on one count of conspiracy under the federal 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 13 counts of 
violating the commodities exchange act and one count of making 
false statements to a government agent 
the indictments capped a 2year undercover investigation in 
which at least four fbi agents posed as traders at the two 
exchanges 
pleas were scheduled wednesday from 21 of those indicted before 
us district judge george m marovich who was assigned cases 
involving the japanese yen pit 
the 19 soybeanpit defendants were to be arraigned aug 25 
before us district judge william t hart 
three more traders were indicted for alleged activities in the 
bond pit and three others were accused of wrongdoing in the swiss 
franc pit 
in the indictments traders were accused of systematically 
conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts and attempting to 
hide earnings from the internal revenue service 
brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers 
accounts a practice called dual trading were alleged to have 
routinely and illegally cheated customers with the cooperation of 
locals or traders who traded only for their own accounts 
eighteen of the defendants charged wednesday are accused of 
violations of the rico act which carry penalties of up to 20 years 
in prison 
rico empowers the government to freeze defendants assets before 
trial and to seize them upon conviction if they are found to have 
been acquired through illegal means but the suntimes quoted 
government sources as saying prosecutors would not try to seize 
defendants homes

bond prices took their biggest dive in about 22 
months friday as a strongerthanexpected employment report jolted 
a market already bracing for a heavy supply of new treasury issues 
to be auctioned next week 
the yield of the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose above 8 
percent just a week after it finished the session below that level 
for the first time in more than two years 
the bonds price fell 2 points or more than 21 per 1000 
face amount while its yield which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price leaped to 807 percent from 790 percent late 
thursday 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer dropped 1267 to 118813 
that was the biggest oneday decline in that index since it fell 
1308 on oct 14 1987 five days before the stock market crash 
the trigger for the big price decline was the labor departments 
report on friday morning that businesses added 169000 jobs in july 
as the unemployment rate fell to 52 percent in addition the 
government revised upward its original estimate of job growth in 
june to 250000 from 180000 
elliott platt research director for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities said the job creation numbers indicated the economy has 
more resilience than some economists have expected 
it really brought the sellers out he said 
in recent days platt said the perception had been growing that 
the economy was slowing markedly and that the federal reserve may 
have to loosen its credit policy to avoid a recession 
but with the economy still expanding he said bond traders are 
now betting that the central bank will leave its policy unchanged 
for awhile 
robert brusca chief economist at nikko securities 
international said he doesnt buy the argument that the 
employment report was that strong 
he said the market is more concerned about absorbing the 295 
billion in new securities that the treasury plans to auction next 
week 
in addition he said the market is wary about the new supply of 
issues that may be headed its way as a result of a compromise 
between the white house and congress on a rescue package for the 
nations savings and loans 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell point to a full point intermediate maturities 
lost 1 point to 1 points and longterm issues fell as much as 2 
points according to telerate inc the financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
in corporate trading industrials fell moodys investment grade 
corporate bond index which measures total return on a portfolio of 
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer lost 
420 to 33110 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds dropped 716 point the average yield to 
maturity rose to 720 percent from 716 percent late thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 811 percent as the 
discount jumped 22 basis points to 785 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills rose to 811 percent as the discount rose 27 basis 
points to 770 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 805 
percent as the discount rose 33 basis points to 750 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 8 percent unchanged from late thursday

gold and silver futures prices fell sharply friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange as the dollar surged in value against other 
major currencies in reaction to the governments report on july 
unemployment 
on other markets the major agricultural commodities were higher 
while energy futures prices were mostly lower 
gold futures settled 540 to 6 lower with august at 36780 a 
troy ounce silver was 122 cents to 133 cents lower with 
september at 520 a troy ounce 
the labor departments report of a 52 percent jobless rate in 
july fell within the markets expectations and was considered 
neutral for the financial markets analysts said 
but the agencys revision of the june nonfarm payroll number 
showing a gain of 250000 jobs instead of 180000 indicated the 
economy was healthier than had previously been believed 
that revision obviously pointed toward the fact that while the 
economy has slowed down significantly it certainly is not pointing 
toward an imminent recession said peter cardillo an analyst 
with josephthal amp co in new york 
either way it means economic conditions do not favor 
metals he said theyll have to look to the dollar for 
direction 
the dollar skyrocketed and interest rates jumped in response to 
the report prompting a shift of investment dollars from the 
precious metals to interestbearing instruments 
soybean futures prices posted strong gains on the chicago board 
of trade rebounding from a weeklong string of losses as traders 
evened up their positions ahead of the weekend 
grain futures also advanced partly in tandem with soybeans and 
partly in reaction to a private cropproduction estimate pegging 
the 1989 corn and soybean harvests slightly below agriculture 
department projections 
soybeans for delivery in august had fallen a total of more than 
85 cents a bushel in the five previous sessions as growing 
conditions improved and supplies of newly harvested south american 
soybeans increased 
this rally was long overdue said walter spilka 
grainmarket analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york the market was oversold technically and it was just a 
matter of which day it would fall on 
wheat settled cent lower to cent higher with september at 
387 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with 
september at 219 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 4 cents higher 
with september at 140 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 16 
cents higher with august at 590 a bushel 
most live cattle futures climbed on buying spurred by strong 
cash markets higher cash hog prices supported the pork complex 
live cattle settled 20 cent to 62 cent higher with august at 
7417 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 43 cent higher 
with august at 8450 cents a pound live hogs were 28 cent to 90 
cent higher with august at 4680 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 65 cent to 128 cents higher with august at 2627 cents a 
pound 
crude oil futures sank on the new york mercantile exchange but 
the nearmonth contract failed to pierce 18 a barrel 
traders said volume was extremely light in an uneventful session 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 21 cents 
lower with september at 1803 a barrel heating oil was 11 cent 
lower to 06 cent higher with september at 4918 cents a gallon

in the wake of three consecutive quarterly losses 
prime computer inc on friday reluctantly recommended that its 
shareholders accept a buyout by jh whitney amp co for about 11 
billion 74 million less than whitneys previous offer 
primes board of directors said the merger was still preferable 
to selling its minicomputer business to mai basic four inc of 
tustin calif which has offered 525 million for the division 
whitney a new york venture capital firm said it would pay 20 
a share for primes outstanding common stock down from its 
previous offer of 2150 a share or about 12 billion 
the reduction in whitneys offer was not as drastic as wall 
street had anticipated and primes stock rose 112 cents a share 
to close at 1775 friday on the new york stock exchange 
an arbitrageur speaking on condition of anonymity said 
whitneys original offer had been widely viewed as untenable and 
the new offer was more realistic raising traders confidence that 
the deal would go through 
the board of directors of prime is very disappointed that jh 
whitney and its financial sources have not completed the 2150 per 
share offer said david j dunn primes chairman 
however after review of all the alternatives the board of 
directors believes that the revised jh whitney offer is the best 
economic alternative available for prime stockholders dunn said 
in a statement 
prime which makes minicomputers and computeraided design and 
manufacturing systems turned a profit of 19 million on sales of 
16 billion in 1988 but the cost of defending against a takeover 
and slow sales of minicomputers led to losses of 144 million in 
the final quarter of 1988 5 million in the first quarter of this 
year and 19 million in the second quarter 
whitney emerged last month as a white knight or friendly 
buyer to save prime from a hostile 970 million bid by mai basic 
four and its chairman new york takeover specialist bennett s 
lebow 
after prime reported the most recent 19 million loss last 
week whitney came under pressure from its main financing sources 
bank of boston and chemical bank to line up an additional 50 
million of financing to ensure that it could ride out a period of 
continued losses 
whitney said thursday it had been unable to obtain the 
additional financing at 2150 per share and was entering 
negotiations with prime to reduce the offer 
the revised offer of 20 a share applies to primes 495 million 
outstanding common shares which represent about 79 percent of the 
companys stock on a fullydiluted basis 
whitney has offered to exchange notes with a face value of 22 
per share for the remaining 21 percent of primes shares 
securities analysts said those notes would trade at a substantial 
discount and estimated the total value of the deal at 17 to 1850 
a share or 106 billion to 116 billion 
prime postponed its annual meeting from aug 9 to aug 24 to 
give stockholders time to consider the revised offer

civilian unemployment dipped a tick to 52 
percent in july the government said friday analysts say the data 
should ease fears of an imminent recession but heighten concerns 
about inflation 
joblessness was down from 53 percent in june with nonfarm 
businesses adding 169000 jobs the labor department said 
at the same time junes job growth was revised from 180000 to 
250000 additional evidence that the economy continues to grow 
though at a slower pace than last year 
this suggests an economy that is clearly clearly far from a 
recession said elliot platt senior vice president of donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette despite a lot of signs of economic weakness 
the labor market remains fairly strong 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said the report was good news and suggests the 
economy is continuing to expand 
while the job growth number provided encouraging news analysts 
were wary over data showing significant upward pressure on wages 
a welcome development for workers but a sign of stubborn inflation 
as well 
the labor department said average hourly earnings rose 08 
percent in july after increasing just 01 percent in the prior two 
months 
thats a very very powerful increase said platt 
ominous was the way boston co economic advisers inc chief 
economist allen sinai described the wage gains 
both agreed that julys wage increase should give pause to the 
federal reserve board which of late has relaxed monetary policy in 
hopes of fueling enough new growth to avert a recession 
there will be no more easing by the fed until after labor 
day said sinai 
the government said the unemployment rate fell last month even 
though civilian employment declined by 82000 people to 11745 
million the rate fell because of a larger decline of 146000 
people in the labor force the number of people who have jobs or 
are seeking employment 
the job growth again came predominantly in the service economy 
which accounted for 140000 of the 169000 new positions 
within services government employment was down by 25000 jobs 
but retail trade added 52000 wholesale trade 5000 
transportation and public utilities 23000 and finance insurance 
and real estate 11000 both business and health services posted 
modest gains the government said 
the goodsproducing sector added 29000 jobs with gains in 
construction and manufacturing offset somewhat by declines in 
mining and the automobile industry 
the 35000 boost in construction jobs came at the same time that 
housing starts and home sales were rebounding manufacturing posted 
a modest gain of 3000 positions after three consecutive monthly 
declines 
employment in the auto industry fell by 12000 jobs last monh 
after a decline of 16000 in june a slump coinciding with sluggish 
car sales 
employment in mining was down 11000 a figure heavily 
influenced by coal strikes in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
that have sparked wildcat actions in other coalproducing states 
the government said the average workweek for production and 
nonsupervisory employees in private industry increased by 03 
hours to 349 hours the factory work week held steady at 41 hours 
and overtime in july averaged 39 hours a week up from 38 hours 
in june the labor department said 
the jump in earnings brought average hourly pay in the private 
sector to 970 on a seasonally adjusted basis up from 962 in 
june 
the payroll and wage data are taken from the labor departments 
monthly survey of businesses a separate household survey found few 
major shifts in unemployment among demographic groups although 
joblessness among black teenagers fell to 274 percent last month 
from 365 percent in june the june total had been up from 324 
percent in may 
these were the july and june rates for other population groups 
adult white men 38 percent up from 37 
adult white women 43 percent up from 41 
white teenagers 134 percent up from 126 
adult black men 93 percent down from 94 
adult black women 99 percent down from 105 
hispanics 9 percent up fro 81 
a separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states was unchanged at 
52 percent

phillips petroleum co said friday it 
is seeking a new partner for a 100 million joint venture to 
explore for oil and natural gas in the united states after hyundai 
corp withdrew 
phillips hyundai and the overseas petroleum and investment 
corp signed a joint venture agreement april 3 to launch a 
threeyear 100prospect drilling venture 
following the signing the south korean government was to review 
the agreement for approval of hyundais investment in the project 
but the government did not give its approval to the korean company 
the south korean government wanted assurances that all 100 
prospects would be drilled in the threeyear period and phillips 
was not prepared to make that guarantee because of variables 
affecting oil exploration said jere smith a spokesman at phillips 
headquarters here 
smith said hyundai sought a subsidy from the south korean 
government to underwrite its participation in the project 
phillips was to bear 10 percent of the cost of the venture while 
45 percent each was to be provided by hyundai and opic an 
affiliated company of chinese petroleum corp of taiwan the 
taiwanese government has given its approval to opics participation 
smith said phillips is at least for now accepting the cost of 
hyundais part of the venture which already has begun with 11 
wells drilled or being drilled in the gulf of mexico california 
texas and elsewhere 
we have made provisions in case something like this

the agriculture department on friday announced 
details of 95 million in payments to apple growers under a 
program to combat surpluses arising from concern over use of the 
chemical alar 
under the plan 575 million pounds of fresh apples will be 
diverted by 56 growers in six states to an array of organizations 
requesting them including manufacturers of ethanol and livestock 
feed the department said 
the plan is designed to divert the apples from normal trade 
channels and thus without disrupting the market reduce a huge 
surplus that piled up during the first half of the year after an 
environmental group charged that alar posed an unacceptably high 
risk of cancer 
governmental officials say that apples are safe to eat and the 
environmental protection agency is taking steps to ban the use of 
alar which is sprayed on fruit to enhance red color extend 
storage life and make harvetsing easier 
the payments were awarded to bidders under a 15 million overall 
program to aid the industry that was announced july 25 by the 
department it said growers participating are located in 
connecticut new york maine pennsylvania utah and washington 
apples in the program will not be distributed through school 
lunch programs the department said 
it said producers will receive payments of 497 to 820 for 
40pound cartons of apples and from 945 to 1650 per 
hundredweight for apples in bulk bins

restore pan ams competitive position despite these unfortunate 
setbacks said chairman thomas g plaskett while our bid for

the securities and exchange commission on 
thursday accused two investors of a scheme to defraud more than 100 
brokerages including merrill lynch amp co inc prudentialbache 
securities inc and shearson lehman hutton inc 
in a civil lawsuit the sec says the investors jury matt hansen 
and fergus m sloan jr and their new york brokerage firm fermat 
associates committed fraud by buying millions of dolars worth of 
securities without having sufficient money to pay for them and 
selling them later the same day at a profit to cover their cost 
the new york times reported in fridays editions 
the illegal practice is known as free riding 
the sec also charges the toronto dominion bank violated federal 
banking regulations by providing the investors with credit although 
the two did not produce collateral the bank was not charged with 
fraud 
the sec said the investors through a partnership registered in 
panama graycliff international sa opened an account at the new 
york branch of toronto dominion the agency said the bank often 
covered the investors checks overnight when the funds in the 
account were insufficient 
the investors then opened 250 accounts at more than 100 
brokerages using 76 names the suit charges since december 1984 
the sec claims the defendants used this web of accounts to buy 
and sell securities on the same day 
the agency says the men earned more than 1 million through the 
scheme but left debts of 15 million at four brokerage houses at 
which they had steep losses steinberg amp lyman universal 
securities of america inc merrill lynch and dominick amp dominick 
the sec said it found no losses at any other brokerages 
calls to the investors office were answered by someone who 
identified himself as a temporary employee and said he had know 
knowledge of the sec suit the times reported a message left on 
sloans answering machine was not returned the newspaper said 
hansens home phone number is unlisted 
elliot schnapp a laywer representing the men said he belived 
the charges were without merit 
it appears to us that the sec is seeking to retroactively 
declare illegal a type of trading many investors and banks have 
engaged in for many years and not thought to be illegal he told 
the times 
he also denied that the men left debts at the four brokerages 
in response to an sec request a us district court judge in 
manhattan on thursday issued a temporary restraining order to stop 
the two men from continuing their investment activities the court 
also froze their assets 
in addition the court issued a temporary order to restrain the 
toronto bank from further violations of the credit extension 
provisions 
in a statement the bank said it had been cooperating with the 
sec for several months and was an innocent bystander in the areas 
under investigation
