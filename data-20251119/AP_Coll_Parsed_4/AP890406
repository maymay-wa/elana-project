terry trippet has done his best to make 
certain visitors to his worldfamous southfork ranch can see 
everything they believe texas has to offer 
he has installed a 183foottall oil derrick 
he has stocked lush pastures with a longhorn cattle and 
championship racehorses 
and as for a texas millionaire 
well he says he just walks around the grounds as often as he 
can 
trippets ranch about 25 miles northeast of dallas is the model 
for the ewing spread in the television series dallas 
the ranch with its stately white twostory ranchhouse and 
immense outbuildings is sometimes incorrectly placed in 
neighboring towns but trippet prefers the townname of southfork 
ranch and he lets everyone know its all his 
im the mayor and im the city council and im the building 
inspector he says wearing a sly grin thats shaded by a 3000 
cowboy hat thats the only way i could have gotten all these 
things built around here 
what was once a fairly nice country ranch is becoming an 
international tourist attraction trippet says you can stand on any 
part of the ranch and hear about 10 languages spoken in one hour 
it sounds like an idle boast until the next group of tourists 
strolls by 
a camerasnapping couple is from germany a young family with 
two children is from canada and a woman who rolls into trippets 
path and levels a camera lens at his head has a british accent 
you look just like jr coming down there she says as she 
shoots 
he does resemble jr ewing who raises the ire and interest of 
millions of tv fans worldwide on this day the tall texan is 
wearing a leather vest western shirt a pair of sharply pressed 
jeans and ostrichskin boots 
like jr the 44yearold trippet is fond of that disappearing 
texas pastime making money and he made his through you guessed 
it oil 
you want to know the most expensive souvenir around here he 
says then points at himself me thats what and im not 
cheap 
trippet who bought the ranch in 1984 for a very big price 
says if southfork ranch looks a bit commercial thats because its 
meant to make money 
from the 175 chili dogs to the ranchhouse which he rents for 
2500 a night for overnight visitors the showplace is meant to be 
a moneymaking proposition 
besides he says that 2500 is nothing a good penthouse 
is going to cost you that much to rent 
but anything you see here is for sale you want to buy those 
shrubs and ill go dig them up myself 
his latest enterprise could be the start of something very big 
this friday saturday and sunday trippet is holding the southfork 
antiques spectacular 
more than 3 million worth of antique furniture chandeliers 
carpets and jewelry will be offered for sale the auction will 
include a louis xv dining room transferred intact to texas from a 
scottish castle its being offered by priscilla davis a fort 
worth socialite 
for the occasion trippet is selling the contents of his 
ranchhouse he says he will then refill the house and sell all 
those items at the next auction 
as trippet ambles back to the ranch office to check calls before 
roaring off in a gold mercedes he doesnt miss a step when asked 
about his favorite part of the ranch 
my cash register he says and those tour buses parked 
over there i love to see those dollar bills walking in

the diaper business has hit bottom forcing 
the last remaining diaper service in berkshire county to call it 
quits 
thomas holzer vice president of aladco said that with more 
parents using disposable diapers his customers have dropped from 
400 a decade ago to a mere 60 scattered across the county 
we cant operate at that low a volume he said tuesday 
holzer said he had hoped negative publicity about disposable 
diapers choking landfills would slow the trend but that didnt 
happen 
toward the end he found that he couldnt even give away his 
business 
people declined even when diaper service was offered as a gift 
holzer said 
and so in may the adams company which also operates a 
laundry dry cleaning and linen and uniform rental business is 
dropping its diaper division

donate 25 pence every time uh you know whenever you do wink 
wink nudge nudge 
the campaign announced by marie stopes international a charity 
which supports family planning in the third world sounds like a 
publicity stunt 
it is a publicity stunt 
patricia hindmarsh fundraising manager for the charity said 
wednesday that it has been working away quietly for 20 years 
talking earnestly to people and it hasnt done the trick 
we now realize that we need more hype like band aid and comic 
relief to draw peoples attention to the problem so we are asking 
people to make love and save the world 
at the suggested rate of 25 pence 43 cents ms hindmarsh said 
the average british couple could give 1250 pounds about 2125 a 
year 
they can save it up or write us a check every six months or 
put it in a little tin by the bed ms hindmarsh said 
we dont really care how they do it she confessed at the 
end of the day we just want their money 
there is a serious point too i think it will help people 
focus on the fact that they have the freedom to make love without 
producing another mouth to feed she said

the body of vladimir i lenin still is 
wellpreserved after 65 years on lying in state in red square 
pravda reported and is in no immediate danger of decomposition 
the communist party newspaper quoted sergei s debov head of 
the laboratory overseeing the body as confirming long speculation 
that scientists at first did not think they could preserve the 
remains of the soviet founder who died in 1924 
he said they considered a refrigeration system but instead 
decided on anatomicalbiochemical methods the paper reported 
wednesday 
debov did not go into details on how the body is maintained but 
disclosed that the fight against decomposition was so intense at 
first that scientists had to work around the clock to preserve it 
he said the preservation process still requires daily vigilant 
observation and that the body is guaranteed for an extended 
period of time 
the body lies beneath glass in a special marbleandgranite 
mausoleum in red square five days a week visitors are hustled 
past the body in a dimly lit room where no photographs are allowed 
mass demand that lenins body lie permanently displayed prompted 
the communist party leadership to overrule lenins widow nadezhda 
krupskaya who opposed having her husband embalmed

the murderous bombardment in beirut the 
worst in four years has squeezed peoples daily lives to four 
hours of scurrying about their business and 20 hours underground 
when syrian and christian artillery gunners rest at daybreak 
thousands of trapped residents cautiously emerge from bunkers 
their first order of business is to hurriedly buy fresh supplies 
of food water candles gas lamps decks of cards and sleeping 
pills 
just before the antagonists resume the deadly duel that began 
three weeks ago they rush back to shelters on both sides of the 
green line that divides the city into moslem and christian sectors 
most nightclubs bars restaurants cafes and movie houses are 
closed so are schools and universities banks operate haphazardly 
for two or three hours a day depending on the ferocity of the 
shelling 
the only thing that matters nowadays is selfpreservation 
said amin trad a pharmacist in christian east beiruts ashrafiyeh 
district survival is the name of the game 
he did not recall a similar stampede for sleeping pills in 
lebanons 14year civil war 
i dont have statistics but if this continues we will soon 
run out of tranquilizers said trad whose pharmacy is shielded 
by tall sandbag walls 
there are no severe shortages at present wholesalers try to 
monopolize goods in order to raise prices and stores order new 
stock during lulls in the fighting 
some residents manage to joke about the shelling 
tell my friends in west beirut not to worry about me said 
bahjat jaber a police reporter who lives in east beiruts 
maameltein suburb like many others he commuted between beiruts 
two sectors before the latest round of fighting 
i have all the fireworks some 200 shells explode around my 
apartment nightly the house is always shaking like a swing and i 
am swinging quipped jaber 55 
a greek catholic bachelor jaber does not use the basement 
shelter of his seaside apartment building because his 92yearold 
mother can hardly move i simply cant leave her alone 
when a missile detonated a large gas storage tank at beirut 
port winds blew the flame and smoke in the direction of his house 
10 miles north of beirut 
im lik a roasted chicken he joked to friends on the 
telephone 
the fighting pits army commander gen mily 
christian units against an alliance of syrian troops and druse 
moslem militiamen 
it was touched off by an airandsea blockade aoun clamped on 
militiarun illegal ports on march 6 in a bid to reinstate

underground shelter which houses a power generator 
the citys moslem sector is virtually a ghost town tens of 
thousands of residents have fled to relative safety in east and 
south lebanon

wednesday approved an agreement allowing the state to buy the 54 
billion shoreham nuclear power plant for 1 and dismantle it 
in approving the deal worked out earlier this year by gov 
mario cuomo and officials of the long island lighting co which 
owns the plant the commission authorized rate increases that could 
result in new yorks long island residents paying the highest 
electric rates in the nation 
the panel made permanent a 54 percent rate increase granted 
earlier this year approved a 5 percent rate increase to go into 
effect in december and authorized another 5 percent increase for 
december 1990 
the agreement to close shoreham still must be be approved by the 
new york power authority and the long island power authority by 
april 15 then it is subject to approval by the utilitys 
shareholders and board of directors 
the higher rates would give long island lighting a shot at 
regaining the financial stability it lost in recent years because 
of the burdens imposed on it by the illfated shoreham project 
public service commission members who approved an earlier 
agreement worked out by cuomo and the utility only to the see that 
deal die because of state legislators refusal to approve it said 
they hoped they were putting the controversial plant behind them

there was no happy ending to the fairy 
talelike life that richard hemmelsbach has lived since being 
adopted last summer by a childless west german baron 
on wednesday hemmelsbach missed a banks deadline for coming up 
with 3 million to keep the barons 1429yearold castle in the 
family the west german bank that has a lien on the 150room castle 
and 970acre estate plans to put the property up for sale 
as the adopted son of 76yearold baron freiherr theodore 
vonliebieg hemmelsbach stood to inherit the castle and surrounding 
vineyards on the mosel river at the foot of the eifel mountains in 
southwestern west germany 
the value of the castle and estate is estimated at 10 million 
but hemmelsbach said he has something more important than a 
castle 
i still have this wonderful birthright and a wonderful father 
and i plan to be a good baron and good son hemmelsbach said 
wednesday i think were all disappointed but the baron has 
never asked about the castle he only wants to know when i am 
coming back to visit 
vonliebieg selected hemmelsbach in part because of his german 
heritage from more than 10000 people worldwide who responded to 
the barons televised plea for an heir on the syndicated show a 
current affair last june 
hemmelsbach didnt know at the time that he would be asked to 
save the familys deteriorating estate which was taken over by the 
bank when a german businessman who had purchased the castle from 
vonliebieg defaulted on a loan 
the baron has not lived in the castle for more than a dozen 
years he lives with his wife in a nearby villa 
hemmelsbach a 57yearold businessman said he will continue to 
work to purchase the castle for as long as it remains for sale but 
about 18 private and corporate investors including a german hotel 
chain have lined up to purchase the estate from the bank 
ive been a rainbow chaser all my life said hemmelsbach 
who lives in the lake michigan town of ferrysburg i guess ill 
always continue to do that im too old to do otherwise

smoking makes the body burn more calories 
according to a study that helps explain one of lifes biological 
injustices why people put on weight when they give up cigarettes 
the research publi care of about 100 calories a day for the 
typical smoker 
smokers typically weigh five to 10 pounds less than nonsmokers 
and they usually put on that much weight when they break the habit 
the question has been why this happens 
part of the reason is that folks often eat more when they stop 
smoking and some studies have shown they are more likely to crave 
sugar while preliminary evidence suggested that they also burned 
calories more slowly many experts thought this effect was small 
in the past scientists have studied this by watching changes in 
metabolism when people smoke while sitting still in the lastest 
work researchers decided to see what happened to metabolism when 
people smoked while moving around just as they do in real lifeought it 
was conceivable we wouldnt see any effect 
said dr kenneth a perkins who directed the universityrgh school of medicine 
study thats published in the new 
england journal of medicine 
to our surprise whe opposite that it was much more 
enhanced it reversed our thinking the implication is that the 
metabolic eing is much more important than everyone 
else has considered when staying ng increases metabolism by about 5 
percent but it raises it by about 12 
percent among other things this could help explain hy some 
people balloon when they quit cigaretteothers manage to 
hold their weight steady 
if people tenn coffee breaks 
or while relaxing at home watching tv they wont gain as much 
weight when they quit said perkins those who smoke while 
active are likely to be thinnero begin with because of their 
smoking so they risk putting on more when they stop smoking 
nancy a rigotti of harvard 
noted that some people especiall keep smoking because they 
are afraid of gaining weight 
until our cultural obsession wih slenderness abates she 
wrote we must pay more attention to the way weight gain impedes 
efforts to stop smoking if we are to continue the progress of the 
past quarter century toward a smokefree society 
exprts note that while obesity is dangerous smokers should not 
leof gaining weight keep them 
from quitting 
your health risk is immeasurably improved whestop 
smoking no matter how much weight you gain said perkins 
he also pointed out that people can offset their newly slowed 
metabolisttle extra exercise 
all you would need to do is walk about a mile extra er that perkins 
said that hard as it sounds

the backdrop for franklin d roosevelts famous fireside chats 
is the surprise feature of a new smithsonian exhibition recreating 
the glitter and elegance of the white house in a bygone era 
the permanent installation in the national museum of american 
history entitled the ceremonial court shows the front hallway 
of the white house as it appeared from a 1903 restoration until 
1952 
the 1903 restoration conducted by new york architect charles 
follen mckim took six months and cost about 500000 
the smithsonian display required more than four years of 
planning and eight months to install at a cost of nearly 1 
million the project was underwritten largely by a grant from 
sears roebuck and co 
this is a permanent statement of the highest and most elegant 
reaches of american craftsmanship said museum director roger g 
kennedy 
the white house he said represented a courtly life a life 
of high style its always opening night at court the night for 
grand occasions for getting out the very best china

when roosevelts successor harry s truman undertook a major 
renovation of the white house in 1952 the mantelpiece and other 
unwanted objects were donated to the smithsonian which crated them 
for storage in its sprawling warehouses in suburban suitland md

on a smithsonian catalog card until the pile of crates marked 
white house was discovered nearly 30 years later by j michael 
carrigan the museums newly appointed assistant director for 
exhibits 
in that moment carrigan envisioned a permanent museum 
exhibition of historic white house treasures drawn from the 
smithsonians vast collections the centerpiece of the resulting 
display is a recreation of the front hallway stretching from the 
east room to the state dining room as it appeared beginning with 
theodore roosevelts presidency

the turnofthecentury white house there are hints of the 
boisterous teddy roosevelt household 
just outside a trompe loeil painting of the state dining room 
is the family elevator inside is a mannequin of one of roosevelts 
six children with their pet pony algonquin which once was 
smuggto greet a bedrivelt 
at the other end of the hall is a second trompe loeil painting 
of the main stairway with archie and brother kermit playing at the 
bottom with a paint set and their pet macaw one of a menagerie 
that also included three rats a terrier a kitten a flying 
squirrel and a green snake named emily spinach

a dead rat might not be worth a rats 
whisker in lapeer county soon or even the 10cent bounty allowed 
by an obscure state law 
the 1915 law provides the bounty to anyone who kills a rat and 
turns it over in a state of good preservation to their 
municipal clerk the clerk is to burn the rats head and authorize 
payment through the county 
but the law also allows county boards of commissioners to 
rescind the bounty a move that lapeer county clerk mary ellen 
thick said in a recent interview that she would welcome 
im sure they have not done that but well be doing that 
soon she said itll be presented to the board of 
commissioners immediately 
the bounty law surfaced recently during the celebration of 
marathon townships 150th anniversary of incorporation 
township clerk laura ring recalled receiving an anonymous letter 
in 1985 from a resident who said he had killed 76 rats and wanted 
to know whether he had to cut off their heads before receiving his 
760 bounty 
i went to the board meeting wearing surgical gloves that 
month ring said i actually had visions of a sack of rats 
appearing on the front doorstep 
but the rat slayer never has come forward 
marathon township meanwhile also has on its books a 5 bounty 
for wolves in effect since 1839

the bush administration disappointed that 
mikhail s gorbachev is not withdrawing military support from 
nicaragua is accusing the soviet president of empty rhetoric 
regarding central american peace 
while his words about not exporting revolution are welcomed 
they are not matched by deeds which would give those words 
credence white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
wednesday referring to gorbachevs denunciation of the export of 
revolution 
gorbachevs comments in his speech in havana on tuesday 
conflicted with the policy of cuban president fidel castro who 
supports the spread of revolutionary movements 
but in a written statement read by fitzwater the white house 
called on gorbachev to back up his statements about wanting 
demilitarized peace zones in central america by discontinuing 
military assistance to the leftist government of nicaragua 
today we call upon the soviets to cut off their 
halfbilliondollar annual military aid to nicaragua the soviets 
continue to pour arms into nicaragua a country whose army is 
already larger than those of all their neighbors combined he 
said 
fitzwater said continued soviet activity in central america will 
affect ussoviet relations but declined to specify how the 
administration might express its displesure 
weve never made linkage threats he said but we have 
always said these are the kinds of things that influence the 
relationship between the united states and the soviet union 
a day earlier fitzwater had said soviet spokesman gennady 
gerasimovs statements against the export of revolution appeared to 
be a positive sign but on wednesday he was more resng we can hold out 
a little optimism on the basis of the 
words but that the administration is looking for deedsto back 
them up 
us officials looked to the soviet leaders visit to cuba as an 
opportunity for him to change direction in central america bush 
had written him urging soviet withdrawal of military support from 
the leftist nicaraguan government and a halt to cuban and 
nicaraguan support for leftist guerrillas in el salvador 
but gorbachev in his tuesday speech to the national assembly in 
havana said moscow will not has support for nicaragua as long united states 
continues military assistance to other 
governments in the region 
fitzwatert 
comparable to the soviet assistance because the usbacked nations 
are not involved in subversion of their neighbors 
us officials estimate the soviets shipped more than 500 
million in military aid last year to nicaragua and gave managua the 
same amount in economic asse the united states has 
bankrolled the contra rebels fighting to oust the sandinistas 
bushs shift to a diplomatic course means us aid to the contras 
is now nonmilitary 
us aid to el salvador this decade totals some 35 billion 
and the administration accuses the soviets of supporting the 
salvadoran rebels through cuba and nicaragua critics of the 
administration policy meanwhile cite widespreder the usbacked regime

doctors participating in a major study of 
treatment after coronary bypass surgery will be barred from owning 
stock in the companies whose medicines are being tested according 
to guidelines released today 
the rules are intended to prevent any conflict of interest that 
might sway researchers when they analyze the results 
doctors who drew up the guidelines note that there are no widely 
accepted standards to prevent conflicts of interest for scientists 
doing research with products that have commercial value 
we believe that a defined conflictofinterest policy will 
protect the integrity of the study and the credibility of 
investigators as the trial is scrutinized by the scientific 
community and the public the organizers wrote 
the rules were drawn up by dr bernadine healy of the cleveland 
clinic foundation and colleagues from the montreal health 
institute cedarssinai medical center in los angeles baylor 
college of medicine the university of minnesota and the maryland 
medical research institute 
they were published in todays new england journal of medicine 
along with an editorial by its editor dr arnold s relman 
these are laudable voluntary guidelines which for the time 
being other clinical investigators would do well to adopt he 
wrote 
the sevenyear federally funded study is called the post 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery clinicial trial it will 
examine the effects of drug therapy and cholesterol lowering for 
people undergoing heart bypass surgery 
during this surgery doctors reroute blood around clogged heart 
arteries however the detours often become plugged after a few 
years and the study is intended to see if treatment can keep this 
from happening 
the study will test drugs produced by three companies according 
to the new rules all key researchers will be prohibited from 
owning stock in the drug companies or working for them as paid 
consultants the ban also will extend to their spouses and 
dependents 
authors of the rules note that the outcome of this study could 
affect the care of millions of americans undergoing bypass surgery

polling places across the nation would close 
at a uniform time in presidential elections under a plan on its way 
to the senate after winning house approval 
the bill approved 238154 on wednesday is designed to reduce 
the effect of outcome projections made hours before the polls close 
in the wet and in some lateclosing states elsewhere 
the importance of western votes for president is being 
diminished just because of where we live rep ron wyden dore 
declared 
the measure has passed the house twice before only to languish 
in the senate but lawmakers say senate prospects are better this 
year 
the bill calls for closing times of 9 pm est 8 pm cst and 7 
pm mst in presidential election years only the switch from 
daylightsaving time to standard time in the pacific time zone 
would be postponed a maximum of two weeks polls there would close 
at 7 pm pdt 
under the timetable polling places would shut their doors 
simultaneously making it impossible for results from some states 
to indicate a winner and influence turnout elsewhere 
only presidential years would be covered by the bill which 
would take effect in 1992 and would not apply to alaska and hawaii 
the plan is designed to dovetail with a 1985 agreement under 
which major television networks said they would voluntarily refrain 
from projecting election results within a state until the polls 
close there 
it is unclear if local races are actually affected by early 
projections house rules committee chairman claude pepper dfla 
however said tuesday that he believed the phenomenon may have 
contributed to the 1980 defeat of rep al ullman dore then 
chairman of the ways and means committee 
either way lawmakers say voter frustration because of such 
projections is basically unhealthy 
its unfair to either party that the east coast would announce 
the final result of an election to the west coast before the final 
votes are counted rep james h quillen rtenn told the house 
the only critic of the bill to take the floor rep william 
frenzel rminn described it as a rube goldberg device that 
will louse up the states cause them a great deal of confusion and 
travail 
he said it actually could reduce turnout by shortening voting 
hours on the west coast and possibly prompting east coast states to 
open the polls at later hours than they do now 
rep al swift dwash the measures sponsor said studies have 
shown an earlier poll closing will prompt voters to vote earlier 
and thus the fear of a drop in turnout is simply not 
substantiated by the facts 
the extension of daylightsaving time in the pacific zone would 
take place only in presidential election years it would last for a 
maximum of two weeks and apply to california washington oregon 
and nevada as well as the idaho panhandle but not the rest of idaho

the risk of bleeding strokes is significantly 
higher than usual among men who have very low cholesterol levels 
but high blood pressure a study published today concludes 
the research found that men with blood cholesterol levels under 
160 were three times more likely than those with higher cholesterol 
levels to suffer bleeding strokes but this increase appeared to be 
explained entirely by a substantially higher risk in those with 
high blood pressure 
the researchers said the findings should not be taken as an 
excuse to stop trying to lower cholesterol to prevent heart disease 
of the 350977 men studied 3986 had unusually low cholesterol 
levels under 160 milligrams per deciliter of blood and diastolic 
blood pressures above 90 which is considered to be elevated in 
this group there were nine bleeding strokes a rate that works out 
to 23 strokes for every 10000 men 
by comparison among men with low cholesterol but low blood 
pressure as well there were just under two bleeding strokes per 
10000 people the same as for all men with low blood pressure 
the men with low cholesterol levels did not face any unusual 
risk of strokes resulting from blood clots inside the brain these 
are more common than bleeding strokes 
the men with low cholesterol also had a sharply lower risk of 
dying from all kinds of cardiovascular disease for those with 
cholesterols between 140 and 160 there were 46 cardiovascular 
deaths per 10000 people compared with 83 cardiovascular deaths 
for the total group 
the study was based on the multiple risk factor intervention 
trial the latest analysis by dr hiroyasu iso and colleagues at 
the university of minnesota was published in todays new england 
journal of medicine 
our findings should not be taken as a reason to defer the 
establishment of programs to lower serum blood cholesterol levels 
in the us population in order to prevent coronary heart 
disease the researchers concluded 
they speculated that very low cholesterol may weaken the walls 
of arteries in the head while high blood pressure makes them break

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee says president bushs insistence on cutting the capital 
gains tax is a thorn in our negotiations as white house and 
congressional bargainers try to complete a budget agreement 
i think were confused rep dan rostenkowski dill said 
wednesday night after a meeting with treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and richard darman director of the office of management and 
budget 
were a room of good intentions he said but theres a 
difficult thorn in our negotiations and thats capital gains 
brady and darman have been meeting with key members of congress 
to craft a plan for meeting the goal of a 100 billion deficit in 
fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
about 28 billion in either new revenues or spending restraint 
would be needed to meet that goal according to white house 
estimates 
as part of the deficit reduction plan in his fiscal 1990 budget 
president bush proposed cutting the tax rate on capital gains to 15 
percent about in half 
the president contends the rate cut would raise about 48 
billion in revenue however congressional estimates show the 
reduction would be a big revenue loser in the long run and 
democrats contend the rich would benefit the most from the tax 
break 
although his own budget included several billion dollars in tax 
increases and new user fees bush contends those did not violate 
his campaign pledge against any new taxes 
with democrats opposing the capital gains scheme coming up with 
a deficitreduction plan has proven difficult since alternative tax 
revenues or more spending cuts would be needed 
rep leon panetta dcalif the house budget committee 
chairman has proposed in the talks that half the deficit 
reduction about 14 billion come from revenues a combination of 
taxes sales of government assets and new user fees bushs 
revenue proposals produced about the same amount but included the 
claimed capital gains influx 
he said wednesday that resolution of the tax issue is crucial to 
the success of the talks 
rostenkowski said he was not discouraged but it would be 
difficult 
were going to continue to talk but i dont know that 
were going to meet any of the deadlines he said 
congress has an april 15 deadline for completing the budget 
brady and darman declined to comment on the specifics of the 
meeting 
its just part of the budget process brady said asked if 
he had brought something new to discuss he said i didnt bring 
a thing

mikhail s gorbachevs call for an end to the 
export of revolution and counterrevolution to latin america 
disappointed us analysts who were hoping for a stronger sign that 
the kremlin would curtail its military aid to cuba 
bush administration officials pursuing a more conciliatory 
central american policy than president reagan agreed with 
congressional leaders last month not to seek military aid for the 
contra guerrillas of nicaragua 
they hoped that in response gorbachev would curtail the 
estimated 6 billion in aid the kremlin sends to cuba the 1 
billion in soviet aid to nicaragua and east bloc assistance to 
leftist guerrillas in el salvador 
while his words about not exporting revolution are welcome 
they are not matched by deeds which would give his words 
credence white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
gorbachev meeting in havana with cuban leader fidel castro 
scolded western media for reporting a cubansoviet rift and gave no 
indication that the kremlin would be cutting its aid to the 
caribbean island estimated at about 6 billion a year 
as in the past the soviet union and cuba have a common 
approach to the key problems of international affairs gorbachev 
said the most immediate task is to solve socalled regional 
conflicts 
we are resolutely against any theories and doctrines 
justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution and all 
forms of interference in the affairs of sovereign nations 
gorbachev said 
on tuesday fitzwater had said that the united states would 
welcome the reduction of soviet military support in nicaragua or 
if they mean that soviet surrogates would cease supporting 
insurgents in el salvador 
instead gorbachev condemned american meddling in afghan 
affairs the united states has been sending an estimated 500 
million a year in covert aid to the anticommunist guerrillas of 
afghanistan helping secure the negotiated withdrawal of soviet 
troops last february 
many americans have engaged in wishful thinking hoping that 
gorbachev would seek to ease economic problems at home by 
curtailing aid to revolutionary movements abroad particularly 
latin america said howard wiarda a political scientist at the 
university of massachusetts 
but there is no evidence whatsoever that the soviets have 
started to reduce military aid to nicaragua or to the rebels in el 
salvador said wiarda 
although gorbachev may be pressuring castro in private meetings 
to tone down his revolutionary rhetoric and may ultimately curtail 
soviet aid to leftist insurgencies i think it unrealistic to 
expect gorbachev to change those policies quickly said wiarda 
the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee applauded 
gorbachevs statement on the export of revolution while at the 
same time criticizing castros past policies 
i hope castro follows gorbachevs advice said sen 
claiborne pell dri certainly much of our trouble in central 
america comes from cuban activities if they can be closed down 
this will help peace to come to that troubled region 
a former cuban diplomat now living in the united states juan 
benemelis said american expectations were too high for this 
meeting 
i think there is definitely conflict between gorbachev and 
castro but that it will take some time to become public said 
benemelis who worked in africa for castro before defecting in 1980 
benemelis has seen hints that gorbachev will reduce aid to cuba 
as well as pressure castro to curtail military interference in 
other countries but doesnt think the trend will become obvious 
until both countries enter their next fiveyear economic period in 
1991 
since gorbachev took power the soviets have been asking the 
cubans to fulfill their annual trade agreements castro has had 
problems for example filling his sugar quota he has not been 
doing it he said 
castro who opposes the type of political reforms gorbachev is 
pressing in the soviet union said tuesday that no such changes are 
needed in cuba 
but if soviet aid was reduced castro would face a political 
crisis said benemelis 
the cuban leader who has developed strong ties to the soviet 
military and intelligence agencies over the decades may be biding 
his time hoping that conservatives in those organizations will 
force gorbachev from power said benemelis 
castro is betting on the opposition said benemelis

the bush administration is seeking changes in 
us law to allow up to 150000 soviets to immigrate to this 
country over the next five years after a flood of visa applications 
caught the government off guard 
the adminstration has been the target of criticism from capitol 
hill for its tangled approach to the flood of applications coming 
primarily from soviet jews more than 4000 jews were allowed to 
leave the soviet union last month the highest total in 10 years 
for years the administration has demanded that the soviets 
loosen their stranglehold on emigrant applications but once the 
flood began under soviet president mikhail gorbachev the exodus 
appeared to overwhelm us officials 
in order to remedy the situation the state department announced 
on wednesday that the agency had sent legislation to congress to 
allow 30000 immigrant visas per year over a period of five years 
for those people whose admission would be in our foreign policy 
interest said spokesman richard boucher 
while the spokesman said the primary beneficiaries of the new 
legislation are likely to be soviet citizens the law could be 
used for other nationalities 
were trying to make sure we take care of everybody from the 
soviet union who wants to come in boucher said 
but rep bruce morrison dconn chairman of the house 
judiciary subcommittee on immigration refugees and international 
law said the administration proposal doesnt deal adequately with 
the problem of soviet jewish refugees 
it creates an unprecedented pick and choose immigration 
policy morrison said in a telephone interview it allows the 
president to choose people from different areas who are not 
immigrants or refugees 
after his subcommittee holds a hearing today on soviet refugees 
morrison said he plans to introduce legislation that would deal 
with the soviet jewish refugee situation narrowly expeditiously 
and with adequate resources for resettlement 
ins commissioner alan nelson says that in order to help clear up 
the backlog of soviet visa applicants in moscow and rome he is 
sending additional inspectors to both cities to help speed up the 
processing 
more than 19000 soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the 
us embassy in moscow for permission to enter the united states as 
refugees and another 7000 are waiting in temporary quarters near 
rome 
the current rate of soviet applications has been running about 
4000 a month at that rate the allocated refugee slots were due 
to run out shortly 
those being denied access under the refugee quotas were offered 
parolee status but that did not give them government funding nor 
did it allow the applicants to apply eventually for citizenship 
last summer the backup problem was exacerbated by a change in 
the justice department policy that ordered ins to determine refugee 
status for soviets casebycase rather than as a group that is 
true for other refugee applicants 
as a stopgap measure the state department in january shifted 
7000 unused slots meant for vietnamese refugees to accommodate the 
soviet overflow 
although some estimates project about 40000 soviet applicants 
this year the administration had budgeted for only half that 
number 
in a statement attorney general dick thornburgh said the 
legislation was not specific to nationality in order to provide the 
president with some flexibility in case he wanted to apply it 
to another nation at some other point 
he pointed out that the law could apply to vietnamese people who 
obtained exit visas from their homeland but do not qualify for 
refugee status under current immigration law 
all immigrants have to prove that they would not become a ward 
of the state by showing that they had a job offer or some other 
means of financial support boucher said 
the new legislation does not contain any request for funding for 
the additional immigrants although the white house has requested 
100 million from congress in supplemental funding for migration 
and refugee assistance 
boucher said the administration also hoped that voluntary 
agencies would be able to help make up the shortfall 
as well he added were hopeful that friends and relatives in 
the united states would be able to provide such assistance

american diners with a death wish can now risk 
sushicide with fugu a seafood delicacy that becomes the last 
supper for 100 japanese each year 
the raw fish arrived in new york city last week appearing on 
the menus of seven manhattan restaurants and making the united 
states the only country outside japan where fugu is found 
but the man who brought the gourmet delight stateside promised 
wednesday this fugu couldnt hurt a fly unlike the badly prepared 
fugu thats fatal to half the people who eat it every year about 
100 japanese eat a fatal fugu meal 
there is no danger at all said a confident nobuyoshi 
kuraoka owner of restaurant nippon in midtown manhattan in the 
50 years since the war there is no single instance of poisoning 
from the tiger puffer fish prepared by a licensed chef in the city 
of shimonoseki 
with that in mind all 265 pounds of fugu flown frozen into john 
f kennedy international airport was prepared for delivery in that 
japanese city kuraoka stressed its safety but tales of fugu past 
provide another picture 
fugu has been a taste treat in japan for more than 2000 years 
there are 15 different kinds of fugu all prepared from puffer 
fish if not properly cleaned the fish can be fatal its 
entrails liver and ovaries contain the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin 
the removal of the dangerous organs is handled by special chefs 
in japan with at least 13 years experience 
to insure smooth sailing with this first fugu shipment kuraoka 
had a chef with 53 years experience sakae hata of shimonoseki 
handle inspection in japan and upon arrival here 
no other fish is treated as strictly as this fugu today 
inspectors at shimonoseki observed the whole process said 
kuraoka 
the goahead for importation was given in november 1988 after a 
year of intense negotiations between the two countries said chris 
lecos of the us food and drug administration 
fugu now will be allowed into the united states up to three 
times per year between september and march when the fish are in 
season fugu had been on the fdas automatic detention list for 
eight years lecos said 
the ban made kuraoka a man with a mission bringing fugu to this 
country 
i was asked by three or four food critics in new york to bring 
it in and by the japanese people staying in new york said 
kuraoka they miss fugu so much 
why would anyone miss raw fish that much 
it has a very mysterious taste profound and unforgettable 
explained kuraoka who charges between 35 and 60 per person for a 
fugu sashimi platter 50 a plate for fugu hors doeuvres 
his opinion was not exactly echoed by two women in the 
restaurant whod tried the dish and lived to tell about it 
bland offered one somewhere between squid and fluke 
said the other 
nevertheless kuraoka was confident fugu would find its place in 
the american market 
the tiger puffer fish is the best delicacy in japan he 
said its a huge fish a beautiful fish this is our very best 
and also our most expensive im very happy and very proud

us customs officials warned jamaica to intensify 
its antidrug efforts after the agency seized an air jamaica 
jetliner with nearly two tons of marijuana 
security procedures on air jamaica are dismal at best 
customs service spokesman michael sheehan said wednesday we hope 
this seizure will attract their attention 
inspectors found 3595 pounds of marijuana packed into two 
unlisted containers in the cargo hold of the airbus a300 that had 
flown from kingston to miami international airport sheehan said 
you could smell it from 50 feet away he said we just 
cannot comprehend how the jamaicans could not have discovered it 
and allowed it to leave the country 
under us law the plane was seized and governmentowned air

larger marijuana shipments have been intercepted on ships and 
cargo planes but tuesdays seizure was the most within memory 
aboard a scheduled commercial airliner sheehan said 
as customs officials wednesday were announcing that find three 
men carrying shoulder bags with a total of 60 pounds of pot were 
nabbed on another air jamaica flight here sheehan said 
george heavey customs regional director said the plane seizure 
marked the 130th time since 1980 that shipments were stopped on air 
jamaica flights agents have intercepted a total of almost 9 tons 
of the drug 
customs is very concerned that despite the rhetoric and the 
propaganda that weve been receiving from air jamaica the 
security is almost totally ineffective heavey said weve got 
to do more to stop the use of air jamaica aircraft as conveyances 
to smuggle marijuana 
he said theency was particularly incensed that the two large 
cargo containers were not not on the flight manifest 
inside the containers agents found 88 cardboard boxes 
including 29 filled with clothes and the rest stuffed with 
marijuana 
inspectors did not immediately grab the drugowing it to be 
picked up at the airport

in an antiextinction effort a 
state legislature has enacted a law under which anyone caught with 
the eggs of leatherback turtles can be fined up to 363 or 
sentenced to six months in jail 
many malaysians eat the eggs as a delicacy believing they 
increase sexual prowess 
the law passed wednesday by the trengganu state assembly in 
kuala trengganu 180 miles northeast of kuala lumpur says the only 
lawful purpose for keeping the eggs is for hatching by the state 
fisheries department 
abdul rashid ngah chairman of the state fisheries and 
agriculture committee said he proposed the law because the number 
of leatherback turtles laying eggs in rantau abang near kuala 
trengganu had declined to about 500 in recent years and measures 
were needed to prevent their extinction 
the turtles measuring as much as five feet in diameter and 
weighing up to 900 pounds range the seas as far as japan the 
philippines and australia but return to the beaches of rantau abang 
each june to august to lay their eggs 
scientists say the turtles which live as long as 100 years 
return each year to the exact beach where they were born to lay up 
to 70 eggs

donald atwood a general motors corp 
executive tapped for deputy defense secretary is promising to sell 
his more than 3 million in company stock to avoid any conflict of 
interest 
the vice chairman of the giant automaker also said wednesday 
that he took out an insurance policy to guarantee his gm pension 
should the company fail to protect against any suggestion he would 
use his government office to protect the company for the sake of a 
pension 
this is way beyond what is remotely reasonable sen trent 
lott rmiss member of the senate armed services committee said 
in praise of atwoods efforts 
youve done an extraordinary thing said sen carl levin 
dmich a member of the senate armed services committee youve 
probably gone overboard youve done it at a great expense to 
yourself 
atwood 64 owns about 14 million in restricted gm stock 
options and about 12 million in class e common stock as well as 
other types of common stock estimated at over 750000 according 
to congressional sources 
in addition atwood owns between 5000 to 15000 in atampt stock 
and between 50000 to 100000 in exxon stock the sources said 
financial disclosure forms only require listing a range of assets 
atwood a member of the board of directors of general motors 
since may 1987 made his unusual financial promises just one month 
after the senate rejected john tower president bushs first choice 
for defense secretary 
senators cited allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing 
as well as the appearance of conflict of interest in voting against 
tower the former texas senator had received more than 1 million 
in consulting fees from defense contractors after leaving 
government service 
the senate later confirmed bushs second nominee for defense 
secretary rep dick cheney of wyoming 
on the opening day of hearings levin and richard lugar rind 
introduced atwood to the senate armed services committee with levin 
noting that anybody who can master gms bureaucracy has a 
fighting chance at the pentagon 
the panels chairman sen sam nunn dga indicated that 
atwood would likely win confirmation 
atwood has 90 days to sell his holdings but said he hoped to 
receive an extension when he accepted bushs offer atwood said he 
was told that tower would be confirmed by the third week in january 
and that he would win approval by the second week in febary 
between the first week in february and now there has been a 
gradual erosion in the stock market and a gradual erosion in auto 
stock atwood said 
on other issues atwood expressed his support for purchasing 
commercial products if they are available at lower costs than those 
manufactured by defense contractors 
the nominee also told nunn that the departmets top defense 
priorities are a national secur under way the pentagons acquisition system 
and the 
ethics problems in the wake of the ill wind procurement scandal 
we dont just issue a pamphlet on ethics atwood said 
we have to makee that they have the training

young couples still dream of home ownerhip 
but higher housing prices and delayed marriages mean a longer wait 
for the reality 
couples in their 20s traditionally provide the population fuel 
for growing house sales but they are losing the ability to cover 
down payments on starter homes housing analyst f john devaney of 
the census bureau said wednesday 
between 1975 and 1985 the median income of couples in their 20s 
rose 80 percent while housing prices climbed 125 percent devaney 
reported in a new bureau analysis housing in america 198586 
the financial constraints on these young couples havent 
dampened the growth in housing much it would seem with the report 
showing that the nations housing stock grew twice as fast as the 
population 
housing increased by 26 percent between the mid1970s and 1985 
while the population of the country grew by just 11 percent over 
the same period the census study showed 
helping absorb the increase are the shrinkage in average 
household size from 294 to 269 people during the decade 
requiring more homes for the same number of people and the number 
of people investing in seasonal and recreational houses devaney 
said 
devaney said the growth in housing prices is forcing young 
couples to delay purchasing their first home 
the starter or first home is usually the hardest for a couple 
to make a down payment on since the down payment on a subsequent 
house usually can be obtained from the sale of the prior one 
the median price of first homes rose from 27100 in 1975 to 
61000 1985 125 percent devaney said at the same time the 
median income of married couples who rented a home climbed only 80 
percent from 12300 to 22200 
devaney explained in a telephone interview is that 
young couples who used to move from the reer to owner category in 
their 20s are now delayransition into their 30s and later 
because theynger qualify for the mortgage loans 
in 1975 threefourths of married couples aged 25 to 35 qualified 
for an 80 percent mortgage a figurel to less than half by 
1985 the study found 
asically there is still the desire is sort of in 
our phyche in this country to own a home devaney said but 
realization of that desire is being delayed and devaney said he 
doesnt expect any sudden turnaround in this situation 
at the same time demographic reports show that young people are 
marrying later than they have in the past waiting until theyve 
completed their educations and launched careers and are also 
postponing having children 
in addition to the rise in recreational and seasonal housing 
devaney noted that smaller households have taken up a large share 
of the increase in total homes in the country 
divorce and separation up sharply in recent years turn one 
household into two he observed 
in addition many elderly widows continue to maintain homes on 
their own and the postponement of marriages by young people has led 
meny of them to maintain smaller households 
one in 10 homeowner units is a woman living alone devaney 
commented 
other findings from the nealysis included 
the median monthly housing costs for all americans averaged 
355 in 1985 compared to 311 for blacks and 357 for hispanics 
the proportions of income spent for housing were 28 percent for 
renters 21 percent for owners of mortgaged homes and 13 percent 
for folks with homes that were not mortgaged 
the average size of new homes built in 1986 was 1825 square 
feet up 300 sq feet from 20 years earlier 
the median age of housing in 1985 was 23 years

president bushs 441 million package of 
education programs is as appealing as motherhood says one 
democratic supporter but critics say it spends too little to 
counter the problems in american schools 
the most optimistic outlook on the bush proposal came from its 
chief senate sponsor nancy kassebaum of kansas 
its a package one could hardly be against she said tuesday 
after a rose garden ceremony at which bush announced he was sending 
it to congress chances of passage are very good said 
kassebaum the senior republican on the senate education 
subcommittee 
but there were some who found reason to grumble among them rep 
augustus hawkins dcalif and the 19millionmember national 
education association 
awkins chairman of the house education and laboee 
called bushs plan a futile response to the growing crisis in 
american education he sno future on capitol hill 
the educational excellence act outlined by the president makes 
good on many of his campaign promises among them a 250 million 
grant program to reward schols that have cut drug use or dropout 
rates raised test scores or improved in other ways 
jor part of the package proposed for fiscal 1990 
calls for spending 100 million on a new magchools program 
schools would be encouraged to develop special with the objective of increasing 
open enrollment and 
parental choice 
other parts of the bill would reward outstanding teaience scholars 
develop new ways to certify teachers help 
drugridden urban schools and bolster the endowments of 
historically black colleges 
critics zeroed in on its fiscal modesty 
the fact that they can talk easily about raising 40 billion 
to bail out savings and loans and were nickelanddiming on the 
issue of childrens education talking ab0 million is 
ludicrous said ken melley chief lobbyist for the nea 
the fact is if the education budget were to just enjoy the 
cost of living increase that they give the defense budget we would 
have had another 900 million he said 
some juggling in the budget proposal submitted by former 
president reagan and later embraced by bush would allow modest 
increases in several rams such as chapter 1 which 
bolsters basic skills of disadvantaged students 
but critics say even those increases dont match inflationaning schools 
would have to cut back on services 
bush is attempting to strip programs long supported by 
congress to pay for new initiatives of questionable value 
hawkins charged the congress will not accept that lack of 
commitment to educaion investment 
not all dmocrats were negative about the n 
this is an excellent initiative said sen claiborne pell 
dri chairman of the education subcommittee who attended 
the rose garden announcemeo 
motherhood and said its chances of passage are pretty good 
eduction officials said wednesday thd enter budget 
negotiations with congress seeking 223 billion in fiscal 1990 
spending author for their department the initial 219 billion 
sought by reagan plus 441 million for the budition to the 250 million 
for merit schools and 100 
million for magnets bush is proposing 
25 millionor grants to urban schools that have the most 
serious drug problems 
25 million for federal grants to develop ways to get 
professionals from other fields into teachingstrative 
positions 
10 million in matching grants to historically black colleges 
and universities to herich their endowments

members of congress who neglected to report 
travel abroad paid for in part by foreign governments say they were 
ignorant of the federal law requiring them to do so 
rep robin tallon dsc who traveled to australia and new 
zealand with three colleagues and their spouses last november said 
he was absolutely unaware of the filing requirements under the 
1978 foreign gifts and decorations act 
he wasnt alone 
if i didnt file it was an oversight said rep charles 
stenholm dtexas chairman of a house agriculture subcommittee on 
livestock dairy and poultry and leader of the delegation that 
spent 12 days in the two countries two of stenholms colleagues 
however did complete the forms 
the act was intended to prevent conflicts of interest by 
ensuring disclosure of gifts from foreign governments including 
travel expenses 
other lawmakers who didnt fill out the forms also pledged to do 
so if congressional ethics officials deem it necessary 
the officials say they have no way of knowing how many members 
of congress fail to file the reports conviction of violating the 
law could carry a civil penalty of 5000 plus the cost of the 
gift but no member of congress has been charged with failing to 
file a proper foreign travel expense report 
in 1988 two senators and eight house members filed travel 
expense reports under the gifts act 
among those who didnt at least at first 
sens james exon dneb larry pressler rsd tom harkin 
diowa and thensen john melcher dmont they and others 
received transportation paid for by the governments of new zealand 
and australia during a january 1988 congressional trip to those 
countries 
sen william cohen rmaine who spent one night at an 
international conference in potsdam east germany last june 
since we never knew about it the law we never filled it 
out said mark bowen exons spokesman exon subsequently 
reported the travel expenses 
im going to check with the appropriate senate office and if 
indeed its determined that a report was not filed that should have 
been filed then well do that said don foley harkins 
administrative assistant 
sen howell heflin dala chairman of the senate select 
committee on ethics was the lone senator on the trip to the two 
countries to disclose the travel expenses on a gifts and 
decorations act form 
stenholm neglected to file even though he was advised by the 
house ethics committee chairman rep julian dixon dcalif that 
the foreign gifts and decorations act requires that expenses 
for travel provided by a foreign government be reported to the 
committee within 30 days of departure from the donor country 
dixon enclosed a copy of the form with the advice to stenholm 
overseas expenses for the stenholm delegation were paid by 
qantas airways the australian governmentowned airline and 
several private quasiprivate and foreign government entities 
such as the australian meat and livestock corp the new zealand 
wool board and the new zealand meat producers board stenholm said 
bryan yolles an attorney with clifford amp warnke the firm that 
helped arrange the trip to australia said no foreign government 
money was used in the trip but house rules say funding by 
quasigovernmental organizations must be listed 
the institute for eastwest security studies a nonprofit 
research organization in new york paid cohens travel expenses but 
didnt tell him the east germans were picking up expenses in the 
country said kathy gest spokeswoman for cohen 
if we should have filled one out we will gest said its 
often not clear in situations like this she said cohens office 
planned to check to see if his expenses exceeded the 100 that 
triggers the filing requirement for the senate the house minimum 
is 180 
rep doug bereuter rneb who also attended the conference 
did file a gift form estimating the value of lodging and meals for 
three days at the interhotel in potsdam at 400 
to ensure that senators are aware of the law the senate ethics 
committee sent all members a copy of it plus an explanation in a 
letter last november 
in some cases members of congress or their aides apparently 
filled out the forms unnecessarily 
the confusion indicates to me its not being enforced 
said bernard wruble a private attorney who formerly headed the 
office of government ethics but he said public officials have an 
inescapable responsibility to know who is providing them with 
something of significant value

only rarely in this avowedly marxist state does 
anyone decide to run for office on a platform of free enterprise 
free expression and free emigration 
roberto bahamonde did he lost 
the margin against bahamonde was 21 but what makes him unique 
was that he even tried the place where bahamonde 53 made a bit 
of history the other night was near his home in a rundown section 
of eastern havana called san miguel de padron 
the 150 voters in that municipality had before them a classic 
political choice a marxistleninst against what might be described 
as an americanstyle liberal democrat 
this was a highly unusual occurrence in a country where mar 
orthodoxy is the national religion 
what happened the night of march 21 provided some ins 
how after 30 years communist authorities have been skillfully 
able to keep the bahamondes of cuba at bay 
rters of the revolution see it opening the dooruld lead to the unraveling 
of when bahamonde 
regards as the substantial gains made under president fidel castro 
particularly in social servic he wants to preserve those advances and add 
what he believes 
cuba lacks most freedom 
in some countries argentina and chile of the 1970s are 
examples renegades like mysteriously disappeared or 
were shot outright 
here he has been able to work raise three children se 
son graduate from college and with notable exceptions that have 
left him understandably embitered lead a reasonably stable 
existence 
believes cuba needs change 
almost all critics of the syste suffered 
imprisonment because they trespasseds or simply 
opted for silence 
almost nobody chooses to trto change things through the 
electoral process bahamonde an agricultural engineer is an 
exction 
he has a number of gripes about the sallowed to be selfemployed that 
press censorship should 
end a with food rationing and that cuba should allow es to compete with 
the communist party 
the points he wanted to make that tuesday night 
in march when he joined his neighbors for an elect state 
assembly seat 
on march 21 the comrge of the 
proceedings refused bahamonde permission to read his platform the 
party stalwart st according to standard procedures voters 
are permitted to spavor or against the candidates once 
the nominating process is completed 
the candidates themselves cannot campaign 
the establishment candidate was gerardo aldama a decorated 
26year veteran of the interior miniry who served in angola in a 
country that honors citizens who sacrifice themselves for the 
revolution aldama is a man of distinction 
during a sometimes tense period in which bahamondes credentials 
were discussed that evening he found his controversial past 
resurrected 
d after all written a letter to castro in 1971 calling 
for a shift to material incentives for workers insteadrds meaning low 
pay 
he also ran afoul of the police in 1proselytyzing 
trying to convince fellow workers that the systeded 
fundamental change 
there also were allegations that he tried to leave the country 
during the mariel980 and that he even had made an 
attempt on castros life 
ahamonde rejects the latter allegations he has a letter from avernment 
official proving he never sought to emigrate 
stilrt 10 days after that issue was raised he recalon 
i responded that this was false he said i never had any 
intention of abandoningmy country 
the darkest pfor bahamonde occurred in may 1975 when he 
was detained for supposedly attempting to spread his anticommunistws 
he was subjected he cld to eight electric shock treatments 
on grounds that he was suffering from menurbances 
if he has any such problem it is not evident to the casual 
observer he projects a rational image 
it took me a long time to recover years he said referring 
to the impact of the shock treatment 
you lose your memory you cant even remember peoples names 
i thought i would even foget what i learned in the university 
alld he was detained 10 months after his arrest in1975 he 
was held 19 days in 1971 and another 583 
these problems dogged him last month when he launched his 
candidacy people wondered can anyone who has been in trouble with 
the law be counted on to fulfill his duties in elective office 
whthe votes were counted the answer was obviouslythere 
were 60 votes for aldama 31 for bahamondd 59 abstensions 
but bahamonde felt vindicated those who abstained he argued 
actually were his supportrs but were afraid to take a public stand 
in thofhands vote in a secret ballot bahamonde claims he 
would have won hands down 
before dawn tuesday twthe election bahamonde was 
hauled off by police shortly after arrival of mikhail s 
gorbachev 
bahamondof dissidents who had planned to 
take part in a demonstration to ask gorbachev to pressure castro

but may change some of their assignments 
all 172 veterans hospitals cannot be allpurpose entities

we have no intention whatsoever of closing any veterans 
medical facilities derwinski said

scott said wednesday the national aeronautics and space 
administration set up a similar line for its employees in the 
aftermath of the space shuttle challenger disaster 
among the most common feelings are hopelessness helplessness 
and worthlessness he said 
scott has been consulting with jeffrey mitchell a psychologist 
at the univerity of marylandbaltimore county known to police fire 
and medical services around the country as the founder of a process 
known as critical incident stress debriefing 
the process is designed to relieve the stress emergency service 
personnel encounter in masscasualty incidents and other crises 
a variation of the process may be valuable to the prince william 
sound communities devastated by the spill scott said 
mitchell has done similar work in other afflicted communities 
like palm bay fla after a gunman shot up a shopping mall 
killing six people and wounding 10 
mitchell warned that the children in the valdez area would be 
among the first to show the stress 
he said dont be surprised if children ask for cooking oil to 
put in the bathtub or out in the mud puddle scott said 
kansas psychologist richard gist a leading disaster expert was 
scheduled to arrive in valdez today said mark johnson state 
coordinator of emergency services 
mental health professionals should plan on seeing problems 
for two to three years at least scott said probably 
longer because of the total loss of lifestyle that may occur the 
loss of lifestyle is as important as loss of income 
mitchell suggested to scott that the effects on employment be 
evaluated as quickly as possible those that will lose their 
livelihood for the next year or two will need vocational 
rehablitation or it soon will have a negative impact on their 
mental health scott said 
in the interim scott said the emphasis will be on education 
trying to describe the reactions that are normal in such a 
situation and offering ways to deal with them

lawmakers have agreed to let us 
military forces continue joint training exercises with honduran 
troops in this central american country that borders nicaragua and 
el salvador 
in a separate action the legislature also approved new measures 
for cooperating with the united states to fight drug trafficking 
the military exercises agreement was approved by a 1322 vote on 
wednesday the lawmakers who voted no said the measure could hurt 
regional peace efforts 
the two countries have engaged in more than 80 joint military 
training exercises involving at least 60000 us and 20000 
honduran troops during the past 38 years 
the exercises were stepped up in 1982 when relations between 
honduras and the leftist sandinista government in nicaragua 
deteriorated and the united states built an air base in honduras 
honduras also has served as a refuge training ground and 
staging base for nicaraguan rebels about 11000 of whom have lived 
with their families in camps near the nicaraguan border since the 
us government cut off military aid to them in february 1988 
an estimated 1100 american troops currently are stationed at 
the enrique soto cano us air force base about 50 miles northeast 
of tegucigalpa 
the base is considered among the most important centers of us 
military operations in central america washington has been 
supporting the government of el salvador in its nineyear war 
against leftist rebels 
under the drug agreement honduran officials said they will work 
with the united states to crack down on drug production and 
trafficking both nations are to share information and human and 
technological resources 
during the past six years honduras caribbean coast has become 
a transfer point for drug shipments from colombia to the united 
states 
in the mostpublicized local case reputed drug baron juan ramon 
matta returned home to honduras in 1986 after escaping from a 
colombian prison 
his arrest in april 1988 at his home in tegucigalpa and rapid 
deportation to the united states touched off riots extradition of 
hondurans is prohibited by the constitution 
matta remains jailed at the federal prison in marion ill 
serving a threeyear sentence for escaping from a florida prison in 
1971

the tokyo stock exchanges main index plunged 
today ending seven days of gains while the dollar rose 
substantially against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which rose 4854 points to a 
record high on wednesday shed 36501 points or 11 percent to 
finish trading at 3299578 it was the indexs secondlargest 
decline this year following a 36621point drop on march 20 when 
it finished at 3165480 
stocks fell almost across the board as participants expressed 
concern about the recent rapid rise in the nikkei index which had 
gained more than 1800 points since last tuesday said a dealer 
with a major securities firm in tokyo 
uncertainty over possible political instability caused by a 
widening stockprofiteering scandal also discouraged participants 
the dealer said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the scandal has been continuing for some time but speculators 
are very concerned now about the situation he said 
prime minister noboru takeshita whose party is under fire for 
its links to recruit co the information services conglomerate at 
the center of the scandal suffered a major blow wednesday with 
reports he had received 380000 from the firm at fundraising 
parties in may 1987 
in the scandal the company reportedly sold hundreds of 
thousands of unlisted shares of a realestate subsidiary at 
discount prices to about 150 influential public and business 
figures the recipients of the shares made substantial profits 
after overthecounter trading began and the stocks quickly rose in 
value 
takeshitas public support ratings have plunged to about 10 
percent and he now faces strong pressure from the political 
opposition to resign 
investors secondlargest concern is inflation which made 
them either step off to the sidelines or sell issues because of the 
upcoming release of the us unemployment rate the dealer said 
the us jobless rate for march is to be announced friday in 
washington 
inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes to slow the economy 
could discourage stock investment 
trading was active with volume on the first section estimated 
at 11 billion shares down from wednesdays 18 billion shares 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar closed at 13215 yen 
up 078 yen from wednesdays 13137yen finish the us currency 
started trading at 13193 yen and ranged between 13175 and 13225 
yen 
a trader with mitsubishi bank said the dollaryen exchange rate 
changed little during the day as investors stayed on the sidelines 
trying to avoid major moves ahead of the release of the us 
unemployment rate 
basically the market has more demand for the dollar than the 
yen mainly because of the higher interest rates in the united 
states said the trader speaking on condition of anonymity 
for currency investors higher us interest rates make the 
dollar more attractive than the yen

mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo 
and seven associates could become the nations first mafia members 
to get the death penalty after being convicted of killing another 
gangster authorities said 
a jury deliberated about three hours wednesday before returning 
guilty verdicts on murder conspiracy and a weapons violation in 
the 1985 slaying of frank frankie flowers dalfonso who failed 
to show scarfo proper respect 
the conviction gave the 60yearold scarfo and his codefendants 
the prospect of execution or spending the rest of their lives in 
prison 
scarfo who heads the phildadelphiasouthern new jersey mafia 
is already serving a 14year sentence in a 1 million extortion 
case and faces at least 40 more years in a federal racketeering 
case 
common pleas court jury members had said they could return the 
death penalty if necessary assistant district attorney charles 
grant said he would seek that sentence on grounds the murder was 
deliberate and premeditated 
the jury was to begin hearing testimony in the penalty phase 
this afternoon 
no other us mafia member has been sentenced to death 
organized crime investigators say one mobster louis lepke 
buchalter was executed in the 1940s but he led murder inc a 
group of mercenary hit men not an italian mafia family 
robert f simone scarfos lawyer expressed concern about the 
penalty phase in light of the jurys quick verdict 
i dont think im going to get much sympathy from a jury that 
didnt even want to deliberate a case that affects the lives of 
eight people simone said 
the defense lawyers said that they would file appeals within 30 
days 
the prosecutions case focused on two informants one thomas 
delgiorno has testified against scarfo several times in the past 
two years he received a 20year sentence for his role in the 
dalfonso killing and other convictions 
the second eugene milano was scheduled to stand trial with the 
others but decided to cooperate to avoid a death sentence even 
though it meant tesitifying against his 27yearold brother 
nicholas nicky whip eugene milano pleaded guilty to 
thirddegree murder 
the defense attorneys branded the informants as liars 
attorney joseph santaguida who represented 31yearold 
defendant frank narducci jr said the jury just couldnt have 
examined the credibility of the witnesses so quickly but obviously 
they believed them 
after the jury foreman announced the first verdict for 
narducci narduccis wife sandy ran screaming from the courtroom 
stop it stop it you should all die narduccis mother 
adeline yelled at the jury 
like my father died dalfonsos daughter gina shouted 
back 
scarfo still faces charges in new jersey with nicholas nick 
the blade virgilio in the 1978 slaying of somers point municipal 
court judge edwin h helfant 
besides scarfo narducci and nicholas milano the others 
convicted were joseph ligambi 48 and narduccis 26yearold 
brother philip who were identified as the shooters francis 
faffy iannarella 32 accused of supplying the two murder guns 
salvatore chuckie merlino 47 and his brother lawrence 
yogi merlino 32 
during the trial which began march 17 the two informants 
testified scarfo gave the order to kill dalfonso because he lacked 
respect and refused to share profits from illegal operations with 
the mob dalfonso was shot on a south philadelphia street near his 
home

mayorelect richard m daleys promise that the 
doors of his office would remain open to blacks was greeted with 
guarded optimism by many of the political leaders who lost control 
of city hall 
the promise highlighted daleys tuesday night victory speech a 
day later acting mayor eugene sawyer told reporters you heard 
him say it well make sure he sticks to it 
also helping hold daley to his word sawyer said is the 
practical matter of having to face reelection in 1991 
im sure hell be extremely careful theyve got a short time 
youve got to have continuity in government you cant just go in 
there and clean out all the blacks said sawyer who is black 
daleys victory over chief rival timothy c evans the lone 
black in tuesdays election earned him the right to complete the 
final two years of the late harold washingtons second term 
and daley invoked the memory of washington as well as his 
political bossfather the late richard j daley in promising that 
the city that works will work first to unite an electorate 
deeply divided along racial lines 
the openness and fairness that the late mayor harold 
washington talked about will be in my administration in the city of 
chicago said daley whose victory ended six years of black 
political control in the nations thirdlargest city 
a mayor today has to bring people together from one end of 
this city to the other he added to accomplish the things that 
are necessary to give people a good quality of life 
during a round of interviews the 46yearold daley said he 
planned to leave soon for a brief vacation and would make few moves 
until his transition team completed its report his inauguration is 
set for april 24 his 47th birthday 
but before rushing off to attend to business that has stacked up 
in his states attorneys office during the fourmonth campaign he 
proposed several programs reminiscent of the shirtsleeve 
professionalism that earned chicago in his fathers days the 
moniker of the city that works 
i will bring out the best of my father he knew city 
government daley said he knew state and federal government 
he loved this city and worked very hard for this city and ill try 
to be like him 
evans most prominent supporter jesse jackson called for party 
unity and for blacks to move beyond the rivalry between sawyer and 
evans 
the basic harold washington coalition has remained a bit too 
divided and when we unite we will win jackson said pointing 
out there are only 18 months before the next election 
unofficial totals showed daley finishing with 55 percent of the 
vote to 43 percent for evans and 3 percent for republican edward 
vrdolyak 
daley was helped to victory tuesday by overwhelming white 
support low black turnout and clear majorities among liberal 
lakefront voters and hispanics

ah spring with its warming breezes budding 
trees and luscious smell of skunk spray 
marilyn planned a day of traveling for her antique business 
wednesday and if luck was with her thered be a dead skunk by the 
side of the road 
unfortunate for the skunk of course but what a wonderful smell 
theres nothing like it in the world said marilyn who 
doesnt want her last name known by people who might think theres 
something weird about her 
in her 50 years the suburban woman has had to endure the 
solitary pleasure of reveling in the odor of skunk while getting 
the fisheye from her husband children other relatives and friends 
she wondered was there anyone else like her out there 
in january marilyn ran an ad in usa todays personal column 
calling all skunk lovers 
my family and friends think i am the only person in the world 
that likes the skunk scent i would like to prove them wrong so if 
you or anyone you know likes the scent please reply 
one response came from a woman in nevada who apparently didnt 
read the personal ad very carefully since she offered marilyn a 
job in her brothel 
but the 70 other letters were from people like marilyn 
my husband said i must be the only one in the world because 
god couldnt possibly have made anyone like me since the smell is a 
defense mechanism said marilyn 
ha how wrong her husband can be 
listen to this letter from west virginia 
i can think of no combination of things using the five senses 
that can rival the feel of a warm summer breeze the taste of a 
cool drink the sights of a beautiful garden the sound of rushing 
water and the faint smell of skunk 
another writer said he never tries to hit a live skunk when hes 
driving but if a skunk lay dead i might try to get a little on 
the wheel 
other writers called the musky scent sensuous and 
intriguingly delicate 
and what about this exclamation pointfilled letter from 
california 
ive fed skunks before in yosemite national park i once dated 
a woman in 1980 who owned four skunks in new mexico we walked them 
in the parks on long leashes and they love to have their heads 
scratched feel welcome to write me anytime im 36 italian 5 ft 
10 190 pds brown eyes and wavy hair i love a skunks scent 
write back 
actually california presents a puzzle 
recently ive had the chance to wiff the west coast california 
skunk wrote a transplanted southerner and i can tell you 
truthfully it didnt do a thing for me 
marilyn said she lived for 12 years in a semidesert area of 
southern california and never had the pleasure even once of getting 
skunk scent 
otherwise the 30000 miles marilyn and her husband travel 
yearly in their antiques business have revealed no favorite 
stretches of road for catching the odor no sections of the country 
that produce superior scents 
its all just wonderful she said

a 12yearold girl who told police 
she was overwhelmed by her babysitting duties will be tried as an 
adult in the strangling of her 2yearold brother and choking of 
her 15monthold sister 
a broward county grand jury indicted fifthgrader arva betts as 
an adult on charges of seconddegree murder and aggravated child 
abuse the grand jury could have sent the case to juvenile court 
her lawyer said arvas age and the fact that she had no history 
of violent behavior and no criminal record should have supported a 
juvenile charge 
were disappointed and shocked that the grand jury decided to 
indict her said attorney johnny mccray jr there was little if 
any evidence put on to support trying her as an adult 
investigators were initially baffled when arvas mother sally 
butterfield woke up the morning of march 14 and found andrew 
caesar dead and his sister tiffany caesar injured at their home 
in nearby wilton manors 
arva who was 11 years old at the time was taken into custody 
when it was determined that andrew had been strangled 
police said the child confessed to the attack and said she was 
overwhelmed by the responsibility of watching her half brother and 
half sister from when she got home from school until 11 at night 
her mother worked two jobs to support the family 
tiffany is hospitalized in critical condition at memorial 
hospital in hollywood doctors say she could be permanently 
disabled 
arva remained at the countys juvenile detention center 
wednesday night and was to be transferred today to the broward 
county jail but mccray said he would ask the court to let her 
remain in the custody of the state department of health and 
rehabilitative services 
society would not benefit by placing her among adults 
mccray said 
no charges have been filed against ms butterfield but casey 
said she is being investigated by health and rehabilitative 
services officials for possible neglect charges

nikita s khrushchevs secret speech 
denouncing dictator josef stalin was published for the first time 
in the soviet union today 33 years after it sent shock waves 
through the soviet bloc tass reported 
khrushchevs speech to a closed communist party congress in 1956 
put an abrupt end to three decades of official glorification of 
stalin a period during which complaints about his regime often met 
with prison or death 
the text appears in the monthly news from the soviet communist 
party central committee the official news agency said 
copies of the journal were being mailed exclusively to its 
650000 subscribers a staff member of the journal said 
citizens who do not already subscribe will not be able to buy a 
copy the staffer said all subscription copies were en route to 
the post office today 
copies of the speech were leaked to the west and published just 
days after khrushchev disclosed that stalin had used torture 
arrests and fabricated charges to purge the leading ranks of the 
communist party 
khrushchev who was toppled from power in 1964 did not tell the 
entire story of stalins bloody crimes he omitted the dictators 
war against the peasants through forced collectivization and 
ignored his own role during the reign of terror 
stalin ruled the soviet union from 1924 until his death in 1953 
prominent soviets have called for the publication of the speech 
in their own land for years top members of the communist party 
heard summaries of the speech read at meetings after the congress 
but for the soviet public at large it has remained a mystery 
khrushchev freed many people imprisoned under stalin and pulled 
back from other repressive measures but the destalinization 
stopped after he left office 
president mikhail s gorbachev has resumed the process and 
discussion of stalins repressions now is widespread 
the same journal in february printed another socalled secret 
speech that of former moscow party chief boris n yeltsin 
in remarks to the central committee in october 1987 yeltsin 
said gorbachev was being glorified and that the soviet people had 
gained virtually nothing from the soviet leaders reforms the 
speech led to yeltsins ouster as moscow party boss and removal 
from the ruling politburo

many cuban exile leaders interpret this weeks 
meeting between fidel castro and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as 
evidence of cubas growing political isolation 
gorbachevs support for glasnost during his cuban visit and 
castros speech refusing to endorse his guests political 
liberalization program left miamis many exiles gloating 
i think it was a suicidal speech gorbachev is the one that 
pays for cuba and keeps the economy running said tomas regalado 
news director of the spanishlanguage radio station wqba 
i have to say that castro is too old to change his ways but 
now the world now is changing he is in the past 
huber matos a militant exile leader who even recently has been 
involved in a gunrunning case allegedly aimed at castro was 
exultant about gorbachevs visit with the cuban leader 
this is a great punishment from heaven matos said 
wednesday castro has been betrayed ideologically by the soviet 
union 
some hoped that gorbachevs pressure may do what the bay of pigs 
invasion in 1961 failed to accomplish and finally bring to an end 
the fantasy many exiles still nurture of returning to cuba to 
overthrow castro 
its very difficult for me to imagine a counterrevolution 
said rodolfo cortina an administrator at florida international 
university i cant see the veterans in their 40s and 50s full 
of cholesterol and good living climbing over the seawall into 
havana 
with the lessening of soviet support for cuba along with 
gorbachevs efforts to please the united states exiles here may 
now be more willing to accept the gradual change that seems the 
most likely avenue of reform inside cuba cortina said 
if it means any reduction in human suffering then im for 
it he added 
others however fear that at least in the short run human 
rights may be a victim of the ideological rift rather than its 
beneficiary they note that even as gorbachev bid farewell to 
castro the cuban government began rounding up known dissidents 
castro cannot afford an easing of controls over the

the bridge that collapsed and sent eight 
people to their deaths was in better shape than many of the aging 
bridges nationwide said transportation secretary samuel skinner 
skinner went to the site of the bridge collapse on wednesday 
four cars and a tractortrailer plunged into the hatchie river when 
a section of the 55yearold bridge collapsed saturday 50 miles 
north of memphis 
there are bridges that are in more need of repair than this 
one said skinner during his visit 
sen jim sasser dtenn who accompanied skinner said more 
than 200000 of the 575000 bridges in the united states are 
classified as deficient those weaknesses sasser said range 
from minor deficiencies to major deficiencies that could lead to 
tragedies similar to the one we see here 
the collapse left a gaping hole in the two northbound lanes of 
us highway 51 but a newer companion bridge for two southbound 
lanes was undamaged the southbound bridge was closed for 
inspection but was expected to reopen for twoway traffic today or 
friday 
authorities say spring floods may have undercut a bridge 
support but the cause of the collapse has not been determined 
skinner said he will press for a national policy on repairing 
highway and railroad bridges were going to put a program 
together and were going to try to find a way to fund it the 
secretary said 
repairing the bridges known to be in immediate need could cost 
upwards of 70 billion skinner said 
even though thousands of bridges are in bad shape bridge 
inspections generally are sufficient in tennessee as well as other 
states skinner said 
the hatchie bridge passed inspection in 1987 and was due for 
another one in about six months 
that bridge is not anywhere close to the bottom of bridges 
in this country skinner said

the prosecutor who tried to keep a man imprisoned 
after his conviction in a police killing was overturned has been 
fired his boss cited policy conflicts for the dismissal 
assistant district attorney winfield scott is the third 
prosector involved in the case of randall dale adams to leave the 
office this week 
i found we had a conflict regarding current office policies 
that simply could not be resolved any other way said dallas 
county district attorney john vance he would not elaborate on 
wednesdays firing 
scott did not return repeated calls from the associated press 
other officials at the office declined comment 
over scotts objections adams was released from a texas prison 
march 22 less than a month after a state court overturned his 
conviction for the 1976 slaying of a dallas police officer 
adams spent more than 12 years in prison his case was 
chronicled in the documentary the thin blue line in which a 
key prosecution witness recanted his testimony that adams was the 
triggerman 
adams attorney randy schaffer said wednesday that scotts 
actions were deplorable but added that he was being made a 
scapegoat for following the offices marching orders 
scott who served as assistant district attorny in dallas for 21 
years participated in the original prosecution of adams and helped 
choose a jury for the 1977 trial 
in fighting adams release scott said state district court 
judge larry baraka and eight of the nine appellate judges were 
liberal and biased in adams favor he asked that baraka be 
removed from the case 
the day after adams release vance said there wasnt enough 
credible evidence to retry him and the murder charge was dropped 
at the time vance said he would investigate scotts behavior as a 
personnel matter 
earlier this week prosecutors john creuzot and leslie mcfarlane 
left saying they were going into private practice both had been 
with the office about six years and had worked on the adams case

the pilot of a world airways jet that slid off an 
icy runway into boston harbor in 1982 said a jury award of more 
than 1 million justified his seven years of trauma and 
heartache 
pilot peter langley and copilot donald hertzfeldt had suffered 
emotional distress impairment of earning capacity lost wages 
and minor physical injuries from the january 1982 crash said 
their attorney walter walker 
a federal jury wednesday awarded langley 1021840 and 
hertzfeldt 444700 
massachusetts port authority which operates logan international 
airport does not believe the evidence supports the verdict and 
plans to ask us district judge robert a keeton to set the award 
aside next week said agency spokeswoman teresa mcalpine by law 
the pilot and copilot cannot seek damages against the federal 
government 
a separate federal jury earlier this year determined that the 
crash was caused by icy runway conditions at logan and that the 
federal aviation association and the port authority had failed to 
apprise langley of the situation yet another federal jury awarded 
the airline more than 30 million for the loss of the jet 
langley 64 said the decision was justification for ones 
position over the last seven years and the trauma and all the 
heartache thats been going on in retrospect id rather that it 
hadnt happened now that it has i think it is a fair judgment 
i think the last 30 seconds on the runway are something that 
im going to live with the rest of my life he said for a 
pilot to feel hes not fully in control of his airplane is a most 
frightening experience 
langley said he lost confidence and interest in flying after the 
crash and gave up his plans to become a flight engineer after he 
reached the mandatory retirement age of 60 
hertzfeldt is working as a pan am shuttle copilot which walker 
said was the only job he could get with a crash on his record 
langley said he mentioned the tarmac seemed slippery when the 
jet touched down then a few seconds later i said no braking to 
the crew langley said 
as the end of the runway approached he saw the landing lights 
and pilings of a light tower that jutted out into boston harbor 
langley said he was literally standing on the brakes with the 
engines in full reverse thrust 
when the dc10 stopped the front end was in boston harbor and 
the nose which had broken off was partially submerged the crew 
had to swim to safety and two people sitting in the front seats 
were never found and presumably drowned

the new spiritual leader of moslems in 
belgium the netherlands and luxembourg whose predecessor was 
slain in brussels main mosque has received death threats police 
said today 
we are taking this very seriously a police official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said the threats that imam 
samir rahdi received over the telephone apparently stemmed from his 
moderate views 
the previous imam abdullah ahdal was killed along with his 
librarian after ahdal failed to support the death sentence 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini issued feb 14 against author salman 
rushdie for his novel the satanic verses which some claim 
insults islam ahdal also had received threats 
like ahdal rahdi is a saudi national ahdal also was a former 
student of rahdis it is somewhat logical that there are new 
threats since he has the same views as his predecessor the 
police official said 
the official would not specify when the threats were made but 
belgian newspapers reported they were made in calls on saturday and 
tuesday 
on friday a proiran fundamentalist group in beirut claimed 
responsibility for the murders the group soldiers of justice 
said it carried out gods verdict by killing the imam and his 
librarian salim behir 
both were shot in the head and neck from close range security 
around brussels main mosque was increased after the latest 
threats police said

nepals ambassador to india says her 
country has been facing severe shortages of food and medicine since 
two treaties with india expired last month a newspaper reported 
today 
as of march 23 not a pin has moved into nepal except one 
truck of rotten oranges and onions ambassador bhinda shah told 
the statesman an englishlanguage newspaper based in bombay 
india closed 13 of its 15 customs checkpoints along the 
1090mile border with the himalayan kingdom after the trade and 
transit treaties expired march 23 most of nepals foreign trade is 
with india or conducted through india 
after the treaties expired the supply of essential items such 
as medicine fuel and baby food stopped mrs shah said 
we are flying in medicines from bangkok or singapore she 
told the newspaper in an interview wednesday 
nepal has asked india to hold talks either in katmandu or in new 
delhi to complete drafts of new treaties india has yet to respond 
mrs shah said the two countries signed and approved a draft 
treaty on oct 12 1988 but india abrogated the draft on march 1 
and told nepal the trade and transit arrangement would lapse she 
said 
india has insisted on a unified trade and transit treaty which 
mrs shah said was a regressive step since transit is a 
recognized right of access to sea of landlocked countries a right 
which has also been recongnized by india she was quoted as 
saying 
the two countries have maintained friendly ties for decades but 
india became increasingly concerned about nepals relations with 
china 
india and china fought a border war in 1962 and since then their 
relations have remained uneasy in august nepal bought unspecified 
chinese arms for its 30000man armed forces 
in the interview mrs shah said the arms acquisition was purely 
for the internal security of nepal to guard against possible 
terrorist attacks 
nepal locked between india and china has to maintain good 
relations with both and there is no question of nepal having 
improved relations with any country at the cost of india the 
statesman quoted mrs shah as saying

movement banned for seven years could be formally registered in 
court within two weeks the agreement allows solidarity to organize

solidarity must now organize the nations provincial governors and 
city mayors he said the agreement was a political victory a 
theoretical one which may turn out to be a victory or a disaster if 
we are not able to make use of it

the restoration of the soviet blocs first independent trade union 
which claimed 10 million members and ignited that nations spirit 
during its 16month legal existence in 198081 
he said he expected solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 million 
members he said he would like to see at least three competing 
trade unions

to revive polands crumbling economy came after two months of 
intensive talks the pact also reinstates independent student 
farmer and artistic organizations banned with solidarity after a 
december 1981 military crackdown

involved 57 participants representing the opposition the 
government and the roman catholic church

elections to the 460member lower house of parliament or sejm 
that guarantee the communist party and its allies a 65 percent 
majority 
but a new house of parliament a 100member senate would be the 
first freely elected legislative body in the soviet bloc and would 
have veto power over the sejm any citizen who collects 3000 
signatures can run for the senate and all seats would be openly 
contested 
a presidency also would be created to be elected jointly by the 
sejm and the senate the president would be elected this year to a 
sixyear term and would have broad powers to dissolve parliament 
and veto laws the post is expected to go to jaruzelski 
communist officials hope the broad agreement will provide poland 
with political and labor stability so economic reforms can work to 
fight high inflation constant consumer shortages and polands 39

gov bill clements plans to sign into law a 
measure requiring all motorcycle riders to wear helmets his 
spokesman said 
the governor believes the evidence is overwhelming that 
motorcycle helmets are in the public interest and will clearly 
enhance public safety said reggie bashur clements press 
secretary 
the bill which has passed the senate was approved by the house 
on an 8255 vote wednesday and faces a final vote today 
the action came despite arguments that the bill would interfere 
with adults freedom of choice 
rep larry warner called the measure a nanny bill and said 
the current law requiring helmets for those under age 18 is 
sufficient 
this is a babysitting bill he said he suggested that 
future measures in the same vein might tell us we need to get 
more exercise and eight hours worth of sleep and stop smoking and 
eat all our vegetables and sit up straight 
rep ralph wallace also defended his right to choose whether to 
wear protective headgear 
i own a motorcycle and i own a helmet sometimes i wear a 
helmet and sometimes i dont its a matter of choice sometimes i 
like to feel the wind blowing through my hair wallace said 
rep mike mckinney said the bill is an issue of public health 
and its an issue of legitimate public concern he said studies 
show riders without helmets are more likely to have head injuries 
and are twice as likely to be killed in accidents 
when a person neglects his own health safety or his welfare 
then all of us suffer said mckinney a physician and house bill

taiwan will send an official delegation to 
china for the first time to attend the annual meeting of the asian 
development bank in beijing next month the government announced 
today 
the government said the 12member delegation will be led by 
finance minister shirley kuo and will include officials from the 
finance ministry the foreign ministry and governmentowned banks 
the decision taken by the government cabinet at a regular 
weekly meeting was regarded as another step in a new nationalist 
inititive to counter communist chinas efforts to isolate taiwan 
internationally 
a foreign ministry spokesman chen yuchu told reporters the 
cabinets decision did not signal a change in government policies 
toward china he said taiwan would continue to oppose official 
contacts with the rival communists who won a civil war in 1949 
forcing the nationalists to flee to taiwan 
chen said the delegation would not discuss relations between the 
rival governments and that the cabinet decided to approve the trip 
because the annual meeting was being organized by the asian 
development bank and not beijing 
he said the delegation would attend the threeday meeting which 
begins on may 4 to ensure that taiwan could actively 
participate in the development bank and also to fulfill taiwans 
obligations as a founding member of the bank 
chang chungtung history professor at the national taiwan 
university described the governments decision as a major 
breakthrough and said it could lead to further flexibility toward 
the mainland 
he said it was probably intended to pressure the chinese 
communists to accept de facto nationalist rule over this island 
the nationalists continue to claim they are the legitimate 
government of all china and have maintained a policy of no 
contacts no talks no compromise toward communist china since 
their defeat on the china mainland 
but in the past year the nationalists have relaxed their policy 
on private contacts between taiwanese and mainland chinese and have 
allowed an exchange of visits trade and cultural ties 
the asian development bank was founded in 1966 to help regional 
development the 47member organization voted in 1986 to admit 
china and changed taiwans membership name from the republic of 
china the official nationalist name to taipei china 
nationalist officials protested then saying the change 
relegated taiwan to a provincial government under china the 
nationalists boycotted the development banks annual meetings in 
1986 and 1987 but attended last years meeting in manila the 
philippines where the bank has its headquarters 
chen said the nationalists are still opposed to the taipei 
china designation he said the nationalists would continue to 
negotiate with the bank to work out a compromise solution 
acceptable to both parties 
since the 1970s taiwan has been virtually isolated 
diplomatically it is now recognized by only 23 nations while most 
other countries recognize the mainland government

mayor edward i koch told a state commission 
investigating charges of patronage in city hiring that some 
apparently improper procedures amounted to peanuts when 
compared to the citys overall hiring system 
koch appeared wednesday before a commission studying claims that 
the talent bank a clearinghouse for city job applicants was used 
to award city jobs to politically connected people 
the state commission on government integrity has heard testimony 
that the talent bank had become a patronage operation contrary to 
kochs intent 
koch said the commissions hearings had created the impression 
that there is massive patronage in my administration and that 
this massive patronage was hidden behind a sham affirmative 
action program 
these charges are false he said 
koch called the number of talent bank jobs filled under 
questionable circumstances from 1983 to 1986 peanuts 
the talent bank placed about 3000 people in jobs most paying 
less than 20000 a year 
if i had wanted to have a massive patronage program i could 
have koch said but i did not want to have nor did i have a 
patronage operation 
in his defense koch said testimony had described practices at 
the talent bank that he would not have approved those practices 
involved only a part of the talent banks job referral services 
the laborers deck hands and ferry agents at two agencies he said 
and the talent bank itself was and is a very small part of the 
citys hiring program he said 
commission chairman john d feerick asked the mayor if he had 
failed in his responsibilities because he wasnt aware among other 
things that the talent bank computer listed applicants by who 
their political sponsor was that documents were destroyed to hide 
this fact that job postings were waived so they could be filled 
with political appointees 
koch said he could only review the citys 42 agencies by 
checking results not by watching daytoday operations 
feerick said the commission would deliver a report to the 
governor sometime in may 
the commission was appointed by gov mario m cuomo to 
investigate corruption and inefficiency in state and municipal 
governments the commission cannot prosecute but can report its 
findings to prosecutors and suggest legislation

potentially dangerous ultraviolet radiation 
streamed through the south polar ozone hole during the antarctic 
spring at levels not usually reached until months later the 
national science foundation reports 
while few people reside in antarctica to be threatened by the 
potential for skin cancer and other damage from the radiation 
scientists fear the rise there could presage conditions in other 
areas of the world 
the increased ultraviolet radiation was measured at the united 
states palmer station last september through december spring in 
that part of the world the foundation reported wednesday 
this is the first measurement of a clearly significant 
enhancement in uv radiation reaching the ground that is linked to 
human impact on the ozone layer reported john e frederick of 
the university of chicago 
scientists there have been studying radiation levels because of 
concerns about the depletion in the amount of ozone in the 
atmosphere high above the antarctic that depletion has come to be 
known as an ozone hole in recent years 
ozone which helps filter out dangerous radiation from the sun 
is damaged by manmade chemicals and the fear has risen that if it 
is depeleted over other parts of the earth rates of skin cancer 
could rise and plants and other animals could also be damaged 
the antarctic ozone depletion is usually at its worst in the 
septemberdecember period a time when there is generally only 
little sunligbt reaching that part of the world 
even so the scientists found that rates of ultraviolet 
radiation reaching the ground were typical of those usually found 
in midsummer in that region a time of much more intense sunlight 
the researchers are hoping to determine if the changes in 
radiation will affect the food chain in the region ultraviolet 
radiation can kill plankton which form the basis of the food chain 
in the ocean but the effect diminishes with the depth of the water 
early indications were that there was no immediate threat the 
researchers said but they plan to continue their studies 
in a parallel experiment last fall scientists working over the 
north polar region determined that an ozone hole has not appeared 
there but they said conditions are ripe for depletion of the 
protective gas in that region also 
a northern ozone hole could pose a much greater threat since 
the bulk of the worlds population lives in the northern hemisphere

the bush administration is considering a 
proposal to require that gun buyers register semiautomatic assault 
rifles of the kind linked to mounting drugrelated violence 
stephen higgins director of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms said that proposal among others is being studied by 
government agencies as the administration weighs additional steps 
to control the deadly weapons 
ive been asked to give comments on that and a lot of other 
proposals that were made higgins said wednesday the 
administration is involved in looking at the entire issue getting 
input from a lot of people of which this agency is one 
another administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said today that putting semiautomatic rifles in the same 
category as machine guns requiring an fbi background check and a 
waiting period is one of the options actively being 
considered 
the official also said that some steps to crack down on the 
sales of highpowered rapidfire weapons could be announced by the 
administration within the next few weeks 
an initial plan dealing just with the district of columbia was 
to be unveilled on monday by federal drug coordinator william j 
bennett the official said this package would deal more with such 
issues as finding more prison space and expanded use of federal 
prosecutors than with the guns themselves since the district 
already has tough guncontrol laws on the books 
higgins made his comments as he discussed the administrations 
move to widen its temporary import ban on assault rifles to include 
virtually all foreignmade models 
earlier wednesday the white house had announced that 24 models 
of semiautomatic assault rifles were being added to the list of 
weapons already covered by the 90day ban on imports imposed last 
month 
the initial import suspension covered as many as 400000 
weapons the additional list covers permits to import up to 250000 
more higgins said 
we think weve got 999 percent of the foreignmade 
semiautomatic rifles higgins said 
the 90day period for banning imports of semiautomatic weapons 
will enable atf to determine if any of the weapons on the list are 
used for legitimate sporting purposes the gun control act of 1968 
bans the importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate 
sporting purposes 
these are weapons which are identical in design to those on 
the original list higgins said they are basically paramilitary 
in appearance they are largecapacity magazines 
importers have been given 30 days to substantiate that the 
weapons they are selling are being used for sporting purposes he 
said 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
a prime reason for expanding the ban was to prevent a few gun 
manufacturers from gaining an unfair competitive edge 
but he conceded that there is some unfairness because the 
ban still does not affect americanmade highpowered rifles which 
account for 75 percent to 80 percent of the market 
unfortunately it is not something we can do anything about 
fitzwater said to do anything about domestically manufactured 
weapons would require a change in the law 
fitzwater declined to say whether bush would eventually propose 
a change in the law to include the americanmade weapons 
but higgins said a proposal to require registration of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles is under study 
he said president bush has asked him to comment on imposing a 
registration requirement on semiautomatic rifles that would be akin 
to the current rules governing machine guns and other military 
weapons 
cbs news reported wednesday night that bennett whom bush had 
asked to recommend what should be done about the weapons told bush 
a week ago that rambolooking rifles with a large clip should 
be treated the same as the machine guns 
larry cirignano a bennett spokesman said the network report 
was not an accurate depiction of bennetts views but he 
declined to elaborate we never talk about what we recommend to 
the president he said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio last week proposed a 200 
registration fee and a requirement that purchasers of the weapons 
be fingerprinted and submit to a background check 
metzenbaums proposal was among a number of issues discussed 
last week by bush and top federal law enforcement officials at a 
white house meeting 
the atf director declined to describe the administrations 
deliberations on the proposal but that system is being 
considered by a lot of different people he said 
the administration first suspended imports of assault rifles on 
march 14 amid mounting furor over the use of such guns by drug 
dealers and other criminals notably the slaying of five children 
in a stockton calif schoolyard in january 
the next day colt industries inc suspended sales of its popular 
ar15 rifle an americanmade weapon similar to assaultstyle 
rifles covered by the import ban 
bush a member of the national rifle association has slowly 
been moving away from the nras hardline advocacy of the right to 
bear arms of any type 
while bush initially opposed any outlawing of guns the latest 
move marks another advance in the administrations tougher stance 
on assault weapons 
the presidents latest action drew sharp criticism from a group 
of conservative republican lawmakers who met with white house chief 
of staff john sununu to register their objections 
most of us felt the action today solves no problems 
administratively its a nightmare practically it solves 
nothing said rep larry craig ridaho 
widening the ban was a confirmation of the fact that he bush 
is parting company with guncontrol opponents said craig

a highly tentative projection by the 
agriculture department shows that 1989 wheat production could be 
about 245 billion bushels a 35 percent boost from last years 
droughtshriveled harvest 
if the harvest turns out to be that much it would be the 
largest us wheat output since 1984 when production was almost 
26 billion bushels 
wheat production dropped in later years as tighter acreage 
restrictions were imposed to help curb rising grain surpluses and 
drought took its toll last year as production dropped to 181 
billion bushels 
suddenly oncelarge grain inventories were drained off and 
market prices rose the usda eased planting requirements for 1989 
and is looking at possible adjustments for next year 
the departments agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service has published a preliminary regulatory analysis of the 
current wheat situation to help plan the 1990 program including 
some fresh projections for this year 
the forecasts for the 1989 crop year are highly tentative 
the report said production forecasts are subject to wide 
variability at this time because winter wheat has not been 
harvested and spring wheat has not been planted 
despite such vagaries the agencys report projected the 1989 
wheat acreage for harvest at 655 million acres up nearly a fourth 
from 532 million acres harvested in 1988 that would be the 
largest acreage since 1984 when 669 million were harvested 
the average yield per acre harvested was projected at 374 
bushels up from 34 bushels in 1988 that would produce a total 
wheat crop this year of 245 billion bushels 
despite the boost in production it would leave total us wheat 
supplies in the 198990 marketing year that will begin june 1 at 
only 3 billion bushels about what they were in the current year 
total wheat use in the year ahead was projected at 247 billion 
bushels or still more than this the 1989 harvest 
as a result the wheat carryover a year from now on june 1 
1990 would be around 534 million bushels or the same as it is 
expected to be this june 1 
the report projected the farm price of wheat to average 365 
per bushel over the 198990 marketing year down 10 cents from a 
forecast of 375 for the current year 
analysts said the projections take into account severe drought 
in kansas where wheat production is expected to be cut sharply this 
year 
other usda insider estimates of kansas wheat production are 
ranging from about 190 million bushels to as much as 315 million 
bushels this year compared with 323 million bushels produced in 
1988 and a 198688 annual average of 342 million 
kansas wheat farmers planted 124 million acres last fall up 
sharply from 102 million planted for the 1988 crop 
according to one set of jottings abandonment because of dry 
weather might reduce this years harvest to 105 million acres in 
which case yields could average 30 bushels per acre a total state 
output of 315 million bushels 
under another scenario however the kansas crop might be 
reduced to 99 million harvested acres a yield of 25 bushels and a 
total output of 250 million bushels the worst case version calls 
for 93 million acres harvested an average of 20 bushels per acre 
and a total harvest of 190 million bushels

the agriculture department plans to step up 
purchases of pork for donation to schools and other institutions to 
help bolster sagging hog prices paid to farmers 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said wednesday the 
department not only has bought more pork this year but it also 
has bought a greater variety of pork items than in prior years 
frozen hams and canned pork are the main items bought by usda 
for distribution to schools and other domestic feeding programs in 
addition the department soon will begin buying canned luncheon 
meat including pork he said 
farmers have marketed unusually high numbers of hogs in 
recent months which have helped depress market prices yeutter 
said since last july 1 the beginning of the current purchasing 
year usda has spent more than 96 million for pork compared with 
30 million the previous year

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought an additional 200000 metric tons of us corn for 
delivery this year under a longterm supply agreement 
more than 23 million tons have been purchased since the soviets 
resumed buying us corn on march 28 after a layoff of almost three 
months 
the corn is scheduled for delivery by sept 30 the end of the 
sixth year of a longterm grain supply agreement between the soviet 
union and the united states 
officials said wednesday the latest sales brought total corn 
sold to the soviets for 198889 to more than 125 million tons 
additionally sales include 4 million tons of wheat 450000 tons 
of soybeans 14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons of 
grain sorghum 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 200000 tons of 
corn would be about 79 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 246 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around 20 million

a city councilwoman faces possible legal 
action because she lied about her age on her sworn candidacy 
application 
since i was divorced 13 years ago i have consistently knocked 
10 years off my age along with every other woman in the united 
states loyce crouch said 
ms crouch 59 surrendered her keys to city hall saying she 
will never return after she acknowledged at a city council meeting 
tuesday night that she had misrepresented her age since she won her 
first election in 1979 
she said she stated in her candidate applications that she was 
born in 1940 although voter registration records showed that she 
was born in 1929 
district attorney jim mapel said he plans to present allegations 
to a grand jury that ms crouch committed perjury 
if knocking 10 years off my age constitutes perjury in the 
eyes of those people well then this evidently is not the nation 
that i revered she said 
city attorney j kay gayle says the problem is not that crouch 
lied about her age but that she falsified a public document and 
swore that the information included in the document was correct 
ms crouch claims the matter was brought up because some other 
members of the city council dont want me to sit here 
i am being pushed so that i will no longer open my mouth 
she said im tired of it all

this potatofarming community of about 600 
is facing insolvency after being ordered to pay 50000 to settle a 
decadeold lawsuit by a poolhall owner arrested for opening on a 
sunday 
town attorney winston jacobo told the town council it has been 
ordered to pay by 4 pm tuesday or the council members will be 
held in contempt of court 
jacobo told council members they have about 65000 available 
but also have unrelated bills totaling 31000 
if you vote to pay it the settlement you vote to make the 
town insolvent jacobo said we dont have the money to pay 
the council authorized jacobo to ask attorneys for george 
pierce the poolhall owner to accept 20000 now and 10000 a 
year until the debt is paid 
alternatives would be for the town to declare bankruptcy or ask 
the legislature to take away the towns charter 
if the town becomes insolvent jacobo said the state might pull 
the towns charter anyway 
about 75 people crammed into town hall late wednesday to find 
out whether hastings could remain solvent 
one resident dartha marshall said none of the council members 
were in city government when the arrest was made and should not be 
held accountable she blamed former mayors jody bateman and greg 
maltby and the former town attorney for the problem 
in 1978 pierce now 52 was arrested for operating his game 
room on a sunday afternoon in violations of a local law 
county judge robert andreu threw out the charges and pierce 
filed a lawsuit he claimed he lost 100000 in business from the 
incident 
a jury awarded him 44000 in 1981 but a judge reduced it to 
23800 later a new trial was ordered and this time in 1984 a 
jury awarded him 65000 
some payments have been made but the town still owes almost 
50000

dennis r patrick says the deregulatory 
approach he took toward the broadcasting and telephone industries 
during his two years as head of the federal communications 
commission will continue after his departure 
patrick who on wednesday announced his resignation from the 
commission said there was no discussion of a possible successor 
when he turned in his resignation at the white house the previous 
day he said he was not pressured to leave his post 
among those mentioned as possible replacements was sherrie 
marshall a former patrick aide who was on loan to the white house 
during the unsuccessful confirmation proceedings for defense 
secretarydesignate john tower 
washington attorneys susan wing and jim smith also have been 
mentioned along with alfred sikes head of the commerce 
departments national telecommunications and information 
administration 
at a news conference patrick said he was confident the next fcc 
chairman would carry on an agenda seeking deregulation he said 
there would be no substantial slowing of progress 
it is not a static telecommunications market and the 
regulatory response will not be static he said 
patrick thanked president bush for his continuing support 
despite rumors he had been on the skids since bush took office 
calling his resignation absolutely voluntary patrick said 
the white house has been absolutely supportive of me since day 
one 
patrick said he would return to private industry but would 
remain in his job until a replacement was named the 37yearold 
former california attorney said he has no plans has conducted no 
job interviews and would not excuse himself from any pending fcc 
decisions 
until he leaves the fcc it will be business as usual 
patrick said 
we have accomplished substantially all his agenda and now 
i desire and am very anxious to return to the private sector 
one of patricks congressional foes rep edward markey 
dmass said he looked forward to a better balance between 
consumer and business interests under a new fcc chairman he said 
deregulation under patrick had turned into deregulation for 
deregulations sake 
but patrick was praised widely by industry representatives 
james billingsley american telephone amp telegraph cos senior 
vice president federal regulation said patrick has been an 
enthusiastic and forceful proponent of fundamental changes in 
regulation that will greatly serve the public interest and our 
industry long after he has left the commission 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said patrick was a man of principle and dedication 
who has made his mark on communications policy 
william l weiss chairman of the ameritech phone company said 
he was optimistic a successor will be selected who will build on 
mr patricks contributions to a progressive regulatory framework 
for the information age 
patrick was named to the fcc by thenpresident reagan in 1983 
after working in the white house personnel office and was named 
chairman succeeding mark s fowler in april 1987 
among his major accomplishments patrick successfully proposed 
the change in the way longdistance rates are set by atampt and led 
the fccs repeal of the fairness doctrine which required 
broadcasters to air opposing views on controversial issues 
under patrick the commission also has moved to change the way 
broadcasters are licensed guaranteed exclusive licenses to 
syndicated tv programs made a preliminary ruling on standards for 
highdefinition television and generally has followed the 
deregulatory approach of the reagan administration 
the commission has been two members short of its normal 
fivemember complement since last year nominations to fill the two 
vacant seats were held up because of senate displeasure with 
patricks policies

house speaker jim wright converted a 3000 
speaking fee from a texas university into a bulk sale of his book 
reflections of a public man because he otherwise couldnt 
accept the money under house rules the speaker acknowledged 
the sale of 504 copies of the book to southwest texas state 
university following a 1984 lecture wright delivered at the school 
is under examination along with other such sales as part of an 
ethics committee investigation of the speakers finances 
the panel is looking into whether wright used the book sales in 
some instances to evade limits house rules impose on outside income 
from speaking and writing fees and is examining other areas of the 
speakers conduct for potential violations of at least four other 
rules 
in october 1984 when wright delivered the university speech he 
already was bumping up against the 23630 maximum he could accept 
in speaking fees for the year under house rules in addition the 
3000 check the university sent him was 1000 more than the 
maximum the rules allow 
an aide asked him what to do about it wright told reporters on 
wednesday 
i said 3000 is actually more than i can properly accept 
the speaker said he responded he said well maybe they want to 
buy some books i said if they want to buy some books thatll be 
fine i dont think theres anything wrong with that 
wrights income from the book sales about 1650 was not 
subject to house limitations 
the incident is similar to a previously reported bulk sale of 
the book in 1985 when wright sent 336 copies to the new england 
life insurance company in return for 2000 initially intended as 
an honorarium but in that case the speakers office defended it 
by saying the deal was arranged by aides without wrights knowledge 
wright received 55 percent of the proceeds from each copy of the 
slim 595 volume collecting a total of 55000 in royalties 
the ethics committee met again today and had a full day of 
deliberations scheduled for friday chairman julian dixon 
dcalif said he anticipated some conclusion in the case next week 
dixon also said the committee is asking the house to add 
600000 to its budget for this year in part to cover growing 
costs of the wright probe were basically out of money dixon 
said 
he said the money would go to cover additional fees for richard 
phelan the outside counsel retained for the wright investigation 
to cover expenses incurred in that probe and to pay for other 
unrelated ethics cases 
in addition to the issue of evading income ceilings the ethics 
panel also is deliberating several other potential rules violations 
whether the speaker should have reported as gifts a series of 
benefits he received from a business partner fort worth developer 
george mallick 
whether mallick had a direct interest in legislation which 
would have made any gift over 100 improper 
whether in working for forbearance language in a bill 
dealing with savings and loan institutions wright improperly used 
influence on behalf of a business partner and 
whether the speakers overall conduct violated a general 
requirement that a lawmaker conduct himself at all times in a 
manner which shall reflect creditably on the house of 
representatives 
as the committee went into the home stretch in its 
deliberations wrights allies were preparing their defense 
compiling lengthy pointbypoint rebuttals to potential findings of 
rules violations 
but the speakers opponents said even if some charges are 
dropped the remaining issues are serious enough to cause the 
speaker severe political damage the evidence strikes me as 
fairly overwhelming said rep newt gingrich rga wrights 
chief accuser

deterrence of nuclear weapons prevents war and expressed her

a federal judge today fined the state 
164250 for prison overcrowding and ordered that the money be used 
to set up a bail fund for indigent defendants 
us district judge raymond j pettine ruled the state was in 
contempt of court for failing to limit to 250 the number of 
prisoners awaiting trial in an intake unit 
overcrowding at rhode islands only jail for inmates awaiting 
trial has been a problem for years but mushroomed last year after 
the legislature passed laws allowing drug defendants to be held 
without bail 
the corrections department under pressure from pettine opened 
two annexes to the intake unit but has been unable to keep up with 
the exploding population construction of a new prison building has 
been stalled by local opposition in cranston where the adult 
correctional institutions complex is located 
last fall pettine gave the state until feb 20 to reduce the 
population at the intake unit to 250 as of monday the population 
was 464 said joseph a dinitto state corrections department 
spokesman 
pettine imposed fines of 50 per extra inmate per day from feb 
20 to march 13 and said further fines up to 289000 or more would 
be imposed if necessary to meet his order to reduce crowding 
i think thats just what was needed to ensure this problem is 
taken care of said steven brown executive director of the rhode 
island chapter of the american civil liberties union the aclu sued 
the state 13 years ago over prison conditions 
pettine ordered the state to turn over the money within 15 days 
to the corrections department but stayed the order to give state 
officials a chance to appeal 
dinitto said he had not yet seen the ruling and would not 
comment on it 
the governor said the decision will be appealed 
pettine praised the state for submitting longrange plans to 
alleviate overcrowding but said the state should be fined because 
it ignored options such as the bail fund proposed by the aclu 
any prisoner being held on 5000 or less cash bail will be 
eligible to have bail paid by the fund pettine recommended that 
maximum use be squeezed from the money by bailing first those 
prisoners being held on 1000 bail or less before those being held 
on higher amounts 
these pretrial detainees are in jail only because they are 
too poor to make bail pettine wrote

a government contracting officer 
testified today that the defense department had received a 
betterthanexpected price when it negotiated a 24 million 
contract with a california defense contractor to make handheld 
radar equipment in july 1987 
the testimony of william massie who handled contracts for the 
project came as the defense opened its case in the trial of three 
former executives at teledyne electronics of newbury park calif 
all are charged with bribery conspiracy and making false 
statements 
before a parade of defense witnesses was called us district 
judge richard williams denied defense motions to dismiss bribery 
and conspiracy charges against the three eugene sullivan george 
kaub and dale schnittjer 
the government finished its case wednesday with prosecutors 
attempting to persuade the jury that the three defendants knew a 
private consultant hired by teledyne electronics had paid bribes to 
a navy engineer to help secure the radar equipment contract 
the defense contends the former executives were unwittingly 
duped by private consultants hired by the company 
massie the contracting officer said the governments objective 
was to allow the defense contractor a 1374 percent rate of profit 
on the job in fact massie said teledyne electronics agreed to 
only a 135 percent rate of profit meaning the government got a 
cheaper price than it had expected 
under crossexamination however massie acknowledged that that 
price was still not necessarily the best possible price 
on wednesday william parkin a consultant who has pleaded 
guilty to bribery and is cooperating with the government testified 
that he took a portion of the money that teledyne gave him and 
channeled it to another consultant fred lackner lackner in turn 
paid bribes to stuart berlin a navy engineer familiar with the 
contract 
the government contends that the three defendants knew that 
parkin and his consortium were bribing berlin the defense says the 
former teledyne executives were innocent victims of a conspiracy 
devised by parkin and lackner 
teledyne electronics paid parkin 10000 in upfront money in 
november 1985 to help win the contract and agreed to hand over 
another 150000 in february 1988 after teledyne won the contract 
fbi agent michael swinhoe testified that he had interviewed kaub 
after the governments investigation of pentagon fraud and 
kickbacks was made public in june 1988 
according to the agent kaub said he was not aware of any 
illegal or unethical behavior on parkins part 
but kaub said he was skeptical of the consultant by virtue of 
mr parkins profession as an influence peddler 
kaub who was teledynes vice president dealing with government 
contracts said the nature of the environment in which parkin 
worked was also cause for some concern 
on the witness stand parkin admitted that he had taken about 
50000 in bribes over a 10year period while he was employed by 
the defense department parkin left the navy where he had been 
director of acquisitions for the joint cruise missile project in 
october 1983 
the trial in federal court is the first brought by the 
government in its investigation of the 150 billion purchasing 
system at the defense department 
except for the three executives all the people named in the 
indictment including parking lackner and berlin have pleaded 
guilty as has teledyne

portauprince haiti ap troops loyal to lt gen prosper 
avril guarded the national palace today with antiaircraft guns and 
cannons after he declared a state of emergency to counter the 
weeks second military rebellion 
the order wednesday by the embattled president in power for 
just six months also included a dusktodawn curfew early today 
he went on staterun television to appeal to the mutineers to end 
their uprising 
government forces also stood guard outside the national bank and 
the telecommunications office which were briefly occupied by the 
rebels wednesday 
sporadic machinegun fire and what sounded like exploding 
grenades could be heard during the night radio soleil the roman 
catholic station reported today that one man was shot to death and 
three other people were wounded overnight but the circumstances 
were unclear 
several hundred youths marched into downtown portauprince at 
midmorning and erected barricades of tires and boxes which they set 
on fire soldiers fired into the air to disperse the crowd 
about 25 rebel soldiers and 200 supporters stood outside a 
military barracks 200 yards away from the palace which was guarded 
by loyal soldiers 
most stores were closed and few buses or cars moved through the 
capital 
avril appeared on television at 2 am speaking calmly for 
about 10 minutes from his office in the national palace he was 
surrounded by soldiers 
i exhort you brothers in arms soldiers of our splendid army 
to leave the vile path of treason and national shame and find once 
again the shining path of honor and dignity he said 
wednesdays uprising was the second in the 7000man army since 
sunday when an attempt to overthrow avrils government was foiled 
by loyal soldiers who rescued him as he was being driven to the 
airport to be deported 
avril denounced the rebels who held his 14yearold son and 
88yearold mother hostage during sundays coup attempt the 
soldiers also briefly held hostage two of avrils brothers all 
were released unharmed 
in imposing a curfew wednesday the government blamed sundays 
coup attempt on a vast campaign against drug trafficking 
contraband and corruption that collided with the interests of 
those who oppose democratic change 
avril has recently discharged or transferred several officers in 
a crackdown on corruption and drug trafficking 
the united states has made the crackdown a condition for the 
resumption of 70 million in annual aid that it suspended after 
thugs killed 34 voters in november 1987 thwarting haitis first 
free elections in more than 30 years 
on wednesday a rebellion broke out in the dessalines barracks 
which adjoins the presidential palace it was unknown how many of 
the 700 dessalines were taking part 
about 25 dessaline soldiers and 200 supporters stood today 
outside the barracks demanding avril hand over power to the 
president of the supreme court of appeals gilbert austin a former 
justice minister 
there is no compromise possible with gen avril said one 
soldier on condition of anonymity we will camp here until he 
leaves 
but it did not seem avril who appears to have the support of 
the 1000 presidential guardsmen would relinquish power 
voluntarily 
its a standoff i think theyre just staring each other 
down one western diplomat said 
avrils presidential guard stationed two antiaircraft guns 
four armored personnel carriers and threewheeled cannons inside 
the national palace compound 
radio stations ignored a government order for newspapers radio 
and television not to diseminate information except with the 
militarys permission the censorship order came after the 
dessalines soldiers went on the independent radio metropole to 
demand avril resign they blame him for the deaths of four rebel 
soldiers who held the airport sunday and monday 
those four were members of the elite 400member leopard commando 
unit that had about 100 of its soldiers holding the airport because 
their commander was being held under military guard accused of 
being the ringleader of sundays attempt to overthrow avril 
avril deported the three alleged coup leaders in miami us 
immigration officials said the three officers arrived wednesday and 
applied for asylum 
a statement by army general headquarters read on state 
television ordered all soldiers to report to their command posts 
avril 50 came to power in a sept 17 coup led by 
noncommissioned officers who said they overthrow lt gen henri 
namphy because they wanted to end statesponsored violence and 
corruption

a navajo tribal judge has banned the 
tribes police chief from the reservation for failing to enforce 
court orders related to embattled chairman peter macdonalds 
struggle to retain power 
window rock district judge robert yazzie signed an order 
wednesday excluding police chief wilbur kellogg from the 
reservation pending a hearing on monday 
an antimacdonald majority of the tribal council has voted to 
place macdonald on leave but the flamboyant head of the nations 
largest indian tribe has resisted 
for the last two months ive just been a football back and 
forth between the two factions said kellogg who remained at his 
office late wednesday 
kellogg was found in contempt and fined 500 by the tribal 
supreme court earlier this week for having failed to enforce a 
court order barring j tonny bowman an appointee of the 
promacdonald advisory council from taking over yazzies court 
in other developments wednesday 
tribal controller bobby white confronted by 50 angry macdonald 
appointees and others handed over 31 paychecks that had been 
withheld by order of the antimacdonald majority of the tribal 
council 
the general manager of tribal radio station ktnn said the 
tribal attorney generals office told him in a memorandum that 
macdonald because of a temporary restraining order issued by 
tribal court should not be allowed to use the stations air time 
to make the weekly chairmans report 
ktnn general manager freddie howard said the station would have 
to disobey because of concerns about fairness free speech and 
federal communications commission requirements howard said the 
station would not drop either macdonalds report or one made by 
leonard haskie the interim chairman selected by the tribal council 
this borders on trying to censor somebody howard said 
its just like telling a newspaper what to print or what not to 
print 
howard also said i cant allow politics to jeopardize our 
good standing with the fcc the issue isnt macdonald or haskie 
macdonald was placed on paid administrative leave by the tribal 
council after witnesses before a us senate committee testified he 
received gifts and kickbacks in connection with tribal business 
dealings 
macdonald who has denied such wrongdoing has maintained the 
councils action was invalid and illegal he has tried to retain 
his authority by firing opponents and those who attempt to remain 
neutral

some communist party leaders in leningrad blamed 
psychological attacks and malicious press coverage for the 
humiliating defeat of 12 city officials in last months elections 
a newspaper reported thursday 
but others at a special meeting called to discuss the election 
disaster said the party itself was responsible for the crisis of 
confidence in its abilities said sovietskaya rossiya the 
russian republics official party and government newspaper 
the meeting the first extraordinary session of the leningrad 
party organization in 30 years came four days after some party 
members demanded the resignation of the leningrad leadership the 
newspaper said 
leningraders on march 26 rejected every one of local officials 
running for seats in the soviet unions new parliament the 
newspaper said 
yuri solovyev a candidate member of the partys ruling 
politburo and regional party chief ran unopposed and still lost 
because more than half the voters crossed out his name on the 
ballot he characterized the results as depressing sovietskaya 
rossiya said 
sovietskaya rossia said tuesdays meeting occurred in an 
atmosphere of openness honesty and toughness of evaluation and 
impartial criticism which we have dreamed about since the 
beginning of perestroika 
the newspaper concluded that if such a meeting had occurred 
previously the party might not have suffered so in the elections 
leningraders are not satisfied with the tempo and path of 
perestroika in the city the newspaper quoted vp smirnov as 
saying they dont feel that the leadership of the city defends 
the interests of the population of the working class or the 
intelligentsia said smirnov a radio controller and member of 
the regional party leadership 
clearly a crisis of confidence has been outlined he said 
but the newspaper said many speakers blamed the loss on 
malicious press strongly creating a negative stereotype of the 
party bureaucrats 
it listed four party leaders who spoke with alarm about the 
psychological attack being carried out against the party and isnt 
it strange that some organs of the press united with forces which 
are extremely far from the ideas of marxismleninism 
the report did not give examples of what they regarded as 
malicious press coverage 
we insufficiently evaluated the ideological prejudice and 
bourgeois illusions which have been spreadly recently and the 
dissatisfaction of the people with the growth of the deficit 
inflation crime miscalculations in the organization of the 
cooperative movement the newspaper said paraphrasing the four 
officials 
it identified the four as ya petrosyan the director of an 
institute ya sidorenko an official of leningrads higher party 
school sb petrov director of a sewing factory and va 
yefimov party leader of leningrads lenin region 
sovietskaya rossiya said the turning point of the meeting came 
when general contractor id spassky warned that if the party 
doesnt start showing it can solve citizens problems it can 
expect more of the same 
people want to live better today he said the process of 
renewal of the economy at the least must move in parallel with 
political changes but the prosperity of the people should outstrip 
it only then will the people believe us and in the meantime they 
wait for years and lose faith in perestroika 
across the nation in the soviet far east khabarovsk communist 
party chief vs pasternak blamed his loss on the late president 
leonid i brezhnev and his corrupt cronies in an interview with 
izvestia pasternak said people were sick of commands and looked 
at all party leaders with the same distrust 
pasternak said a leaflet was circulated in khabarovsk that said 
a vote for pasternak means a vote for the party which led our 
motherland into this dead end and now with the help of demogogic 
subterfuges is trying to convince people it can lead them out of 
this situation

a government newspaper thursday praised polands 
communist authorities and solidarity for displaying common sense in 
an agreement that it said legalizes the union while challenging it 
to act constructively 
common sense came out on top the newspaper izvestia said 
telling its readers that in poland the participation of the 
opposition in the official political life of the country has become 
a fact 
the soviet union has watched the legalization of opposition 
forces in its allies hungary and poland while its own communist 
party continues to tolerate no challengers one controversial 
figure former moscow party boss boris n yeltsin is under 
investigation by the party on charges that he supports a multiparty 
system 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh asked about the 
developments in poland said the soviet union was watching a 
process it considered an internal polish affair 
we wish that dialogue to lead to results or developments that 
could improve the situation in poland so that the life of the 
polish people can be brought back to normal gremitskikh said 
the conclusion of negotiations in poland was reported by radio 
moscow and by the tass news agency but izvestia gave its millions 
of readers a much more detailed account that included the formation 
of a second chamber of the parliament legalization of solidarity 
and other key changes 
the agreement reached wednesday gives poland its first 
democratic elections since world war ii 
it said the agreement would not have been possible without 
reforms carried out by the polish communist party in the last eight 
years but that solidarity also showed a realistic attitude 
the agreement would not have been possible without the 
political will which the opposition began to show at last during 
the middle of last year izvestia said 
the opposition has taken on a new role for itself one that is 
quite difficult psychologically up to now its main strength was 
negative resisting the system criticizing all and everything 
izvestia said 
now in the conditions of legal activity it has to clearly 
formulate its program speak out with concrete ideas be in full 
view consistently become an object of evaluation and criticism 
it said 
it is one thing to be able to destroy instigate strikes and 
interfere with reforms and something else entirely to create to 
assist in the framework of general responsibility positive 
processes it said 
izvestia said it still was not clear whether solidarity was 
inclined to cooperate with authorities 
earlier radio moscow reported the agreement in an 
englishlanguage news broadcast but only an alert listener could 
realize that solidaritys legal status had been restored 
the news report said solidarity had taken part in the 
negotiations and they produced a number of political agreements 
including one which states trade union pluralism 
the announcer said the participants also agreed on 
establishment of a twochamber parliament and the post of a 
president with broad powers it did not mention that the 
parliament would be the result of the first democratic elections 
since world war ii 
the tass news agency said only the talks involving walesa had 
ended and gave no further details of the agreement

floridas chief justice today appointed 
a retired judge to preside over an appeal hearing for a man who 
state officials agree was unfairly convicted of killing his 
stepdaughter more than 20 years ago 
the state supreme court refused wednesday to release james j 
richardson 53 a former farm worker who claims he was framed in 
the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children in arcadia about 
35 miles east of sarasota 
but the court cleared way for a hearing that could lead to 
richardsons freedom and chief justice raymond ehrlich named 
retired judge clifton m kelly of sebring to conduct the hearing 
the order wednesday relinquished the supreme courts 
jurisdiction over the case 
it all means we are at last unblocking the clogged up pipeline 
and we are now going to get some action said ellis rubin one of 
richardsons attorneys this may be the beginning of the end 
richardson was convicted only of killing the oldest of the 
children an 8yearold stepdaughter and sentenced to die in the 
electric chair his sentence was commuted to life in prison after 
the us supreme court struck down the death penalty in 1972 
an investigation ordered by the governors office concluded last 
month that the prosecution withheld vital evidence from the 
defense and attorney general bob butterworth determined richardson 
received an unfair trial 
the children died after eating a lunch tainted with a pesticide 
the lunch was served by a neighbor who was babysitting while 
richardson and his wife were working in an orange grove

the cold rain to see him 
i was the first person to shake his hand said tim haggarty 
of londonderry northern ireland this is the best day in my 
entire life hes a hero 
gorbachev sent his security men dashing in all directions when 
he decided apparently on impluse to stop his motorcade only a few 
yards from the abbeys great west door and greet about a dozen 
people in the crowd of several hundred waiting across the street 
many were encouraging him with shouts of mikhail 
haggarty 23 said he studied the soviet leaders schedule for 
his 40hour visit to britain and concluded the only opportunity 
gorbachev would have to meet the people would be after laying a 
wreath at the tomb of the unknown warrior 
i think he must really know that we love him haggarty said 
what hes doing is so wonderful hes trying to create peace in 
the world he has to be treated like the hero he is 
gorbachev and his wife raisa also spoke with mark frankham of 
croydon on the southern outskirts of london and told the 
13yearold thank you very much for the reception 
mark who was with his mother gloria said i never expected 
him to come over as there were so many police around he was 
already in his car but he got out and came across i am thrilled

and two soviet soldiers laid the wreath of red carnations on the 
tomb containing the remains of an uknown british soldier killed in 
france in world war i 
this has been a very significant event here gorbachev told

prime minister margaret thatcher who accompanied him 
it reminds all of us of our common responsibilities it 
reminds all of us that we should do our best in order to prevent 
new victims so that all the sacrifice of our people may not have 
been in vain i mean particularly the soldiers fallen in those 
battles

the amount of tv commercials aimed at children 
has increased dramatically since the reagan administration lifted 
regulations on such advertising congress was told today at a 
hearing on a bill that would reimpose restrictions on kids tv 
programs 
rep edward markey dmass said that the three major 
television networks had steadily increased the number of minutes 
per hour of advertising in childrens tv shows from below the 
95minute limit established by the federal communications 
commission in 1974 to as much as 11 minutes per hour today 
prior to 1984 when the commission enforced commercial 
guidelines all these networks were either at or below the 95 
minutes per hour limit markey said however in the five short 
years since the commission deregulation order commercial time has 
been on the rise with stations at two of the networks now offering 
as many as 11 minutes per hour of commercial matter 
markey said the government must stem the endless streams of 
tv commercials on childrens shows because broadcasters are not 
regulating themselves 
but the president of the association of national advertisers 
disagreed at a hearing before the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
dewitt helm said the bill before the house and a companion 
measure before the senate were unconstitutional and may not 
actually achieve the goal of improving the quality and quantity of 
childrens programming 
helm said less advertising may lead to worse programs for kids 
and that program producers must have the flexibility to determine 
how best to balance the entertainment needs of the audience with 
the financial requirements of good programming 
rep jim slattery dkan a cosponsor of the bill lashed out 
at the broadcasting representatives at the hearing and told them 
that about 80 percent of network programming is unmitigated crap 
and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves 
he challenged them to name a single childrens tv program they 
could be proud of saying they were miserably failing at what 
he said was an obligation to provide quality childrens tv shows 
he said the bill that is being considered which would impose a 
limit of 105 minutes of advertising per hour on weekends and 12 
minutes per hour on weekdays for kids shows was just piddling 
on the margins and will not affect responsible broadcasters one 
iota 
slattery said he didnt want to paint all broadcasters with the 
same brush he said some are responsible but that suggestions 
that the marketplace is going to take care of all these things is 
mr helm naive 
on wednesday sen howard metzenbaum dohio said the 
legislation was designed to stem the crass commercialization of 
childrens television where the constant din of cereal toy and 
candy ads is enough to make any childs and any parents head 
pound and stomach ache 
rep john bryant dtexas a main author of the house bill said 
it was his intent that stations which fail to provide a 
reasonable amount of quality programming with strict advertising 
limits specifically for children should not only be in jeopardy of 
losing but actually lose their licenses at renewal 
the legislation would require the fcc to consider how well a 
broadcaster has been committed to the educational and informational 
needs of children in its overall programming 
congress passed an indentical bill last year but president 
reagan vetoed it 
a number of cosponsors spoke at a capitol hill news conference 
and said the proposal was modest and would not harm 
responsible broadcasters 
markey said the bills were adopted in cooperation with the three 
major television networks the national association of broadcasters 
and the association of independent television stations 
this legislation is needed to ensure that broadcasters treat 
children as consumers of information and new ideas not just 
consumers of candy cereal and toys markey said 
the bill was introduced in the house by reps bryant matthew 
rinaldo rnj and terry bruce dill and had 14 cosponsors 
the bill has wide support from psychiatric health and 
educational groups and has been a 20year focus of peggy charren 
of action for childrens television in boston 
charren who introduced each lawmaker at the news conference 
said the bill would impose on broadcasters the three rs of 
television restriction requirement and reporting 
rinaldo the ranking republican on the telecommunications and 
finance subcommittee noted that the fcc in 1974 had determined 
that basic fairness for children ought to be observed by noting 
a clear separation between program content and commercials 
it is only in the last few years since the fccs 
deregulation order in 1984 that the assumptions underlying our 
bill have come into question

almost 30 years ago a young australian 
who loved american country music died in a car accident in sydney 
leaving behind 2000 old 78s and boxes of correspondence with the 
pioneers who had made the records 
john edwards never made it to america but his collection did 
as he directed in his will his legacy forms the nucleus of the 
southern folklife collection that opened this week at the 
university of north carolina at chapel hill 
in the past 20 years historians have begun to look more and 
more toward folklife materials said mike casey an archivist of 
the collection theyre looking to sound recordings to provide a 
perspective on on the history of the south 
in 1983 unc bought the edwards collection from the university 
of california at los angeles where it had been greatly expanded by 
acquisitions of more recordings and documents unc combined the 
purchase with the unc folklore archives to form the southern 
folklife collection 
with 38000 items dating to 1906 the collection is being touted 
as one of the nations three top resources for country music 
research joining the country music foundation in nashville tenn 
and the library of congress 
music is highly symbolic said dan patterson chairman of 
the folklore curriculum at unc it encodes deep statements about 
your identity it speaks of values that are woven into your life 
the collection includes gospel spirituals blues bluegrass 
cajun ballads native american string band and country music 
everything from sermons recorded at a primitive baptist church to 
the skillet lickers recording of the fiddle tune cottoneyed 
joe to merle travis im sick and tired of you little 
darling 
researchers musicians and other visitors also have access to 
books videotapes and scrapbooks booths are available for 
listening to the tapes and theres a sound studio to erase many of 
the flaws on old recordings 
the people who have gathered in chapel hill through saturday to 
mark the opening of the collection include musicians and the 
researchers and music professionals who have documented their lives 
a concert friday night will feature performers such as etta 
baker a blues guitarist wade mainer who in the 1920s was one of 
the first stars of country music and esteban jordan a texan who 
calls himself the jimi hendrix of the accordion 
another scheduled proformer is y ngong knul a 67yearold from 
cambodia now living in greensboro who performs a ritualized form of 
chanting he symbolizes a musical direction that may be part of the 
traditional southern music of tomorrow 
theres starting to be a number of new ethnic groups moving 
into the south who have not been recorded as of yet casey said 
theyre hispanic and theyre vietnamese and theyre playing 
their music 
its clearly not what what weve consider southern traditional 
music up till now he said but the fact is in the next 100 
years it will be and its important to document it

north koreas official media on thursday warned 
south korea not to arrest a dissident clergyman who secretly 
visited the communist country for talks on reunifying the korean 
peninsula 
the seoul government should know clearly what consequences 
its foolish scheme to arrest and punish rev moon ikhwan will 
bring on its lot said a commentary in the workers communist 
party newspaper rodong sinmun 
north korea on wednesday threatened to break off an already 
fractured dialogue with seoul if moon is arrested when he returns 
home from an unauthorized nineday visit to pyongyang via japan 
and china 
moon an adviser to south koreas main dissident united national 
democratic movement arrived wednesday in tokyo and said he plans 
to return home by april 14 
his visit the first by a south korean dissident broke 
regulations requiring south koreans to obtain government permission 
before they travel to north korea 
south koreans were angered by televised scenes of moon hugging 
north korean leader kim il sung whom they blame for the 195053 
korean war korea was divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 
seoul officials say moon helped pyongyang discredit their 
governments authority 
moon told reporters in tokyo he went to pyongyang to contribute 
to unification through nongovernmental contacts but he also said 
he met only communist leaders and some of his relatives living in 
the north 
rodong sinmun said as rev moon ikhwan already stated his 
pyongyang visit this time was aimed at deepening trust between the 
people in the north and the south jointly seeking a reasonable way 
of reunification and promoting peace 
moons arrest would deliberately aggravate northsouth 
relations and lay a new obstacle in the way it said 
the nations are involved in a variety of contacts ranging from a 
possible nonaggression pact to trade and cultural exchanges some 
have stalled over north korean protests about recently concluded 
ussouth korean military exercises

president bush plans to extend for one year 
the economic sanctions president reagan imposed on the panamanian 
government controlled by military leader manuel antonio noriega an 
administration source said today 
the current economic trade and military sanctions expire on 
april 8 bush was expected to act as early as today or friday to 
keep them in place for year 
in the package that is currently being prepared for bushs 
signature the sanctions remain the same as the ones already in 
place 
after the election well take a look at the situation there 
and see if theres any cause for change said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the sanctions imposed under executive order by reagan a year ago 
involve restrictions on us businesses who have developed a 
flourishing business with panama as well as a cutoff of military 
aid to the central american nation 
the sanctions include blocking assets of the government of 
panama in the united states and prohibiting tax payments by us 
organizations to the noriega regime 
the administration is closely looking to panamas upcoming 
elections which are scheduled for may 7 
it is anticipated that noriega who is accused in a federal drug 
running case in miami will control the process because he controls 
the electoral tribunal and the media that otherwise might provide 
opposition candidates a better chance to get their messages out 
noriega as chief of the defense forces is de facto ruler of 
panama 
if the panamanian people have a chance to express their will 
in a free and open manner were confident noriega will go said 
the source who acknowledged however that prospects for that 
appeared rocky 
the military promised the opposition authentic panamanian party 
that the elections will be clean 
the democratic alliance a coalition of the opposition 
democratic christian liberal and liberal republican nationalist 
movement parties has guillermo endara as its presidential 
candidate 
noriega has been panamas de facto leader since february 1988 
when he orchestrated the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle 
the president had tried to fire noriega as military leader after 
noriega was indicted in florida on us drug trafficking charges 
noriega denied the charges 
washington continues to recognize delvalle as president and 
imposed economic sanctions against panama in an effort to force 
noriega out

the strike pushed its planning schedule ahead 
obviously the opportunity that easterns problem presented 
brought us to take a look at the timing of that plan said robert 
baker americans senior vice president for operations it was 
probably a year down the road the caribbean part was closer than 
that 
american will add 600 employees in miami the airlines expanded 
presence will represent another 100 million a year to the local 
economy 
the growth in florida and the caribbean will add 3219 seats a 
day to the market new routes from miami will include nonstop 
flights to los angeles new york and boston 
new service to the caribbean will include stops in san juan 
puerto rico and kingston and montego bay in jamaica santo domingo 
and puerto plata in the dominican republic as well as 
portauprince haiti 
the caribbean additions will link 14 cities served by american 
with the caribbean hub in san juan 
in miami american is expanding its daily service from 20 to 31 
flights a day in san juan the number of daily flights will rise 
from 45 to 52 
eastern service represented about a quarter of the seats from 
the united states to jamaica and about a third of the seats to the 
us virgin islands before the strike 
none of what we have announced today will rise and fall on 
what happens to eastern airlines or anyone else baker said 
easterns been in a lot of the cities theyve been a big guy 
here 
the likelihood is that eastern will still be the largest 
carrier in the region he added 
american is upgrading its fleet switching to larger aircraft on 
12 flights to the caribbean to increase its capacity direct 
service from other us cities to the caribbean is part of the 
airlines plan

venezuelas top military court has 
overturned a lower court decision and freed 19 policemen and 
soldiers implicated in the slayings of 14 fishermen on the border 
with colombia 
a lawyer for the families of the victims called wednesdays 
decision inconceivable 
the oct 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots in 
caracas and elsewhere in which news reports said at least one 
person was killed and at least 57 were wounded church groups and 
human rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to the 
government 
the soldiers had claimed the fishermen had been colombian 
guerrillas killed in a firefight but nearby villagers and two 
survivors of the attack denied the claim and said the fishermen 
were ambushed while on a sunday picnic 
an autopsy showed that many of the dead men had been shot in the 
back of the head at close range 
the court president gen daniel de jesus palacios said his 
tribunal had decided wednesday to overturn a lower military courts 
previous decision in january to jail the men part of a 
militarypolice border task force 
a lawyer for the families of the dead men fabian chacon 
criticized the ruling 
there is an unmasked intention on the part of the court to 
favor the men on trial which goes to show that in venezuela there 
are obstacles and structures that make justice impossible chacon 
told reporters outside the judges chambers 
the 19 policemen and soldiers had been held in the city of san 
cristobal about 400 miles southwest of caracas 
the lower military court had ordered their arrest and reversed 
another court that had ordered the arrest of two surviving 
fishermen for military rebellion 
the two survivors wolmer pinilla and jose arias then fled to 
mexico where they received political asylum 
villagers of el amparo denied the men were guerrillas and said 
they were all fishermen out for a sunday picnic when they were 
ambushed by the soldiers 
the military courts latest decision frees the imprisoned men 
and sends the case back to where it stood before the decision to 
imprison them said de jesus 
it was unclear whether pinilla and arias who later returned to 
venezuela would now be guilty of military rebellion and liable 
for arrest again 
military rebellion is often a term used to justify detaining 
people without charges according to the human rights group amnesty 
international 
the decision follows widespread riots in february over 
government economic reforms that left at least 270 dead by official 
estimates unofficial sources say that death toll was as high as 
2000

a federation of hong kong employers urged the 
government thursday to import foreign laborers to ease hong kongs 
acute labor shortage 
the group called the joint associations working group said it 
was essential to import contract laborers to avoid inflation and 
falling economic competitiveness 
hong kong needs about 50000 imported workers most of them 
unskilled to help fill an estimated 200000 job vacancies it said 
the groups chairman martin barrow an executive at jardine 
matheson holdings ltd said there was danger hong kong could lose 
it competitiveness in the manufacturing sector the hotel 
industry and elsewhere because of the shortage of workers 
the government said tuesday it is considering easing 
restrictions on employment of foreign laborers under current 
policy only foreign workers with skills not available locally are 
allowed to work in the colony 
hong kongs low unemployment rate currently 13 percent is 
considered a key factor behind the economys growth slowing to an 
expected 6 percent this year less than half the 1987 rate 
the labor shortage is due to tight immigration laws and a steady 
drain of talent as the colony approaches its return to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 
the report said the government should encourage automation and 
productivity through tax breaks and reducing red tape it said 
bringing in workers on sixmonth to twoyear contracts similar to 
practices in singapore would provide relief 
the group also suggested the possibility of hong kong using 
workers who would commute daily from china

until now vietnam veterans who came 
here to be treated for posttraumatic stress disorder were likely 
to encounter another kind of stress figuring out how to pay for 
living expenses during their sevenweek stay 
thats about to change 
the midrio grande chapter of the american red cross has been 
awarded more than 100000 to help veterans and their families from 
new mexico arizona and parts of texas pay rent and food costs 
while they are treated at an outpatient clinic at the veterans 
administration medical center here 
the red cross hopes to serve about 70 veterans and their 
families during the oneyear project said marjorie waters the red 
cross chapters administrator of emergency services and disaster 
programs 
i want it to be the tip of the iceberg kind of thing where it 
could be increased said mrs waters who hopes the grant will be 
renewed 
we can reach them and help them into this treatment program 
that they would not be able to take part in if they had to worry 
about paying the rent or that basic kind of thing she said 
the red cross was one of eight agencies nationwide awarded agent 
orange class assistance grants totaling more than 581000 to help 
them serve vietnam veterans and their families 
the march 30 awards were the first disbursements to service 
agencies from the settlement of a 1978 lawsuit against seven 
manufacturers of agent orange in their classaction lawsuit 
veterans alleged they got cancer and other illnesses because of 
exposure to the defoliant used by the military in southeast asia in 
the 1960s 
the 240 million settlement upheld by the us supreme court 
last year provides 170 million to be paid directly to us 
veterans or their survivors 52 million to agencies that serve 
veterans and their families plus lesser amounts for veterans of 
other countries who served in vietnam and for legal and 
administrative fees 
the grants to service agencies were designed to reach veterans 
and their families who do not meet the eligibility requirements for 
direct payments which are reserved for disabled veterans the 
grants are not limited to agencies that treat agent orangerelated 
problems 
the 52 million fund for agencies is expected to grow with 
interest to 70million over the seven to 10year life of the 
program 
mrs waters said the idea for rental and food assistance came 
because veterans from outside albuquerque contacted the local red 
cross for money to pay living expenses while in the city seeking 
treatment 
its been in my mind for a couple of years because we helped 
veterans when we could from red cross funding when they were here 
for the program she said they came and said they were taking 
part in the program and didnt have any more money for rent or gas 
or food 
she said the grant really was a godsend because the red 
cross wasnt able to meet all the needs of the veterans it heard 
from 
the chapter applied for 102000 based on an estimate of 
veterans in the clinic and the chapters experience in paying rent 
and food costs for homeless people ms waters said 
diane castillo coordinator of the va treatment program said 
she expects the grant will increase the number of veterans in the 
program from outside the albuquerque area 
a major problem with any guys coming in from anywhere was the 
need for them to commute daily she said 
the clinic which began operating in 1987 combines individual 
and group psychotherapy staff members try to avoid using 
medication because chemicals are only an artificial way of dealing 
with anxiety castillo said 
we directly address the patients traumatic experience bring 
back that event to the patient then work through the feelings 
theyve suppressed for the last 20 years she said 
the program which she described as fairly intense also 
includes counseling for married couples anger management problem 
solving and social skills castillo said 
the clinic has treated about 150 veterans and can handle 85 to 
100 a year she said

the fired captain of the exxon valdez 
walked out of jail today after a judge reduced his bail from 1 
million to 25000 calling the higher amount unconstitutionally 
excessive 
capt joseph hazelwood posted bail walked out of the suffolk 
county jail at 1259 pm and got into a waiting car with attorney 
thomas russo and another lawyer he did not speak and showed no 
emotion as he walked off 
on wednesday another judge set bail for hazelwood at 1 million 
bond or 500000 cash comparing the effect of the oil tanker wreck 
in alaska to the atomic bombing of hiroshima 
justice thomas stark the supervising judge of suffolk county 
criminal court today reduced the bail to 25000 bond or cash 
the amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of 
the crime or the effect of the crime on the community stark said 
of the figure that had shocked even prosecutors 
we cant take out our wrath on one individual said district 
attorney patrick henry whose office originally had requested 
25000 bail 
hazelwood who faces three misdemeanor charges in alaska is 
accused of being drunk when he relinquished command of the exxon 
valdez to an uncertified seaman the vessel then hit a reef march 
24 gushing 101 million gallons of crude oil into prince william 
sound and creating north americas worst oil spill 
judge kenneth rohl a naturalist who comes from a family of 
professional seamen set hazelwoods bail wednesday at 1 million 
bond or 500000 cash 
these misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been 
equaled at least in this country rohl said hes got to think 
about that we have a manmade destruction that has not been 
equaled probably since hiroshima 
the us bombing of hiroshima at the end of world war ii killed 
or injured nearly 130000 people and leveled 90 percent of the 
japanese city no human life has been lost in the oil spill 
dean guaneli alaskas assistant attorney general said the bail 
order expresses the nations outrage at what has happened 
a pale shaken hazelwood whose lawyer had sought 5000 cash 
bail was led from rohls courtroom in handcuffs after his 
arraignment on the fugitive warrant 
it was tough for our client to hear said defense attorney 
michael chalos it was very harsh we thought 
hazelwood was taken to the suffolk county jail he was granted 
30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing 
authorities in alaska have charged him with operating a ship 
while drunk reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil 
he faces 2 years in prison if convicted 
hazelwood 42 of huntington ny was fired by exxon last week 
after the national transportation safety board said tests taken 
about nine hours after the good friday disaster showed he was under 
the influence of alcohol 
rohl said that even though hazelwood faces only misdemeanors 
we are not talking about someone breaking someones windshield 
we are talking about a global catastrophe 
russo said his client was no fugitive because he left alaska 
before any charges had been filed against him 
no one is saying this is not a tragedy russo said but 
added captain hazelwood is not guilty of these crimes he did 
not commit any criminal acts in this affair 
hazelwood who had shaven off his beard appeared pale and 
despondent after the judges tonguelashing when officers put 
handcuffs on him his hands were sweating and shaking

many taxpayers are having trouble giving up 
lucrative deductions that were repealed or curtailed by the 1986 
tax overhaul 
a spot check by the internal revenue service of returns filed 
last year and early this year shows evidence of widespread 
noncompliance with parts of the new law these include limitations 
on writing off investment and personal interest on miscellaneous 
deductions such as union dues and on the treatment of rental losses 
the irs made the disclosure in announcing thursday that it has 
broadened efforts to gauge how well taxpayers understand and comply 
with the new law 
recognizing that the 1986 act represents the most 
comprehensive change to the federal tax system in a quarter century 
and contained changes affecting almost every taxpayer the irs will 
use the studies to assist taxpayers to better understand the new 
laws and help determine to what extent taxpayers are trying to 
circumvent various provisions of the new law the agency said 
the irs is so concerned about public reaction to the new law 
that it has set up teams in each of its 10 regional service centers 
to spot check returns as they are filed without such checks the 
agency would have to wait until 1991 for comprehensive information 
from a sizable number of returns 
a check of several thousand returns filed in 1988 the first 
year affected significantly by the new law disclosed that many 
taxpayers did not follow tougher rules on treatment of losses from 
passive investments rental losses investment interest expenses 
and miscellaneous itemized deductions 
rick hayes head of audit planning for the irs said those 
issues were chosen as targets of the new effort because they 
involve large amounts of revenue show up on many returns and were 
all changed significantly by the 1986 law 
the first of about 150000 returns filed this year that are 
expected to undergo spot checks show those same errors are being 
repeated in addition hayes said in an interview many returns 
being filed this year attempted to avoid the reduction in the 
writeoff of consumer interest in the deduction for 
businessrelated meals and entertainment and in depreciation of 
automobiles 
in the past the irs generally would discover such 
noncompliance only through a formal audit which usually would 
come about two years after a return was filed with the new effort 
the agency hopes to spot trends of noncompliance early and follow 
quickly with a campaign to educate the public 
if the effort is successful the irs expects to see fewer 
taxpayers making these mistakes and fewer returns being audited on 
those issues 
we want to fix as many of these things as we can without doing 
audits on people hayes said if we can do these as part of 
returns processing thats what we want to do 
the irs has not yet estimated how much money is being lost by 
the government because of noncompliance with the 1986 tax changes 
hayes said the spot checks are likely to find numerous cases in 
which taxpayers cheated themselves by misreading parts of the new 
law those taxpayers will be notified he emphasized 
information from the spot checks will be used to determine 
whether the irs needs to change its tax forms instructions or 
publications to clear up confusion resulting from the law changes 
hayes said

the soviet union is facing its toughest year yet 
and could degenerate into economic chaos without urgent 
reforms a newspaper said thursday 
the bony hand of hunger for products is quite capable of 
strangling perestroika the soviet program of economic 
restructuring journalist vasily selyunin wrote in a frontpage 
article in the daily socialist industry 
by putting off painful reforms economists are ruining the 
chances for those reforms to succeed said selyunin who 
specializes in economic affairs 
he cited the need to deal urgently with the soviet budget 
deficit and shortages of consumer goods selyunins calls for more 
rapid economic change have appeared in other top journals 
the sooner real reform is introduced the better because 
otherwise well have to be introducing economic reform under the 
conditions of economic chaos he said 
the government could have begun raising prices on plentiful 
easily substituted items but it is too late because virtually 
everything is in short supply he said 
an institute on consumer demand found that 211 food products 
only 23 could be bought freely he said the rest require 
connections with the sellers overpayment or are rationed 
strategists promise tough reforms after an initial period of 
heightened output of consumer goods but there is no reason to 
expect any such increase selyunin said 
on the contrary one can expect that the year 1989 will be the 
most unsuccessful of all those we have lived through he said 
along with the announced budget deficit of 58 billion and an 
additional 102 billion in loans to state enterprises that are 
losing money the unexpected expense of earthquakes in armenia and 
tadzhikistan will cripple the 1989 economy even further selyunin 
said 
he said inflation is running at 4 percent to 5 percent annually 
much higher than official figures 
today we have to choose between only two realities either 
relatively stable prices with minor inflation of about 6 percent 
and empty shelves or quickly rising prices and goods in the 
stores he said 
selyunins prescriptions for fixing the economy included cuts in 
military spending which he placed at nearly 20 percent of national 
income and two or three years of importing giant stocks of goods 
from the west 
the imports could be sold at 10 times their cost and thus both 
help to balance the state budget and satisfy consumer demand 
selyunin proposed 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other leaders have said they 
oppose such massive imports preferring to spend money on 
modernizing industry instead

a former official of a teamsters local in new 
york told congress on thursday that area crime families controlled 
union activities and finances with repeated acts of intimidation 
and violence including an attempt to murder him 
i had two choices to be a dead man or talk to the feds 
anthony giliberti told a senate panel reviewing government efforts 
to rid labor unions of corruption 
giliberti a former vice president of teamsters local 814 in new 
york has since shortly after the attempt on his life in 1982 
cooperated with authorities including testimony at a federal trial 
in new york that resulted in the convictions of 12 reputed members 
and associates of the bonanno crime family 
local 814 is one of four union locals the government has placed 
under court trusteeship through the use of federal racketeering 
laws the subject of the review of the senate permanent 
subcommittee on investigations 
those trustees and a fifth appointed to oversee a 
multimilliondollar new york fish market that allegedly was 
controlled by the genovese crime family told the subcommittee the 
procedure has proven successful in rooting out corruption although 
all said those efforts were far from completed 
giliberti said he helped arrange mob backing of a candidate for 
president of local 814 and later won mafia approval to force out 
that man sal aiello and replace him as president with vinnie 
bracco 
giliberti said among his many jobs with the union was shaking 
down businesses generally through promising them favors from the 
local in return for 5 percent of the companys profits among the 
favors was allowing companies to hire nonunion workers or to hire 
union workers off the books so the employer could avoid 
payments to union pension and welfare funds he said 
giliberti was shot outside his home in july 1982 and after 
recovering began cooperating with investigators he sat behind a 
screen while testifying to the subcommittee visible only to 
members and staff 
arthur eisenberg appointed trustee of local 814 in 1987 
following the convictions of several of the unions board members 
for labor racketeering said the financial condition of the locals 
pension welfare and benefit funds has improved dramatically since 
he took control of the unions activities 
i believe rico trusteeships can help carry out the public 
policy commitment to rid labor organizations of criminal 
infiltration and control eisenberg said 
concurring in that opinion was edwin h stier trustee of 
teamsters local 560 in union city nj which was placed under 
trusteeship in 1986 after a trial featuring lengthy testimony 
detailing the control of the provenzano crime family over the local 
the subcommittee earlier this week heard from teamsrers 
president william j mccarthy who said he had never had dealings 
with organized crime the hearings are to conclude next week with 
testimony from aflcio president lane kirkland and justice 
department officials concerning the appropriateness of court 
intervention in union affairs

president bush gave his qualified support 
today to a proposal by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to 
hold elections among palestinian arabs as a step toward a 
settlement in the middle east 
at the same time bush opposed any outcome in which israel might 
retain land it won in the 1967 sixday war 
bush said he told shamir we do not support an independent 
palestinian state nor israeli sovereignty over or permanent 
occupation of the west bank and gaza 
bush said he was confident an acceptable formula could be 
devised for conducting elections in the west bank and gaza 
territory israel has held since 1967 
the united states believes elections in the territories can be 
designed to contribute to a political process of dialogue and 
negotiations bush said after meeting with shamir for a little 
more than an hour 
but a senior us official said bush and shamir had agreed on a 
principle not any arrangement for conducting the elections 
these are principles for moving forward the official told 
reporters under rules that barred identifying him everyone 
recognizes more needs to be done to put meat on the bones 
shamirs proposal for elections was the main idea he brought 
here as a way resolving the conflict on the west bank and in gaza 
where palestinians have been in rebellion for 15 months 
shamir said israel will need the cooperation of the palestinians 
in devising the electoral process which he said would be followed 
by negotiations for a permanent agreement on the palestinian 
issue 
in order to launch a political negotiating process shamir 
said we propose free democratic elections free from an 
atmopshere of plo violence terror and intimidation among the 
palestinian arabs of judea samaria and gaza he said using the 
hebrew references to the territories their purpose is to produce 
a delegation to negotiate an interim period of selfgovernment 
administration 
bush speaking first said the status quo serves the interests 
of no one he pledged us assistance in the search for a 
settlement which bush said must be based on direct negotiations 
between israel and the arabs 
the president for the second time this week insisted on an end 
to what he called israels occupation of the territories he also 
said he did not support establishment of an independent palestinian 
state 
bush urged israel to engage in a serious dialogue with 
palestinians but did not say if he wanted israel to talk to the 
palestine liberation organization which claims to represent the 
14 million who live on the west bank and in gaza 
shamir said the goal of the elections he proposed was 
coexistence and cooperation between israel and the palestinians 
as a means to an overall settlement 
the israeli prime minister met for a second time today with 
secretary of state james a baker iii before outlining for bush his 
proposals for dealing with the arabisraeli conflict 
earlier shamirs ideas were shrouded in secrecy he had hinted 
before arriving here that he was inclined to call elections but 
shamir and baker agreed at their first meeting at the state 
department on wednesday not to disclose the substance of the prime 
ministers proposals until after the white house meeting with bush 
meanwhile an aide to shamir said the prime minister objected to 
any suggestions that elections be held under international 
supervision 
the aide yossi ahimeir said shamir rejected the idea of 
foreign oversight of elections during his talks here on wednesday 
ahimeir said the subject of supervision had come up in 
discussions shamir had with secretary of commerce robert mosbacher 
and housing secretary jack kemp 
ahimeir paraphrased shamir as saying we dont need this 
we are a country that has experience in handling democratic 
elections 
the aide said shamir proposed as an alternative to elections 
having egypt chose the palestinian reprepresentatives 
avi pazner the prime ministers media adviser said shamir and 
baker had decided not to reveal anything pazner did say that a 
group of israeli and us officials had convened to explore the 
ideas in advance of shamirs talk with bush 
egyptian president hosni mubarak in an interview with cable 
news network said if shamir holds elections without the 
participation of the plo it will be a grave mistake it will not 
solve the problem 
mubarak interviewed on the nbc today show said bush should 
tell shamir that land for peace is the main principle for 
proceeding forward in the peace process 
declaring that courage and good will were needed for 
achieving peace in the region mubarak said egypt has done lots 
of courageous steps for peace i think its the turn of the 
israelis to make a courageous step 
the israeli leader refuses to negotiate with yasser arafats 
organization which he blames for terrorism against israel and 
protests by palestinians on the west bank and in gaza so far 419 
palestinian arabs and 18 israelis have been killed in 15 months of 
disturbances in the occupied territories 
shamirs election proposition is designed to have the 
palestinians elect representatives to negotiate with israel on the 
basis of the 1978 camp david agreements reached with egypt under 
us auspices 
the agreements produced an egyptianisraeli peace treaty in 1979 
and called also for five years of local autonomy for the 
palestinians after which negotiations would determine their future 
and that of the territories captured by israel in the 1967 war 
baker after meeting with shamir described their talk as very 
productive useful and very friendly 
for his part shamir said he had offered some ways to solve 
problems in the mideast and remarked 
i feel we have started a very serious discussion our 
conversation was very friendly 
there were widespread expectations before shamirs meeting with 
baker that the bush administration would take a tough stance toward 
israel 
bush on monday said he supports an eventual end to the israeli 
occupation and a us official briefing reporters at the white 
house on tuesday under rules of anonymity predicted a candid 
discussion a diplomatic way of forecasting division 
but pazner told reporters afterward i didnt see any 
hardening of position 
the israeli spokesman said shamir wanted to move carefully and 
that while the palestinian problem was severe for israel a bigger 
problem is our relationship with the arab world 
except for egypt none of the arab countries is officially at 
peace with israel the threat of a war the threat of an 
explosion comes mainly from that situation pazner said

with the bush administration pushing the 
supreme court to overturn its landmark abortion decision abortion 
advocates are converging on the nations capital this weekend for 
what they expect will be their largest demonstration 
they believe the stakes are higher than any time since the 
courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion and are determined to 
pick up the gauntlet bush has thrown down 
we have been silent far too long said kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
tens of thousands of students from 500 college campuses are 
coming mothers are bringing their daughters and granddaughters a 
delegation from capitol hill will be there and dozens of 
celebrities are flying in from hollywood for the sunday march 
organizers say 
the goal is to make the weekend a turning point in the national 
abortion debate organizers feel that antiabortion advocates have 
so far carried the day by focusing the question on when life 
begins instead they feel the issue is whether the government 
should intervene in what they believe should be a private decision 
nobody likes abortion its a difficult choice and there are a 
lot of issues that women have to weigh when faced with a crisis 
pregnancy michelman said women dont have abortions they 
want they have abortions they need 
organizers are reluctant to predict how many will turn out for 
the demonstration but they expect the number will be far larger 
than the 90000 who gathered for a march 1986 proabortion rally in 
washington 
at least one antiabortion group plans to mount a 
counterdemonstration of up to 300 people on the day of the march 
the engine revving the weekends events is the supreme court and 
its pending decision on a missouri case that could reverse or 
severely limit the high courts 1973 roe vs wade decision that 
legalized abortion oral arguments in the case are scheduled for 
later this month 
the reagan administration also pushed to overturn roe vs wade 
and failed but since the issue last came before the court two new 
justices have been seated and justice lewis powell a key defender 
of the 1973 decision has retired 
of the newcomers justice antonin scalia is thought to favor 
overturning or curtailing the decision justice anthony kennedys 
views on the ruling are not known but some observers think there 
may now be a onevote majority for changing the law 
women have felt abortion always would be legal but now that 
its clear theres a clear and present danger theyre 
responding said eleanor smeal president of the fund for the 
feminist majority 
the message of the march is directed at the nine justices who 
will decide the case and who organizers say are not immune to 
public opinion 
they understand public opinion everyone is influenced by 
public opinion said molly yard president of the national 
organization for women if the outcry and protest is loud enough 
and big enough theyll hear it 
the marchers also intend to send a message of disapproval to 
president bush who as one of his first acts as president in 
january addressed by telephone an antiabortion rally of about 
67000 outside the white house 
he has thrown down the gauntlet yard said 
plans for the demonstration include a march at noon on sunday 
from the washington monument down the mall to the capitol on 
monday abortion activists intend to take their message directly to 
members of congress and to legislators in states across the country 
about 50 celebrities and entertainers are scheduled to 
participate including singer judy collins and actresses cybill 
shepherd glenn close ellen burstyn tyne daly jill eikenberry 
morgan fairchild and susan sarandon 
since the 1986 march the number of endorsing organizations has 
doubled to more than 400 and the number of college campuses has 
also doubled 
its going to reshape the debate on abortion smeal said 
until now everybody said the other side antiabortion is a 
minority but is stronger and has more political clout you cant 
say that any more were going to show a tremendous outpouring of 
commitment and feeling 
organizers hope theyve been able to transmit the depth of that 
feeling from an older to a younger generation from the veterans of 
the battle to legalize abortion to the young women who will have to 
live with the outcome of the present debate 
the women who went through illegal abortions are going to make 
sure it doesnt happen to their daughters or granddaughters yard

prime minister noboru takeshita faces pressure from 
some members of his own party to resign to halt damage to the party 
from a stockprofiteering scandal politicians and news reports 
said thursday 
takeshita who acknowledged receiving nearly 400000 in 
political contributions from the company at the center of the 
scandal has vowed to remain in power despite opposition calls for 
his resignation and public opinion polls that show as few as 9 
percent of japanese support his government 
the news reports said thursday about 40 influential members of 
the governing liberal democratic party have decided to form the 
faction which demands all those linked to the scandal including 
party leaders step down 
the situation has reached a critical stage they quoted 
shizuka kamei a leading member of the group as saying the 
present liberal democratic party is not capable of carrying out 
selfpurification 
the group also demands the government call former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone for questioning by legislators on possible links 
with the recruit co an information conglomerate that allegedly 
used stock bargains to seek favors 
opposition parties are boycotting parliamentary deliberations on 
the budget which began saturday to back their demands for 
nakasones testimony 
on wednesday a group of 41 junior party members formed a 
faction to demand the government push political reforms 
prime minister takeshita and mr nakasone should accept the 
guilt and take appropriate measures to satisfy the people said 
faction leader hajime morita public distrust toward politics 
cannot be easily erased 
some liberal democrats have withdrawn from the party saying 
endorsement by the party which has dominated japanese politics for 
most of the postwar era now would hurt their chances to win 
elections 
junior politicians can lose their political careers unless 
the administration takes drastic measures immediately to restore 
public support toward the ldp said one governing party 
politician thursday the member spoke on condition of anonymity 
takeshita and party secretarygeneral shintaro abe have been 
linked to the scandal and another party leader former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa was one of three cabinet ministers who 
resigned because of links to recruit 
takeshita abe and miyazawa have denied personal wrongdoing 
prosecutors have arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen on 
bribery and securities law violation charges 
recruit sold bargainpriced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to 
about 150 influential people who reaped large profits when public 
trading in the stock began and it rose rapidly in value 
takeshita suffered another blow wednesday with reports which he 
later confirmed that recruit contributed 382000 to two takeshita 
fundraising parties in may 1987 six months before he became prime 
minister 
his liberal democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats in parliaments 
lower house and 143 of the 252 in the upper house elections for 
half of the upper house seats must be held this summer and a 
series of setbacks in local elections early this year has worried 
upper house party candidates 
a 3 percent sales tax that took effect saturday along with cuts 
in income taxes and some other taxes also has contributed to the 
takeshita governments unpopularity in the polls

americans took out 422 billion more in 
consumer debt than they paid off in february the slowest pace of 
growth in four months the government said thursday in a report 
consistent with other signs the economy may be slowing 
the federal reserve said the february increase in consumer 
credit was down slightly from januarys rise of 437 billion and 
was the smallest monthly gain since a 391 billion increase in 
october 
growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards 
strengthened in february while the gain in auto loans was slightly 
smaller than in january borrowing through bank and credit union 
loans not secured by real estate also slowed while mobile home 
lending declined 
analysts said the restrained growth in debt indicates consumers 
may be becoming more cautious about their buying plans and is in 
line with other signs that the economy is slowing down in the 
seventh year of its record peacetime expansion 
it doesnt suggest any great retrenchment by consumers but it 
does indicate somewhat more caution said economist cynthia latta 
of data resources inc in lexington mass its consistent with 
this gradually accumulating evidence that the economy is beginning 
to cool off 
consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic 
health because it accounts for twothirds of economic activity 
most government reports on the economys performance in february 
pointed downward although 1989 began with strong momentum 
analysts expect the economy to slow this year as the recovery 
ages and the nation responds to a yearlong campaign by the federal 
reserve board to push up interest rates to restrain growth and keep 
inflation in check 
februarys 75 percent rise in the seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of credit growth was down from 79 percent in january and 78 
percent in december for all of 1988 consumer debt rose 875 
percent 
auto loans rose 21 billion in february an 86 percent annual 
rate of growth following a 213 billion increase during january 
automobile sales have been weak this year with business held 
down by rising interest rates automakers in recent weeks have 
launched a new round of cash rebates and lowinterest financing 
programs in an effort to boost sales and avoid large production 
cutbacks 
growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards rose 
16 billion in february a 103 percent annual rate of growth 
that followed a january increase of 102 billion a 66 percent 
annual rate 
mobile home debts dropped 59 million in february a 28 percent 
rate of decline after rising 50 million in january 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by 
569 million in february a 41 percent rate of growth after 
rising 117 billion in january 
the various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally 
adjusted 67478 billion in february up 81 percent from a year 
earlier

the nation is moving away from the

again turn toward public purpose over private interest historian 
arthur m schlesinger jr says 
schlesinger an assistant to president john f kennedy said 
wednesday in a speech at miami university that a growing sense of 
selflessness fits into a historical rhythm 
schlesinger said the 1980s will go down as an era of vulgar 
consumption towering debt leveraged buyouts and widespread 
crookedness in both the private and public sectors but he 
predicted a sharp change in the national mood around 1990

president pw botha south 
africas strongwilled leader since 1978 on thursday announced his 
intention to retire after elections to be held by september 
his party had made clear it wanted a new president 
botha whose grip on power began to loosen after a stroke in 
january told parliament that an early general election will be 
held on an unspecified date within the next five months 
botha 73 did not state explicitly that he would retire but he 
said the outgoing president would hand over the official seal to a 
new president following the elections 
the new president is expected to be education minister fw de 
klerk who succeeded botha as leader of the national party on feb 
2 many nationalists view de klerk as more flexible than botha and 
more capable of breaking the countrys blackwhite political 
stalemate 
the statecontrolled south african broadcasting corp in a 
commentary to be broadcast friday said botha made it clear he 
did not intend to stand for another term 
botha now enters the last months of a political career that 
has spanned more than a halfcentury the commentary said 
he has presided over the countrys worst racial unrest and 
deepest international isolation but also its most ambitious race 
reforms and foreign policy initiatives including plans for the 
independence of namibia 
botha said he would dissolve parliament in may and then set a 
date for the election the voting is expected to take place between 
july 24 and sept 6 
after the election an electoral college dominated by the 
majority party in the white chamber of south africas racially 
separate parliament virtually certain to be bothas national 
party will choose the new president 
there would then be a ceremony where the seal of the republic 
would be handed over to him by the outgoing state president 
botha told a joint session of parliament in cape town 
de klerk grinned as he emerged from parliament but told 
reporters i have no statement to make 
botha returned to work in march after spending eight weeks 
recuperating from his stroke while his official duties were carried 
out by an acting president constitutional development minister 
chris heunis 
during bothas convalescence national party newspapers and 
politicians began suggesting that the president make way for a new 
generation of leaders botha declared he planned to stay in office 
until 1990 and the partys parliamentary caucus then adopted a 
resolution saying it wanted de klerk to be president 
the party lacked the constitutional power to force the president 
from office bothas term expires on sept 4 but he legally could 
have served until march 1990 the deadline for the next election 
de klerk 53 said after becoming party leader that he sought a 
south africa free of domination and oppression however he 
also reaffirmed the partys commitment to segregated schools and 
neighborhoods for whites who want them 
botha the son of a farmer left the university to become a 
national party organizer in 1936 
he entered parliament in 1948 the year the national party came 
to power and began codifying apartheid legislation and joined the 
cabinet in 1961 
he became head of the whiteminority government in 1978 as prime 
minister for several years he enjoyed a mandate among whites to 
maintain stability while moving away from rigid racial segregation 
in 1984 botha helped push through a new constitution that 
brought asians and mixedrace people into the previously allwhite 
parliament but the black majority continued to have no vote in 
national affairs 
black anger ignited two years of political violence in which an 
estimated 2500 people died 
the constitution abolished the post of prime minister and botha 
became president 
he was the first government leader to call for race reform and 
was credited with repealing apartheid laws that banned interracial 
marriages and required blacks to have a permit to be in whitesonly 
areas his reforms triggered a defection from the national party by 
rightwing whites who opposed any concessions to blacks 
but botha refused to consider the possibility of blackmajority 
government and insisted that whites retain segregated schools and 
neighborhoods

presidentelect alfredo 
cristiani of el salvador says he represents rightists who think of 
themselves as modern conservatives not exponents of their partys 
early neofascism 
as cristiani meets president bush on friday many question 
whether his faction of the republican nationalist alliance is 
dominant and whether he can control reputedly sinister elements of 
the party cristiani takes office june 1 
the united states which gives el salvador about 15 million a 
day in aid has said it will keep a close watch on human rights 
abuses under the rightwing party known as arena officials also 
have tied continued aid to an improved record 
even his antagonists consider cristiani personally upstanding 
and most accept his avowed commitment to furthering democracy in a 
nation ravaged by nine years of civil war 
he was faced with an important test march 31 
an outgoing criminal court judge ruled that two military men and 
a landowner implicated in an kidnapforprofit ring in the early 
1980s were illegally detained and must be freed 
all three along with five fugitives absolved by the judge were 
cronies of roberto daubuisson a dismissed major of army 
intelligence who founded arena in 1981 and retains great influence 
in it 
cristiani acted decisively he brought pressure to bear on the 
judiciary got the judges order revoked and kept two of the three 
suspects in jail 
new arrest warrants were issued for the man released and for the 
five daubuisson associates implicated in the ring 
a ranking us embassy official said of cristianis first human 
rights test he passed with flying colors 
critics of arena say cristiani a wealthy landowner educated at 
georgetown university in washington is a pseudodemocratic veneer 
on an apparatus linked to rightist death squads that killed tens of 
thousands of alleged leftists in the early 1980s 
arenas anthem broadcast incessantly during the campaign still 
says el salvador will be the tomb where the reds will all end 
up 
the presidentelect denies being a front man and says 
daubuisson who is an arena legislator and leads the majority bloc 
in the unicameral legislature will not have a post in the 
executive branch 
there should be no doubt that it is i who will run the 
government cristiani said after winning the march 19 election 
he is 41 a coffeegrower businessman and champion athlete who 
came late to politics and rose to prominence in arena after 
daubuisson lost the 1984 presidential election 
be assured that i entered politics only because of the 
countrys grave crisis and am not motivated by personal ambition 
he said in a radio advertisement during his campaign 
cristiani campaigned on a platform of capitalism for the 
masses and an end to the civil war 
he has said he is willing to talk with leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front but we will not 
negotiate our political platform or a share of power we will not 
negotiate democracy 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary archbishop of san 
salvador said recently the arena victory was likely to augment 
the level of violence because they are advocates of escalation of 
the war 
the new presidents position is that he will offer the rebels 
terms for laying down arms and entering the democratic process and 
will increase military pressure if they refuse 
rebel leaders say that amounts to a call for surrender they say 
they will be the ones to intensify the war showing the country to 
be ungovernable without their participation

doctors have discovered how to identify genetic 
defects in embryos as young as two days old greatly reducing the 
need for aborting a abnormal fetus in later stages of pregnancy 
researchers said thursday 
it is a wonderful move forward a scientific advance a 
medical advance and an ethical advance biologist robert edwards 
told doctors from 42 nations at a conference on the test tube 
fertilization techniques 
the new work by british and american scientists has developed 
screening techniques for sexlinked handicaps such as muscular 
dystrophy as well as some immunodeficiency and neurological 
disorders 
it has preciptated the opening later this year of the first 
genetic screening programs using in vitro fertilization 
they will be at britains bourne hallan clinic in cambridge and 
hammersmith hospital in london said edwards a member of the 
british team responsible for the worlds first test tube baby in 
1978 
the traditional screening method amniocentesis can be 
performed only in the second trimester of pregnancy it involves 
removing a small amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus in 
the uterus 
if a genetic disorder is found the woman faces the often 
traumatic choice of abortion in the fifth or sixth month of 
pregnancy 
some women never get over a lost baby especially when an 
abortion is performed after amniocentesis when she has already 
felt it move and is heavily pregnant said dr robert m winston 
of hammersmith hospital 
the new method allows doctors to study the genetic makeup of a 
2dayold embryo produced in a test tube 
by removing a single cell of the embryo then amplifying and 
copying specific gene sequences scientists can identify defects 
if the embryo is normal it is implanted in the womans uterus 24 
hours later 
now youre seeing the breakthrough youve got the embryo 
right before you put it in so they will know their pregnancy is 
right that for me is marvelous said roberts 
among drawbacks is the low success rate of only one in five for 
test tube fertilizations 
roberts also cautioned the new method would not immediately 
eliminate the need for amniocentesis 
in the early days of the work wed have to do amniocentesis 
to find out what our failure rate is edwards explained we 
take an embryo and type it then you type it with amniocentesis 
and say yes its a male and its free of disease 
but he added even if youre only 95 percent right you reduce 
the amniocentesis abortions to just 5 percent of what weve got 
now 
among disorders the new technique can detect are absence of 
enzymes which lead to muscular dystrophy and a highly debilitating 
disease known as lesch nyhan both of which affect males children 
with lesch nyhan are crippled and have to be restrained phsyically 
to prevent them mutilating themselves 
a woman who carries a dominant gene for such inherited disorders 
has a 50 percent chance of passing on the defect while a woman 
with a recessive gene has one in four chances of passing it on 
winston cited one woman who produced a child with lesch nyhan 
then had five lateterm abortions when amniocentesis detected the 
disorder 
he said another womans first marriage ended after two abortions 
of fetuses suffering muscular dystrophy the woman since has 
aborted three more such fetuses

the senate told it is a guardian of 
tradition without becoming a barrier to change celebrated its 
first two centuries of history on thursday recalling its faltering 
beginnings and noting its many milestones 
april 6 1789 was the date that the first senate meeting in 
new york city finally reached a quorum and thus was able to 
start conducting business after a frustrating month of failing to 
do so 
history oozes from these walls said sen john glenn 
dohio as the day of commemoration began in the old senate chamber 
in the capitol with the issuing of a postage stamp displaying the 
gilt shield and eagle still suspended over the presiding officers 
chair 
the eagle and shield were there during speeches on the old 
chambers floor which served the senate from 1810 to 1859 and can 
be seen in 19th century prints involving three famous senators of 
the era daniel webster of massachusetts henry clay of kentucky 
and john c calhoun of south carolina 
those three senators and the roles they played in the period 
before the civil war were invoked repeatedly as past and former 
senators hailed the senate as an institution 
howard h baker jr of tennessee a former senate republican 
leader said the sense of history in the old senate hall and in 
the senates present chamber first occupied in 1859 is so strong 
that at times one can truly smell the marble 
nearly 20 former senators including baker and former 
democratic leader mike mansfield of montana joined senators in 
the current 101st congress for the ceremonies members of the house 
of representatives celebrated the quorum bicentennial session of 
that body on tuesday 
former sen thomas f eagleton a democrat from missouri said 
that the legacy of the early senate is the art of the american 
political compromise 
today compromise is woven into constitutional fabric of the 
nation eagleton said 
although many senators past and present have regarded compromise 
as morally wrong eagleton said it is politically essential 
compromise in my judgment is getting a bad rap eagleton 
said without it we screech to a halt paralyzed by 
intransigence 
the senate session began at 11 am the hour of the first 
session two centuries ago 
with the conclusion of the ceremonys first half in the old 
chamber senators formed a procession to the senates present 
meeting place down the hall 
senior senators from the states answered the roll call 
beginning with delaware which became the first state in 1787 and 
continuing to hawaii which in 1959 became the 50th to join the 
union 
when south carolinas name was called republican strom thurmond 
gave this response south carolina was not the first state to be 
admitted but it was the first to secede in 1860 after the civil 
war south carolina returned to the union in 1868 
sen ted stevens ralaska noted thomas jeffersons description 
of the senate as a stage and recalled some of the drama the 
present chamber has witnessed including the onevote defeat of the 
attempt to oust president andrew johnson during reconstruction 
after the civil war and the rejection of president woodrow 
wilsons effort to bring the united states into the league of 
nations after world war i 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said that while 
the senate has undergone many changes over the years it remains a 
place where the rights of the minority are protected and speech can 
remain virtually unlimited 
it is a guardian of tradition without becoming a barrier to 
change he said 
senators moved in and out of the ceremonies to spirited john 
philip sousa marches played by the marine corps band 
a tourist asked a doorman does a band play every day the 
senate meets 
no the doorman replied only once every 200 years

mikhail s gorbachev conducted overt 
intelligence at a hightech factory thursday asking surprised 
workers not only about quality control but also whether they were 
happy and how much money they made 
he even asked me my salary which was a bit embarrassing 
because i think us english like to keep our salaries to 
ourselves said michael smith a 43yearold worker at the case 
communications ltd plant 18 miles northwest of london 
although the british are often reserved especially on the 
subject of money smith presumably divulged the details the 
plants workers make an average of about 37000 a year 
on the only full day of his 40hour visit to britain the soviet 
president paid a 40minute visit to the 1000worker plant 
arriving in an impressive 22car motorcade 
the highly automated factory designs and makes network 
systems that enable computers to talk to each other the company 
said the soviets invited themselves last week because gorbachev 
would be interested in its technology and relaxed corporate culture 
gorbachev was greeted outside at the companys main building by 
british trade secretary lord young and company and local officials 
case communications flew the soviet flag for the occasion 
nearly 200 people braved cold drizzle and waited behind a police 
barricade across the street hoping to catch a glimpse of the soviet 
leader 
keep up the good work read one placard 
young said after the visit he was very interested in ways in 
which we are dealing with quality control he showed an enormous 
curiosity and i think he will have found the visit extremely 
useful 
gorbachev talked to smith a senior designer of printed circuit 
boards with particular friendliness and commented on their shared 
name 
michael i know that name gorbachev said 
he was a very friendly chap i thought smith said later 
he was more interested in my private life he asked where i 
was educated what sort of school i went to where i lived what 
size of house i had he wanted to talk about my family my wife and 
children where they went to school 
employee angela dawkins 42 told gorbachev she had worked at 
the factory for six happy years 
gorbachev fixed her with a stare and said are you saying this 
because the bosses are listening 
no i really mean it she said 
ah yes i can see from your eyes she said gorbachev replied

oliver north testifying in his own defense 
said today reagan administration superiors told him not to tell 
anybody about his role in funneling aid to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
north took the stand shortly after george bush was identified in 
court as an intermediary in president reagans secret plan to aid 
the contras 
north who faces a dozen charges in connection with his role in 
the irancontra affair said i was particularly admonished to 
keep secret that another country was providing millions of 
dollars to help the contras saudi arabia supplied some 32 
million in aid to the contras beginning in mid1984 
asked by defense lawyer brendan sullivan who told him he was 
going to be running the operation north identified thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane his deputy john poindexter and 
cia director william casey 
under questioning from his lawyer the former white house aide 
depicted himself as a marine officer with plans to take command of 
a battalion at camp lejeune when top officials in the reagan 
administration enlisted him to run the secret contra operation in 
1984 
north testified in his own defense after his attorneys read into 
the record a lengthy account of the reagan administrations efforts 
to keep alive the contra struggle against the leftist government of 
nicaragua 
the account a legal admission of fact read to the jury with 
the agreement of the prosecution said bush personally told the 
president of honduras in 1985 that extra aid was being funneled to 
his country as payment for helping the contras 
the account also said a representative of panamanian military 
leader manuel noriega offered in a meeting with north to 
assassinate the sandinista leadership in nicaragua north was said 
to reply that the united states wanted no part of any such plans 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart said i have 
no comment on the developments adding that this is part of an 
ongoing trial 
a short while after the admission of fact statement was 
read north was on the stand and fielding questions from his own 
attorney 
was there a time when you were stepping in to help the 
contras asked north lawyer brendan sullivan 
i was not stepping in i was brought in responded north 
i was told not to tell anybody about his role in taking over 
from the cia in overseeing the contras needs north testified 
prosecutor john keker objected when sullivan asked whether north 
understood that president reagan had designated him as the 
contras new provider us district judge gerhard a gesell 
sustained the objection and north didnt answer 
north said he ended up handling everything that had been 
coming from the cia 
everything that they had from the little tents that they 
lived in to food to bullets to intelligence had come from 
the cia said north 
i dont recall there was any specific break point when all 
the contras needs fell on his shoulders but he was carrying the 
load by the time the cutoff in military aid went in effect in 
october 1984 north testified 
north recalled how he went to casey to get bank account numbers 
so he would know where money to the contras was to be funneled and 
which factions of the splintered contra movement to contact 
dressed in a dark suit north sat down in the witness box seven 
weeks after a jury began hearing testimony in the case 
so youre colonel north his attorney brendan sullivan 
began as the former white house aide took the stand yes sir i 
am he replied with a smile 
it was disclosed earlier in norths trial that president reagan 
personally approved a secret deal early in 1985 to funnel 110 
million in extra aid to honduras in exchange for that countrys 
support for the contras 
the deal with honduras was one of the quid pro quo arrangements 
whose details have emerged at norths trial showing how the united 
states secretly enlisted the aid of other countries in support of 
the nicaraguan rebels at a time when congress had cut off military 
aid to the contras 
after reagan approved the assistance bush then vice president 
told honduran president roberto suazo that president reagan had 
directed expedited delivery of us military items to honduras 
said the statement read by norths lawyer 
vice president bush also informed suazo that president reagan 
had directed that currently withheld economic assistance for 
honduras should be released said the statement 
bush also said that the united states would provide from its 
own military stocks critical security assistance items that had 
been ordered by honduran armed forces and that several security 
programs under way for honduran security forces would be 
enhanced the statement said 
noriegas representative offered the assassinations in mid1986 
on behalf of the panamanian leader in exchange for a promise 
from the us government to help clean up noriegas image 
according to the statement 
also to be part of the deal according to the statement was the 
lifting of a ban by the us government on military sales to the 
panamian defense forces 
after lengthy criminal investigations noriega was indicted in 
the united states on feb 4 1988 for alleged involvement in 
international drug trafficking 
north told the representative at the meeting that the us 
government could not be involved in assassinations said the 
statement read by his lawyer 
the panamanian representative pointed out that noriega had 
helped the united states the previous year in blowing up a 
sandinista arsenal the statement said 
when north told his boss poindexter of the panamanian offer 
poindexter responded according to the statement that the us 
government could not be involved in assassination but panamanian 
assistance with sabatoge would be another story poindexter 
recommended that north speak with noriega directly it said 
the prosecution said in a motion earlier that north should be 
compelled to produce his notebooks and ledgers if he testified 
north chronicled his daily activities at the national security 
council in a series of notebooks he also kept a ledger of the use 
of travelers checks he received from contra leader adolfo calero 
north told congress he destroyed the ledger but the prosecutors 
have been under orders not to read his immunized testimony 
the government had issued a subpoena to produce the documents 
march 3 contingent on his testifying 
other information detailed in the statement read by norths 
lawyer included 
reagan urged the saudi head of state in 1985 that the saudi 
arabian government continue its support for the contras 
subsequently the saudis gave 25 million 
in 1983 cia director william casey became involved in a secret 
effort known as operation tipped kettle to persuade israel to make 
available weapons captured from the plo casey discussed the matter 
with defense secretary caspar weinberger 
the cia advised that it would use the weapons for various 
purposes several hundred tons of the weapons were shipped to the 
contras as congressionally appropriated funds to the rebels ran out 
in 1984 under an operation known as elephant herd the united 
states was to tell israel it would be as flexible as posible within 
the constraints of the law to compensate israel with aid in 
exchange for the weapons it had gotten from the plo 
earlier today former hostage david jacobsen testified that 
norths eyes filled with tears following jacobsens release because 
other americans held captive in lebanon had not been released 
jacobsen said that on a plane flight to germany north told 
jacobsen he was discouraged because the other hostages hadnt 
been released and they cant enjoy the same happiness you are 
enjoying

the fired captain of the exxon valdez 
walked out of jail thursday after winning reduction of the 1 
million bond set by a judge who compared the tankers oil spill to 
the hiroshima bombing 
a stonefaced capt joseph hazelwood 42 walked past reporters 
without comment and climbed into a waiting jaguar with his lawyers 
a few hours earlier a supervising state judge reduced his bail 
to 25000 and called the 1 million figure unconstitutionally 
excessive 
hazelwood who was charged with being intoxicated when his 
tanker crashed into a reef on march 24 spent one night in jail 
he turned himself in wednesday and state supreme court justice 
kenneth rohl set bail at 1 million bond or 500000 cash 
these misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been 
equaled at least in this country said rohl who comes from a 
family of professional seamen we have a manmade destruction 
that has not been equaled probably since hiroshima 
justice thomas stark who heard the bond appeal said there was 
little chance of hazelwood jumping bail and drastically cut it to 
the amount originally requested by prosecutors 
the amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of 
the crime or the affect of the crime on the community said stark 
after listening to an emotional appeal from hazelwood attorney 
thomas russo 
hazelwood has 30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing that 
would return him to alaska where he faces charges of operating a 
ship while intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil the charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 
2 years in prison and a 10000 fine 
hazelwood was fired by exxon last thursday after the national 
transportation safety board said tests taken about nine hours after 
the march 24 disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol

civil liberties union has brought a halt to a yearsold practice of 
reading bible verses each day over the intercom at blytheville high 
school 
we sought legal advice and learned that we would probably not 
be on solid legal ground and would probably lose the case 
superintendent frank ladd said wednesday 
principal bruce young had earlier contended the readings 
carried out for at least 17 years didnt violate the 
constitutional separation of church and state he said students 
could tune them out if they wanted and that no attempt was made 
to impose specific interpretations of the verses 
jay jacobson director of the arkansas chapter of the aclu had 
said that group was discussing a lawsuit with a potential client in 
the district 
im delighted to see that they voluntarily agreed with the 
bill of rights and will set a fine example for young people that

consumers prefer less fat in their steaks and 
hamburger and the beef industry has responded well to those 
demands two texas aampm university scientists said thursday 
h russell cross and jeff savell said further progress can be 
expected in the future as attention continues to be drawn to health 
issues notably the dietary linkage between fats and high levels of 
blood cholesterol 
but savell told a conference sponsored by the national 
cattlemens association that if he had to send cattle producers and 
the beef industry a note from the teacher it might say 
excellent progress made in making product fit consumers needs 
keep working on leanness convenience and cost value remember to 
maintain taste or consumers will go elsewhere 
the beef industry drew praise from jay fletcher of the community 
nutrition institute who agreed that less fat is being sold to 
consumers 
i think they have done more than many other industries to 
recognize the dangers of excessive fat consumption and take steps 
to inform consumers about that fletcher said in a telephone 
interview 
but selling meat is also a business he said and the beef 
industry wants to recover its market share they have lost it 
steadily to chicken and poultry in general over the past 10 years 
fletcher said that occurred largely because of consumer 
perception of beef as a highfat food 
it was just a year ago that the agriculture department released 
a study by texas aampm led by cross and savell that showed the 
trimmable fat on retail cuts of beef had been reduced 27 percent in 
two years 
the 45000 study paid for by the beef industry and usda 
showed that the average thickness of fat on steaks and roasts from 
primal cuts or the major wholesale cuts of beef was 014 inch 
while the average for all cuts from chuck roast to stew meat was 
011 inch or less than oneeighth of an inch 
most retailers have been using a quarterinch beef fat trim or 
less since 1985 compared with a standard of half an inch before 
that according to the industry 
at the conference cross said consumers have indicated they 
would pay for more closely trimmed beef preferably with external 
fat of less than oneeighth inch 
internal fat or marbling has been a factor in the taste of 
beef and cross said this still is important to consumers the 
challenge he said is take fat off not out of beef 
cross said that texas aampm meat scientists are currently working 
with human medicine researchers at baylor college of medicine and 
the university of texas southwestern medical center on projects 
aimed at further improvements in the healthfulness of beef 
the work includes modification of the fatty acid content of meat 
product through changes in cattle feeds and products themselves 
fatty acids can potentially elevate cholesterol levels in human 
blood but cross said that even now only 27 percent of the total 
fat in beef is the type of saturated fatty acid that can raise 
cholesterol 
savell told of recent research on the composition of cooked as 
well as raw beef with reduced or no external fat for example if a 
slice of beef with all the fat trimmed off is cooked the fat 
content of the interior meat is reduced by 20 percent from a slice 
with a quarterinch layer of fat 
that is because less fat migrates from the outside into the meat 
tissue 
when you trim the fat off a steak that has a half inch of fat 
you get rid of half the total cholesterol savell said

president bush bowing to congressional 
pressure has chosen peter tomsen as a special envoy to the afghan 
rebels battling the sovietbacked regime in kabul administration 
sources said thursday 
tomsen the deputy chief of the us embassy in beijing has not 
formally been selected but sources who spoke on condition they not 
be identified by name confirmed he was the choice of bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
the move stops short of offering formal recognition of the 
afghan governmentinexile but it is seen as a means of broadening 
us influence among the longfeuding rebel factions and curbing 
paskistans clout 
the post carries the rank of ambassador tomsen will be based in 
washington and travel frequently to the region said an 
administration official who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified the name has not formally been announced because it 
hasnt been put through all the administrative hoops yet said 
the official 
the move drew immediate criticism from the soviet union in 
moscow foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh accused the 
united states of plans to break off relations with the afghan 
government and preparing to recognize a selfimposed 
government 
the united states does not want to extinguish the flames in 
afghanistan they make every effort to topple the government in 
afghanistan gremitskikh said repeating soviet charges that the 
administration was failing to uphold the geneva accords that 
oversaw the withdrawal of soviet troops in february 
the united states closed its embassy in kabul several weeks ago 
as the situation in the city deteriorated after the soviet pullout 
formal diplomatic ties were not broken however 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler who confirmed 
the decision about the envoy had been named but refused to identify 
him said the move did not entail a recognition of the rebels 
governmentinexile or establish diplomatic relations with it 
sen gordon humphrey rnh who pushed a law through congress 
last year requiring the appointment of such a special ambassador 
said he was elated by the reported decision 
humphrey acknowledged that he had backed an afghanborn rand 
corp scholar for the post zalmy khalilzad who is now a us 
citizen for the job khalilzad speaks afghanistans two languages 
dari and pashtu which tomsen does not 
but the senator said he was pleased that the administration 
appeared to be moving toward developing policy for dealing with the 
fluid situation in afghanistan and he hoped the move was a step 
toward the eventual recognition 
it does raise the credibility of the resistance he said 
the senator argued that the highlevel posting was needed to 
curb pakistans influence over the rebels now that the soviet 
troops have withdrawn from afghanistan and the insurgents are 
battling the kabul regime 
pakistans goals whatever they are in the region may not 
wholly be in agreement with our own the united states needs to 
take some new initiative we need a policy with momentum 
humphrey said in a telephone interview 
the united states has funneled support to the rebels through 
pakistan which has continued to back radical moslem fundamentalist 
rebels over more moderate factions 
some us officials have privately expressed concerns about 
powerful resistance leaders who advocate restructuring afghan 
society along strict islamic fundamentalist lines

a government minister said thursday the 
sevenyear ban on solidarity would be lifted immediately and lech 
walesa urged supporters to put their political victory into 
action by organizing nationwide 
the process of legalization of solidarity should be completed 
between april 15 and april 20 said sports minister aleksander 
kwasniewski a chief negotiator for the communist government in two 
months of talks with the opposition that concluded wednesday in a 
broad accord 
kwasniewski said the sejm or parliament would meet friday to 
enact the agreements on trade union freedoms economic reforms and 
political changes including creation of the first freely elected 
legislative body in the east bloc 
walesa looking relaxed at a news conference after a grueling 
week of negotiations outlined the tasks his independent trade 
union faces but he warned the agreement could lead to disaster if 
poland failed to take advantage of the changes 
the most important task for today is to write applications 
immediately all over the country to provincial governors and city 
mayors so we get the technical possibility to organize as soon as 
possible walesa said 
the agreement allows solidarity to organize on a national 
regional and local level after parliament makes the necessary 
changes in the labor law to permit more than one legal trade union 
at a workplace 
on the national level the union plans to form an organizing 
committee as early as this weekend to apply for formal registration 
by submitting a new union charter in court said top solidarity 
adviser tadeusz mazowiecki 
today we as poland have a great victory but a political 
victory a theoretical one which may turn out to be a victory or a 
disaster if we are not able to make use of it walesa said 
if we are not able to work in the economic field to have more 
produce more and better and in the political field to represent 
ourselves well nice slogans will only stay slogans walesa 
said 
the government daily rzeczpospolita called the agreements sealed 
by walesa and gen czeslaw kiszczak the interior minister a 
breakthrough that created a chance that must not be wasted by 
false solutions sham ambitions or ignorance of realities 
stanislaw ciosek a politburo member and participant in the 
talks said the agreement was a step toward reforms undertaken by 
the communist party but it would not solve all of polands 
problems 
these reforms have made the prospect of satisfying the working 
class much closer ciosek said in spite of what i said before 
one should not expect that the agreement reached should eliminate 
all concerns and troubles 
walesa appeared unconcerned by the apparent lack of reaction by 
poles to the restoration of the soviet blocs first independent 
trade union which claimed 10 million members and ignited that 
nations spirit during its 16month legal existence before being 
crushed under martial law in december 1981 
i went on the hotel balcony today and watched peoples 
behavior i met with great sympathy almost everyone waved but 
also with a lot of doubt walesa said 
he said the union had trouble before with expectations that were 
too high so todays skepticism is good 
walesa said he expected solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 
million members but that he would like to see at least three 
competing trade unions 
walesa and his advisers have said the shift in the attitude of 
the polish leadership toward solidarity is partially due to changes 
in the political climate in the soviet union 
walesa said he would like to see what is happening in the soviet 
union for himself and added i would not like to disturb 
perestroika and reforms that country is reforming itself as far as 
we hear we want to solve our problems and not disturb 
others 
he later flew to his home in the port city of gdansk where 
solidarity was founded and told reporters the union would like to 
use the monopol hotel in warsaw as its national headquarters 
kwasniewski said the government had urged local and regional 
authorities to support the registration process of new unions and 
provide them with office space 
authorities proposed the talks in august during the years 
second nationwide wave of strikes when work stoppages appeared 
again this year walesa appealed for calm to give the negotiations 
a chance 
both sides have expressed hope the solutions reached at the 
talks that began feb 6 will repair the economy and revive the 
dispirited population 
in addition to solidarity authorities agreed to restore legal 
status to the farmers union rural solidarity and the independent 
students association all banned during martial law 
in exchange the opposition agreed to participate in june 
elections to the 460member sejm that guarantee the communist party 
and its allies a 65 percent majority 
but at the same time poland will have its first democratic 
elections since world war ii creating a new 100member senate 
a presidency also will be created to be elected by the sejm and 
the senate the president would be elected this year for a sixyear 
term and the post is expected to go to gen wojciech jaruzelski 
the communist party leader due to his partys dominance in the 
larger sejm

thirdworld debt is imposing its heaviest 
burden on millions of children whose countries are cutting social 
programs to keep up payments loans from foreign banks actress 
audrey hepburn told congress thursday 
accompanying declining spending by developing countries for 
health and education is a more alarming statistic she said the 
average weightforage figure is falling in many of the countries 
in other words the children of the developing world are 
paying for the third worlds 13 billion debt with their health 
education and even their lives she told the house appropriations 
foreign operations subcommittee 
at least half a million young children have died in the last 
12 months as a result of the slowing down or reversal of progress 
in the developing world said hepburn who is a goodwill 
ambassador for the united nations childrens fund 
unicef she said is able to use its implicit trust to help 
alleviate those conditions in places such as the droughtstricken 
sudan where aid to starving people has been stalled because of a 
civil war 
everybody trusts you because everybody loves a child 
hepburn said in response to a question from chairman david obey 
dwis 
its something everybody has in common children may 
eventually be the cause of peace in these countries what they need 
most is peace but they cant wait and unicef is taking care of 
them 
unicef is a perennial favorite on capitol hill where lawmakers 
have restored some 100 million in cuts proposed by the reagan 
administration over the last four years according to the

a common pleas court judge ruled thursday 
that mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and seven associates 
must be sentenced to life in prison instead of death for killing a 
gangster 
judge eugene clarke took the decision away from the jury on 
grounds that prosecutors failed to show sufficient aggravating 
circumstances for a death sentence to be imposed 
because only a jury can impose a death sentence the eight men 
convicted in the 1985 slaying of frank frankie flowers 
dalfonso will automatically be sentenced to life in prison 
friends and relatives of the eight broke out in applause as the 
judge announced his decision 
during the sentencing phase of the trial thursday city police 
firearms examiner john finor testified bystanders were nearby when 
dalfonso was shot on a south philadelphia street corner 
but clarke ruled that was not an aggravating circumstance 
necessary for the death penalty under pennsylvania law 
the decision came a day after jurors convicted scarfo and the 
others of firstdegree murder conspiracy and the possession of an 
instrument of crime in the july 23 1985 shooting of dalfonso 
near his home as he paused to light a cigarette 
government witnesses said dalfonso was murdered because he 
failed to show scarfo proper respect as head of organized crime in 
the philadelphiasouthern new jersey area 
scarfo 60 already is serving a 14year sentence in a 1 
million extortion case and faces at least 40 more years in a 
federal racketeering case

the bush administration is preparing a package 
of measures designed to encourage polands communist authorities to 
implement democratic reforms they agreed to this week officials 
said thursday 
the package to be announced as early as friday would include 
economic and possibly political concessions to poland said two 
administration officials who spoke on condition they not be 
identified they declined to give specifics 
a polish government spokesman said it was asking the united 
states to give the green light to loans from the international 
monetary fund the world bank and from other western governments 
what we want does not lie in the bilateral range of things 
not trade said polish embassy spokesman mierik miernik 
polands efforts to rebuild its shattered economy have been 
hampered by an inflation rate of between 60 and 100 percent and a 
39 billion foreign debt the polish government would like us 
support in persuading the paris club of bankers and governments to 
reschedule repayment of the loans miernik said 
although the united states lifted the sanctions it imposed after 
communist authorities declared martial law in poland in 1981 it 
has been pressuring western banks and governments against extending 
new credits to warsaw he said 
forty congressmen have also urged the administration to 
influence the imf world bank and paris club to relieve debt 
pressure on poland 
the congressmen including house democratic whip tony coelho of 
california and republican whip newt gingrich of georgia said that 
with the reforms in place poland should maintain a primary 
position on americas foreign policy agenda 
now that poland seems on the threshold of monumental reform 
the struggle of the polish people should not slip down on our list 
of priorities said the letter initiated by rep william o 
lipinski dill 
one step might be allowing the governments overseas private 
investment corporation to insure investments by americans in polish 
agriculture or other economic enterprises said an aide to lipinski 
state department and white house officials have been preparing a 
package of conciliatory measures for several weeks with an eye to 
negotiations involving polands communist authorities solidarity 
leader lech walesa representatives of the roman catholic church 
and others 
walesa and interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak concluded the 
talks and announced the accords on wednesday they include the 
first free elections since the communists took over poland after 
world war ii and legalization of the solidarity trade union after 
eight years of suppression 
state department analysts who have scrutinized the agreement 
said they were impressed its constitutional provisions 
it creates a strong presidency recreates an upper house of 
parliament and eliminates over time the communists guaranteed 
majority in the lower house of parliament meaning they ultimately 
could lose control of the country said a state department analyst 
who asked not to be identified 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday that 
president bush hailed the accords that have started poland on 
this new path of reconciliation 
we feel very confident about the process that is under way in 
poland fitzwater said now that we have these accords we are 
considering issues or moves that might be taken which would in 
various ways foster economic development and help move that 
process forward

despite pleas for help from congress the 
agriculture department said thursday it was too early to advance a 
new drought relief package to aid winter wheat growers facing 
potential losses from dry weather and temperature extremes 
we dont know there is going to be a widespread disaster 
ewen m wilson usdas assistant secretary for economics told a 
house agriculture subcommittee 
frustrated by the waitandsee approach a kansas lawmaker 
introduced legislation to extend drought assistance approved last 
year by congress to farmers of winter wheat planted in 1988 
it is my people we are suffering we were able to work with 
corn country last year it is our time said rep pat roberts 
rkan who represents a 58county district considered one of the 
prime wheatgrowing regions in the nation 
according to usda the winter wheat outlook is bleak in kansas 
traditionally the nations largest producer at the start of the 
month 70 percent of the kansas wheat crop was rated poor to very 
poor kansas normally accounts for 17 percent of total us wheat 
production and 35 percent of the nations hard red winter wheat 
the main bread wheat 
in testimony to the wheat soybeans and feed grains 
subcommittee usda officials conceded that drought could sharply 
reduce harvests in portions of the major winter wheat states of 
kansas oklahoma texas nebraska and colorado however they held 
hope that spring rains could rescue part of the crop 
norton strommen usdas chief meterologist said the next 30 to 
60 days will be critical he said the 90day weather outlook 
suggested nearnormal rainfall in much of the wheat belt across the 
the great plains although below normal rainfall is expected in the 
short term 
because the winter wheat crop is developing later than usual 
this year strommen said we have a mixed picture 
its just a little premature to start to write the crop down 
to any specific level said strommen we simply have to watch 
and wait for the development and the timing and distribution of 
rainfall in the next two months 
lawmakers unsuccessfully pressed usda to support a new 
legislative relief package or extending the 1988 drought assistance 
programs to the 1989 wheat crop 
wilson said usda doesnt want to do anything precipitous 
we will have to monitor the situation and see if it rains and 
see how bad it is he said 
for the major winter wheat states wilson said 31 percent of 
the overall crop was rated poor to very poor compared to 8 percent 
last year at this time 
according to a highly tentative projection by usda total 
1989 wheat production could be about 245 billion bushels a 35 
percent boost from last years droughtreduced harvest 
at the hearing john schnittker a private agricultural analyst 
estimated a harvest of 22523 billion bushels he warned that a 
poor us winter wheat crop would drastically shrink already small 
grain stockpiles and pose a serious threat to world food 
sufficiency and price stability

representatives of salvadoran rebels 
challenged the newly elected arena party thursday to declare its 
administration a government of transition or face a deepening 
of the nineyearold war in the central american country 
guadelupe gonzales of the leftist farabundo marti national 
liberation front said the proposal was being announced in 
washington because presidentelect alfredo cristiani is here for 
talks with us officials 
francisco altschul a representative of the political opposition 
commission of the rebel group said the proposal was presented 
thursday to representatives of arena and other salvadoran factions 
he said he knew of no response 
cristiani has a news conference scheduled friday morning and 
will meet with president bush in the afternoon 
asked what would happen if arena rejects the proposal altschul 
said we hope it is not rejected unless there is a negotiated 
settlement of the war there is only going to be an ungovernable 
country there is only going to be a deepening of the war 
meanwhile in san salvador the leftist guerrillas attacked the 
4th army brigade headquarters and the headquarters of army 
engineers authorities said three soldiers and three guerrillas 
were reported killed and 10 people wounded 
more than 70000 salvadorans most of them civilians have been 
killed during the nineyear war against the ussupported 
government 
the rebels have stepped up attacks recently to protest the 
election of cristiani a rightwing businessman who was the 
candidate of arena in an election march 9 cristiani is scheduled 
to take office june 1 
altschul told reporters that arena named for its initials in 
spanish has made it very clear that it will follow a policy of 
massacres and total war and has given no indication of a serious 
disposition toward peace 
he said the rebels would seek a response from arena to demands 
that it stop assassinations respect nationalization of banks and 
other steps taken by its predecessors and abandon its insistence 
that the guerrillas surrender 
he said this would be a first step to start serious 
negotiations 
in order to resolve the problem of the war in a definitive 
manner it is necessary to revise the constitution and for the 
future arena government to declare itself a government of 
transition the proposal said 
it called for elections in which the army would be confined to 
barracks and the rebel military forces also kept away from voting 
places for three days before during and after the voting 
it called for the rebel faction to participate directly as a 
political force in these elections with our flag and in coalition 
with other parties which may be disposed to participate together 
with us 
it said that commanders and officers implicated in political 
crimes and massacres which have been causes of the war must be 
brought to justice 
the rebels also demanded that us aid be cut off and us 
advisors withdrawn 
elections would be held within six months after initiation of a 
cease fire

president bush may order the military to help 
in the longterm cleanup of the massive oil spill in alaska it was 
disclosed thursday as the administration underscored its opposition 
to a federal takeover of the operation 
theres a lot of military already in alaska white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said adding that those troops 
were the most likely to be tapped 
fitzwater said alaskas congressional delegation had asked 
officials to consider using the military and we are he said 
the armed forces could help in washing oil from animals and birds 
plus cleaning up rocks and shorelines and then continue in the 
longterm effort 
asked when the military might begin the work fitzwater said 
beginning about now he said a final decision was still 
pending the concern is we need a comprehensive way to deal with 
this continuing and longterm cleanup 
the white house is under pressure to take charge of cleaning up 
the largest oil spill in us history 
weve got to have federal control now sen ted stevens 
ralaska told transportation secretary samuel skinner at the first 
of several congressional hearings on efforts to deal with the 
nations worst oil tanker disaster 
while stevens was joined by other senators who suggested that 
the president order a greater federal involvement in the cleanup in 
alaskas prince william sound skinner and admiral paul yost the 
commandant of the us coast guard cautioned against turning 
control of the effort over to the federal government 
i am not prepared to federalize this spill yost told the 
senate commerce committee adding that such a move might leave an 
opening for exxon to close their checkbook and force the 
government to assume cleanup costs 
he said the coast guard has just 3 million or so in the fund 
that would be used for such a task only enough for a few days 
that concern was not shared by stevens who said that the 
government could still tap an industry disaster fund of up to 100 
million to cover the costs and that exxon likely would not be 
relieved of liabilities in any event 
nevertheless yost said the coast guard was planning to assume 
greater direction over exxon corp in deciding how to go about the 
cleanup what equipment to use and what the priorities should be 
were going to do much more coordination and guidance yost 
said acknowledging that alaska gov steve cowper had asked for 
greater coast guard involvement in a letter received monday night 
lg rawls chairman of exxon corp told the senate panel that 
the petroleum giant will continue doing all we can to clean up 
and mitigate the spills effects 
were chasing the oil were doing what we can said the 
exxon chief executive 
meanwhile a group of republican congressmen said bush should 
become more directly involved in the matter and put a federal 
agency in overall charge of the effort 
at a news conference called by the house republican research 
committee rep jim saxton of new jersey said he has received 
offers from people willing to travel to alaska to help but has not 
found any government agency that can provide information on what 
steps such volunteers should take 
while the debate continued on what steps need to be taken to 
protect wildlife fish and the ecology of prince william sound 
officials agreed the early response to the march 24 accident in 
which the exxon valdez supertanker ran aground spilling more than 
10 million gallons of oil was largely bungled and probably was 
inadequate even if events had run more smoothly 
william reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency told the senate panel the petroleum industrys emergency 
reaction plan and the environmental impact analysis in connection 
with the alaskan pipeline did not contemplate such a massive spill 
skinner said that while all is being done now that can be done 
to deal with the spill the response on the first two days after 
the accident was inadequate they hadnt planned for a catstrophe 
of this magnitude he told the senators 
the contingency plan for example called for booms to be put 
around the stricken tanker within five hours but the booms were 
not in place until 12 hours after the accident and then did not 
hold because of strong winds yost said 
sen john kerry dmass said the basic response plan was 
faulty noting that when it was developed the largest oil spill 
anticipated was 74000 barrels the oil that gushed from the exxon 
valdez was more than three times that amount and came out at a rate 
of 50000 barrels an hour according to administration officials

to the visit and reported no disagreement with prime minister 
margaret thatcher beyond gorbachevs friendly correction of her 
estimate of how long they had talked 
a commentary in the government newspaper izvestia however 
combined praise for mrs thatchers recent statement that the cold 
war is over with a review of issues that remain in contention 
columnists a krivopalov and m sturua wrote that each side 
questions the others performance on human rights 
they said izvestias london bureau frequently has its attention 
called to british conduct in northern ireland and to allegedly 
unjust convictions by british courts 
krivopalov and sturua accused sir geoffrey howe the british 
foreign secretary of playing political games 
on the 40th anniversary of the nato they wrote howe allowed 
himself remarks which clearly carry the flavor of the old days he 
once again spoke about the russian bear which he said represents 
a military threat to the west 
in truth they declared recent polls indicate most britons 
perceive the soviet threat as much smaller since gorbachev came to 
power in 1985

restrained by discriminatory measures introduced by the british 
authorities on various soviet products by the ban on export to the 
ussr of contemporary industrial equipment and the newest

accompanying the complaint was an acknowledgment that the 
lethargic and ponderous soviet financial system also is at fault 
despite their differences britain and the soviet union are part

culture 
in a report on his stop at a communications firm that does 
business with the soviet union the agency said british people 
are not yet satisfied with the rate of growth in trade between

the operator of the transalaska oil 
pipeline terminal announced thursday that it will immediately 
require random drug and alcohol testing on all vessels using the 
terminal 
the action was one of several announced by alyeska pipeline 
service co a consortium of seven oil companies that owns and 
operates the valdez terminal and the 800mile pipeline alyeska has 
been criticized for its slow response to the nations worst oil 
spill 
the tanker exxon valdez took on a load at valdez on march 24 and 
hours later ran aground releasing more than 10 million gallons of 
crude oil into prince william sound the ships captain joseph 
hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while drunk 
alyeska said in a news release that it would require tanker 
owners and operators to institute random drug and alcohol testing 
it also said it would require tugboat escorts for all entering and 
departing vessels to a point beyond bligh reef where the exxon 
valdez ran aground 
the state this week drafted an emergency order that if signed 
would require alyeska immediately to take several steps to correct 
problems with its oilspill response program some of those steps 
including the purchase of additional booms dispersants and other 
cleanup equipment were included in alyeskas announcement thursday 
dennis kelso commissioner of the state department of 
environmental conservation was expected to sign the order deputy 
commissioner amy kyle said 
the draft order sharply criticizes alyeskas initial response to 
the spill saying it failed to comply with its spill contingency 
plan and took too long to deploy equipment the order says 
continued operation of alyeskas marine terminal and tanker 
traffic at the current crudeoil flow rate creates a substantial 
risk of an additional oil spill in the sound 
alyeska said a task force of oil company officials will make 
additional recommendations to improve spill response 
we sincerely regret the environmental tragedy in prince 
william sound and pledge to do everything feasible to prevent 
another such accident from happening the news release said a 
painful lesson has been learned

a house subcommittee voted thursday to end the 
remaining price controls on natural gas in 1993 
a decade ago the action of the energy and power subcommittee of 
the house energy and commerce committee would have followed battles 
between consuming and producing states 
memories of those battles led congress and its committees to 
ignore the reagan administrations almost annual requests for 
removal of controls 
thursday it took only 12 minutes for the subcommittee to 
approve by voice vote and without dissent the bill sponsored by 
22 of its 23 members 
a previous decontrol episode in 1985 saw prices collapse 
confounding predictions of a pocketbookbashing flyup of 
prices many analysts now believe gas prices are determined by oil 
prices because many industrial users can switch between the two 
most believe decontrol will have little immediate effect if 
demand does not increase as ceiling prices frequently are well 
above spot prices 
the last major gas pricing battle in congress came in 1978 when 
harsh winters diversion of gas into unregulated intrastate markets 
and soaring oil prices all combined to curtail gas deliveries to 
the midwest and northeast 
to encourage new production congress enacted several different 
prices for gas according to source such as tight sands or very 
deep wells and permitted those prices to rise with inflation it 
also provided that much of that gas would be decontrolled in 1985 
as it was 
but gas from existing wells was to remain under price controls 
that gas is a smaller percentage of the supply every year and today 
is 25 percent to 30 percent of gas flowing through pipelines 
according to the natural gas supply association 
since 1985 the federal energy regulatory commission has 
declared that the ceiling price of certain gas could rise to the 
price of the most expensive category 
that ceiling price which rises with inflation is now 279 per 
thousand cubic feet the march average spot price in major 
producing states according to the newsletter natural gas 
intelligence was 144 some old gas is sold for 30 cents 
the bill does not abrogate contracts some contracts provide for 
market pricing under decontrol but others do not

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev complained 
to prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday that a 2monthold 
us foreign policy review threatens the momentum of arms control 
talks a soviet spokesman said 
president bush ordered the review after he took office in 
january it is still under way and bush has said he will not be 
stampeded by soviet initiatives 
in general we are not happy with the wests answer or maybe 
nonanswer to soviet initiatives in the field of disarmament 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told 
reporters after gorbachev and mrs thatcher met for four hours 
we understand that the new administration needs time to study 
foreign policy because there are new faces there and some of them 
dont know what foreign policy is about he said 
but he said gorbachev told mrs thatcher the soviets dont 
want this pause to become an interval which will lead to losing 
momentum in this process of disarmament 
but still i think overall we must say that the atmosphere for 
disarmament talks is extremely favorable now gerasimov said 
eastwest negotiations began in vienna last month on reducing 
conventional weapons in europe but ussoviet negotiations on 
reducing longrange nuclear weapons have been postponed 
indefinitely 
the reagan administration aimed for a 50 percent reduction in 
strategic nuclear missiles bombers and submarines but an 
agreement was blocked by soviet concerns over the us strategic 
defense initiative and difficulties over verifying compliance with 
an accord 
gerasimov said gorbachev did not specifically ask mrs thatcher 
a staunch us ally to take up the soviet concerns with bush we 
just expressed our concern he said 
asked what the soviets believed was causing the delay in 
formulating us foreign policy gerasimov said his view was that 
the bush administration was trying to please everybody 
the soviets also feel a certain influence of old soviet 
hands like former us secretary of state henry kissinger and 
former us national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski who 
tend to interpret sovietamerican relations in terms of 
confrontation he said

a group of jewish radicals announced thursday 
it would send its members to the occupied west bank to defend 
israeli settlers if prime minister yitzhak shamir orders the 
pullout of his troops from the territories 
the jewish defense league said it had been getting calls from 
settlers concerned that shamir under us pressure would agree to 
pull israeli troops out of the west bank and gaza strip 
shamir is reportedly considering pulling troops out of densely 
populated palestinian areas to ease the tensions that have fueled a 
15month palestinian rebellion that has resulted in more than 400 
arab deaths 
an estimated 70000 jews many of them of american origin live 
in small settlements among the 13 million palestinian inhabitants 
of the territories israeli troops are charged with protecting the 
settlers although most of them also have their own weapons and 
some have conducted vigilante activity against palestinians 
michael shlomich who identified himself as the east coast 
coordinator for the jdl said in a telephone call from boston that 
his organization will not allow the settlers to be slaughtered by 
arab mobs and terrorists 
he said the jdl which in the 1960s and 1970s allegedly carried 
out attacks on arabs and russians in the united states would send 
highly trained people in riot control to protect the settlers 
if the troops leave

a us review panel has recommended upholding 
israels trading privileges with the united states rejecting a 
suit filed by an arabamerican group sources said thursday 
the ruling by the office of the us trade representative has 
been submitted to president bush for his approval and an 
announcement is expected next week the agency said 
a spokeswoman for the trade representative declined to discuss 
the panels findings but other officials said a complaint filed 
against israeli labor practices by an the americanarab 
antidiscrimination committee last year had been rejected 
the committee which lobbies for the rights of arabamericans 
last year accused israel of violating international labor and 
unionprotection laws for thousands of palestinians who work in 
israel and in its occupied territories 
according to us law israel stood to lose trading privileges 
it enjoys under the general system of preferences which grants 
dozens of countries the right to export products to the united 
states free of duties 
the united states agreed to investigate the complaint along 
with petitions against haiti liberia malaysia and syria and held 
hearings late last year 
the trade panel found that israel had taken steps in recent 
months to rectify some violations of workers rights 
the panel declined to rule on the complaint about israeli 
practices in the occupied west bank and gaza citing us policy of 
not recognizing israels legal rights over the predominantly arab 
land said another source who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
that ruling was based on a recommendation from the state 
departments legal adviser said the source 
abdeen jabara who heads the adc said that the very fact that 
hearings were held on israels labor practices toward palestinians 
was an important and positive thing because it raises the 
consciousness of how palestinians are treated by israel 
he said the finding that some rights had been violated means 
that israel has not been given a clean bill of health

julie derwinsky of the coalition for a diverse faculty based at 
berkeley said the group mailed organizing materials about a month 
ago to student organizations at several dozen schools

money she said

a lie detector test disproves claims by rock 
hudsons estate that the late actors homosexual lover had sex with 
another man after filing a landmark aids lawsuit an attorney 
argued thursday 
attorney harold rhoden said the test indicated his client marc 
christian was being truthful when he denied having sex with 
gunther fraulob a singer and songwriter who came forward with 
claims of an affair after a jury awarded christian 2175 million 
an attorney for hudsons estate james parker mills said 
results of a lie detector test taken by fraulob showed he too was 
being truthful 
mills said fraulobs test was taken before the estate filed 
papers saying his evidence was relevant to the case 
mills who had challenged christian to take a similar test 
acknowledged that neither test was admissible in court and should 
not be considered by superior court judge bruce geernaert in 
deciding whether to grant a new trial or to reduce the jurys award 
to christian as requested by hudsons estate 
both sides were in court thursday for legal arguments on the 
request a hearing is scheduled for friday 
jurors in february found that hudson engaged in outrageous 
conduct by concealing from christian that he had aids the 
panelists who had heard seven weeks of often lurid testimony about 
the dead stars sex life said christian should receive 145 
million in actual damages and 725 million in punitive damages 
after the verdict fraulob of laguna niguel filed a sworn 
statement claiming he had sex with christian shortly after 
christian sued in november 1985 christian contends he was so 
traumatized that he has remained celibate since learning hudson had 
aids 
the twist that made christians suit so unusual was that he did 
not develop aids and has tested negative for the disease in 
previous lawsuits only those who actually contracted a sexually 
transmitted disease were able to win damages 
christian 35 sued for emotional distress saying he had lived 
with the fear of coming down with the deadly disease since learning 
in 1985 that the movie star had aids 
hudson 58 died on oct 5 1985 three months after the public 
learned that he had the disease

backers of a bill to curb the amount of 
commercials shown on tv shows for children said thursday that 
broadcasters have stepped up the pitches on such programs since ad 
limits were lifted five years ago 
kids are being exposed to as much as 42 percent more toy cereal 
and candy advertising per hour than adults as advertisers target 
a particularly vulnerable audience rep edward markey 
dmass told a house hearing 
an independent station in boston is inserting as many as 14 
minutes of commericals into each hour of kids shows compared with 
an average eight minutes for adult network programs markey told 
the house energy and commerce telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee that he chairs 
we have a duty to see to it that this child audience is 
protected from wave after wave of exploitive commercials he said 
prior to 1984 when the federal communications commission lifted 
commercial limits on kids tv shows the amount of ads on network 
childrens programs was at or below the 9 minuteperhour rules 
that the fcc had established in 1974 markey said 
since 1984 commercial time has been on the rise with 
stations at two of the networks now offering as many as 11 minutes 
per hour of commercial matter he said 
markey said the government must stem endless streams of tv 
commercials on childrens shows because broadcasters are not 
regulating themselves 
but glenn wright speaking for the national association of 
broadcasters said an nab survey found childrens programs 
contained an average of about 8 minutes of commerical time per 
hour 
he said that there does not appear to be a deluge of 
commercials raining down upon the viewers of childrens 
programming 
wright also said programlength commercials made by advertisers 
have not done well the child audience has made distinctions 
between program content and commercial content and on its own has 
avoided a deluge of commercials he said 
but rep jim slattery dkan said it was naive to think 
the marketplace would regulate itself he said money drives the 
television business and that about 80 percent of network 
programming is unmitigated crap 
slattery said the networks werent meeting their 
responsibilities to children and the government should put as 
much pressure as possible on them 
slattery said the bill will not affect responsible broadcasters 
one iota 
the bill would impose a limit of 10 minutes of advertising per 
hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays for kids 
shows the legislation written in cooperation with nab and the 
association of independent television stations also would require 
the fcc at licenserenewal time to consider how well a broadcaster 
has been committed to educational and informational needs of 
children in its overall programming 
congress passed an identical bill last year but thenpresident 
reagan vetoed it on constitutional grounds 
dewitt helm president of the association of national 
advertisers told the subcommittee he also thought the measure was 
unconstitutional and that less advertising might mean lowerquality 
shows 
program producers must have the flexibility to determine how 
best to balance the entertainment needs of the audience with the 
financial requirements of good programming helm said

kraft inc unintentionally advertised falsely 
that its kraft singles cheese slices contain as much calcium as 
five ounces of milk and more than imitation cheese according to a 
ruling of a federal trade commission administrative law judge 
released thursday 
kraft said it did not believe the ads were misleading and would 
appeal the ruling to the full commission 
one of the challenged ads said imitation slices use hardly 
any milk but kraft has five ounces per slice so her little bones 
get calcium they need to grow 
the judge lewis f parker said the ad implied that the slice 
contained as much calcium as five ounces of milk and did not 
mention that 30 percent of the calcium in the milk is lost in 
processing 
also he said the ads can be taken as implying that imitation 
slices which they state use hardly any milk contain less calcium 
than kraft singles 
in fact almost all imitation and nondairy cheese contains just 
as much calcium as the real thing he said 
however kraft did not intend to make misrepresentations and 
it was debatable whether the company should have known that 
false claims could be inferred from the ads he said 
the advertisements were developed by kraft in response to 
the success of nondairy imitation and substitute cheese slices 
and were not intended to convey express deceptive claims 
he ordered the company not to misrepresent the nutritional 
content of its cheese slices in the future 
in glenview ill company spokesman gene stevenson said kraft 
was pleased that the judge recognized there was no intent on the 
part of kraft to mislead the public 
copy testing that weve done demonstrates that consumers do 
not receive the implied message as stated in parkers ruling 
stevenson said 
kraft is confident that the integrity of the advertising will 
be upheld by the commission he said 
bruce silverglade attorney for science in the public interest 
the advocacy group which asked the commission to look into the 
matter in 1985 said he was pleased with the decision 
it may represent a reawakening of the federal government to 
problems of misleading health claims in food advertising he said

canadian environmentalists expressed concern 
thursday over the alaskan oil spill despite repeated predictions 
from top government officials that it wont reach the british 
columbia coast 
even if it doesnt reach our shores our wildlife that we 
share with alaska already is affected greatly oceanographer 
silvaine zimmermann of the activist group greenpeace said in a 
phone interview from vancouver british columbia 
leading environmental groups also say that even if the oil from 
the largest spill ever in the united states or canada doesnt reach 
british columbia this time the exxon valdez incident illustrates 
that an accident closer to home is inevitable 
the spill which has prompted parliamentary debate in ottawa is 
about 650 miles from canadian waters and doesnt threaten to change 
course toward the south according to the federal fisheries 
environment and transportation ministers 
fisheries minister tom siddon returned to the lobby of 
parliament on wednesday with a map of alaska and his account that 
the spill wont affect canada 
however james fulton who represents in the house of commons 
british columbias northwestern skeena district closest to the 
spill said his information was that the slick is only about 250 
miles away 
that information is clear beyond a reasonable doubt fulton 
said during the emergency debate he requested tuesday night he is 
the environment critic for the socialist new democratic party the 
third largest national party in canada 
fulton said canada must be prepared to handle the spill if the 
winds should change he called it a monster now starting to come 
out of the sound and with pieces breaking off 
if the wind changes direction and picks up parts of the slick 
will reach british columbia we can always hope that the wind 
doesnt blow he said 
the presence of supertankers in the sea lanes off of british 
columbia has been a longtime subject of debate in canada 
ms zimmermann said some people consider the possibility of an 
eventual disaster off of the canadian coast as a mathematical 
certainty not a statistical probability 
she said that the wildlife shared with alaska includes the 
parent stocks of sea mammals such as sea otters she also expressed 
concern about the gray whales that are migrating north from their 
winter zones off of mexicos baja california coast 
the opposition liberal party also supported the new democrats 
call during the parliamentary debate for a federal inquiry into the 
safety of coastal tanker shipping 
parliament returned to session this week after a threemonth 
recess following the election last fall of a second consecutive 
majority government of prime minister brian mulroneys progressive 
conservative party

the justice department is studying a proposal 
that would allow authorities to summarily exclude aliens seeking 
political asylum without giving them a hearing before an 
immigration judge officials said thursday 
under a plan drafted by the immigration and naturalization 
service specially trained ins hearing officers would conduct 
informal proceedings to consider an aliens claim for asylum status 
one critic of the proposal said it would obliterate fairness 
and due process for asylum seekers that is now provided by 
immigration law 
the proposal which is still under study would provide for 
summary exclusion of aliens who seek asylum at ports of entry who 
fail to make a credible showing of eligibility according to an 
internal justice department analysis of the plan 
this should discourage those who are claiming asylum but in 
fact have no legitimate right to this status from attempting to 
enter the united states under this claim according to the 
document 
people seeking asylum must demonstrate a wellfounded fear of 
persecution for a variety of factors including ethnic background 
and political or religious beliefs 
the proposal to amend current immigration law would require 
approval by congress 
it was drafted by ins in the wake of the flood of central 
americans crossing the border from mexico into texas over the last 
10 months 
most were denied political asylum on the ground that they were 
fleeing poverty not political persecution 
gregory j leo director of legislative affairs for ins said 
the proposal was in an early stage of review 
he described the plan as a legislative proposal that has been 
generated at a staff level and circulated to various divisions of 
the justice department including the office of attorney general 
dick thornburgh 
it was drafted as a possible solution to the misuse or abuse 
of the asylum process by central americans who come to the border 
without a legal claim for political asylum status leo said 
the present system allows an alien to make successive 
applications to the district ins director and to an immigration 
judge leading to a timeconsuming process the departments 
analysis said 
an adverse ruling by the immigration judge can be appealed to 
the board of immigration appeals and thence to federal circuit 
courts of appeal a process that could extend an aliens stay for 
many months 
the draft proposal would eliminate the hearing mechanism for 
aliens at ports of entry who are denied political asylum 
there are people who would use the asylum process as a means 
of staying here even though they are not qualified leo said 
but arthur c helton director of the political asylum project 
of the nonprofit lawyers committee for human rights said the plan 
would obliterate fairness and due process for most asylum 
seekers 
this would be a very serious attack on asylum as a means of 
entering the country he said 
it would affect thousands of people arriving at the border 
helton said 
in the 1988 fiscal year 60000 people sought asylum and if 
current rates continue the total for the current year will be more 
than 100000 helton said 
the draft legislation also contains a provision that would 
increase by 5000 the number of refugee visas that would be granted 
in the 1989 fiscal year for aliens from central american nations 
anyone seeking refugee status must apply in their own country 
by increasing the number of visas by 5000 authorities hope to 
encourage central americans to apply at us embassies in their 
home countries according to the draft 
ins is currently authorized to admit 3500 eligible refugees 
from central america in the current fiscal year 
the ins proposal would abolish the right of aliens pressing 
claims at immigrationcourt hearings to be represented by an 
attorney when an alien is examined by an ins officer an attorney 
could act as an adviser but could not be an advocate presenting 
evidence 
the officers determination would be administratively final 
but could be overruled by the attorney general or the ins 
commissioner the proposal said 
the influx of refugees from central america across the texas 
border over the last 10 months prompted ins to set up a detention 
facility for people awaiting immigration court hearings 
on wednesday 2150 refugees were being detained at the ins 
facility in port isabel texas a total of 4340 refugees were 
being detained at various ins locations in texas the agency said 
aliens denied political aslyum are given the choice of returning 
to mexico of facing detention while they await the outcome of 
immigration court proceedings 
the crisis stemmed from an upsurge in asylum applications at the 
border crossing from the normal monthly total of about 400 to 5000 
a month between june 1988 and feb 1 
the flow was reduced after ins imposed emergency procedures 
enabling oneday processing of asylum applications at port isabel 
the proposal would also eliminate the right to apply for 
political asylum at any point during a deportation proceeding 
aliens would be required to file a notice of intent to file such an 
application two weeks after the start of deportation proceedings 
the applicant would then have another 30 days to file the papers 
if the deadlines were missed a political asylum claim would be 
allowed only if the alien showed changed circumstances in his 
home country would make him qualified

the bush administration moved thursday to 
widen americas gate for the unexpected flood of jews armenians 
and pentecostals allowed to emigrate from the soviet union but it 
still faced stiff criticism for the bureaucratic barriers which 
have thwarted that exodus so far 
state department officials formally notified congress that 
president bush intends to raise from 25000 to 43500 the refugee 
admissions ceiling this year for applicants from the soviet union 
moreover they advanced legislation to create a new special 
immigrant category to accommodate up to 30000 additional 
applicants 
but those initiatives didnt spare the administration from being 
lambasted on capitol hill where several lawmakers charged that 
us footdragging on the refugee issue remains a major 
embarrassment to a nation which after all has fought for years to 
convince moscow to loosen its emigration policy 
rep bruce a morrison dconn chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on immigration said the slow pace in which 
applications have been handled and in many cases denied runs the 
risk of destroying a tremendous victory for bipartisan foreign 
policy in short lets not blow it 
morrison and several other members of congress already had 
fashioned alternative legislative measures designed to speed entry 
into the united states by the nearly 8000 soviet citizens half of 
them jews seeking refugee visas each month bushs 
counterproposals were served up just as the panel began hearings 
on those measures 
meanwhile another panel the house appropriations subcommittee 
on foreign operations approved the administrations request for 
100 million in supplemental money this year to help pay for the 
increase in refugee processing 
at morrisons hearing rep barney frank dmass noted that at 
one point after soviet president mikhail gorbachev eased emigration 
restrictions in late 1987 the us embassy in moscow only had one 
person assigned to handle the refugee applications and the state 
department told us that was the consequence of appropriations 
constraints frank snapped it was one of the three silliest 
things the state department has ever said strong competition 
notwithstanding 
according to the council of jewish federations more than 7000 
jews are stalled in vienna and rome awaiting processing by the 
immigration and naturalization service thousands of others still 
in the soviet union have been told it could take as long as two 
years to get an initial screening interview at the us embassy in 
moscow the council says 
despite franks persistent questioning jonathan moore us 
coordinator for refugee affairs declined to say whether the 
consular and immigration staffs in moscow would be substantially 
beefed up noting there are mutual limits on the size of each 
countrys missions but he suggested part of the problem in moscow 
may be eased by forwarding some of the paperwork to other us 
offices for completion 
the last major soviet emigration to the united states occurred 
nearly 10 years ago when 28400 people came as refugees for the 
next seven years relatively few soviets were permitted to 
emigrate but it remained a matter of us policy to grant 
automatic refugee status to any soviet citizen who got out and 
asked entry into america 
following gorbachevs policy change more than 20400 soviet 
refugees were admitted to the united states last fiscal year an 
almost sixfold increase over the 1987 figure and a tide that caught 
us officials off guard to the dismay of many refugee groups and 
members of congress the ins then switched gears and began denying 
on a casebycase basis refugee visas to a substantial number of 
applicants such denials are based on findings that the applicant 
has not demonstrated a wellfounded fear of persecution 
the general accounting office said thursday that a total of 
4919 soviets had been denied refugee status from october 1988 
through march 31 in that period 11783 people were approved in 
vienna and rome while 2073 were denied at those embassies 
meanwhile 13568 were approved at the moscow embassy and 4919 
were denied there 
virtually all of the jews and pentecostals leaving the soviet 
union are doing so with israeli visas but instead of going on to 
israel the vast majority about 95 percent stop in vienna or 
rome to apply for us visas armenian emigres on the other hand 
constitute most of the refugee applicants applying directly at the 
us embassy in moscow 
bushs latest proposal would create a new discretionary 
category of special immigrants as selected from time to time by 
the president they could become citizens and would have other 
rights and benefits shared by refugees 
rep gerry sikorski dminn said the special immigrant 
idea certainly does not address the longterm difficulties of 
increased immigration of refugees from the soviet union 
ins commissioner alan c nelson insisted our soviet program is 
still one of the most generous of all immigration programs and 
we wish to make it clear that absolutely no soviet seeking relief 
is forced to return to the soviet union

president bush extended economic sanctions 
against panama for one year on thursday calling the government of 
military leader manuel antonio noriega corrupt repressive and 
inept 
in an executive order bush said that the actions and policies 
of the noriega regime in panama continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the united states 
sanctions put in place by the reagan administration were to 
expire on saturday bush notified congress he was retaining them 
for an additional year 
however the sanctions could be modified depending on the 
outcome of panamas may 7 presidential election after the 
election well take a look at the situation there and see if 
theres any cause for change said an administration official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
if the panamanian people have a chance to express their will 
in a free and open manner were confident noriega will go said 
the official however he conceced that prospects for a fair 
election were uncertain in that noriega appears likely to control 
the process 
the sanctions include sharp restrictions on us companies that 
do business in panama a hold on assets of the panamanian 
government in the united state and a prohibitation on tax payments 
by us organizations to the noriega regime 
the objective of administration policy remains support for a 
return to civilian constitutional rule and the development of an 
apolitical military establishment in panama bush told congress 
our judgment remains that the root cause of the current crisis 
is the fact that the panamanian people have lost confidence in a 
political system widely perceived as corrupt repressive and 
inept 
bush said he would keep the sanctions in place as long as 
these measures are appropriate they will automatically expire 
april 8 1990 unless he renews them again 
noriega who is accused in a federal drugrunning case in miami 
has been the de facto ruler of panama since february 1988 when he 
orchestrated the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle 
delvalle had tried to fire noriega as military leader after 
noriega was indicted in florida on us drugtrafficking charges 
noriega denied the charges washington continues to recognize 
delvalle as president and imposed the sanctions against panama in 
an effort to force noriega out 
the reagan administration cut off military and economic aid to 
panama in july 1987 
the administration has amended the sanctions to permit us 
businesses with subsidiaries in panama to pay amounts owed to the 
government of panama including taxes withheld from paychecks of 
workers in panama into escrow accounts in us banks 
bushs message to congress said that 170 us companies with 
subsidiaries in panama are being notified by letter of these 
changes 
information received from panama indicates that certain us 
firms with operations in panama may have faiiled to withhold 
panamanian taxes from employee paychecks in possible violation of 
the regulations bushs statement said

savings and loan customers withdrew 94 
billion from their accounts in february down only slightly from a 
record 106 billion in january the government said thursday 
the 20 billion withdrawn during the first two months of this 
year is more than double the 86 billion for all of last year and 
puts new pressure on congress to move swiftly as it begins writing 
legislation to close or merge failed sampls 
james barth chief economist of the federal home loan bank 
board attributed the outflow to the failure of sampls to keep pace 
with rising interest rates offered by competitors chiefly money 
market mutual funds 
but in recent weeks top administration officials including 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady has been citing the outflow 
as evidence of public nervousness that will persist until congress 
adopts president bushs proposal to spend 50 billion over the next 
three years to bail out the industry 
february marks the 10th straight month of net withdrawals and 
the fourth month of withdrawals in excess of 7 billion earlier 
from october 1987 though may of last year billions of dollars 
flowed into sampls as stock market investors sought the safety of 
federally insured accounts 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said sampls as a substitute for deposits were turning increasingly 
toward advances from the federal home loan banks a trend he called 
disturbing 
although the 12 regional banks are controlled by the industry 
they borrow in financial markets and relend to sampls at low 
governmentsubsidized rates advances from the system have 
increased by 158 billion from october to february 
it disturbs me that the banks are being looked to so heavily 
by the thrifts it represents more and more of a growing government 
involvement in the entire industry ely said

the federal election commission warned 
congress thursday that the fund used to finance presidential 
elections is running dry because americans are less inclined to 
earmark 1 of their tax payment for it 
unless the system is modified by 1996 the fund will lack 
sufficient monies to finance the presidential elections fec 
chairman danny mcdonald said in a letter to the house and senate 
appropriations committees 
meanwhile two democratic lawmakers introduced legislation that 
would require candidates who are eligible to receive public funds 
in the general election campaign to agree in writing to participate 
in at least four 90minute debates the vice presidential nominees 
would be required to engage in at least one debate 
if presidential candidates are going to continue to take 100 
million from taxpayers to run their campaigns then there ought to 
be some assurance that they will stand up on stage face their 
opponent and engage in a true discussion of the issues said rep 
edward j markey dmass who introduced the legislation with sen 
bob graham dfla 
under the proposal the debates would be sponsored by 
nonpartisan organizations and held in september and october at 
least 30 minutes of each 90minute debate would be devoted to 
questions and answers or candidatetocandidate exchanges 
the federal election commission would determine whether 
candidates are responsible for failing to comply 
taxpayer contributions which come from checking a 1 
contribution box on tax returns have been declining because 
according to markey each year fewer and fewer think theyre 
getting their dollars worth 
the percentage of taxpayers contributing to the presidential 
election campaign fund has dropped steadily from 287 percent in 
1981 to 21 percent in 1988 according to the ongressional research 
service 
once overflowing the campaign fund is falling victim to 
inflation as well as a dropoff in income 
fec spokesman fred eiland said the peak year was 41 million 
earmarked on returns filed in 1981 on returns filed last year 
only 33 million was earmarked for the election fund 
the fund is the source for the matching contributions the fec 
allocates to candidates for the major party nominations as well as 
the lump sum payments made to the nominees for the general 
elections campaign 
in 1988 republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis 
received federal checks for 461 million each for their fall 
campaigns in addition each party received 92 million 
the fec also paid out a total of 667 million in matching 
funds the commission matches up to 250 in individual 
contributions to qualified presidential candidates during the 
primary campaign 
republican pat robertson received 101 million in matching 
funds the largest amount of any presidential candidate dukakis 
was second with 9 million and bush third with 84 million 
the fund paid out a total of 177 million in 1988 the first 
year it operated was 1976 when 70 million was distributed to 
candidates 
eiland said the fund is expected to have enough money to cover 
the 1992 election assuming president bush has no serious opposition 
for the gop nomination

a federal police report quoted in 
the official press on thursday expressed concern that some ethnic 
albanians could stage guerrilla warfare against federal authorities 
in troubled kosovo province 
bloody clashes between ethnic albanians and security forces left 
at least 24 people dead in kosovo last week including two 
policemen and 200 injured 
ethnic albanians who comprise about 85 percent of kosovos 
population took to the streets to protest constitutional changes 
which they say limit the provinces autonomy 
the changes took effect march 28 and gave yugoslavias largest 
republic of serbia more control over kosovos judiciary schools 
and police 
some ethnic albanians announced they would flee into the 
woods which indicates yugoslavia is faced with a danger of 
separatist guerrilla warfare the staterun borba daily quoted 
the police report as saying 
according to the report about 45000 ethnic albanians took part 
in last weeks riots in kosovo a state of emergency and curfews 
were introduced there in a crackdown against the protests 
borba quoted a police officer as saying 16 major fires hit 
forests and factories in the province since april 1 and described 
the fires as terrorist diversions by ethnic albanian 
nationalists 
the vecernje novosti newspaper said a major highway leading from 
the provincial capital of pristina to urosevac was closed for more 
than two hours wednesday because unknown people tried to plant 
explosives on the road 
a kosovo police statement meanwhile confirmed unofficial reports 
that two ethnic albanian boys were killed on wednesday 
it said they were shot by another ethnic albanian youth playing 
with a rifle said to belong to a soldier guarding a military 
observation post 
the statement gave no other details the incident reportedly 
occurred in malisevo village about 25 miles southwest of pristina 
on the political front media reports said thursday that serbia 
rejected a public call for introducing democratic elections with 
competing candidates and proposed its communist party chief 
slobodan milosevic for the office of the republics president 
serbias socialist alliance a communistrun umbrella 
organization on wednesday turned down a proposal that milosevic 
the sole official candidate for president be elected by public 
ballot 
slovenia yugoslavias most liberal republic held its first 
westernstyle general elections last sunday featuring two 
candidates and a secret ballot for its representative on the 
countrys collective presidency 
janez drnovsek a 38yearold economist advocating closer ties 
with the west a market economy and cuts in the military budget 
was elected by 56 percent of the votes cast 
he is to be inaugurated as yugoslavias next president on may 
15 under the countrys rotating system in which presidency members 
take turns every year at the head of the state presidency 
slovenia has led the drive for more democracy in this 
communistruled state and has allowed several noncommunist human 
rights and political groups to function freely 
serbia led by hardliner milosevic insists on the oneparty 
system as the main solution to the countrys problems 
we will choose milosevic according to valid constitutional 
norms said bogdan trifunovic head of the serbian socialist 
alliance according to the borba newspaper 
under the yugoslav system the socialist alliance in each of the 
countrys six republics and two provinces is in charge of 
nominating candidates for government posts

the food and drug administration was told 
thursday that home aidstest kits are safe and could save thousands 
of lives but the agency questioned whether the test manufacturers 
could provide adequate counseling and privacy 
at a daylong hearing at the national institutes of health the 
developer of an aids hometesting kit that failed to win fda 
approval criticized the agencys decision saying it was the result 
of politics not scientific judgment 
untold thousands have become infected with the aids virus 
simply because theres no aids home test available said elliott 
j millenson a rockville md consultant who formed a company to 
develop and sell a bloodcollection kit 
so long as politics not science guides government action 
on aids people will die needlessly he said 
the fda has been reluctant to approve aids hometesting kits 
because of concern over whether people can safely draw their own 
blood and ship samples safely to a lab for testing and whether the 
samples can remain viable during shipping they also are concerned 
about whether testers can assure confidentiality and whether test 
suppliers can provide adequate counseling especially for those who 
test positive for the deadly virus 
the agency last year rejected millensons proposed hometesting 
kit and said it would consider for approval only tests designed for 
use by medical professionals in traditional health care settings 
paul parkman director of the fdas center for biologics 
evaluation and research who conducted the hearing said the agency 
will continue to consider evidence on the hometesting issue but 
added i dont see theres been a lot of change since the fdas 
decision a year ago 
millenson said the fda has refused to study the evidence 
that backs up his claim that the test his company developed is 
safe effective and would incorporate adequate education and 
counseling of those using it 
millensons hometesting kit included a device for drawing 
blood a crushproof shipping container for blood samples and a 
detailed instruction booklet users would draw their own blood 
send the sample in a prepaid shipping envelope to a laboratory and 
be informed of the results by telephone by trained healthcare 
professionals he said 
howard markman a denver psychologist who was a consultant for 
millensons project dismissed the fdas fears that telephone 
counseling for those who test positive for the lethal virus will 
not be adequate he said studies have shown that telephone 
counseling has effects comparable to facetoface counseling 
markman criticized the fdas resistance to home testing for aids 
and said the agency appears to be saying that if this is out of 
the hands of the medical community thats not good 
it makes me wonder whether theres a turf issue thats a 
hidden agenda he said

tamil militants on thursday blew up a 
truck carrying indian troops in northern sri lanka killing at 
least 18 of them military officials said six more soldiers were 
killed later in a gunbattle with the fleeing guerrillas residents 
said 
militants using remote controlled devices detonated explosives 
buried in the road as the truck passed over it at mankulam village 
26 miles north of vavuniya town military officials said at least 
five soldiers were injured they said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
an official of the indian high commission or embassy in 
colombo said he was unaware of the killings 
indian troops searching for the guerrillas were ambushed by 
the militants and six soldiers were killed in the ensuing gunbattle 
at the nearby maharambakulam village said residents in vavuniya 
town 135 miles north of colombo 
the residents who were contacted by telephone spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the militants believed to be members of the dominant liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam group took away 15 rifles and a light 
machine gun after blowing up the truck officials said 
india deployed nearly 50000 troops after tamil militants 
spurned an indiasponsored peace accord signed in july 1987 and 
aimed at ending a tamil insurgency in the northern and eastern 
provinces 
at least 800 indian soldiers have been killed in the operations 
against the rebels who refused to surrender their arms saying the 
accord did not meet enough of their demands for self rule 
india sponsored the accord because of the sympathies of its own 
60 million tamils to the rebel cause 
the 6yearold tamil secessionist war and a violent sinhalese 
backlash have claimed more than 12500 lives 
the latest violence came barely 24 hours after the government 
announced a unilateral oneweek ceasefire beginning tuesday 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said wednesday it the 
ceasefire will be a unilateral declaration by the government and 
will cover military operations by both sri lanka and indian armies 
against sinhalese and tamil terrorists 
the government on thursday also released 13 political prisoners 
as part of a peace proposal offered to tamils and sinhalese 
militants 
after receiving a pardon from president ranasinghe premadasa 
the prisoners walked out of a maximumsecurity prison about three 
miles east of colombo 
the prisoners were tamils convicted under antiterrorist laws 
and serving sentences ranging from five to 15 years said 
velupillai balakumar the president of the eelam revolutionary 
organization a tamil group 
last week premadasa offered tamil and sinhalese militants 
unconditional amnesty seats in parliament and money for 
surrendered weapons if they stopped fighting 
neither sinhalese militants nor the tamil rebels have responded 
positively to the peace overtures 
on wednesday sinhalese militants called a nationwide strike to 
commemorate a failed uprising against the government 18 years ago 
the strike was viewed as a rejection of the peace offer 
meanwhile two opposition leaders said the ceasefire 
announcement would not be fruitful unless the government held 
negotiations with extremist leaders 
sinhalese militants started the current campaign to bring down 
the government after the july 1987 peace accord was signed saying 
it gave too many concessions to the minority community 
the predominantly hindu tamils comprise 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people sinhalese buddhists make up 75 percent 
and control the government and the military 
tamil militants allege their community is discriminated against 
by the sinhalese in jobs and education

news reports said five other people were killed in separate 
incidents by sikhs waging a terror campaign for an independent 
nation in the northern agricultural region the only indian state 
where the sect is in the majority 
ten gunmen entered the farmhouse in kalchian village 25 miles

the soviet union confirmed thursday that it 
delivered fighterbombers to libya last month but said they were 
defensive aircraft and did not have the range to threaten israel 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the total 
was around half a dozen not 12 to 15 as claimed by us 
officials 
the issue appeared to cast a shadow over the otherwise warm 
constructive tone of president mikhail s gorbachevs talks with 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
with washington reports of the bomber sale capturing headlines 
in britain mrs thatcher asked gorbachev for an explanation and 
got none her spokesman said 
her foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe also raised the matter 
with his soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze and shevardnadze 
responded by mentioning british arms sales to saudi arabia 
howe said his government was concerned because libya is a 
terrorist state said the british spokesman who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
gerasimov told a news conference he did not know about the sale 
but later went on television to confirm elements of the report 
while seeking to minimize its significance 
us defense department sources have said the aircraft are su24 
fencers which can fly within an 800mile radius without refueling 
far enough to reach egypt and even israel from existing libyan 
airfields they say the jets were shipped in crated pieces to the 
libyans aboard soviet transport planes 
in interviews on channel 4 news and bbctv gerasimov said the 
planes whose type he did not specify were supplied to libya under 
a 1986 agreement he said it was an old contract not more than 
six were sold and they were shipped in pieces 
this is not a longrange bomber gerasimov said this is a 
bomber that you can use for closer activities its operational 
range is 300 miles 
its a frontline bomber he added its for defense only 
you cannot really use it for offensive purposes 
the interviewer said the planes could refuel in midair and reach 
israel to which gerasimov replied theoretically maybe but 
libya has no refueling capacity at all 
the sale comes at a time when the soviet union is trying to 
improve relations with israel as part of its effort to play a 
greater role in middle east peace efforts 
israel condemned the sale we are surprised that the soviet 
union which states that it seeks to relieve situations of 
confrontations around the world is supplying offensive 
weaponry to libya a foreign ministry spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
this will not add to stability in the middle east said 
foreign minister moshe arens 
on bbc television gerasimov said the planes were delivered in 
march and suggested they would not be operational for some time 
because they were delivered in crates you must put them 
together it takes time and knowhow to do it 
he said the sale to libya is really small fry campared with 
the british contract to sell saudi arabia billions of dollars worth 
of tornado fighterbombers

a group of vietnam veterans flew home from 
southeast asia to a greeting of confetti hugs and kisses thursday 
after building a 14room clinic for their former enemies with 
50000 in donated money 
boy we didnt get a greeting like this when we came back from 
the war said army veteran steve brooks of santa cruz among the 
six volunteers who returned to san francisco international airport 
after nearly four months in vietnam 
the veterans along with about 30 vietnamese they paid 1 a day 
each erected a onestory 2500squarefoot building at vung tau 
some 60 miles from ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
the veterans said they watched with pride saturday while local 
politicians made speeches under us and vietnamese flags in a 
champagnetoasted ceremony to mark the finish of the project 
the unusual mission left richard anderson feeling much better 
about himself than he did after serving a year in vietnam with the 
army corps of engineers 
anderson 41 was the job foreman on what he and his buddies 
called the veterans vietnam restoration project an idea that 
originated with a veterans of foreign wars contingent at 
garberville calif 
it was he said out of a sense of purpose to do 
something kind for the vietnamese people he said but not 
because he felt he had hurt them in the war 
i dont lay that personal guilt on myself anderson 
declared but i have problems secondary to that there was 
something about the vietnamese people i had to do 
anderson said he didnt have to come home from the war to 
conclude as he did that there was something wrong with us 
involvement in vietnam 
in my first three months in vietnam i noticed it was a crazy 
war and it was wrong and that some day we would have to make up for 
it he said 
the volunteers who had collected 50000 in a funding drive 
that began last year were given housing by the vietnamese 
government anderson said but they had to buy their own food and 
other necessities 
they ran into some surprises in building their clinic instead 
of using concrete blocks they had to use small locally made bricks 
the basic design which called for a 1500squarefoot building 
was changed to 2500 square feet at the insistence of local 
politicians 
and every day anderson said he had to deal with local 
officials who had to approve of everything that was to be done 
we brought some tools and experience but we didnt realize we 
couldnt get power to the job site he said we didnt realize 
water was rationed so we couldnt mix materials we didnt realize 
everything had to be done by hand

mikhail s gorbachev and prime minister margaret 
thatcher argued passionately thursday in talks that covered weapons 
sales to the middle east and disarmament officials said 
the leaders described their private morning talks as friendly 
but a british spokesman said they argued energetically over the 
soviets reported sale of longrange bombers to libya or a possible 
negotiated ban on chemical weapons 
a soviet spokesman said gorbachev complained to mrs thatcher a 
staunch us ally that president bushs review of foreign policy 
is threatening to stall the momentum of nuclear arms reduction 
talks 
in a toast at a dinner honoring gorbachev mrs thatcher made 
clear she is unshaken in her belief that at least some nuclear 
weapons are necessary to deter war in europe gorbachev replied he 
could not accept that view 
he said the prime minister considers him a romantic for 
advocating a nuclearfree world but he contended his position 
reflects the harsh realities of our time 
after a wreathlaying ceremony at westminster abbey the soviet 
president stopped his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people 
in a crowd of several hundred showing off the spontaneity that has 
won him popularity in the west 
later he met british businessmen and appealed to them to step up 
trade with the soviet union saying i invite businessmen to act 
and operate on the principle that the brave capture cities 
mrs thatcher emerging from her 10 downing st residence after 
four hours of talks said the meeting was very friendly and covered 
all of the principal topics of the day 
gorbachev said his fifth meeting with the conservative leader 
reached a degree of mutual understanding that enabled them to 
discuss the problems of nuclear arsenals regional conflict and 
specialized sovietbritish matters 
a thatcher spokesman said on condition of anonymity after the 
talks that the two love arguing they have this way of arguing 
very strongly but never losing their tempers 
he also called the discussions extremely frank animated 
warm passionate and solemn 
but there were no indications that the staunchly anticommunist 
prime minister and the reformminded soviet communist party chief 
resolved differences 
the british spokesman said mrs thatcher raised the reported 
sale of soviet longrange bombers to libya saying we are sorry 
you are doing this 
gorbachev did not respond the official said 
interviewed on channel 4 news soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov confirmed bombers were supplied to libya under 
a 1986 agreement but insisted they were shortrange defensive 
aircraft 
he said no more than six were delivered and that their range was 
300 miles not 800 miles as reported in washington they could not 
reach israel without refueling and libya has no refueling 
capacity at all gerasimov said 
you cannot really use it for offensive purposes he said 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze also reportedly clashed over the 
issue shevardnadze did not reply directly but he noted britain is 
a major arms supplier to other middle east countries 
our reply to that is yes but libya is a terrorist state 
the british spokesman said 
at a news conference gerasimov charged that the libyan arms 
deal was leaked in washington just to ruin the atmosphere of 
the sovietbritish summit 
gerasimov also said that prolonged reviews of foreign policy 
could lead to a loss of momentum in disarmament talks 
president bush ordered a review of us foreign policy when he 
took office in january the review is still under way and bush has 
said he will not be stampeded by soviet initiatives such as 
disarmament proposals 
in her toast at dinner mrs thatcher restated her opposition to 
gorbachevs call for total nuclear disarmament by the year 2000 
both our countries know from bitter experience that 
conventional weapons do not deter war in europe whereas nuclear 
weapons have done so for over 40 years she said as a 
deterrent there is no substitute for them 
gorbachev responded he would stick to his proposal 
acknowledging several stages would be necessary before all nuclear 
weapons are eliminated he said mrs thatcher thinks there is a 
good measure of romanticism in this approach i cannot accept 
that 
shevardnadze and howe signed agreements designed to protect 
private business development and make it easier for individuals to 
obtain visas 
the british side also pledged to build a school in 
earthquakestricken soviet armenia for which gorbachev expressed 
gratitude 
gorbachev originally planned to visit britain in december but 
he canceled the trip after the earthquake wrecked cities and killed 
thousands of people 
raisa gorbachev toured st pauls cathedral and visited tower 
bridge for a view of the city through a chilly drizzle 
gorbachev is to address businessmen in a speech friday he then 
goes to windsor castle to see queen elizabeth ii before returning 
to moscow at the end of the sixday tour which also took him to 
ireland and cuba

97 in late august 1986 north reported to admiral poindexter 
that a representative of panamanian leader manuel noriega had asked 
north to meet with him noriegas representative proposed that in 
exchange for a promise from the usg to help clean up noriegas 
image and a commitment to lift the usg ban on military sales to the 
panamanian defense forces noriega would assassinate the sandinista 
leadership for the us government north had told noriegas 
representative that us law forbade such actions the 
representative responded that noriega had numerous assets in place 
in nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as 
noriega had helped the usg the previous year in blowing up a 
sandinista arsenal 
98 north advised admiral poindexter that the british persons 
who had run the operation against the arsenal had used a panamanian 
civilian ordnance expert north noted that noriega had the 
capabilities that he had proffered and that the cost of any 
operations could be borne by project democracy 
99 admiral poindexter responded that if noriega had assets 
inside nicaragua he could be helpful the usg could not be 
involved in assassination but panamanian assistance with sabotage 
would be another story admiral poindexter recommended that north 
speak with noriega directly 
106 in late september 1986 lt col north reported to admiral 
poindexter on his london meeting with noriega noriega would try to 
take immediate actions against the sandinistas and offered a list

nationalist guerrillas in bitter combat thursday as south africa 
angola and cuba arranged emergency talks to salvage the 
unsponsored plan for namibias independence 
there is a crisis in namibia said a state department 
official in washington speaking on condition of anonymity weve 
got a real problem 
chief inspector kierie du rand a south african who heads 
namibia territorial force said 42 guerrillas were killed in 
clashes thursday afternoon including one battle involving scores 
of insurgents an undetermined number of policemen were injured he 
said 
governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said a pitched 
battle raged for several hours thursday between security 
forces and about 200 guerrillas 
du rand said at least 252 guerrillas of the southwest africa 
peoples organization and 24 members of the south africanled 
security forces have been killed since gunbattles broke out 
saturday when a ceasefire was supposed to take effect 
angolas state news agency quoted swapo defense spokesman peter 
muehihange as saying only 38 guerrillas died in that time and nine 
are missing he said 20 security force members were killed 
foreign minister pik botha of south africa said his government 
is committed to the plan to grant independence to namibia which 
pretoria has ruled for 74 years 
south africa claims swapo has sent more than 1500 guerrillas 
into namibia in violation of an accord requiring the insurgents to 
remain at their bases in angola at least 100 miles away 
the south african council of churches led by prominent 
antiapartheid clergymen said the carnage of the last few days 
could have been prevented if the united nations had denied south 
africas request to let its forces leave their bases to combat the 
guerrillas 
it said the credibility of the un peacekeeping force was in 
doubt 
a joint south africancubanangolan commission monitoring the 
independence accord scheduled a meeting saturday to discuss the 
crisis south africas president pw botha said us and soviet 
observers would participate 
i trust that the commission will be able to find a peaceful 
solution to the very serious situation which has arisen he told 
parliament in cape town 
chester a crocker the assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs left washington on thursday to attend the commission 
meeting 
a namibian police official chief inspector derek brune

the angolan border he said the guerrillas have broken up into 
small groups and that some fighters were reported as far as 120 
miles south of the border

said the united nations hoped to have its first infantry battalions 
in the battle areas early next week 
the united nations has authorized 4650 troops for the namibia 
operation but only 921 have arrived the only forces in the battle 
area are about 300 logistical personnel 
the united nations accepted a us offer to fly 850 finnish 
soldiers to namibia francois giuliani spokesman for 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told reporters the men 
could be arriving over the weekend 
swapo officials said the guerrilla fighters had been inside 
namibia for some time and had no intention of leaving or accepting 
a surrender proposal 
but thornberry said it was made clear beyond a shadow of a 
doubt to swapo that it would have to negotiate an additional 
element to the un plan if it wanted bases inside namibia 
the way for namibian independence was cleared in december when 
south africa angola and cuba signed an accord calling for 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops who have helped marxist angola 
battle usbacked rebels 
besides granting namibia independence south africa is to end 
military aid to the angolan rebels

the air force said thursday the inflight loss 
of escape hatches on two b1b bombers would lead to more frequent 
inspections of the equipment in the future but the problem had not 
stalled the return of the bombers to the air 
col larry greer an air force spokesman said 60 of the 97 
b1bs in the fleet had been cleared for air operations by late 
thursday and that all of the b1bs scheduled for training flights 
thursday or thursday night would be permitted to fly 
the b1b fleet has been slowly returning to the air this week 
after being grounded in the wake of a march 27 incident at dyess 
air force base texas that incident involved the failure of gears 
that move the wings on the swingwing bomber 
as that grounding order was being lifted this week two b1bs 
experienced unusual problems with the same escape hatch suddenly 
blowing off during training flights 
the first hatchblowing incident occurred about 11 am tuesday 
as the jet was climbing from a lowaltitude exercise near the 
texasnew mexico border the 3foot by 4foot hatch blew off at 
about 12500 feet 
then at about 1145 am wednesday a hatch in the same place on 
another b1b blew off at about 19000 feet as the jet flew over la 
junta training range near pueblo colo 
no one was injured and both airplanes made routine landings but 
the incidents caused the air force to order another inspection of 
each plane before they took off on training flights 
greer said thursday the air force had not recovered either of 
the two hatches but that inspections of the other planes in the 
fleet suggested routine opening and closing of the hatches during 
maintenance can gradually throw the locking latches beyond normal 
tolerance levels 
were going to perform the inspection on these hatches more 
often greer said its part of the growing process with a new 
plane as equipment matures you have to adjust your maintenance 
and inspection schedules 
the spokesman added technicians also had discovered that by 
painting a small stripe across the hatch inside the plane it was 
possible to provide an easy visual cue to the crew to make sure a 
hatch is shut tight 
as for the problem that prompted the grounding greer said that 
87 b1bs had undergone the required inspection by thursday and 60 
had been cleared for flight 
ten are awaiting inspection in the case of the other 27 he 
continued a gear box that handles drive shafts that help to move 
the wings has been removed and shipped to the sundstrand corp the 
maker for inspection 
the spokesman declined to predict when the entire fleet would be 
back in the air

the prosecutor who fought to keep randall dale 
adams in jail despite an overturned murder conviction has been 
fired by the district attorney who said his assistant mishandled 
the case 
two other assistant prosecutors who worked on the case have 
resigned reportedly because they were embarrassed by the states 
bungled attempts to deny the imprisoned man his freedom 
winfield scott 48 who insulted a colleague and two judges 
during a lastminute battle to keep adams behind bars was fired by 
district attorney john vance on wednesday 
vance told the dallas times herald that scott just did not 
handle the adams case the way i had told him to handle it he 
was convinced he was doing right and i was convinced he was doing 
wrong 
several phone calls by the associated press to scott and vance 
were not returned thursday 
first tom landry and now winfield scott is no icon safe in 
dallas asked randy schaffer the houston attorney who 
represented adams during appeals of his 1977 capital murder 
conviction of a dallas police officer 
apparently the powers that be just perceived that they could 
not longer keep him in the office but i think he was just 
following orders schaffer said i guarantee you if he won the 
recusal hearing to oust state district judge larry baraka from the 
case he wouldnt have been fired 
adams whose conviction for the 1976 slaying of a dallas police 
officer was overturned last month was freed march 21 after 
spending 12 years in prison at one point he came within three 
days of execution 
his case was resurrected with evidence uncovered in a 
documentary by errol morris the thin blue line which strongly 
suggested that dallas officer robert wood was not slain by adams 
but by witness david harris 
acting on barakas recommendation the texas court of criminal 
appeals ruled that the original prosecutor suppressed evidence 
while at least two witnesses lied on the stand 
assistant district attorneys leslie mcfarlane and john creuzot 
who represented the state in a december hearing on whether adams 
should receive a new trial announced earlier this week that they 
would leave the office by the end of the month both said they will 
pursue private practices 
its time for me to move on said ms mcfarlane 32 who has 
been with the office 5 years its time for me to leave 
its time to move to greener pastures said creuzot 31 
hes been with the office six years 
but sources who asked not to be identified said both ms 
mcfarlane and creuzot were embarrassed by the states efforts to 
keep adams in jail 
after baraka granted adams a personal recognizance bond scott 
tried to have baraka removed from the case and succeeded in getting 
adams bond increased at a hearing on the motion to oust baraka 
the next day scott insulted baraka ms mcfarlane and the judge 
who wrote the march 1 opinion overturning adams conviction

un human rights officials said thursday 
the soviet union has agreed to sign an accord allowing its citizens 
to take human rights complaints directly to international 
investigators 
they said the soviets would sign the optional protocol to the 
international covenant on civil and political rights 
soviet acceptance of the document would be an extension of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs declaration in december that human 
rights should be given new emphasis in international affairs 
rajsoomer lallah of mauritius chairman of the human rights 
committee associated with the united nations and fausto pocar of 
italy of the committee told reporters the notice was unofficial and 
the soviets had not said when they would sign the protocol 
pocar said he received the assurances during a workshop at the 
center for human rights organized in moscow in november 
lallah said he also had received unofficial confirmation and 
added in october we are going to examine the third periodic 
human rights report of the ussr and it is possible that by 
then the decision will have been taken or in process of being 
taken 
a month ago the soviet union said it would accept world court 
jurisdiction in cases based on the covenant on civil and political 
rights and five other human rights treaties the decision reversed 
a long policy of resisting outside judgment of its practices 
the international covenant on civil and political rights 
guarantees the individuals right to life freedom from torture 
inhuman or degrading treatment freedom from slavery or forced 
labor freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention freedom of 
movement freedom of thought conscience and peaceful assembly and 
free association 
us officials praised last months soviet policy change but 
noted that only governments not individuals can file legal 
actions with the world court whose formal title is the 
international court of justice 
pieter kooijmans un special investigator on human rights 
said at the time it would be a real breakthrough for human 
rights if the soviet union would recognize the right of 
individuals to file complaints of rights abuses 
under the optional protocol individual citizens can complain of 
rights abuses to the human rights committee an international body 
of legal experts with the power to order compensation 
hungary ratified the protocol last year joining 40 other 
nations that recognize it

two california executives charged with 
bribery and conspiracy in the pentagon fraud investigation said 
thursday they were unaware that a private consultant their company 
had hired was bribing a navy engineer 
george h kaub and eugene sullivan both former executive vice 
presidents at teledyne electronics of newbury park calif also 
said the consultant william parkin had an excellent reputation 
for his expertise on government contracts 
defense attorney mark tuohey asked kaub about parkin a private 
consultant that teledyne electronics a division of teledyne inc 
hired to help it secure a lucrative pentagon contract for handheld 
radar equipment 
parkin has admitted paying bribes to a navy official for inside 
information and has testified for the government both parkin and 
navy engineer stuart berlin have pleaded guilty in the case 
asked tuohey did you ever know that mr parkin was paying off 
three other people including berlin 
absolutely not kaub responded 
sullivan concurred in that view 
kaub one of three men on trial in alexandria federal court was 
the first defendant to take the witness stand followed by 
sullivan also on trial is dale schnittjer who was sullivans 
successor at teledyne electronics 
the three face charges of bribery conspiracy wire fraud and 
making false statements the government claims they knew parkin and 
his associates were paying bribes to berlin in order to secure the 
radar contract 
but the defense contends the executives were victims of a 
conspiracy devised by parkin 
the defense is expected to continue friday while us district 
judge richard williams has indicated closing arguments will be 
monday 
under crossexamination sullivan and kaub said they never asked 
parkin about his business partners or sought details about his 
operation before teledyne electronics hired him 
you have to make an assumption that he was doing legitimate 
work said kaub noting parkin worked for a number of wellknown 
defense contractors 
sullivan said parkin told him that other consultants he had 
hired didnt want their names revealed to protect other 
business relationships so sullivan never asked 
kaub said he signed the contracts with parkin in november 1985 
that called for parkin to receive 10000 to help teledyne 
electronics get permission to bid on the contract parkin a former 
navy official had a good reputation with teledyne electronics and 
told officials there that he knew how to present himself to 
negotiate lobby whatever kaub said 
kaub also said the deal had a subcontract calling for parkin to 
receive 150000 for future work should teledyne electronics be 
successful in winning the radar job the pentagon awarded the 
company the 24 million job in july 1987 
although details of parkins future work were not spelled out 
kaub said the arrangement was not a contingency fee which is 
illegal under pentagon procurement rules 
asked if he meant to conceal the 150000 arrangement with 
parkin kaub said absolutely not if you want to make 
something illegal you should hide it not put it out in public 
kaub said he had little contact with parkin between 1985 and 
late 1987 the defendant said he talked to the consultant for a 
total of about 15 minutes on the telephone and spent about an hour 
with him at a hotel near washington in november 1987 
at that meeting kaub said parkin gave him two reports that 
might be useful to teledyne electronics kaub said he found only 
one contained valuable information while the other was just a 
bunch of garbage 
parkin has testified that he indirectly paid money to berlin 
parkin left government in october 1983 after a 17year career 
during which he said he accepted 50000 in bribes 
teledyne electronics already has pleaded guilty in the 
governments investigation of fraud and corruption in the 
pentagons massive procurement program more than a dozen people 
have pleaded guilty so far 
in earlier testimony thursday roy lane an executive of 
teledyne inc said he had known of parkins work for at least 20 
years 
i gained quite a respect for the man said lane explaining 
he had known parkin when the latter was a contracting officer with 
the navy 
i thought he was one of the most competent government 
contracting officers lane said

a group led by former baseball commissioner 
peter v ueberroth agreed thursday to buy strikecrippled eastern 
airlines and a union spokesman said he was cautiously optimistic 
the deal could end the monthold walkout 
the 464 million agreement would give employees a 30 percent 
share in the company in exchange for wage concessions 
the sale by easterns parent texas air corp is subject to 
approval by us bankruptcy court and easterns creditors eastern 
also must reach new work agreements with its striking unions by 
midnight tuesday under terms of the sale 
under this agreement eastern can be back flying in very short 
order said texas air chairman frank lorenzo who has been the 
target of bitter personal attacks from union members 
about 500 striking machinists jammed a union hall in miami 
where eastern is based cheering and chanting take me out to the 
ball game and hey hey ho ho lorenzos got to go after 
hearing of the sale 
eastern has been virtually paralyzed since march 4 by the 
machinists strike which has drawn the support of pilots and 
flight attendants eastern filed march 9 for protection from 
creditors in bankruptcy court as its cash dried up 
its a mammoth challenge said ueberroth im convinced 
that there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that i can 
help bring together to help this airline 
the sale includes easterns highly profitable northeast shuttle 
but ueberroth will follow through on an earlier agreement to sell 
the service to developer donald trump for 365 million 
ueberroth who stepped down as baseball commissioner saturday 
was vice president of trans international airlines for two years 
and founded a travel agency in southern california in 1963 first 
travel corp eventually grew into the secondlargest agency in 
north america 
he was organizer of the 1984 los angeles olympics which turned 
a profit of 230 million and put him on the cover of time magazine 
as man of the year as baseball commissioner he turned the game 
from a 67 millionayear moneyloser to one that made 100 million 
last year 
frank ortis vice president of machinists local 702 and miami 
strike coordinator said it was impossible to tell whether unions 
would fare better until we get into dealings with commissioner 
ueberroth 
however were willing to give it a shot he said 
the air line pilots association issued a statement saying that 
the union was encouraged but that strike issues had yet to be 
resolved 
nonetheless what we have heard so far leaves us cautiously 
optimistic said john bavis chairman of the 3600member union 
lorenzo will remain in charge of eastern until the deal is 
approved but ueberroth will help formulate the reorganization plan 
texas air would get 200 million cash eastern notes worth about 
185 million plus eastern assets valued at about 79 million 
including easterns new yorkmontreal routes plus eight landing 
slots and one gate at new yorks laguardia airport 
ueberroths group made a 464 million offer for eastern last 
week and withdrew it after being told it had been topped by another 
suitor but talks with ueberroths group resumed this week and 
wound up thursday 
under the deal ueberroth and thomas talbot another former 
airline executive from california would own 30 percent of the 
airline easterns unions would get another 30 percent in exchange 
for wage and workrule concessions shares for the remaining 40 
percent will be sold to investors 
many union leaders and rankandfile members have said they 
would accept concessions to help resurrect eastern if they were 
given independence from texas air which bought the 60yearold 
carrier in 1986 for about 600 million

a majority of telephone users think the seven 
regional bell companies should be allowed to enter the equipment 
manufacturing longdistance and information services markets 
according to a survey released thursday by the telephone companies 
in the random survey of 24291 registered voters 58 percent 
agreed that congress this year should consider lifting the 
restrictions placed on the bell companies in the 1984 breakup of 
american telephone amp telegraph co 
in the atampt breakup the regional phone companies were 
prohibited from entering the phone equipment research development 
and manufacturing business and from providing their own 
longdistance and information services to local and national 
customers 
the us district court in washington reaffirmed those 
prohibitions last year saying the bell companies if freed from 
their restraints might engage in predatory pricing and 
crosssubsidization of services and discriminate against 
competitors wanting to use their phone lines 
the court did allow the regional companies to provide 
gateway services through which users can call a single 800 
number to gain access to a variety of services such as compuserve 
and the source databases 
ed reilly president of kennan research of new york city said 
his companys survey found that americans want american companies 
freed to compete in providing telecommunications products and 
services consumers want as many choices as possible 
according to kennan 
74 percent of those surveyed said the seven bell companies 
should be allowed to compete in the longdistance arena 
78 percent thought those companies should be allowed to offer 
information services which could include electronic banking 
health monitoring home security services and data bases 
79 percent said the bell companies should be allowed to 
research develop and manufacture telephone equipment 
68 percent said the newspaper advertising business does not 
need to be protected from electronic yellow pages that the bell 
companies could offer 
74 percent said allowing the seven companies to compete in the 
telephone equipment market would strengthen us competitiveness 
against overseas manufacturers of high technology equipment 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said those surveyed werent told 
there is already stiff and growing competition for atampt in 
manufacturing equipment 
atampt chairman robert allen said in a recent speech in washington 
that the bell companies if allowed to begin manufacturing might 
be inclined to team with overseas manufacturers to avoid huge 
development costs to the detriment of american workers 
linnen also said atampt never has opposed the bell companies 
entry into the information services business 
the survey was conducted by telephone from november through 
january it had a margin of error of less than 1 percent kennan 
said 
it was commissioned by ameritech bell atlantic bellsouth 
nynex pacific telesis southwestern bell and us west these 
companies operate 22 local telephone companies

the mercury hit 100 and kept going thursday 
as southern california sweated out the third day of a 
recordbreaking heat wave that sent thousands to the beach 
increased power demand and withered strawberries 
downtown los angeles where the temperature peaked at 105 
degrees wednesday registered 103 thursday afternoon breaking the 
dates record of 91 set in 1932 and tied in 1962 san diegos 98 
made it the hottest april day on record 
high pressure over the west squeezed warm air out of the 
interior toward the populous coast beating back sea breezes and 
turning even the usually balmy beaches into a furnace for thousands 
who rushed there instead of work 
it started off with 80 degrees at sunrise and now its up to 
98 in the shade said santa monica beach lifeguard randy 
degregori 
southern california edison said power demand to keep up with air 
conditioning would beat the april record of 14282 megawatts set 
wednesday the los angeles department of water and power the other 
major local supplier of electricity projected an april record need 
for 4700 megawatts by 4 pm 
other hot afternoon readings around southern california included 
110 at ontario 108 at el toro 107 at palm springs 104 at long 
beach 102 at san bernardino and 100 at riverside blythe and 
santa maria 
much of the rest of the state shared the warmth though not the 
triple digit readings san francisco and sacramento hit the upper 
80s 
san diego county grower fran hillebrecht watched three acres of 
strawberries in escondido wither in a 105degree santa ana wind 
theyre really melting in this heat she said you cant 
put enough water on the roots of the plant to keep it from losing 
moisture 
conversely san bernardino county agricultural biologist mike 
cohen said early warming of the soil would help summer vegetables 
just being planted 
since tuesday orange county ice co has sold about 30 tons a 
day to food and liquor stores compared to the five or six tons 
normally delivered daily this time of year said office manager 
jean mann 
dr george gellert a los angeles county health official urged 
people to take precautions ranging from simply wearing hats to 
spending time in airconditioned places such as shopping malls and 
supermarkets 
the 61degree ocean water might deter beachgoers from plunging 
in but they should at least keep splashing themselves gellert 
said 
people going to the beach and not going into the water are 
just exposing themselves to the sun they may be better off 
remaining in the shade 
santa ana winds out of the interior began warming the region 
last weekend by tuesday downtown los angeles reached 100 degrees 
tying the alltime april record 
even normally cool san francisco felt the heat wednesday with a 
record high of 88 a full 8 degrees above the previous record that 
had stood since 1924 
at 5 am thursday the mercury had dropped only to 74 in 
downtown los angeles and 88 at laguna peak above point mugu in 
ventura county even at 3 am hundreds of people could be found 
parked along beaches seeking respite 
socal edisons alltime record power use was last september when 
its 38 million central and southern california customers used 
15987 megawatts 
the dwps all time record was 4991 megawatts on sept 6 1988 
tuesdays usage was 4073 megawatts and wednesdays was 4541 
megawatts 
even if high temperatures remain in the same range power use 
increases over the span of a heat wave because lack of overnight 
cooling causes heat buildup in buildings requiring more power to 
start up air conditioning each day

a bipartisan group of four senators asked 
attorney general dick thornburgh on thursday to delay any plans to 
abolish the justice departments organized crime strike force 
program saying such a move could hamper federal law enforcement 
capabilities 
given the success of the organized crime strike force program 
over the past 20 years we believe that a decision to abolish the 
strike forces could hamper federal law enforcement capabilities at 
a time when many areas are overwhelmed with organized crime and 
illegal drug activity the letter said 
the letter signed by democrats edward m kennedy of 
massachusetts and sam nunn of georgia as well as republicans strom 
thurmond of south carolina and arlen specter of pennsylvania was 
delivered to the justice department after thornburgh had left for 
the day said aide dave runkel 
recently thornburgh has said he was leaning in favor of 
merging those offices into the us attorneys offices runkel 
said he said he felt that would enhance the federal efforts 
against organized crime 
the us attorneys around the country have recommended 
unanimously according to runkel that the strike forces be 
assimilated into the us attorneys offices the recommendation 
is under review by the justice department criminal division and is 
expected to be forwarded to thornburgh soon runkel said 
a lot of the organized crime business these days is in fact 
drugs and when you fence the us attorneys out of those cases 
that doesnt seem to be the right thing to do runkel said it 
seems appropriate to merge them and have one federal prosecutor 
rather than two federal prosecutors in the same parts of the 
country 
there are strike forces in about two dozen major cities around 
the country 
runkel noted that the strike force in new york was merged with 
the us attorneys office in manhattan several years ago 
under the past three us attorneys new york was the most 
active in the country in the fight against organized crime he 
said 
the senators noted that thornburgh has said in speeches and in 
testimony before congress that some of the reasons giving rise to 
the establishment of organized crime strike forces still apply 
including the need for seasoned prosecutors who can commit the time 
necessary to prepare these cases and who are free of daily criminal 
docket obligations 
the 1988 drug bill they wrote included a provision requiring a 
comprehensive reorganization study that should be completed in 
several months 
a decision as important as this would benefit from the results 
of that study the letter said accordingly we urge you to 
delay any such decision until the appropriate committees of the 
congress have reasonable time to consider your proposal we pledge 
to do so expeditiously

influential palestinians expressed skepticism 
thursday about president bushs call for elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
israeli officials however said they were encouraged by the 
outcome of prime minister yitzhak shamirs visit to washington 
shamir told his aides his meeting with bush thursday was an 
excellent meeting more than i ever expected israel television 
reported 
other israeli reports indicated shamir disagreed with the 
americans on some issues notably the us demand to stop jewish 
settlement in the occupied lands 
israeli journalists reporting from washington quoted shamir as 
saying a timetable for discussing the elections idea will be set in 
the next few days 
israel radio said joint usisraeli teams will be created to 
work out concrete proposals leading to elections 
i think that in general the positive us response to the 
elections idea is encouraging and raising hopes foreign ministry 
spokesman alon liel told the associated press 
some palestinians expressed the fear that shamir proposed 
elections as a ploy to sidestep the palestine liberation 
organization and block its key demand that a palestinian state be 
created 
i believe its a trick because i dont believe the israelis 
want true peace said jack khazmo editor of the proplo weekly 
al bayader assiyasi 
if they did they would go to an international conference and 
accept the idea of land for peace khazmo said in an interview in 
jerusalem where his newspaper is published 
also thursday a palestinian died of a gunshot wound sustained 
in earlier violence and an israeli soldier shot and critically 
wounded a teenage protester in bethlehem witnesses and arab news 
reports said 
in other clashes in the occupied lands troops shot and wounded 
at least eight palestinians 
doctors at jerusalems mukassed hospital said salem ismail 
salah 27 of the west bank village of deir salah died thursday of 
head wounds sustained during a clash with troops march 30 
chanting plo israel no about 200 people in deir salah 
waved outlawed palestinian flags and followed salahs coffin 
his death brings to 420 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising against israeli occupation started in december 1987 
eighteen israelis also have died 
in nearby bethlehem reporters watched four soldiers fire live 
ammunition to disperse 100 palestinians who were throwing stones 
and bottles 
one soldier chased 17yearold dahoud khaled nassar he knelt on 
the ground took aim and shot the youth in the head twice from 
about 40 yards away 
an army spokesman confirmed a palestinian youth was wounded but 
denied a live bullet hit nassar who was in critical condition at 
mukassed hospital army regulations permit troops to fire live 
ammunition only when their lives are in danger 
shamirs election proposal was the main idea he brought to 
washington to help resolve the conflict that has provoked much 
criticism of israeli army methods 
leading plo supporters in the occupied territories did not rule 
out elections but said balloting must be part of a comprehensive 
peace plan including a timetable for negotiations on a final 
settlement 
jonathan kuttab a human rights activist in the west bank said 
as a prerequisite for elections israel would have to lift military 
orders banning freedom of expression for the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
he said israel also would have to end detentions without trial 
and stop deporting palestinian activists

a document produced at oliver norths trial 
thursday depicted george bush for the first time as helping 
carry out the reagan administrations secret program to sustain the 
nicaraguan contras when congress had forbidden us aid 
thenvice president bush served as an intermediary for president 
reagan in assuring the president of honduras in the spring of 1985 
of expedited us military and economic aid according to a 42page 
admission of facts agreed to by the government and read to the 
jury by norths defense attorneys 
the document established a quid pro quo relationship between 
continuing thirdcountry assistance to the contras and the 
availability of us assistance to those countries but bush was 
not described in the document as having cited such a linkage in his 
may 1985 meeting with thenpresident roberto suazo of honduras 
the document nevertheless revealed bush as actually playing a 
role in the effort to keep the contras alive as a fighting force 
during the period of the boland amendment prohibition on american 
involvement this is a portrait of bush that never emerged in the 
final irancontra investigative reports by a presidential review 
board and a joint congressional committee 
asked thursday about the revelation of bushs gobetween role 
with the honduran leader who was being pressed by the united states 
to continue helping the contras white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said we cant say anything it would become a part of 
the case 
bush declined to comment on the document when asked about it at 
a dinner party for visiting israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
bush said he hadnt seen the document and i dont worry about 
it 
both the presidential commission headed by former sen john 
tower rtexas and the congressional panels found no meaningful 
role by bush in the scandal that resulted from the covert sales of 
us arms to iran and the subsequent diversion of the proceeds to 
the nicaraguan resistance fighters 
bush has said that he supported reagans iranian armssale 
initiative but that he voiced reservations about what would happen 
if it ever became public 
portions of the document read thursday did however show bush 
as an enthusiastic supporter of the effort to tide over the contras 
until direct us assistance could be resumed 
in early march 1985 for instance bush asked thennational 
security advisor robert mcfarlane to say whether he the vice 
president should encourage a private group to donate a planeload 
of medical supplies that would arrive in honduras coincident with 
bushs meeting with suazo 
bush strongly favored such a flight the document said 
noting that the unidentified group was supportive of the 
resistance it said that north told mcfarlane that bushs idea 
was a sound one the document did not reveal whether the planeload 
of supplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit 
bush has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion of 
armssales proceeds to the contras and donald gregg national 
security adviser to bush when bush was vice president has 
testified that he did not pass on to bush information about contra 
resupply effort that gregg had learned from felix rodriguez a 
onetime gregg cia associate 
a source involved in the irancontra congressional 
investigation speaking on grounds of anonymity said thursday that 
bush didnt leave very many footprints anywhere it needs to be 
said that the extent of his knowledge was not our major goal we 
were more interested in what the president reagan knew 
but this source also said that it was because he bush left 
so few footprints i think that he was treated so well in the 
final investigative report by the congressional panel 
victoria goldstein a spokeswoman at the honduran embassy here 
said she had no information about the bushsuazo meeting but she 
said the embassy would not have been involved 
according to the document bush personally told suazo during the 
may 1985 in honduras that extra aid was being funneled to his 
country in earlier testimony mcfarlane had said the aid was part 
of a secret agreement calling for honduras to help the contras 
mcfarlane testified that reagan personally approved the secret 
deal to slip 110 million in extra aid to honduras as one of 
several quid pro quo arrangements with other countries in 
exchange for support for the contras 
mcfarlane said in crossexamination that reagan telephoned suazo 
to gain the release of an arms shipment to the contras that had 
been seized by a honduran military commander 
the statement entered in court thursday said vice president 
bush also informed suazo that president reagan had directed that 
currently withheld economic assistance for honduras should be 
released that the united states would provide from its own 
military stocks critical security assistance items that had been 
ordered by honduran armed forces and that several security 
programs under way for honduran security forces would be enhanced 
in a dec 3 1986 speech to the american enterprise institute 
here little more than a week after the irancontra affair broke 
into public view bush said that while he was aware of reagans 
iranian initiative and had supported it i was not aware of and 
oppose any diversion of funds any ransom payments or any 
circumvention of the will of the congress 
the document also revealed that bush saw several north memoranda 
involving the secret us effort to aid the contras although it 
did not contradict bushs assertions that he never knew about the 
diversion of the iranian armssales proceeds to the resistance 
at another point the document shows that bush was included in 
the distribution of a memo making it clear that leaders of 
guatemala were conditioning continued support for the contras on a 
doubling of us economic assistance to guatemala

federal officials plan to shoot 
and poison up to 1500 ravens in the mojave desert in an effort to 
save the desert tortoise which is a favorite meal of the predatory 
birds 
animal damage control officers with the us department of 
agriculture will kill ravens by injecting hardboiled eggs with 
poison and placing the eggs on elevated platforms where the ravens 
will find and eat them 
the ravens are killing young tortoises by the thousands and 
contributing to an alarming decline of tortoise populations in the 
desert said biologists with the us bureau of land management 
the agency that developed the raven control program 
bureau of land management officials obtained a permit this week 
from the us fish and wildlife service to kill the birds the san 
bernardino sun reported tuesday 
the birds are protected by the migratory bird treaty act the 
permit represents the largest sanctioned killing of ravens in the 
western states said agent tom riley of the fish and wildlife 
service 
national audubon society officials oppose the program and local 
audubon officials called it shortsighted and excessive 
im a little annoyed at this said bob mckernan president 
of the san bernardino valley audubon society in general the blm 
is not doing its job throughout the desert on a variety of levels 
it bothers me that they are now having to go to these extremes 
to eliminate or reduce a population 
roads dumps homes power lines and sewage plants in the desert 
have helped boost raven populations 15fold during the last two 
decades blm biologists said 
the 50000 raven control program set to begin within the next 
two weeks will last about four months and will be conducted in 
three areas including the desert tortoise natural area preserve 
near california city said ted rado a wildlife biologist with the 
us bureau of land management 
the bait platforms at least four feet high will prevent other 
animals such as kit foxes and coyotes from eating the poisoned 
eggs rado said 
ravens die within 24 to 48 hours after eating the poison 
officials plan to shoot ravens and capture some with nets fired 
from cannons to supplement the poisoning program 
ravens favor tortoises seven years old and younger because their 
fingernailthin shells are easily punctured with their beaks as 
more and more young tortoises are eaten fewer reach maturity and 
the adult reproductive population shrinks 
in two studies blm biologists attributed 88 percent of tortoise 
deaths to ravens but critics remain skeptical that ravens can 
cause so much damage

plo chairman yasser arafat was quoted 
wednesday as saying assassination squads have been deployed in 
european and arab countries to kill palestinian leaders 
the editorinchief of the londonbased weekly almajalla quoted 
arafat as saying the teams of killers are of different 
nationalities including one palestinian 
there are three groups but according to the names available 
to me only one person involved is a palestinian and the rest belong 
to other nationalities arafat was quoted as saying 
there have always been such attempts perpetrated by the 
israelis international intelligence agencies and arab agents 
there was no elaboration 
excerpts from the interview ran in the weeklys jiddabased 
sister englishlanguage newspaper arab news which is sold in 
manama 
according to the publication arafat said the assassination 
efforts were aimed at halting progress after last years peace 
initiative by the palestine liberation organization led to the 
united states lifting a 13year ban on dealing with the guerrilla 
organization 
arafat also was quoted as saying he did not provide information 
to the americans that could help disclose the identity of the 
terrorists who planted a bomb aboard a pan am jet which blew up in 
december over lockerbie scotland 
we havent reached such type of coordination with the united 
states he said 
the plo he was quoted as saying was not ready to cooperate 
with the united states in combating terrorism under the definition 
now being applied to the word because it is we who are victims of 
state terrorism 
the definition has been considered controversial because the plo 
insists any attacks on israeli military targets are legitimate 
resistance since israeli forces occupy the west bank and gaza 
strip where a palestinian state is foreseen 
but arafat was quoted as stressing in the interview we refuse 
to blow up aircraft or kill civilians because these are crimes 
against humanity and those responsible for them should receive no 
mercy 
the report quoted arafat as saying he believed the dialogue 
between the united states and the plo reflected seriousness 
by the american administration in seeking fruitful results that 
would give a strong push to the middle east peacemaking process 
according to the publication the plo chief reiterated the 
standing plo request for un forces to replace the israelis in the 
occupied territories when asked if he would accept the presence of 
us forces instead as an arafat aide recently suggested arafat 
was quoted as saying he would have to convene the plo central 
council to consider the proposal 
the central council is a liaison body between the plo leadership 
and its legislative body the palestine national council 
the report said arafat was interviewed in tunis before the 
central council elected him as president of the selfproclaimed 
independent palestinian state

officials said wednesday they 
broke up a major international counterfeit ring confiscating 12 
million in counterfeit us currency and arresting a west german 
and an israeli accomplice 
the counterfeiters had operated since at least 1987 and their 
bogus money has turned up in several european cities and in africa 
said jochen schroers spokesman for the frankfurt prosecutors 
office 
schroers said investigators seized 235 pounds of counterfeit 
us 100 bills with a total face value of 12 million 
he said it was the largest seizure of counterfeit money in west 
german history 
printing machines and highquality paper used by the 
counterfeiters were also confiscated in raids march 20 in frankfurt 
and the surrounding area schroers said 
two of the counterfeit rings alleged organizers a 49yearold 
israeli and a 43yearold west german businessman from the 
frankfurt area were arrested and an arrest warrant was issued 
for a third suspect schroers said 
the spokesman refused to provide further information on any of 
the suspects 
according to schroers west german authorities received their 
first clues about the counterfeiters in 1987 when they heard the 
ring wanted to circulate a large amount of their bogus money 
we knew no more than that until late summer 1988 when the 
first hundred or so hundreddollar bills surfaced in various 
european cities especially east europe but also in africa 
schroers said 
he said that american and israeli authorities provided 
information about links between the counterfeitiers operating in 
west germany with another ring that was active in 1983 and 1984 
schroers said equipment used by the earlier group had come from 
frankfurt 
according to schroers a member of the earlier ring who is now 
in jail in austria gave authorities information that led to the 
arrest of the israeli man suspected of involvement in the new ring 
of counterfeiters 
west german police confiscated the printing equipment paper and 
counterfeit bills in raids on two residences and a business in the 
frankfurt area schroers said

no b1b bombers will fly until their escape 
hatches are inspected in the wake of two instances in which the 
hatches flew off the strategic air command announced wednesday 
asked if the planes had been grounded again col larry greer 
sacs director of public affairs at offutt air force base neb 
said 
thats your word i didnt use that word 
at the moment they are inspecting all of the airplanes we 
expect that will be completed and they will be flying again late 
thursday afternoon 
ejection hatches on two b1b bombers from dyess air force base 
in abilene texas mysteriously blew off during training flights 
just a day apart a base official said wednesday 
no one was hurt in either incident maj mary beth kilgore said 
at this time both incidents are under investigation ms 
kilgore said theyre looking at them now but theres no 
evidence to link these two incidents 
greer said about 40 of the 97 planes had been returned to flying 
status following last weeks inspections which focused on sweeping 
wings 
the air force had placed b1b bombers back in training service 
just monday after canceling training runs for a week because of a 
march 27 incident in which another dyessbased b1b punctured a 
fuel tank because of a malfunction in its moveable wing 
the first hatchblowing incident occurred about 11 am tuesday 
as the jet was climbing from a lowaltitude exercise near the 
texasnew mexico border ms kilgore said the 3foot by 4foot 
hatch blew off at about 12500 feet 
about 1145 am wednesday a hatch in the same place on another 
b1b blew off at about 19000 feet as the jet flew over la junta 
training range near pueblo colo ms kilgore said 
both airplanes returned to dyess for routine landings she said 
both hatches were above the offensive systems operators seat 
on the right rear side of the cockpit the b1b regularly carries 
four crew members and each the pilot copilot offensive 
systems operator and defensive systems operator has his own 
ejection hatch 
the hatch is one or two feet above the crew members head 
when theyre in there crew members have got their helmets 
on and theyre strapped in ms kilgore said adding that the 
loss of the hatches didnt affect either planes flight 
the metal hatches fell over unpopulated areas and neither had 
been recovered by wednesday afternoon 
officials with the air force and rockwell international corp 
the planes manufacturer were inspecting the aircraft wednesday 
ms kilgore said 
the b1b has been the most maligned aircraft in service history 
with controversy over the planes electronic defense system and the 
moveable wings the planes have been grounded three times in the 
past 18 months

under current tax law a homeowner may deduct 
interest on a home mortgage loan as large as 1 million an amount 
far beyond the borrowing ability of most middleclass americans 
despite this real estate and home building organizations are 
determined not to let the million dollar cap be reduced by a 
single dollar defending their stand as being in the interest of 
middleclass homeowners 
taking a stand doesnt begin to suggest their determination 
leaders of housingrelated industries sound these days like 
military commanders determined to give no ground they have made up 
their minds they have drawn the line it is 1 million 
for congress to tamper with deductibility says kent colton 
executive vice president of the national association of home 
builders would be to risk a taxpayer rebellion he says it could 
strike at the heart of middle america 
ira gribin president of the national association of realtors 
is equally concerned guarding against threats to homeownership 
and private property rights in general is similar to manning a fire 
station he said recently you have to be on duty all the time 
not just when theres a fire 
few issues have ever fired up the two industries to such an 
extent nearly 20000 realtors have sent letters to president bush 
seeking his help against the threat it has been made a plank in 
the home builders statement of policy 
many people think the alert is overdone that the vigilance is 
uncalled for if there is a threat they say it is hardly a 
visible one 
even before his election the president endorsed the tax 
deduction as it now stands and has given no indication of changing 
his mind and senate and house members have given their assurances 
that no changes are likely 
the realtors say the office of sen lloyd bentsen dtex 
chairman of the senate finance committee has said the subject is 
off the table or not up for reconsideration 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee has said in reference to the maximum 1 million 
deductibility as long as im chairman its going to remain 
where it is 
as if that werent assurance enough more than 100 
representatives have endorsed a resolution that it is the sense 
of the congress that the current law regarding the federal income 
tax deduction for interest on debt secured by a first or second 
home should not be further restricted 
so why worry because say real estate and housing people the 
income tax deduction on home mortgage debt already has been limited 
twice in the past three years it can happen again they say 
easily and quickly 
says gribin just as the best time to put out a fire is before 
it has a chance to really get started the best time to defend 
against a potentially disastrous piece of legislation is before it 
garners a lot of support 
and colton the great concern is the foot in the door once 
the barrier is lowered he says it can be lowered more easily in 
the future again and again until deductibility is eliminated 
altogether 
he has other reasons too unless the allowable deduction is cut 
to a small fraction of the existing 1 million limit he says the 
revenues produced would hardly be significant he also contends 
that whatever revenues are generated would be offset by those lost 
through a decline in newhome construction 
as long as the decision is made in full view of the american 
public the deductibility will be kept he states the trouble 
is that a lot of deals are made in closed rooms he wants to ward 
off that possibility 
jeff lubar a realtor spokesman offers an even more succinct 
explanation for having the troops on alert 
congress must be watched he suggests because all it takes is 
a pen to scratch out one zero and 1 million goes to 100000

in 25 years on the force city police officer 
ray chuderewicz has worked race riots and vietnam war protests and 
arrested drug pushers rapists and car thieves 
the 6foot1 205pound officer has gotten by with nary a 
scratch until a militant antiabortion organization began waging 
guerrilla warfare at womens clinics in pittsburgh 
now chuderewicz is on disability leave for several weeks 
recovering from surgery for a hernia he suffered during a february 
protest while trying to arrest the local leader of operation rescue 
it gets me a little bit ticked off said chuderewicz 56 
who hasnt suffered a jobrelated injury since 1966 at the first 
protest i fell down and darn near rolled under a bus 
he is one of six city officers on longterm disability and one 
of 50 officers who have been injured since june when operation 
rescue added three of the citys womens clinics to its 
antiabortion protest targets around the country 
in less than a year police chief ralph pampena estimates more 
than 1330 abortion foes have been arrested and the protests have 
cost the police department roughly 100000 including 30000 in 
compensation claims 
officials have become so frustrated theyre considering using a 
racketeering law against the protesters to recoup their costs 
in pittsburgh as elsewhere the group has turned demonstrations 
into confrontations because protesters use whatever methods 
possible including chaining themselves to doors to prevent 
access to abortion clinics 
such tactics have clouded the issue critics say 
the tactics are becoming more important than the issue 
itself said pampena the issue now is between the police and 
the demonstrators its no longer focused on the issue of 
abortion 
but the rev keith tucci the local leader of operation rescue 
said the groups methods are necessary to save lives 
i genuinely feel bad that any police officer has been hurt 
that bothers me and i wish i could undo it but children are dying 
thats the consequence said tucci 32 of penn hills who 
resigned as pastor of his evangelical church to work full time for 
the movement 
tucci argued that police have drawn themselves into this cross 
fire by using excessive force with demonstrators the treatment 
is far rougher than needed 
in a demonstration protesters use passive resistance going 
limp and requiring police to carry them to paddy wagons in order 
to delay their arrest and in turn delay possible abortions 
most of the injured officers ailments involve back and groin 
problems caused by lifting dozens of protesters pampena said 
hoping to save strain on his officers the chief said he offered 
demonstration leaders the option of having a person arrested every 
45 seconds the time it would take to carry someone away those 
arrested would have to cooperate by walking 
that way theyre still getting the same amount of time 
nobodys being harassed nobodys being accused of brutality 
pampena said but they refused they said thats not in their 
plan 
tucci argued that protesters originally asked police for such an 
agreement but it was they who refused 
now he said operation rescue members are not as conciliatory 
because many claim theyve been victims of police brutality 
after people have been beaten up and molested i dont know 
what incentive they have to get up and walk away now he said 
once arrested demonstrators often continue to use passive 
resistance on several occasions theyve tied up city courts for 
hours and days by refusing to give their names calling themselves 
baby does to identify with the children they say are being 
murdered by abortion 
allegheny county jail warden charles kozakiewicz said the 
countys expenses following a march 11 demonstration totaled more 
than 15000 because the activists withheld their names for 33 
hours to protest assault charges lodged against one of their 
members 
due to overcrowding at the jail 60 women were held overnight in 
the jails gymnasium and 62 men were kept in police holding cells 
until an unused building at mayview state hospital could be 
prepared 
kozakiewicz said the women continued to remain limp upon arrival 
at the jail forcing guards to hold their heads erect for 
photographing and drag them up five flights of steps to the 
gymnasium 
the whole process was timeconsuming the warden said 
some of the officers suffered injury some of these women how 
can i say it were large 
operation rescue organizers claim the women were fondled and 
sexually harassed by jail guards and stripsearched by male guards 
kozakiewicz said he is troubled by those charges saying the 
women were treated with dignity and respect he said female 
corrections officers stripsearched only a few women and the only 
time male officers became involved was when women had to be dragged 
upstairs to the gym 
its devastating because you put your best foot forward he 
said lord knows they may have a champion in me in their cause 
but its certainly frustrating to me to have to carry and drag 
people in the jail the point is not to be proved here 
pampena said he has issued memos to police officers instructing 
them to be as gentle as possible in dealing with protesters 
we know were not dealing with the criminal element and i have 
no animosity toward them or their cause he said my police 
officers are probably split 5050 on the issue 
officials at the abortion clinics say they are pleased with the 
job police have done 
meanwhile attorneys representing the building that houses the 
allegheny reproductive health center have sued operation rescue 
tucci and more than 40 other people claiming they have harmed the 
buildings reputation among its 28 tenants and discouraged 
potential tenants 
the suit says the protesters violated the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act because their blockades 
constitute extortion and the interference with commerce by 
threats or violence 
the county law department is investigating whether pittsburgh 
can apply the rico act to recoup its costs of overtime medical 
treatment for police and housing prisoners arrested in 
demonstrations 
but operation rescue spokesman nick brough said neither lawsuits 
nor restraining orders will stop the protests 
they want us to run away in fear but we cannot brough 
said we have made a promise to god that we wont be deterred 
whether by police brutality tyrannical judges or unjust laws

having trouble getting your act together in time 
to meet the april 17 incometax deadline 
consider joining the 6 million or so of your fellow citizens who 
are turning for help to form 4868 application for automatic 
extension of time to file us indiviudual income tax return 
complete this form properly mail it to the internal revenue 
service and youll get four more months until aug 15 to 
complete your annual accounting with uncle sam 
theres one catch to this however extension of time to file 
does not mean extension of time to pay 
with form 4868 the rules stipulate you need to enclose a check 
big enough to ensure that at least 90 percent of your eventual tax 
bill for 1988 is paid 
if you dont meet that standard you can run into a wide variety 
of woes including penalties for late payment and a possible ruling 
that invalidates your extension request altogether 
so if youre uncertain how much your tax is likely to run it 
makes sense when estimating it to err on the high side 
the trouble is that means youre probably going to wind up 
giving the government the free use of some of your money for at 
least several months 
drawbacks notwithstanding the irs says 57 million taxpayers 
filed for extensions in the tax filing season last year for this 
year it is projecting that 62 million will do so 
there used to be another way to duck the deadline and to 
postpone the need to pay as well 
all you had to do was be out of the country defined as the 50 
states and puerto rico on april 15 that qualified you for an 
extra two months to file and pay 
this was the easiest extension to get and particularly useful 
to some taxpayers who were not in a position to determine what 
their tax liability was going to be observed steven holub 
managing partner in the houston office of the accounting firm of 
laventhol amp horwath 
about a year ago a clever thinker in an airlines marketing 
department hit on the idea of promoting its flights to other 
countries as a way of getting this break 
but the idea was too clever in the eyes of the irs which 
immediately began a crackdown now the only people eligible for the 
extension are those who live outside the united states including 
members of the armed forces stationed in other lands 
it eliminated a very handy device holub said 
for people who will be traveling abroad this year he adds it 
is now necessary either to get your return in on time or file a 
form 4868 before you depart 
some tax mavens advise getting an extension even if you can meet 
the original deadline as a way of reducing your chances of being 
audited no say others it is best to file in april when there is 
safety in numbers 
ignore this debate counsels the arthur young tax guide both 
theories are oversimplifications of irs procedures

asked what proportion of votes at corporate 
board meetings are unanimous 85 percent of a select group of 
directors agreed that virtually all are 
because management generally selects or greatly influences the 
issues on which votes are taken and because most directors have 
relatively little time to study board matters the question arises 
again what good is a board 
it is an agesold question asked over and over times change 
and the boards role evolves but in spite of studies conferences 
learned papers and the like never has the issue been put to rest 
it probably never will be 
harold geneen former itt chairman has been quoted as saying a 
board should sit in judgment of management especially the chief 
executive and to reward punish or replace the management as the 
board sees fit 
but he added that is what is supposed to happen that is what 
appears to happen but it doesnt and for good reason as board 
chairman the chief generally is the one who selects members and 
the agenda as well 
in recent years boards have become more involved and because 
of court suits and other evidence of shareholder suits boards 
today have a tendency to be more aware of their obligation to 
shareholders 
but the questions not only persist they grow more numerous 
for example institutions have grown enormously in the past two 
decades mutual funds and pension funds have become big owners of 
stock and on many days they dominate activity on the new york 
stock exchange 
question should such institutions have board seats 
its a good bet that the ordinary folks whose money makes up 
these funds would be inclined to say yes reasoning that they 
are entitled to representation but a lot of corporate executives 
dont see it that way 
in the same survey that indicated most board votes are unanimous 
by egon zehnder international a consulting firm only 12 of 102 
directors thought institutions should be represented 
in fact many of the directors interviewed all of whom serve 
very large corporations and 60 percent of whom are chief executives 
of other companies consider institutional influence a growing 
danger to corporate governance 
underscoring that view 50 percent of them agreed with the 
statement the power of institutional investors in corporate 
governance is growing out of proportion and something should be 
done about it 
said one institutional investors dont belong on corporate 
boards theyre only concerned with quick profits not the 
longterm health of the corporation 
who then is concerned with longterm health management or 
insiders outsiders such as widely knowledgeable educators or 
chief executives of other companies outsiders who own shares 
outsiders who own little or no stock 
you may have strong views on those questions but chances are 
that your views are offset by others with equally strong but 
opposite opinions 
in the zehnder survey four of 10 directors opposed the seating 
of insiders while acknowledging the valuable handson experience 
of corporate officers one of the directors contended 
since it is only human nature to want to save your own job 
management who serve on boards cannot be expected to have the best 
interests of the shareholders in mind in takeover situations 
representatives of small shareholders have long argued at annual 
meetings that all board members should own stock in the company 
and most of the directors in the zehnder survey agreed 
they suggested however that stock ownership is not a 
requirement for being a good director seven in 10 agreed that 
directors are likely to have the same commitment to shareholder 
interests regardless of their equity holdings 
you may disagree as millions of others disagree it is the 
reason why the issue of what makes a good board might never get 
settled

back in the 1920s the leaders of the 
fledgling league of women voters raised cash by hocking their rings 
and pearls at a friendly washington pawn shop 
the shops operator held the goods until the organization was on 
its feet and the ladies of the league had the cash to redeem their 
valuables or so goes the story oft told by the officers of 
todays league of women voters 
at 70 the league finds the solutions to its problems more 
difficult to come by 
the nonpartisan league dedicated still to promoting political 
and civic activism is working to reverse a decline in members and 
end the financial squeeze that has forced it to draw from its 
endowment to cover operating losses 
it has cut expenses laid off staff reduced its lobbying 
efforts and deemphasized a range of issues it was active in yet 
distracted by 
aggravating the deficit was last falls presidential debate 
debacle which culminated when the league angrily withdrew its 
sponsorship of the final debate between george bush and michael 
dukakis in a dispute over format and details 
that move generated much sympathy around the country but renewed 
and intensified hostility toward the league among partisans of both 
parties 
yet the troubles facing the league of women voters run deeper 
it is in some ways a victim of the success and achievement of a 
generation of active educated and assertive women like the ones 
who hocked their jewels to pay the bills and of the social change 
that has moved women away from volunteer work to jobs that pay 
the woman who was the heart and soul of the league volunteer 
is now an investment banker says grant p thompson the leagues 
first male executive director 
to meet the changing social and financial demands the 
organizations board of trustees agreed in january to a longterm 
refocusing of the leagues efforts its top priorities now are 
public campaign financing and a project called advocate for the 
voter which aims at increasing voter registration and turnout 
the move essentially was a return to the sort of issues that 
concerned the league when it sprang from the womens suffrage 
movement in 1919 
our goals are the same but the strategies to reach them are 
going to have to change says nancy m neuman the leagues 
national president weve got to accommodate people who have very 
busy and complicated lives but who still want to be active and try 
to change things 
the leagues strength is its 1150 local organizations in 
communities in every state where members monitor obscure 
government proceedings promote voter registration and push league 
positions on a plethora of concerns 
some have seen that wide range of issues as a problem 
a blue million of em former league president dorothy 
ridings says of the issues the league has tried to deal with arms 
control abortion clean water defense spending child care 
housing and tax reform to name a few 
over the years weve simply tried to become all things to all 
people with the best of intentions but its stretched us thinner 
and thinner said ridings now publisher of the bradenton fla 
herald 
the league describes its own positions as progressive some say 
they are liberal 
while they say theyre nonpartisan they tend to support 
positions that most clearly follow democratic lines says frank 
fahrenkopf the former republican national chairman who tangled 
with the league over the debates theyre basically liberal 
the league is strictly bound to its grassroots orientation so 
much so that it didnt even have a reliable national membership 
list when thompson was hired four years ago 
since then the league has spent heavily on modernization 
bringing computers into the operation and installing its first 
modern financial system 
the financing problems are real budgets for the league and its 
educational fund have fallen over the last decade corporate 
donations are down and the league has spent 1 million over the 
last several years from its reserves now at about 15 million 
thompson says last years losses including those from the 
debate fiasco will hit about 800000 with cost controls he 
hopes the league will end its fiscal year with a deficit of 
200000 to 400000 on an operating budget of 68 million 
to control costs the league in january dismissed two workers 
one a lobbyist on capitol hill left vacancies unfilled and cut 
back its publications 
officials acknowledge that the changes particularly the 
deemphasis on selected issues have created tensions between 
headquarters and members 
years of declining membership despite the acceptance of men as 
members in 1974 is another problem 
membership grew 10 percent last year reversing a decade of 
decline due primarily to a new but costly directmail campaign to 
solicit members thompson says mailings cost as much as the dues 
they brought in the payoff will come only if those members renew 
membership in the stillpredominately female organization 
reached a peak of about 150000 in the mid1970s and is now about 
107000 
of all its problems and controversies the biggest controversy 
by far was over the debates 
the league has sponsored presidential debates since 1976 
neither the republicans nor the democrats were happy with the way 
the debates had been run and before the 1988 campaign formed the 
commission on presidential debates to serve as a rival sponsor 
the league sponsored two debates during the primary season but 
two more fell through when candidates backed out the campaigns 
agreed to let the league sponsor one of two presidential debates in 
the fall but neuman angrily withdrew the organizations 
sponsorship 11 days before the event saying the bush and dukakis 
campaigns were trying to stifle spontaneity 
the dispute turned bitter 
the league said it would turn over the debate site the shrine 
auditorium in los angeles to the new sponsors for 90000 twice 
the amount it had put down then the party commission charged the 
league hadnt even put down a deposit on the building until it 
announced plans to withdraw 
the commission said that amounted to holding the auditorium 
hostage the new sponsors found a new and rentfree site 
a lot of the people on both the republican and democrat sides 
who had to work with the league in past debates found them very 
very difficult to work with fahrenkopf said 
the league spent all its time hustling money and using it for 
their fundraising it almost became the only thing the league 
existed for any more was to hold the debates fahrenkopf charged 
league officials say they asked for the extra money to cover 
contracts for sets and lighting and said it paid more to withdraw 
from the debates than it would have to let them proceed 
the debate issue hangs over the league still as it looks to 
what neuman sees as a bright future it will continue to sponsor 
local debates in 1990 and neuman says the league will propose 
presidential debates in 1992 
until then she says we will be working to ensure that 
the american public is never again forcefed a campaign as mediocre 
and as patronizing as this one

editors note its another question of whether the feds should 
tell the states what to do and if so who should foot the bill 
this time the debate is about the quality of day care for children 
and when kids are involved emotions run high more than two dozen 
childcare bills are now before congress while president bush has 
some ideas of his own 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
a baby sitter recently saved the lives of 
eight young children by tossing them from the window of her burning 
apartment to the arms of rescuers three stories below 
there was heroism in the tale but it also raised some questions 
should one person have been looking after eight children ranging 
in age from 5 months to 3 years were the children getting the 
individual attention considered vital to healthy child development 
even more basic was the situation safe and whos to blame for day 
care that is abusive hazardous emotionally damaging or 
intellectually barren 
day care for children traditionally has been regulated by the 
individual states now congress is debating whether to enact 
minimum federal standards and force states to toe the line 
no fewer than two dozen childcare bills are pending on capitol 
hill with advocates of federal regulation insisting that some 
states simply are not doing a proper job 
the controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of the 
states was a major factor holding up childcare legislation last 
year and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year 
are states doing the job 
arkansas gov bill clinton who is leading a national governors 
association push for federal incentives instead of requirements 
says the record reflects a significant effort in most states to 
improve childcare standards 
but officials of the childrens defense fund maintain there are 
wide discrepancies in the standards from state to state in some 
states for example a single adult cannot care for more than three 
infants but in idaho a new mandatory licensing system 
theoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants 
the states that are generally moving forward are the ones that 
werent in such bad shape to begin with says helen blank day 
care director for the cdf but we still have a situation where in 
many states licensing standards dont give children the protection 
they need to grow up safe much less give them a good 
developmental experience 
the bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards in 
some states what they call progress makes you a little 
uncomfortable 
meanwhile president bush is pushing for a tax break for 
lowincome families with young children on the premise that it 
gives parents a choice one parent can decide to stay home or the 
family can use the money for the child care of their choice 
bushs plan presumes that parents dont want or need federal 
intrusion in the day care field any federal requirements would 
decrease the supply of care and infringe on parental choice 
backers of the plan contend 
but some parents have told congress they always assumed the 
government regulated child care until tragedy struck their family 
and experts contend that most parents arent qualified to judge day 
care and why should they have to 
we dont ask restaurant patrons to inspect the kitchen for 
violations says dr sue aronson a childcare consultant who 
teaches pediatrics at hahneman university in philadelphia 
there is little disagreement among experts over ideal day care 
conditions for children some are physical such as requiring 
staffers to frequently wash their hands to prevent the spread of 
infectious disease providing immunizations fire extinguishers and 
enough adults on hand to get infants and young toddlers to safety 
in an emergency 
then there is quality warm positive individual onetoone 
interactions between adults and children as described by dr sue 
bredekamp director of professional development at the national 
association for the education of young children 
such interactions have a longterm effect on language 
selfesteem social development and intellectual competence she 
says her group has identified three factors that most influence 
the quality of day care interactions group size the 
stafftochild ratio and staff training 
the federal government operates dozens of day care centers for 
its employees across the country and overseas and many agencies 
without centers are now making onsight child care a priority 
the learning center at the general services administration in 
washington meets or betters nearly all standards recommended by 
professional groups and is serving as a model for that movement 
director pam simon says other centers send their teachers to 
observe the staff and organizers come to find out how to set up 
centers at their agencies we get people coming to look at us all 
the time she said 
bredekamp of the naeyc says proper training might have averted 
the recent death of a 9monthold infant whose nanny banged her 
head against the wall because she would not stop crying we must 
face the very real possibility that the nanny did not know any 
better she says 
training not only can prevent child abuse but also enables 
caregivers to help children grow and learn she says our goal 
is not that children just survive child care we want and need for 
them to thrive in child care 
to that end she says 20 preschoolers and two adults is far 
superior to 40 kids and four adults in terms of noise level 
psychological space and opportunities for individual interactions 
with adults and other children and she says one adult for every 
three or four infants is critical if babies are to be adequately 
held rocked comforted and protected from physical harm 
even states with relatively stringent regulations often fall 
short of standards recommended by professionals 
only 15 states meet naeyc guidelines for infant ratios and group 
size only five meet the guidelines for toddlers and 10 for 
preschoolers nearly half dont require any training or experience 
of day care teachers 
on the health and safety front about half the states dont have 
specific day care center handwashing requirements according to a 
forthcoming study by the american academy of pediatrics and the 
american public health association 
the federally funded study meant to be a comparative report 
card for states also has found that only 6 percent require that 
center children be immunized for meningitis and only 18 percent 
require energy absorbing surfaces below climbing equipment 
although onehalf to twothirds of all injuries occur on 
playgrounds

many state legislatures have agreed to some minimum standards 
but have balked at more stringent regulations urged by some 
agencies 
in idaho for example the state has just instituted a mandatory 
licensing system its first but while the new law requires fire 
and health inspections and criminal history checks it doesnt 
require any education or training of staff members the staffchild 
ratio is 1 to 12 regardless of the ages of the children staffers 
watching no more than six kids are not regulated at all 
the law is less strict than our regulations were under the 
previous law says perry ackerman child care licensing 
coordinator for the state but that was voluntary there wasnt 
any penalty for being unlicensed 
is that progress 
we lost a lot in the area of quality ackerman replies 
but we got a mandatory law after eight or nine attempts i guess 
its progress 
in texas regulations for the states 14000plus family day 
care homes are about to be revised under the current system the 
only qualification for caregivers is that they be 18 years old 
and they can watch up to 12 children depending on their ages one 
mix allows one adult to care for four infants and two toddlers 
another permits six young children and six schoolage siblings 
while texas requires centers to be licensed its much weaker 
registration system for day care homes was highlighted by toddler 
jessica mcclures wellpublicized tumble into an abandoned well 
shaft with six children in her care the baby sitter thought she 
didnt need to register with the state she was wrong 
but even if she had registered the state would have done no 
more than run checks for a criminal record or reports of child 
abuse no one would have visited the house and discovered the well 
shaft in the yard 
its providing a false sense of security to parents says 
cris rosdukler the states assistant commissioner for licensing 
rosdukler says she has unsuccessfully sought money to put teeth 
in the registration process an attempt two years ago to limit 
family day care homes to six children got nowhere she says 
hopes for change at this point turn on raising the minimum 
caregiver age to 21 and requiring training both before and after 
becoming a provider 
at the other end of the spectrum delaware upgraded family day 
care in 1985 and just completed an overhaul of center regulations 
the ratio now is one staffer to four infants health and safety 
requirements are much more stringent caregivers now must 
participate in 15 hours of training a year and expose children to a 
range of daily activities appropriate to their age 
what does delaware have that texas doesnt a healthier economy 
for one thing and a lesshostile attitude toward regulation 
you really have to determine what is the community standard 
that is going to be acceptable says pauline koch delawares 
director of licensing services 
gwen morgan a professor at wheelock college in boston and 
author of the the national state of childcare regulation 
doesnt agree that federal standards are the answer 
im amenable to one federal standard infant care she says 
im convinced that a one to seven infant ratio can have extremely 
harmful effects 
the dangers she says include borderline retardation from lack 
of stimulation increased spread of infectious disease and the 
sheer physical impossibility of exiting a building quickly with 
seven infants 
the federal government should otherwise stay out of the mandate 
business unless they are willing to fork over 20 billion to 30 
billion to help parents and states pay for the upgraded care 
morgan says 
the nations governors agree they are proposing the development 
of national model standards on everything from nutrition and safety 
to staff size training and parental involvement and seeking 
federal financial incentives for states to upgrade their systems 
if the states have incentive grants and after a few years you 
can show me people still doing things that are certifiably bad for 
kids then i personally will be glad to take another look at this 
federal standards issue clinton says 
model standards have failed to influence states in the past and 
hardliners hold little hope of progress even with a federal 
carrot in some states there is such strong opposition to making 
improvements that money incentives will not work says blank the 
childrens defense fund day care director 
blank and her allies note that the states must meet a variety of 
conditions to get federal money for head start school lunches 
nursing homes highways and antipollution projects so why not day 
care 
taxpayers do not want their tax dollars used to place babies 
and children in dangerous situations says joyce strom deputy 
director of the child welfare league of america 
but clinton says mandatory childcare standards would be like 
mandatory elementary school standards we have smaller class 
requirements now in arkansas he says its very expensive 
its very controversial and its very good for atrisk kids im 
glad we did it but i wouldnt recommend it as a national 
standard 
the debate at the clinton household half a continent away from 
the talk on capitol hill has a familiar ring for while clinton 
has been designated lead governor in the nga bid to discourage 
mandated national standards his wife hillary is chairman of the 
childrens defense fund the fiercest standards champion of all 
if it was just the two of us i think we could work it out 
clinton said with a laugh but its not

the critics call it drift and maybe theyre 
right but there certainly is a prevailing current in the early 
course of the bush administration and it leads away from some of 
the policies and positions bequeathed by ronald reagan 
president bush has made those moves carefully and quietly item 
by item he is putting his imprint on major programs supplanting 
and in some cases undoing reagan policies transformations that 
have been taking place with scant notice and only a few complaints 
from conservatives 
thats just fine with the white house bush and his lieutenants 
need no trouble on the republican right where the president never 
was a favorite most of the criticism has been coming from other 
directions much of it from democrats 
still there are some ripples on the right when republican 
national chairman lee atwater spoke at the heritage foundation the 
other night one man complained that bush has moved away from some 
favored conservative positions since the election 
george bush is a conservative atwater replied he said on 
two paramount issues opposition to new taxes and a hard line 
against communism bush is solid and absolute he remains hard 
core on both of those the gop chairman said 
bush denies that his administration is adrift challenging those 
who complain about the pace of administration action he said in 
houston last month 
in this kind of work more is going on than meets the eye or 
makes the headlines the proof will come when we look back from the 
year 2000 
hes also countered by joking about the criticism people say 
im indecisive he said last week presidential pause i dont 
know about that 
some started saying that the white house didnt have an 
agenda said vice president dan quayle we have an agenda its 
just that when ronald reagan left he took it with him 
jokes aside if reagan came back he may not recognize some of 
that agenda 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater who served both 
men says the reagantobush revisions are in approach not in 
goals he says they differ at the margin not on the basics 
from the outset bush has said he envisioned no radical change 
in course from the administration he served as vice president 
nevertheless some reagan positions have been retired since he 
did 
bushs agreement with the democrats on aid to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels is a prime example the administration has agreed to 
seek only nonmilitary aid only through next february and subject 
to congressional committee veto since congress has rejected 
military aid the net result is similar to what reagan got but 
administration policy now is to seek diplomatic answers in central 
america rather than look to military ones 
secretary of state james a baker iii who negotiated the deal 
with congress acknowledged the failure of reagan policy we all 
have to admit that the policy failed to some extent because we were 
not united he said we had an executive branch going in one 
direction and a congress going in the other 
on the domestic agenda the bush administration has embraced a 
compromise version of a bill which reagan pocket vetoed to 
protect federal employees who blow the whistle on waste abuse and 
mismanagement the compromise might have satisfied reagan he never 
said 
the reagan administration opposed any increase in the 335 
hourly minimum wage the bush administration has endorsed an 
increase tied to a lowerthanminimum training wage for new 
workers congressional democrats want a higher minimum and a more 
restricted training wage thats still in dispute and the 
administration has talked of a veto unless there is a satisfactory 
compromise 
bush also has moved away from the reagan position on the 
question of gun controls which also was his own a flat no the 
administration on wednesday widened its import ban on foreignmade 
assault rifles and an official said it is considering a proposal 
that gun buyers register such weapons 
even those modest moves drew the standard protests from the gun 
lobby despite the growing sense of crisis over drugrelated 
violence in american cities and the murder of five children in a 
stockton calif schoolyard 
atwater told his conservative audience that bush remains opposed 
to gun control despite the moves against assault rifles on which 
he said there is growing public sentiment in favor of limits 
if the conservative position is proassault rifle youd 
better get out and start moving around to hear the public outcry 
atwater said

theyre called the heartbeat of new orleans 
and in music circles the neville brothers are known as 
musicians musicians 
for over 30 years the neville name has been synonymous with all 
the traditions of the crescent city their sound is culled from a 
gumbo of styles jazz caribbean african cajun rock funk 
resulting in music as distinctive as new orleans itself charles 
neville who plays saxophone calls it new orleans rhythm and blues 
the brothers art aaron charles and cyril worked 
individually for more than two decades before they finally merged 
their diverse talents in 1977 after several albums and a twoyear 
interlude the band has just released their new album yellow 
moon 
the collection including eight original songs is perhaps their 
most political and personal album one in which they express their 
concern for social issues 
the albums first single sister rosa is a tribute to rosa 
parks who became one of the catalysts for the civil rights 
movement in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat for a white 
person on a segregated bus in montgomery ala the rapreggae 
number written and performed by percussionist cyril reflects the 
albums overall theme to educate people by increasing their 
awareness 
if you dont learn from history it tends to repeat itself 
because it can definitely happen again said art the keyboardist 
look at the neonazis and skinheads added cyril wearing a 
stop apartheid button we want to give youth a chance to look 
at each other on their own terms rather than how it was in the 
last generation who had a certain amount of fear and hatred pumped 
into them before they got a chance to look at people and decide for 
themselves 
we want to convey to youth that they dont have to be 
superhuman or smart to make a change for the better in the world 
my blood another song by cyril speaks about the roots of 
oppression with particular mention of south africans haitians and 
native americans 
theres also a remake of sam cookes a change is gonna come 
and two bob dylan covers the ballad of hollis brown and with 
god on our side although aaron and cyril trade off as lead 
vocalists on most of the album art gets the chance to belt out 
fire and brimstone with the same enthusiasm he seems to have 
for life in general charles is heard prominently on the 
instrumental healing chant 
there is a tenuous and harmonious thread to yellow moon 
partly due to producer daniel lanois peter gabriel u2 recording 
style he used a new orleans apartment instead of a studio 
his method of recording is to build the studio around the 
artist rather than force the artist to conform to some existing 
environment charles said 
the nickname for the studio became the swamp cyril said 
with a laugh a whole atmosphere was created which you are able 
to hear on the record 
jonathan demme something wild married to the mob 
directed the video for sister rosa the filmmaker shares the 
musicians interest in haiti after working with artists there and 
hearing cyril sing my blood demme wanted american artists to 
go to haiti to perform 
but he didnt want it to be like a sun city said cyril 
referring to the socalled integrated music venue in south africa 
he wanted people with more similar roots and backgrounds the 
brothers and demme are working on a video with the haitian band les 
freres parent 
the brothers musical roots go back to the 50s art was part of 
the hawkettes in 1954 when they recorded the legendary new orleans 
anthem mardi gras mambo in the 1970s he helped form the 
meters a funk group with great impact on fellow musicians and such 
new bands as the police 
charles was busy touring with big mac bell bobby blue bland 
and bb king aaron had a top 10 hit in 1967 with tell it like 
it is cyril was involved in his own band before he joined art 
with the meters in europe who were touring with the rolling stones 
when charles and aaron joined the meters to record the wild 
tchoupitoulas album it was the first time in years the brothers 
had all played together 
it happened so easily and beautifully and we were so proud of 
the finished product said cyril so they decided to form the 
neville brothers 
although their popularity stems from their hometown of new 
orleans they initially didnt have a large following as a group 
we used to play tipitinas you could blow it up and get no 
one but the neville brothers art recalled but were just 
enjoying it as it happens tipitinas is a popular new orleans 
music hall and was featured in the film the big easy along 
with the neville brothers music 
after the release of their first album the neville 
brothers the group took off their 1981 fiyo on the bayou 
was a critical and commercial success rolling stones guitarist 
keith richards called it the best album of that year but their 
1987 uptown didnt quite make it even devoted fans felt it was 
an attempt at mass appeal yellow moon should dispel any doubts 
of the brothers integrity 
a cinemax special in may will include such guests as bonnie 
raitt gregg allman buckwheat zydeco jimmy buffett john hiatt 
and tv journalist ed bradley who will perform sixty minute man 
with the brothers bradley is one of many fans who has danced with 
wild abandon at a neville brothers concert our music is 
definitely dance music thats the way to respond to it said 
charles the same energy we put out is recycled through the 
audience in a place with no dance floor theres less energy 
coming back from the audience

the tanker exxon valdez was freed 
wednesday from the reef that ripped its hull and spilled more than 
10 million gallons of crude oil and alaskas governor asked the 
coast guard to take over the cleanup from exxon 
elsewhere the captain of the exxon valdez surrendered to police 
and was ordered held on 1 million bond 
cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaisethick oil from prince 
william sound but progress was slow and the oil had spread over an 
area larger than delaware the animal death toll rose and salmon 
hatcheries remained endangered 
in juneau alaska gov steve cowper said he asked coast guard 
rear adm edward nelson jr to take over the muchmaligned and 
slowly progressing cleanup effort from exxon and nelson indicated 
he would although he has not formally approved the request 
cowper said the coast guard should be better able to handle 
coordination and management of the cleanup than exxon which he 
said was too bureaucratic 
maybe thats been the problem all along you need a military 
system to get things done the governor said 
we appreciate the efforts of exxon we think they were done 
in good faith but we think there has to be a much more disciplined 
management structure cowper said at a capitol news conference 
president bush earlier had sent a team of highlevel officials 
to valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup 
wasnt necessary cowper said coast guard management is different 
from the plan bush rejected 
although cowper said he didnt want to be extremely critical 
of exxon a letter sent to the coast guard by a state environmental 
official said exxon had been unresponsive 
exxon has failed to provide the information necessary to 
make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil 
and the protection of resources wrote lynn kent chief of the 
state oil and hazardous substance spill response section 
exxon spokesman henry beathard said the company disagreed with 
charges it wasnt handling the cleanup properly and thought exxon 
was the best organization to manage the effort 
we gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup we 
think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this 
project is for exxon to continue beathard said 
fired tanker captain joseph hazelwood 42 surrendered to police 
on new yorks long island and a judge set bail at 1 million bond 
or 500000 in cash up from a prosecutors recommendation of 
25000 he had been sought since saturday on a fugitive warrant on 
misdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk 
these misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been 
equaled at least in this country judge kenneth rohl said as 
hazelwood was arraigned hes got to think about that we have a 
manmade destruction that has not been equaled probably since 
hiroshima 
salvage crews pumped compressed air into the 125 million ship 
and floated it off bligh reef 25 miles from the port of valdez 
from there it began a 30mile journey under the control of six 
tugs to a remote cove off naked island for temporary repairs 
picking its way through scattered icebergs 
no pollution was immediately visible theres a real good 
possibility oil sheen will show up but theyre ready for it 
coast guard spokesman rick meidt said 
the ship was refloated at 1035 am hours before the tide 
reached its peak wednesday 
it was not just a stroke of good luck said gary gorski 
exxons salvage coordinator it took a lot of hard work 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi said the company has 
talked with dry docks in south korea japan and singapore about 
accepting the vessel after the temporary repairs are made 
first choice is a portland ore dry dock iarossi said but 
oregon officials have raised concerns about accepting the ship 
iarossi said the ship wont trail any pollution while it is towed 
oil has floated over 2600 square miles soiled 800 miles of 
beach and killed thousands of animals including at least 30 sea 
otters officials said 
dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them 
said fish and game spokesman jon lyman 
favorable weather however has kept it offshore from a national 
park and additional coastline outside prince william sound 
flow through the alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily 
flow of 21 million barrels wednesday the alyeska pipeline service 
co said oil flow from the north slope had been cut by 60 percent 
because the spill restricted tanker traffic in valdez harbor but 
traffic has increased 
in washington sen alan cranston and rep mel levine accused 
the federal government of covering up the possibility of a major 
spill and the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology the california 
democrats also asked president bush to cancel oil leasing off the 
california coast pending a review of the program 
hazelwood turned himself in with three attorneys in hauppauge 
ny and was arraigned his lawyer said he had not decided whether 
to waive extradition proceedings and return to alaska to face the 
charges 
hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the 
influence of alcohol reckless endangerment and negligent discharge 
of oil the charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2 years in 
prison and a 10000 fine 
fbi officials in washington say they also are investigating 
whether hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the 
clean water act which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants 
into navigable waters 
hazelwood was fired by exxon a week ago after the national 
transportation safety board said tests taken about nine hours after 
the disaster showed he was drunk 
hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had 
his license suspended three times his mother has told the 
associated press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that 
exxon was aware of his drinking problem 
exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and 
now requires crews to be aboard ship where drinking is prohibited 
four hours before sailing 
one hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages 
including 40 on tuesday alone the claims have come mostly from 
fishermen exxon has settled only two so far at least 14 lawsuits 
have been filed

any sale of strikecrippled eastern airlines 
could eventually hurt the airline and sister carrier continental 
airlines but texas air corp and its chairman frank lorenzo may 
reap millions analysts say 
some analysts believe a sale of easterns assets and other 
advantages lorenzo has gained during texas airs three years of 
ownership of the airline would produce a sizable profit despite 
easterns heavy losses and long list of creditors texas air bought 
eastern in 1986 for 600 million 
our position is that hell come out of the deal all right as 
far as eastern is concerned but what we are concerned about in the 
long term is these airlines continuing position in the industry 
louis marckesano an airline analyst for janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia said wednesday 
i still think there was a potential merger there between 
continental and eastern that could have made a viable carrier in 
the 90s but i think either one of these carriers by themselves 
may have a hard row to hoe in the future marckesano said 
an investor group headed by former baseball commisoner peter 
v ueberroth reportedly was in the fdnesday of 
negotiations to buy eastern from texas air but the deal hit a snag 
texas air agreed last week to sell easterns prized northeast 
shuttle operation to new york developer donald j trump for 355 
million 
analysts said that since eastern is in bankruptcy reorganizd has creditors 
waiting to collect millions its still hard to 
gauge just how much texas air would gain from ae 
any eastern sale would hto be approved by the airlines 
unsecured creditors committee which includes rntatives of 
the eastern unions and by us bankruptcy judge burton lifland 
but marckesano estimates that houstonbased texas air could see 
an overall profit of more than 100 million from its threeyear 
ownership based on expected proceeds from the sale of eastern and 
from revenues received during its ownership 
that gain would be on top of the increased value of ehat texas air 
acquired from the airline such as the former 
eastern computerized reservation sys merged with 
continentals to form system one the system is used by many travel 
agencies 
the immediate impact will be that mr lorenzo will get someh out 
of it and i fully expect that whatever fale 
takes that will be the case said robertn airline 
analyst with duff amp phelps inc in ch 
the amount of profit for texas air will depend partly on whether 
a buyout includes assumpterns debts decker said 
it also was uncether lorenzo would use any such profit 
to strengthen continental which lost 2581 million in 1987 and 
3155 million in 1988 
continentave messing declined to comment wednesday 
on thtial effects of an eastern sale texas air spokesman 
art kent did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
some experts said that even if an eastern sale raised money to 
help pay off texas air debt it might not go too far in helping the 
companys remaining operations 
continental is pretty debtridden themselves said severin 
borenstein an airst and economist at the university of 
michigan it doesnt look like theyre going to start reporting 
in the soon and unless they eventually turn things 
around they may nlong for this world 
marckesano also cast doubts on continentals future 
just to keep up with wha in companies like delta 
or american or northwest where they have 10 billion to 20 
billion worth of equipt on order is going to be extremely 
difficult marckesano said 
with eastern gone maybe they will concentrate on pouring 
capital into continental he said but i dont have much 
confidence in the surviving management of texas air that they will 
do the right thing to make continental a strong competitor in the 
future

two major oil companies have limited gasoline 
deliveries to wholesale distributors in western states in what one 
spokesman called the first us gas rationing since the arab oil 
embargo of the early 1970s 
spokesmen for shell oil co and chevron corp said wednesday 
that the rationing was to prevent the hoarding of gasoline in the 
wake of the alaska oil spill 
shell spokesman bill gibson in houston texas said in a 
telephone interview that is was the first gasoline rationing he 
could recall since the arab oil embargo of 197374 
gibson said shells decision to put a cap on its deliveries to 
wholesalers in washington oregon california idaho utah nevada 
and arizona was a result of excessive buying by those distributors 
in the last week 
some of our western regional wholesalers began buying 
excessive amounts of gasoline last week and this program is 
strictly in response to that said gibson adding he didnt have 
specific purchase details immediately available 
he denied shells supply management program was put into 
effect because of shortages in crude supplies 
he said most of the crude for west coast shell refineries 
located at anacortes wash martinez calif and los angeles 
comes from sources other than alaska 
the decision to limit sales to 90 percent of the gasoline the 
wholesalers purchased in april 1988 went into effect monday and 
will remain until shell decides its no longer necessary he said 
he said he did not know why shell chose 90 percent as its figure 
the wholesalers rushed to purchase gasoline after the tanker 
exxon valdez slammed into rocks in alaskas prince william sound on 
march 24 dumping more than 10 million gallons of crude in what 
became the nations worst oil spill 
chevron began its rationing just three days after the accident 
in anticipation of steppedup gasoline purchases said company 
spokesman mike libbey in san francisco 
on march 27 chervon began to limit deliveries to 100 percent of 
contract agreements to make sure thered be enough gasoline to go 
around libbey said 
the cost of gasoline in the seattle area has climbed about 8 
cents a gallon in the last three weeks the biggest hikes having 
occurred since the spill 
gibson would not comment on whether the 90 percent allotments 
helped to increase wholesale and gasolinepump prices 
but libbey said it was clear that the valdez spill translated 
into a 4cent to 7cent hike in chevrons price per gallon to 
retailers 
major west oast refineries rely heavily on alaska oil to masoline and 
other products the pipeline from alah slope 
to valdez usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day but 
that was reduced to 800000 barrels a day after the spill limited 
tanker loadings at the port 
cclaimed to have no problem with crude supplies to 
its major wesst refineries in the san francisco and los 
angeles areas 
chevron hasnt had to limit refinery activity at all libbey i 
gather from what i hear that the independents smaller 
oil companies are squeezed more tightly than we a they 
dont have the resources we have and room to maneuver 
exxon in houston said it would not be able to provide 
infomation on whether it has a similar gasoline dist effect until sometime 
today and information from other major 
il companies wasnt immediately available 
shells deliveries to retail gasoline stations served directly 
are not affected by the cap because those stations cant 
keep much gasoline in storage gibson said 
he did not know how much of shells gasoline in western states 
goes as opposed to retailers 
once operations are returned to normal in alaska gasoline 
prices will start dropping but not by much he said most of the 
increases consumers have seen since the new year are the result of 
a decision last fall by the opec nations to limit production and 
he added the popular summer driving season is approaching meaning 
demand will stay high and keep prices up

the stock of nwa inc rose 350 to a 
recordhigh 8725 a share after oil mogul marvin davis said his 
262 billion proposal to buy the parent of northwest airlines 
would not require selling the carriers main assets 
we do not intend to bust up the company and our planned 
financing will not necessitate the sale of any of the companys 
strategic assets davis said in a letter he sent to nwas board 
of directors tuesday and released to the media wednesday 
more than 25 million shares of nwa stock changed hands 
wednesday 
the los angelesbased billionaire whose holdings include real 
estate and entertainment properties owns about 3 percent of nwas 
291 million shares and offered to pay 90 a share for nwa stock in 
a letter last week to company directors 
with the equity we are prepared to commit and the anticipated 
structure of the balance of the financing the companys projected 
cash flow is adequate to service the debt involved the second 
letter said 
davis said in the letter that his group is prepared to 
increase the price of our offer in the context of a negotiated 
transaction 
a spokesman for the nations fourthlargest air carrier based 
in suburban eagan confirmed receipt of the letter but said the 
company would not comment 
northwest chairman steven rothmeier has said the directors will 
review the offer but he has not said when 
the airline has said it intends to remain independent state 
officials have rallied behind the carrier introducing legislation 
intended to thwart a hostile takeover 
in washington minnesota gov rudy perpich and rep james 
oberstar dminn met with northwest representatives wednesday and 
spoke later by telephone with davis afterward they told reporters 
they still opposed the billionaires offer 
perpich and oberstar chairman of the house aviation 
subcommittee said they remained concerned that davis would have to 
sell parts of the airline to finance the deal they said that might 
result in layoffs and in northwest moving its service hub from 
minneapolisst paul international airport 
guy cook chairman of international association of machinists 
district lodge 143 said he remains suspicious of davis offer 
because davis has not provided specifics about how he would finance 
it 
i believe he has a history of buying and selling companies 
said cook who heads the union representing twothirds of 
northwests 35000 employees he has ownership for a period of 
time and then he sells it off 
kurt rivard a financial analyst for minneapolisbased dain 
bosworth inc said the increase in nwas stock price wednesday 
suggests confidence on the part of investors that a higher bid is 
on its way 
it could come from davis it could come from northwest it 
could come from somewhere else rivard said 
before davis made his offer the company disclosed a separate 
group of investors was interested in buying nwa the identity of 
that group which said it owns 49 percent of the stock has not 
been disclosed 
davis repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he 
intends to expand the airlines domestic and international routes 
and keep the headquarters in minnesota he also said his plans call 
for no employee layoffs workforce reductions or alterations in 
seniority schedules 
the letter said northwest management would be retained but also 
said we intend to effect only those management changes required 
to improve nwas performance 
analysts have said a takeover could impair northwests fleet 
modernization plans because davis would have to sell assets and 
cuts operating costs to service takeover debt but davis said in 
his letter that the acquisition plan in no way calls for the 
reduction of the companys present capital investment program 
northwest has discussed profitsharing and stock ownership plans 
with its unions for more than a year analysts have said an 
employee stock ownership plan could help the carrier defend itself 
against a takeover by putting more stock in friendly hands

when the tanker exxon valdez hit the 
rocks so did alaskas marriage of convenience with the oil 
industry 
but despite the environmental and economic damage wrought by the 
nations worst oil spill alaska is unlikely to divorce itself from 
an industry whose taxes fund 85 percent of state services 
elected officials and political observers say the relationship 
instead will be marked by greater mistrust and skepticism and 
future oil development in alaska may be curtailed 
i guarantee alaska wont have the same trust in the industry 
that it had in the past senate president tim kelly said tuesday 
were going to take the missouri attitude show me 
the sentiment expressed by kelly a prodevelopment anchorage 
republican and longtime industry supporter has been heard 
throughout the state capitol since the good friday spill 
the spill is going to change the political chemistry in 
alaska gov steve cowper said its probably too early to 
assess what changes will take place however it is clear that 
people are not likely to trust statements that the industry makes 
on their face for a long time to come 
legislators say the industry which for years assured alaskans 
it could handle a massive oil spill quickly has lost its 
credibility 
the fullfaithandcredit type of attitude toward their 
operation is going to change warned democratic rep ben 
grussendorf 
after construction of the transalaska oil pipeline in the 
mid1970s alaska began cashing in on its abundant petroleum 
reservoirs rushing to bring its villages many of the modern 
conveniences taken for granted in the lower 48 
oil brought telephone service to even alaskas most remote 
areas dozens of schools and community buildings a state 
television network water and sewer systems airports and roads 
most of all it brought money lots of money 
alaska is the only state that annually pays its residents just 
for living there last year each alaskan got a dividend of 
827 from interest earned by the state permanent fund a 10 
billion savings account derived from oil money for a family of 
four that meant 3308 
the flood of oil money also allowed the state to repeal its 
income tax in 1980 theres no state sales tax 
most people in alaska are aware that the oil industry brings 
benefits and detriments cowper said weve enjoyed the 
benefits over the years now were seeing the detriments 
bill glude executive director of the alaska environmental 
lobby said he was surprised how widespread the sense of betrayal 
has become 
we dont like to make the goose that lays the golden egg 
uncomfortable suddenly the industry has laid a black egg and were 
not too enchanted with the goose glude said 
i think a lot of people are ready to declare their 
independence from big oil were seeing a lot of recognition that 
the state is entirely too dependent on the oil industry for its 
revenue and economic base 
many observers however doubt alaskas dependence on its 
natural resources will end as long as theres vast amounts of oil 
minerals and timber to be sold in the nations largest state 
resource development is so intimately linked with our history 
and our future said rep fran ulmer a democrat we are a 
resourcerich state and our resources are what produce jobs what 
produce income and sufficient revenue to support services alaskans 
have come to expect 
ulmer and other legislators predict that as a result of the 
spill the state will toughen its environmental laws provide more 
money to monitor compliance with those laws and demand more proof 
of environmental safeguards 
lawmakers already have jumped on the new antioil bandwagon 
legislation introduced tuesday in the senate would tax oil 
companies to pay for protection of state land against spills and 
what appeared to be a losing campaign by cowper to increase the 
states oilproduction tax has new life 
the fallout from the valdez spill also may dampen development 
overall in what has always been a prodevelopment state one that 
bills itself as the last frontier 
i think the development spirit in alaska is going to be much 
more cautious than before the oil spill kelly said 
state officials still largely favor new oil exploration and 
development but the spill provides new ammunition to 
environmentalists an end to oil drilling eventually would dry up 
the estimated 4 million of oil revenues that flow into the state 
treasury daily 
democrat cowper and the states allrepublican congressional 
delegation have been lobbying congress to open a portion of the 
vast arctic national wildlife refuge for oil exploration in the 
wake of the spill the chances of gaining congressional approval 
appear slim 
i dont think it will make it impossible to get an anwr bill 
through the congress cowper said i just think it will be 
extraordinarily difficult

a new effort by the internal revenue service 
to spot errors and taxavoidance schemes without a formal audit has 
turned up considerable evidence of apparent noncompliance with 
several provisions in the new tax law 
in some cases the irs says taxpayers are ignoring the 
limitation on deducting miscellaneous itemized expenses such as 
union dues others are overlooking new restrictions on deducting 
personal and investment interest some are circumventing 
complicated requirements on the treatment of losses from rentals 
and passive investment activities 
the irs is concentrating on those four issues because they 
underwent significant change in the 1986 tax overhaul show up on 
numerous returns and have the potential for yielding substantial 
amounts of money for the government rick hayes of the irs said in 
an interview wednesday 
the irs is looking at 1987 and 1988 tax returns to determine how 
much revenue is being lost and how forms and instructions could be 
changed to eliminate confusion and opportunity for cheating 
rather than waiting for barely 1 percent of returns to make 
their way through the formal audit procedure which can be as long 
as two years after returns are processed the irs has set up teams 
in each of the 10 regional service centers to make spot checks as 
soon as returns are filed 
a big goal in the effort is to not only correct the returns that 
are checked but also to make the public aware of what mistakes are 
being made with regularity and how to avoid them 
when we see things on the return that are not allowable we 
want first to get that information to taxpayers through 
publicaffairs channels during the filing season said hayes 
who directs irs research on audit planning 
we want to fix as many of these things as we can without doing 
audits on people he said if we can do these as part of 
returns processing thats what we want to do 
the agency is studying several thousands of returns for 1987 
the first year that most of the major tax changes went into effect 
those returns were filed in 1988 about 150000 1988 returns which 
are due by april 17 are being checked 
as much as anything else the new program is an attempt by the 
irs to see how people are reacting to the 1986 law which by some 
calculations represented the biggest change in the federal income 
tax since it was enacted in 1913 
there were so many changes designed to close loopholes and 
reduce deductions explained irs spokesman paul nerdlinger we 
need to know how people are taking it are the changes 
misunderstood are people aware they have lost some deductions but 
are still intent on taking them 
one of the big changes affects millions of itemizers who were 
accustomed to fully deducting union dues business publications and 
similar miscellaneous expenses under the new law only the portion 
of such expenses with a few exceptions that exceeds 2 percent of 
adjusted gross income may be deducted 
the spot check of 1987 returns found many taxpayers ignored the 
2 percent floor others deducted expenses that did not qualify 
such as personal attorney fees 
another major change limited to 65 percent the portion of 
personal interest such as on credit cards and education loans 
that could be deducted for 1987 similar restrictions were imposed 
on investment interest spot checks indicated many taxpayers had 
circumvented those restrictions by deducting the interest as a 
business expense on schedule c 
similarly hayes said some filers have tried to dodge 
limitations on deducting passive losses and rental losses by 
writing them off as business losses on schedule c 
on returns filed this year the irs has found many taxpayers 
still trying to avoid the limitation on deducting personal 
interest other areas of noncompliance on current returns hayes 
said include claiming too much depreciation for automobiles used 
in business and attempting to avoid the 80 percent limit on 
deducting businessrelated meals and entertainment

the bush administration is allying itself with 
the automobile industry and opposing congressional efforts to set 
deadlines for the government to issue new motor vehicle safety 
requirements 
barry felrice the national highway traffic safety 
administrations associate administrator for rulemaking told the 
senate commerce consumer subcommittee the agency opposes 
legislation that would give it a oneyear deadline to issue the new 
safety requirements 
the provisions in the new bill requiring us to initiate or 
complete these actions within prescriptive time frames are overly 
restrictive said felrice who said his testimony had been 
approved by the bush administration 
he said work on safety regulations doesnt lend itself to easy 
solutions 
officials from the nations three major automakers general 
motors corp chrysler motors corp and the ford motor co also 
voiced opposition to a deadline for new rules 
id hate to see us get into a mode where time frames dictate 
the incorporation of technology robert munson fords automotive 
safety director told the panel 
the agencys opposition to the proposals came as a 
disappointment to lawmakers of both parties on the subcommittee and 
to consumer activists in the room who said they had hoped the bush 
administration would adopt a more sympathetic approach to motor 
vehicle safety proposals 
i think nhtsa is the comic book example of a federal 
regulatory agency that does nothing said an angry sen john 
danforth rmo 
subcommittee chairman richard bryan dnev complained that the 
agencys rulemaking process has a longer gestation period than 
anything known in the laws of nature 
bryan danforth and several other senators have introduced a 
bill ordering the safety administration to require automakers to 
strengthen vehicles to better withstand side impact crashes in 
which nearly onethird of all deaths of auto occupants occur 
the agency would also have to require head restraints mounted 
rear brake lights and other safety features for pickup trucks and 
minivans a fastgrowing market in addition the agency would have 
to require manufacturers to produce bumpers that can prevent major 
damage to a car traveling at 5 mph 
the reagan administration had opposed regulations in all those 
areas in 1982 the safety administration rolled back the bumper 
standard from 5 mph to 25 mph 
the safety administration already has work under way dealing 
with side impact crashes for cars and head restraints for light 
trucks felrice said 
he also opposed two new requirements in the bill that minivans 
and pickup trucks be built to better prevent rollovers and that 
car seats used by young children be improved he said the agency is 
already studying both problems 
the bill seems to have us begin rulemaking before we complete 
the research he said 
the safety administration established in 1966 to set vehicle 
safety standards and investigate defects came under frequent 
criticism during the reagan years by lawmakers who accused the 
agency of stifling safety initiatives 
felrice who is not a political appointee testified because the 
agency has no administrator the bush white house has said it will 
nominate jerry r curry a retired army general who was defeated in 
a bid for congress from virginia last fall for the job

robert a rogers gms director of automotive safety 
engineering told members of a subcommittee of the senate committee 
on commerce science and transportation on wednesday that gm plans 
to equip about 500000 90model cars with air bags

40 percent with the 1989 model year and will reach 100 percent with 
1990model cars 
driverside air bags will be standard equipment on the 1990 
buick reatta and riviera cadillac allante deville eldorado 
fleetwood and seville chevrolet camaro and corvette geo storm and 
metro convertible oldsmobile toronado and pontiac firebird gm 
said in a news release 
the devices will be optional on the oldsmobile 88 royale and 98 
regency the statement said 
all other 1990model passenger cars will be equipped with 
automatic lapandshoulder safety belts gm said the automaker 
said it planned to phase in a passengerside air bag during the 
early 1990s 
gm currently offers optional driverside air bags on its 1989 
oldsmobile 88 royale and 98 regency and cadillac deville and 
fleetwood models the statement said the devices cost about 850 
each 
chrysler corp has said it will equip all of its 1990model cars 
with driverside air bags air bags currently are standard on some 
of its dodge chrysler and plymouth models

attorneys for michael milken have asked the us 
supreme court to consider removing the judge in charge of the 
settlement of insider trading charges against the deposed bond 
financier and his former employer drexel burnham lambert inc 
meanwhile unnamed sources quoted by the wall street journal 
today said david solomon chief investment officer of solomon asset 
management was negotiating with prosecutors to cooperate in the 
governments case against milken he would be the first drexel 
client to testify against milken should he become a witness 
the investigation is believed to focus on allegations of 
parking of junk bonds and stocks by solomons company 
according to the journal when parking occurs securities are bought 
with the understanding that theyll be sold back to the original 
owner usually at a prearranged time and price the process is 
intended to hide their true ownership to avoid tax or disclosure 
obligations 
the petition filed wednesday asks the court to hear their appeal 
of a lower court decision allowing us district judge milton 
pollack to preside over the securities and exchange commissions 
lawsuit against drexel and milken 
lawyers for milken and his brother lowell who also was named in 
the sec suit filed last september claim pollack should be 
disqualified because his wife stands to make 30 million from a 
leveraged buyout drexel helped finance 
they allege the transaction represents a conflict of interest 
for pollack who must approve any final settlement between drexel 
and the sec 
the milkens were charged last week with a range of criminal 
securities law violations in a 98count racketeering and fraud 
indictment that capped a twoyear government investigation a bond 
hearing on the charges in which the government is seeking 18 
billion in penalties is set for friday 
michael milken headed drexels californiabased highyield junk 
bond division and made a reported 550 million in 1987 before 
stepping down after the indictment to prepare his defense 
the supreme court petition came after the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals in late february refused to rehear a bid to remove 
pollack from the case but that court did grant a stay against 
pollack issuing any rulings 
the sec settlement is a crucial precondition to resolving 
criminal securities fraud charges against drexel the firm in 
december agreed to pay 650 million and plead guilty to six 
felonies to settle the criminal charges with the manhattan us 
attorneys office 
negotiations between drexel and the sec hit a roadblock last 
month over the federal governments demand to fire milken before 
the pact was reached that condition though may be be moot since 
milken has left the firm 
a majority of the 12member appeals court rejected a bid to 
allow the full panel to hear the case against pollack but in a 
dissent four judges said the the case would continue under a 
cloud if pollack were allowed to preside 
both a district court judge and a threemember appeals court 
panel also rejected dismissing pollack 
were faced with a situation where we are in a litigation with 
a potentially adversarial party namely drexel where that party 
was responsible for 30 million going to the wife of the judge 
said michael armstrong attorney for lowell milken 
we think that is a perception that merits the judge stepping 
aside he said 
michael milkens lawyers also are challenging the criminal fraud 
settlement in federal court saying it violates his rights by 
forcing the firm to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay of more than 
100 million

a group of hong kong employers on thursday 
urged the government to import foreign workers to ease the british 
colonys acute labor shortage 
the joint associations working group said importing workers is 
essential to avoiding an inflationary spiral and an erosion of hong 
kongs ability to compete with its asian neigbors 
the group estimated hong kong needs about 50000 imported 
workers most of them unskilled to help fill what it estimated 
were 200000 job vacancies 
the groups chairman martin barrow a senior executive at 
jardine matheson holdings ltd said there was a great danger that 
hong kong could lose its competitiveness in the manufacturing 
sector the hotel industry and elsewhere because of the shortage 
of workers 
the hong kong government announced on tuesday that it was 
considering easing restrictions on the employment of foreign 
laborers under existing policy only foreign workers with skills 
not available locally are allowed to work in the colony 
hong kongs unemployment rate currently running at 13 percent 
is considered to be a key factor behind the economys growth 
slowing to an expected 6 percent this year less than half the 1987 
rate 
the labor shortage is due to the combination of a steady brain 
drain as the colony approaches its return to chinese sovereignty in 
1997 and tight immigration laws 
while emphasizing that there are no viable alternatives to 
importing workers the report said the government should help 
encourage automation and productivity through tax breaks and 
reducing red tape 
it said bringing in workers on sixmonth to twoyear contracts 
under a system similar to that practiced in singapore would be the 
best way to provide relief the group also suggested the 
possibility of hong kong industry using workers that commute daily 
from china 
the ninemember group included the chinese general chamber of 
commerce the federation of hong kong industries the hong kong 
tourist association and the textile council of hong kong

usair has told the teamsters it would begin 
negotiating with the union on a contract for some 4000 fleet 
service workers in 101 cities according to a newspaper report 
but the airline hasnt dropped its opposition to the teamsters 
which narrowly won an election last december to expand its 
representation of fleet services workers from 1900 in four cities 
to the entire usair system todays pittsburgh postgazette said 
usair told a us district court in alexandria va that it 
would appeal last fridays dismissal of a lawsuit it filed 
challenging the national mediation boards decision to certify the 
union as representing the 4000 workers 
the nations seventhlargest airline said through spokesman 
david clark that it would bargain in good faith as it pursues the 
suit which accuses the board of failing to investigate alleged 
election improprieties 
bill genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
called the companys decision to bargain for all 4000 baggage 
handlers air freight handlers and catering employees a victory 
for them to come out and say they would recognize 101 cities 
they were eating crow he told a packed membership meeting 
wednesday at a motel near the greater pittsburgh international 
airport 
prior to the december election which the teamsters won by only 
a fourvote margin the union had represented 1900 workers at 
airports in pittsburgh philadelphia boston and buffalo ny 
the election gave the union the right to extend its 
representation to 900 former employees of pacific southwest 
airlines who lost their teamster affiliation when the west coast 
carrier was merged into usair last year and to another 1200 
previously unorganized workers at smaller usair stations 
the teamsters currently working under a contract that has been 
open for amendment since july 1987 also are asking a federal court 
to order usair to grant the union access to work sites and employee 
records and to set up a grievance procedure for those not 
previously represented genoese said 
the union is seeking elimination of a twotier wage system and 
retroactive pay increases of 10 percent annually 
usair has offered 3 percent wage hikes and some benefit 
improvements according to the union but wants to maintain the 
lower rate scale for workers hired after may 1985

announced today 
the department also said however that airlines did not do as 
well in february this year as they did last year when it came to

a house subcommittee today approved a bill 
that would remove remaining price controls from natural gas on jan 
1 1993 
approval by the energy and power subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee came on a voice vote sending the 
bill to the full committee a similar bill has been introduced in 
the senate 
the subcommittees action ratified a consensus achieved earlier 
this year in backroom negotiations among all the major factions 
involved in what has sometimes been one of the most bitter fights 
in congress 
from 33 percent to 40 percent of all natural gas which supplies 
roughly a quarter of the nations energy needs is still sold at 
controlled prices 
the controls established in 1954 have evolved through several 
control schemes since then a partial decontrol in 1985 confounded 
many observers when it was followed by a price collapse driving 
some well operators to accept prices below their ceilings 
the gas still under controls comes from wells that were in 
production in 1977 the average march spot price in producing 
states as reported by the newsletter natural gas intelligence was 
144 per thousand cubic feet contracts for pre1977 gas range 
down to about 30 cents per thousand cubic feet 
a 1978 bill established several price categories for gas 
discovered after that date some of which became free of controls 
in 1985 
the federal energy regulatory commission allowed the 
lowerpriced categories of the rest of the post1978 gas to rise to 
the highest price which was above the market price

members of the house banking committee today 
began writing legislation to bail out the troubled savings and loan 
industry as sampl regulators underscored the urgency of the situation 
by announcing that deposit withdrawals remained at nearrecord 
levels in february 
the federal home loan bank board announced that depositors 
withdrew 94 billion from sampls in february down only slightly 
from the alltime record of 106 billion in withdrawals in january 
for just the first two months of this year withdrawals have 
totaled 20 billion more than double the net withdrawals for all 
of 1988 which were 86 billion 
analysts attributed the bulk of the withdrawals in both january 
and february to the failure of sampls to keep pace with rising 
interest rates offered by competitors principally money market 
mutual funds 
the latest bad news on declining deposits came as the house 
banking subcommittee on financial institutions began voting on the 
first of several of the 165 proposed amendments to the sampl 
legislation 
the subcommittee which includes all but four members of the 
full committee voted 3512 to adopt an amendment that would leave 
the sampl regulatory agency the federal home loan bank system with 
even less authority than proposed by president bush 
the amendment offered by rep jim leach riowa gives the 
federal deposit insurance corp rather than the bank system 
primary authority to regulate statechartered sampls 
the subcommittee chaired by rep frank annunzio dill also 
adopted by voice vote an amendment providing fixed fouryear terms 
to the chairman and vice chairman of the fdic which now insures 
deposits in commercial banks and would also become responsible for 
insuring sampl accounts the bush administration had proposed making 
the chairman of the fdic serve at the pleasure of the president 
a third amendment offered by rep stephen neal dnc 
encourages state housing authorities to buy repossessed sampl 
properties from the federal government 
the subcommittee planned to meet all day today and for two days 
next week 
in a further indication that the legislation may face slow 
going the full committees chairman rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas earlier said he doubted the subcommittee has set aside 
enough time and promised to reconsider any of the amendments if 
sponsors believe they received short shrift in the subcommittee 
im not going to be party to a stampede to act in great haste 
only to repent later at great leisure he said 
in the senate the legislation appears to moving at a faster 
pace the banking committee chairman sen donald w riegle jr 
dmich told members of his panel that majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine intends to have the senate vote on the bill 
during the week of april 17 
the senate committee met privately for five and a half hours 
tuesday eight hours wednesday and plans another session today 
it looks like many most of the controversial decisions will 
be made behind the closed doors of the senate banking committee 
no votes no fingerprints no political blood said kenneth a 
guenther executive vice president of the independent bankers 
association of america 
one possible snag in the senate is riegles effort to scrap the 
part of the administration plan that would keep 50 billion in sampl 
spending from counting as part of the budget deficit with many 
democrats lining up behind riegle and most republicans opposed 
kevin gottlieb director of the senate committee staff said 
panel members wednesday did not resolve the question but he said 
democrats were sending a strong signal that riegles funding 
package remained clearly viable despite administration attempts 
to squelch it 
rep charles schumer dny has put together a similar 
amendment in the house but on wednesday he said he was concerned 
about reaction in financial markets and had not decided whether to 
offer it 
however gonzalez today strongly supported including sampl 
spending in the budget criticizing bush for going the budget 
gimmick route the most expensive route 
i know that president bush is stuck with his read my lips 
statements but this committees responsibility goes beyond 
campaign slogans he said 
in another development wednesday treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady in an effort to persuade congress to accept the main 
features of the administrations proposal warned that he may 
recommend a veto of any rescue package that gives the industry too 
much leeway in getting its financial house in order 
brady told a small group of reporters that congress would be 
asking for a repeat of the sampl problem some time in the 
future if it passed bailout legislation that postponed the 1991 
deadline set by the administration for sampls to beef up their 
capital

traditional italian pasta will get a special 
government qualitycontrol mark under a measure aimed at helping 
consumers distinguish it from cheaper imported mixedwheat pasta 
news reports said thursday 
according to the measure approved by the cabinet and expected 
to take effect this year foreign pastamakers will have to list 
their ingredients on packages they want to sell in italy 
even diners in restaurants will have to be notified of the type 
of pasta they are eating according to the new law 
traditional italian pasta made from durum wheat stays firm 
when cooked an important quality for those who like it al 
dente 
in july the european economic community court of justice 
overturned an italian law that barred the sale of pasta not made 
entirely with durum wheat

will be tempted to turn to the less firm mixedwheat pasta which 
costs up to 30 percent less than durum pasta and is produced in 
west germany and holland

president bush today renewed his threat to 
veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond 425 an hour as 
senate democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage 
floor to 455 
house minority leader bob michel rill who met with bush and 
relayed his comments to reporters said the president made it 
abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility not one 
penny not one deviation from his position on the minimum wage 
bush met with republican congressional leaders hours before the 
senate opened debate on the legislation 
the senate bill sponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass 
would raise the hourly minimum from 335 to 465 by january 1992 
and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers 
but kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his 
measure identical to the house bill passed two weeks ago which has 
a final wage of 455 and would allow employers to pay new entrants 
in the job market a subminimum for two months 
bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new 
employees a subminimum training wage for six months the gop 
leaders who met with bush said he also reiterated his opposition to 
shortening that time frame 
another of the republicans with whom bush met sen thad 
cochran rmiss told reporters afterward that the message that 
was given to the president by the senate gop leadership was that 
were going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue and we 
urged him not to back down from his commitment to 425 and the 
sixmonth training wage 
republicans could thwart the democrats quickpassage strategy 
by staging a filibuster but an aide to one leading gop senator 
said there were no plans to do that the aide said it appeared the 
democrats had the votes to win passage of their plan by early next 
week 
meanwhile a new poll said there was overwhelming public support 
for an increase in the minimum wage which has been at 335 since 
1981 
the washington postabc news survey conducted march 30 through 
april 3 said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14 
percent did not eightytwo percent said they favored an increase 
even if it would trigger higher consumer prices 
but only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a 
higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it 
meant businesses would stop hiring or would fire workers because 
of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage the poll 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
by agreeing to amend his bill kennedy provided the amended 
version wins passage averts the need for a conference committee to 
resolve differences between the house and senate versions 
a number of other amendments were also expected including a gop 
attempt to substitute bushs proposal 
a lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said bushs 
repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by democratic 
sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president 
he says he wont compromise so i dont see a need for us to do 
anything except send him our bill said aflcio lobbyist robert 
mcglotten 
bush has been adamant in saying he would veto the housepassed 
bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both 
chambers of congress 
while the housepassed bill cuts the final target of the hourly 
minimum wage to 455 it moves up the effective dates of the three 
increases from jan 1 to oct 1 meaning the first increase would 
come this year and the last jump would occur oct 1 1992 
bush has proposed three 30cent increases in the minimum wage 
beginning jan 1 1990 and ending two years later with the hourly 
minimum at 425 
the president said his support for those increases hinges on a 
provision allowing employers to pay new workers a subminimum wage 
for six months regardless of any past experience with another 
employer the subminimum under the bush plan would be 335 an 
hour after the first increase in the minimum wage it would rise to 
340 an hour by 1992 
the housepassed bill sets the wage for new hires provided it 
is their first job at 335 effective oct 1 when the subsequent 
increases in the minimum wage took effect the subminimum would 
rise as well to 85 percent of the minimum the provision allowing 
the newhire wage would expire on sept 30 1992

angry state officials asked the coast 
guard to take the helm of the cleanup of the nations worst oil 
spill and the fired captain of the exxon valdez left a new york 
jail today after posting a reduced bond 
capt joseph hazelwood posted the 25000 bail slashed from 1 
million by a judge who called the higher amount set by another 
judge unconstitutionally excessive 
on wednesday an enraged judge kenneth rohl set the bail and 
said of the spill we have a manmade destruction that has not 
been equaled probably since hiroshima 
hazelwood spent wednesday night in jail on new yorks long 
island where he lives and an extradition request was pending 
also wednesday two oil companies shell and chevron limited 
gasoline deliveries to distributors in western states in what one 
official called the first us gas rationing since the arab oil 
embargo of 1973 both companies said the rationing was to prevent 
the hoarding of gasoline in the wake of the spill 
in washington officials from exxon corp the bush 
administration and the state of alaska were called to the capitol 
to brief members of congress today on the spill 
transportation secretary samuel skinner testified that 
contingency plans were never adequate to handle an oil spill the 
size of the current one he said it was too early to place blame 
but that exxon corp did not have enough equipment on hand 
exxon chairman lg rawl in his prepared statement again 
apologized on behalf of his company for the spill but said exxons 
response to the accident was immediate and thorough 
with the slick now larger than delaware gov steve cowper asked 
coast guard rear adm edward nelson jr to take control of the 
cleanup 
cowper said nelson indicated he would but a formal decision was 
pending 
the governor charged that exxon has been too bureaucratic in 
overseeing the cleanup and other state officials complained of a 
lack of planning and inadequate updates 
we think there has to be a much more disciplined management 
structure cowper told reporters maybe thats been the problem 
all along you need a military system to get things done 
in his letter to nelson cowper noted that less than 4 percent 
of the 101 million gallons of oil spilled in prince william sound 
on march 24 had been recovered and that the slick had reached the 
gulf of alaska 
but exxon spokesman henry beathard said the company believed it 
was the best organization to manage the effort 
we gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup he 
said we think the most effective and efficient way to carry out 
this project is for exxon to continue 
the tanker was freed from bligh reef 25 miles outside valdez 
with an infusion of compressed inert gas into its hull a rising 
tide and a nudge from six smokebelching tugboats which steered it 
on a slow 30mile journey to a remote cove 
two skimmers and boats pulling two containment booms trailed the 
tanker mopping up a sheen of oil 
the ship had to evade thousands of icebergs some as big as 
houses 
were not going to move fast said gary gorski exxons 
salvage coordinator were trying to work our way around these 
little dorky bits out here 
a newspaper meanwhile reported that a coast guard investigator 
speculated that hazelwood unknowingly had set the ship on a 
collision course with the reef and then apparently placed it on 
automatic pilot without telling the third mate 
the uncertified third mate was in command when the ship ran 
aground but the investigator said there was no way to confirm if 
being on automatic pilot played a part in the accident the 
anchorage times said 
asked about the report a coast guard spokesman chief warrant 
officer rick meidt said none of the facts in that story are in 
dispute to the best of my knowledge 
the coast guard however released a statement saying neither it 
nor the national transportation safety board have confirmed the 
investigators opinions and speculations 
hazelwood 42 is charged with operating a ship while drunk 
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil the 
misdemeanors carry a maximum penalty of 2 years in prison and a 
10000 fine upon conviction 
fbi officials in washington said they are investigating whether 
hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the clean 
water act which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants into 
navigable waters 
flow through the transalaska pipeline has returned to its 
normal daily amount of 21 million barrels according to the 
alyeska pipeline service co oil flow from the north slope had been 
cut by 60 percent because of tanker restrictions in valdez harbor 
oil has floated over 2600 square miles soiled 800 miles of 
coastline killed thousands of animals and resulted in millions of 
dollars in losses to fishermen 
the alaska seafood marketing institute said it had received 
inquiries from customers concerned about the spills effect on 
seafood because of the concerns it has mailed letters to 20000 
fish brokers wholesalers restaurants and supermarkets 
shell spokesman bill gibson in houston said the gasoline 
rationing by his company and chevron is the first he could recall 
since the arab oil embargo 
gibson said shells decision to put a cap on its deliveries to 
wholesalers in washington oregon california idaho utah nevada 
and arizona resulted from excessive buying by those distributors in 
the last week

it was the car cool baby boomers grooved on 
the mustang ford motor cos breakthrough into lightweight 
affordable sports cars turns 25 this month with an immortalized 
place in auto history making its mark the same way the beatles 
reshaped rocknroll 
teenagers dreamed of cruising driveins in their new mustangs 
which like the dreamers themselves grow older by the year some 
original mustang drivers say they dont feel a day older than when 
they slid behind the wheel for the first time 
it felt great stanley tucker of montreal remembered about 
the day 25 years ago when he drove the first mustang ever made at 
fords dearborn mich assembly plant where 52 of the cars an 
hour still roll off the line 
ruby hummel of east detroit got into the mustang love affair 
late but she got her drivers license late too she bought a used 
68 mustang when she got her license in 1973 at age 46 
it makes you feel young she said at a suburban detroit 
jeepeagle dealership where she and her husband were shopping for a 
new car they pulled up in a 66 light blue and white mustang a 
car she says she wont trade 
the nation is dotted with mustang clubs and mustang collectors 
about 75 percent of the members in the performance ford club of 
america are mustang owners said club chairman charles crites of 
ashville ohio 
mustang lovers praise what they call the simplicity of the early 
model promoting an exuberance and free spirit that captivated 
young consumers and made fords rivals rethink and redesign their 
own sporty models 
the original mustang unveiled when lee iacocca was president of 
ford had a base a price of 2368 and featured a 170cubicinch 
sixcylinder engine 
it could be fixed by a general novice person in the back 
yard in the early years crites said simplicity has gone out 
with cheap gas 
crites said hes owned about 15 mustangs over the years and has 
three in his collection of 25 cars his favorite mustang is the 
1969 mustang shelby gt 500 
like other mustang buyers crites is proud of how he found his 
pride and joy in 1970 i went in to a dealership to buy a 
truck he said i saw the mustang sitting there for 3700 i 
went back two weeks later and they dropped the price by about 
500 
crites drove it away that day 
he was one of hundreds of thousands who bought mustangs during 
the early years ford formally introduced the car on april 17 
1964 about five weeks after mustangs job 1 rolled out of fords 
dearborn plant 
some purists call the first editions 1964 models ford calls 
them 65s 
the firstyear sales projection of 100000 cars was passed in 
four months sales increased to its best year in 1966 when 549400 
mustangs were driven off ford dealership lots 
the second generation of mustangs called the mustang ii was 
introduced for the 1974 model year it was a smaller than the 73 
reflecting the need for better fuel efficiency during the oil 
crunch of the mid1970s 
mustang sales bottomed out in 1983 at about 117000 cars 
raising predictions that the car like an aging television sitcom 
had finally run out of gas but last year ford sold 170100 
mustangs 
the 1989 mustang which has a fourcylinder engine has a base 
price 9450 an optional beefedup 50liter engine capable of 223

the sale of the first mustang off the assembly 
line was a mistake 
it had nothing to do with the car it was the salesman doing his 
job too well according to stanley tucker a corporate airline 
pilot now based in montreal 
they should have known better i guess tucker said in a 
telephone interview 
tucker was 32 when he was in st johns newfoundland driving by 
parsons ford on april 14 1964 there on a pedestal was a white 
mustang convertible with a black interior 
i went in and said i want to buy it tucker recalled not 
knowing that the car was in the eastern canadian province as part 
of a promotional tour a few days before the mustang officially was 
introduced 
i guess the salesman didnt realize he shouldnt sell it 
tucker said i wrote him out a check and drove the car off 
a few days later the dealer called tucker asking him to return 
the car 
i said no way ford called and they couldnt get the car 
back either he said 
i was driving that thing around for about six months in st 
johns before i ever saw another tucker said it felt great 
the car was stopping traffic on the streets people would come over 
and say what in heavens name is that 
in the united states mustangs were no strangers on the road 
the car got off to one of the hottest starts in automotive history 
topping its annual projection of 100000 sales in the first four 
months 
the appearance of the car was the thing that caught the eye of 
tucker and hundreds of thousands of other buyers in the early days 
tucker kept the original mustang for two years 
after a couple of years they ford came up with a gimmick 
and said how about trading the first car in for the millionth i 
was stupid enough to do it 
the original mustang serial number 55f08f100001 is on display 
now at the henry ford museum in dearborn mich 
tucker unrelated to automobile designer preston tucker of the 
1940s said he had no problem with the original mustang during the 
two years he owned the car during that time he put 10000 miles 
on it about half of the usual mileage open road is scarce on 
newfoundland 
what im sorry of in hindsight is getting rid of the first 
one he said if i had any brains i would have put it up on 
blocks and let it appreciate

transportation secretary samuel skinner told 
congress today that government and industry never had a contingency 
plan sufficient to handle an oil spill the size of the one caused 
by the exxon valdez tanker accident in alaska 
he did not place the blame on anyone specifically saying it 
is too early to have factually adequate evidence of culpability 
but my impression is that a somewhat overoptimistic attitude 
crept in about our readiness and ability to deal with a spill of 
this magnitude or even that an accident of this size could 
occur skinner said 
he told the senate commerce committee that the exxon corp did 
not have enough equipment on hand when the spill occurred march 24 
in prince william sound disgorging 10 million gallons of crude oil 
this was compounded by the remote location of the spill but 
it goes without saying that every step of the planning for moving 
alaskan oil by water had to assume a spill in just this locale 
said skinner 
on the other side of the capitol house republicans called on 
president bush to become directly involved in the cleanup efforts 
rep jim saxton of new jersey told a news conference called by 
the house republican research committee that the president should 
immediately put one of the federal agencies in charge of 
coordinating cleanup 
the republican group also called for legislation that would 
outline strict contingency plans for future oil spills and place 
the financial responsibility with the corporation responsible for 
the accident 
skinner too called for updating all contingency plans for oil 
transportation 
it is also time to reassess the need for comprehensive oil 
spill liability and compensation legislation he said noting 
that bills have been introduced but never passed by congress 
skinner also warned of problems that would occur if a foreign 
tanker whose owner had fewer resources than exxon had a similar 
accident 
there would be no means under current law to assure that 
damage costs are met he said 
moreover a significant proportion of the crude oil arriving 
in the united states is not effectively covered by the four 
existing us statutes skinner said naming sections of the 
clean water act and the outer continental shelf deepwater ports 
and transalaska pipeline acts 
exxon chairman lg rawl also appeared before the committee 
in his prepared statement rawl again apologized for his company 
for the spill but said exxons response to the accident was 
immediate and thorough 
exxon takes full responsiblity and has done so from the 
beginning rawl said 
rawl said that as of noon tuesday 97 percent of 1 million 
barrels of crude oil remaining aboard the exxon valdez had been 
removed 
the house merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee on coast 
guard and navigation held a hearing simultaneously with the senate 
committee 
at that session adm paul yost commandant of the coast guard 
said the service has a ban against anybody on duty having a blood 
alcohol level above 04 but has difficulty determining whether a 
person is an alcohol abuser 
yost said that if applicants for pilot licenses do not mention a 
problem on their applications the coast guard does not look 
further 
joseph hazelwood who was captain of the exxon valdez was fired 
after blood tests showed that his blood alcohol exceeded the 
accepted level 10 hours after the accident 
hazelwood admitted drinking before the accident and was not on 
the bridge when the tanker went aground he surrendered wednesday 
on charges which included operating a motorcraft while intoxicated 
yost disputed rawls contention that exxon responded 
immediately he told the house subcommittee the company was slow in 
its response 
elsewhere on capitol hill a top government investigator told a 
senate subcommittee that alcohol tests on coast guard personnel on 
duty at the time of the accident at a nearby radar station were 
inconclusive because they were performed 15 hours after the 
grounding 
james l kolstad acting chairman of the national transportation 
safety board told the senate appropriations transportation 
subcommittee that urine tests on one guardsman produced a reading 
of 2 percent which indicates the presence of a large amount of 
alcohol 
but the guardsman said that when his shift ended he had had 
several drinks at home before being recalled to duty for testing 
kolstad said 
on wednesday sen alan cranston and rep mel levine accused the 
reagan administration of covering up warnings about the potential 
disaster from an oil spill on the west coast 
the complaints by the two california democrats was over 
materials prepared by the interior departments minerals management 
service on oil lease sale 91 off the northern california coast 
they said the same environmental findings are the same as those 
that would apply in alaska 
according to memoranda released by levine the fish and wildlife 
service told the minerals management service of the high risk of 
drilling operations in rough seas and also cited inadequate 
technology and equipment for spill cleanup 
levine said minerals management officials deleted the warnings 
from their environmental impact statement 
the lawmakers called on president bush to cancel the lease sales 
action has been delayed until a task force appointed by bush 
completes a study that is to take a deeper look at the 
environmental consequences of drilling

a group led by former baseball commissioner 
peter v ueberroth has agreed to buy eastern airlines in a 464 
million deal that would give the strikecrippled carriers 
employees a major share of the company the parties announced today 
the deal subject to approval by eastern creditors and the us 
bankruptcy court followed lengthy negotiations with easterns 
parent texas air corp and was greeted with cheers by union members 
locked in a bitter struggle with eastern management 
the purchase also was conditioned on eastern reaching new work 
agreements with its striking unions by april 10 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo told a new york news conference 
the purchase includes about 200 million in cash and the rest in 
securities 
under this agreement eastern can be back flying in very short 
order lorenzo said 
miamibased eastern has been virtually paralyzed since march 4 
by a machinists union strike that has drawn the support of pilots 
and flight attendants eastern filed for reorganization and 
protection from creditors in us bankruptcy court in new york on 
march 9 as its cash dried up 
to sum it up its a mammoth challenge im convinced that 
there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that i can help 
bring together to help this airline ueberroth said 
lorenzo said that if the unions agreed to the deal the nations 
seventhlargest airline could resume flying 24 hours later he also 
said the airline intended to file a bankruptcy reorganization plan 
that would pay creditors 100 percent 
lorenzo will remain in charge of eastern until the deal is 
approved but ueberroth will participate in formulating the 
reorganization plan 
texas air would get 200 million cash eastern notes worth about 
185 million plus eastern assets valued at about 79 million 
including easterns new yorkmontreal route plus eight landing 
slots and one gate at new yorks laguardia airport 
about 500 striking machinists jammed their local union hall in 
miami chanting and cheering hey hey ho ho lorenzos got to 
go and take me out to the ballgame as they heard news of the 
sale 
but frank ortis vice president of machinists local 702 and 
miami strike coordinator said it was impossible to tell whether 
unions would fare better under the new proposed ownership until 
we get into dealings with commissioner ueberroth 
however were willing to give it a shot he said 
the air line pilots association issued a statement in new york 
saying the union was encouraged by the announced deal but stressed 
that strike issues still had yet to be resolved and that the union 
had not yet been able to review terms of the purchase the union 
also noted that other buyout proposals still could be put before 
the bankruptcy court 
nonetheless what we have heard so far leaves us cautiously 
optimistic stated john bavis chairman of the 3600member union 
ueberroth who flew to new york late tuesday night from his 
california home began personal negotiations with lorenzo early 
wednesday morning and continued them until about 8 pm resuming 
talks early today 
ueberroths group made a 464 million offer for eastern last 
week and then withdrew the bid after being told by texas air that 
it had been topped by another suitor identified by sources close 
to the situation as billionaire hotel executive jay a pritzker 
under the deal accepted by texas air ueberroth and thomas 
talbot a former airline executive from california would own 30 
percent of the airline easterns unions would have get another 30 
percent of the company in exchange for wage and workrule 
concessions 
drexel burnham lambert inc and ardshiel inc a smaller new 
york firm will place securities for the remaining 40 percent of 
the company 
in addition to the airline the ueberroth group is buying a 199 
percent interest in texas airs computer reservations system the 
reservation network system one is comprised of the former systems 
of eastern and continental airlines also owned by texas air 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
many union leaders and rankandfile members have said they 
would accept wage and benefit concessions to help resurrect eastern 
if they were given independence from texas air which acquired the 
60yearold carrier in early 1986 for about 600 million 
lorenzo has been vilified by eastern workers as a unionbuster 
who was stripping the airline of its assets and funneling them to 
continental which is substantially nonunion 
in related developments wednesday the us bankruptcy court in 
new york appointed washington attorney david shapiro as examiner in 
easterns chapter 11 reorganization case 
shapiro 60 a senior partner in the firm dickstein shapiro amp 
morin was recommended by us trustee harry jones and appointed by 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland 
lifland recently ordered the appointment of an examiner whose 
unusually broad powers would include a mandate to mediate the 
bitter labor dispute at eastern and get the airline flying again 
in a separate court action lifland approved an agreement 
between attorneys for eastern and the machinists union governing 
areas where peaceful picketing would be allowed at new yorks 
laguardia airport and at logan international airport in boston 
eastern previously asked the judge to restrain union picketing on 
eastern property

a sprawling steel plant that has been 
modernized at a cost of 400 million for use in a joint venture by 
a us company and its south korean partner was dedicated thursday 
while protesters outside burned korean flags 
the 80yearold factory was renovated as part of a pact between 
usx corp and giant pohang iron amp steel co of south korea and now 
has an annual capacity of 14 million tons of finished steel 
products mainly material for tin cans steelframed furniture and 
appliances 
the ussposco industries inc plant is part of a 500acre 
complex in this community about 50 miles east of san francisco 
former president gerald ford who spoke at the dedication and 
flipped the switch to put the gleaming machines and computers to 
work said joint ventures are an inevitable trend in business and 
politics 
ford commended officials of both companies for the vision and 
dedication to see the rebirth of the steel industry in 
california he recalled that experts had predicted the end of the 
us steel industry but fortunately the pessimists were wrong 
the plant which began operation in 1909 and hasnt been in full 
production for almost 20 years was the scene of a protest by about 
500 people including members of the international longshoremens 
and warehousemens union 
they were objecting to the use of nonunion labor to handle the 
renovation we want people to know how it affects not just the 
nation but the local community said frank belleci an ilwu 
member 
plant president e a roskovensky who said the plant does 
employ union labor said the protest stemmed from an ongoing 
disagreement over the hiring of nonunion contractors after a union 
bid came in far over the cost of nonunion labor 
under terms of a 1986 agreement usx and pohang each owns half 
the plant and invested 90 million in its rejuvenation the pact is 
similar to the agreement between general motors corp and toyota 
which created new united motor manufacturing inc in fremont calif 
the balance of the money invested 220 million came from 
bank financing pohangs investment is the largest ever by a south 
korean company in the us 
the plant will be a boon to the local economy employing some 
1200 people and paying them a total of about 46 million annually 
the venture already has paid some 12 million in state sales taxes 
flanking the podium as ford spoke was a poster showing three 
workers and the slogan were a whole new breed of steelmaker 
asked whether the plant posed a threat to the us steel 
industry usx board chairman david m roderick said it wasnt going 
to cause one iota of trouble 
this is a solution to keep an american steel presence on 
the west coast he said 
gen taejoon park chairman of pohang lauded those who put the 
deal together despite all sorts of odds and difficulties

you can still get a 100 christian dior lace 
nightgown at bloomingdales swank manhattan store and buy a good 
offtherack suit from burdines in miami but their retailing 
parent has undergone a wrenching change in the year since a 
canadian developer took it over 
federated department stores inc which owns bloomies 
burdines and three other big department store chains is smaller 
leaner and more focused under its new boss robert campeau it has 
fewer stores fewer employees and a big mountain of debt 
it has survived predictions that it would become a financial 
ruin and retailing disaster 
but is it a better company today 
that remains to be seen says pamela stubing an analyst 
with moodys investor service inc only now she said is federated 
emerging from a tumultuous 12month transition 
campeau won federated after a bitter twomonth fight that 
included a bidding war with rival retailer rh macy amp co inc the 
takeover cost campeau 67 billion 
he quickly sold four federated department store chains and its 
discount and specialty stores to help finance the deal 
campeau was accused of decimating a fine old retailer a charge 
hed heard before in december 1986 he bought allied stores corp 
for 34 billion and since then has sold 18 of its 24 store 
divisions 
campeau corp the umbrella for his retailing and real estate 
operations now owns nine department store companies jordan marsh 
the bon maas brothers and sterns from allied and bloomingdales 
burdines lazarus abraham amp straus and richsgoldsmiths from 
federated it also owns ralphs a southern california supermarket 
chain spun off from federated 
besides selling hundreds of stores robert campeau has cut 9000 
jobs at federated and allied and again been sharply criticized for 
heavyhandedness 
campeau corp president james roddy said in an interview that 
only administrators were laid off and the cuts had no effect 
whatsoever on the customers 
campeau has done what retailing strategists said allied and 
federated should have done long before he came along 
when the developer first announced his offer for federated 
securities analysts accused thenchairman howard goldfeder of 
literally giving the store away by failing to streamline the 
company and make it more competitive 
campeau has cut annual operating costs at allied and federated 
by more than 350 million a year said 13d research services a 
yorktown heights ny firm that analyzes stocks and corporation 
finances 
campeau corp stock now trading in the teens could go as high 
as 66 a share this year 13d predicted in a report about his 
business 
while analysts agree that federated and allied needed 
streamlining they are concerned about its effect on the retailers 
its not yet known if they have done a good job in cutting 
down costs without destroying the stores said ms stubing of 
moodys 
but just the fact that the layoffs are behind campeaus 
employees has put the company on a better track said walter loeb 
an analyst with morgan stanley amp co 
everyones happier loeb said the employees are a more 
cohesive group 
some anxieties that prevailed a year ago apparently have not 
panned out many observers said the federated stores would become 
too centralized under campeau and lose their individuality and 
innovativeness 
loeb was reassured a year later saying each individual 
department store company is standing on its own two feet but 
with some direction from the home office 
campeau also was accused of buying the companies solely for 
their lucrative real estate and the entry that stores like 
bloomingdales would provide into new shopping malls 
real estate they said would take priority over good 
merchandising 
roddy doesnt deny that the companies properties was the 
principal draw for campeau as it has been for other 
developersturnedretailers such as edward debartolo jr and 
australias hooker corp 
you acquire shopping centers a lot easier if you acquire the 
company roddy said 
however he said campeau corp is now dependent on retailing 
for profit and the real estate end cannot survive without good 
performances from federated and allied 
the fact that there is growth in retail sales adds value to 
the underlying real estate values within retail roddy said 
with that in mind campeau has reworked federateds expansion 
plans to concentrate on its star bloomingdales division 
the company aims at opening three new bloomingdales a year 
said james zimmerman president of federated and allied campeau 
also is adding stores to other divisions and plans to expand or 
remodel more than half its 250 stores over the next five years 
zimmerman admitted that we didnt spend much of spring 88 
running the business because executives were busy cutting costs 
the company has made conservative projections for 1989 partly 
because of the sluggish consumer buying of the past two years 
zimmerman said campeau hoped for a sales increase of 4 percent 
consistent with industry projects at the start of 1989 
campeaus fourthquarter earnings havent been announced but 
some analysts expect an improvement from the third quarter when 
allied and federated lost a combined 535 million the high cost 
of paying the interest on takeoverrelated debt was partly to blame 
unlike most other big retailers federated and allied do not 
release their sales figures monthly making it difficult to assess 
their performance 
one industry analyst who asked not to be identified estimated 
that despite marginal sales growth for the year ended jan 31 
pretax earnings rose 5 percent at federated and 16 percent at 
allied thanks largely to cost cuts loeb the morgan stanley 
analyst said he expected campeau to adequately manage the heavy 
debt load it took on in acquiring federated and allied 
concerns about that debt wreaked havoc with its financing plans 
last fall 
campeau announced in september that federated and allied lost a 
combined 207 million during the second quarter when sales slowed 
the next month federateds planned 115 billion highyield bond 
sale had to be postponed and restructured 
published reports said buyers hesitated because of the 
retailers lackluster sales and losses but campeau said at the 
time the problem was uneasiness in the highyield bond market 
caused by the bidding war in the biggest debtfinanced takeover of 
all rjr nabisco inc 
roddy acknowledged that investors were concerned about campeaus 
debt but he expressed confidence the company can easily handle its 
interest payments 
the transition at federated has been rocky but the company says 
it is largely complete and analysts will be watching see if the 
takeover really was a good deal for robert campeau 
said ms stubing this year is going to be the really telling 
year

ncnb corp says it wants to discuss revising its 
takeover bid for citizens and southern corp but camps officials 
said thursday the north carolina banking company has done most of 
its talking through the news media 
there has been no communication with the camps board camps 
spokesman dallas lee said they ncnb are just doing it through 
the news media and it makes it hard for camps to respond 
the camps board on monday rejected an offer made last week by 
ncnb of 1075 shares of ncnb stock for each share of camps common 
stock the value of that offer was placed at 39 a share or about 
24 billion 
james hance charlotte ncbased ncnbs chief financial 
officer said wednesday his company is willing to raise the price 
of the offer he told the atlanta journal and the atlanta 
constitution that analysts predictions that the new offer would be 
44 worth of stock per share were in the ballpark 
hance said however that an offer would be negotiated only in a 
facetoface situation with camps 
lee said ncnb has not made an effort to set up such a meeting 
but lynn easley a spokeswoman for ncnb in charlotte said 
thursday we have said at every opportunity we are willing at any 
time to sit down with camps from the very beginning we have said we 
want to sit down 
ms easley said she did not know specifically what efforts have 
been made to set up a meeting with the camps board 
lees comments thursday were not the first to be critical of 
ncnbs communication with atlantabased camps camps officials last 
week said they learned of the original offer through a news release 
before letters to the board outlining the proposal were delivered 
the camps board in turning down ncnbs initial offer said it was 
inadequate and possibly would not pass regulatory muster camps has 
said the value of the ncnb stock may have been inflated by the 
north carolina banks purchase of 20 percent of first republicbank 
in dallas that bank is now called ncnb texas national bank 
i think the camps board made it clear that camps is not trying to 
solicit another offer lee said

six months after bank of new york co won a rare hostile bid to 
acquire rival irving trust corp the banking industry may see 
another big takeover war 
but although the unsolicited 24 billion buyout proposal by 
giant ncnb corp for atlantabased citizens and southern corp is 
in some ways similar to the 13month battle between irving and bank 
of new york the latest deal has some key differences 
its bigger could be more likely to generate opposition from 
state and federal regulators and involves two institutions 
considered strong financial performers 
i guess id have to say it pretty much stops and ends with the 
fact that both were unsolicited offers said rodgin cohen a 
merger specialist with the law firm sullivan amp cromwell who is 
working for atlantabased citizens 
bank of new yorks 14 billion hostile takeover battle for 
irving wasnt the first hostile bank deal but it was the largest 
of its kind to succeed in a banking industry that traditionally had 
relied mainly on friendly deals 
i think the irvingbank of new york deal definitely broke the 
ice michael rosen a boston attorney specializing in bank 
mergers said thursday a lot of people felt that deal was an 
aberration but now its happening again which is noteworthy 
citizens board of directors on monday rejected the stockswap 
merger proposal by charlotte ncbased ncnb as inadequate 
experts see some similarities between the bank of new york deal 
and the ncnb proposal but there also are plenty of differences 
the combination of the two would result in a bank with assets of 
around 75 billion placing it firmly in the top 10 among the 
nations bank holding companies bank of new york grew to about 50 
billion in assets after the irving acquisition 
also irving was a mediocre performer that didnt live up to 
its potential whereas citizens has been a strong performer that is 
living up to its potential said james j mcdermott jr an 
analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods 
ncnb is offering 1075 of its shares for each of citizens 
stock or around 44 a share the company has hinted it might be 
willing to raise its bid by around 5 a share if citizens agrees to 
negotiations but citizens management and many analysts maintain 
that even thats too low 
nbnc stock closed unchanged at 3425 a share thursday citizens 
fdeclined 25 cents to 35 a share 
citizens main criticism of the offer is that the value of 
ncnbs stock may have been inflated after ncnb took over the 
management of the banks of the first republicbank corp of dallas 
last year with the governments financial assistance that bank is 
now called ncnb texas national bank 
the federal reserve may look unfavorably upon the acquisition 
by ncnb of another bank given the fact that they recently received 
federal assistance to acquire first republicbank rosen said 
cohen who represented bank of new york in its fight for irving 
said thursday that no negotiations have been held and none are 
planned with ncnb he said the company has not been talking to any 
other potential suitor 
its quite clear citizens wants to remain independent cohen 
said 
after citizens board rejected ncnbs offer it amended the 
companys bylaws to make a takeover more difficult applying 
provisions georgias antitakeover law irving relied on a similar 
new york law but lost several key court challenges to the statute 
also unlike the bank of new yorkirving battle the ncnb 
proposal reaches across state lines 
its likely that there will be a lot more politics involved in 
this battle because its likely it would result in the 
reduction of jobs said rosen ncnb has a very strong track 
record of cutting costs and reducing staff 
while ncnbs proposal calls for continuation of citizens and 
southerns management and independent operations banking experts 
said they were doubtful ncnb would be a handsoff partner 
first republicbank is a prime example after they ncnb took 
that over they changed the name said stephen biggar an analyst 
with argus research

peter ueberroths deal to buy strikeravaged 
eastern airlines got a boost from two sources that have been 
getting a black eye from prosecutors junkbond powerhouse drexel 
burnham lambert inc and its indicted financier michael r milken 
ueberroth the exbaseball commissioner told reporters at a 
thursday news conference to announce the deal with eastern parent 
texas air corp that milken called him two weeks earlier and 
offered constructive ideas on how to proceed 
he did not specify what those ideas were but quoted milken as 
strongly advising him to focus on the jobs 
ueberroth also put in a good word for drexel the nations 
fifthlargest investment banking firm that has played crucial roles 
in some of the biggest takeovers of the decade 
maybe some of you dont want to here this but i think its 
essential ueberroth said the company texas air not us 
retained drexel burnham lambert and they have been helpful in this 
transaction on the company side and will be overall helpful to 
complete the transaction 
under the arrangement outlined by ueberroth and texas air 
drexel will provide 300 million in debtfinancing for the deal 
which has been valued at 464 million 
drexel and milken have been battling negative publicity since 
they were implicated in wideranging securities fraud by 
nowimprisoned speculator ivan boesky more than two years ago 
drexel agreed to plead guilty to six fraud felony charges in 
december and a grand jury indicted milken and two others on fraud 
and racketeering charges march 29 milken has asserted innocence 
steven anreder a spokesman for drexel said he was unaware of 
ueberroths remarks and could not comment further officials at 
robinson lake lerer and montgomery the public relations firm hired 
by milken to speak for him would not comment 
easterns employees struck march 4 after a prolonged feud with 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo whom they accused of stripping 
the airlines assets eliminating jobs and scheming to crush the 
unions

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply fell in the week ended march 27 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 30799 billion from a revised 30853 billion the 
previous week 
an even broader measure m3 fell to a seasonally adjusted 
39628 billion from 39658 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose to a 
seasonally adjusted 7871 billion from 7869 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 
3 percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent 
growth in m3 the fed has not set a target for m1 growth since 
early 1987 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30721 billion a 23 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 39374 billion up 4 percent while m1 was 
flat at an average of 7871 billion 
in other reports 
the federal reserve said bank borrowings from the federal 
reserve system at the discount window excluding extended credit 
averaged 511 million a day in the week ended wednesday up from

million in the two weeks ended april 5 up from a revised 328 
million a week earlier

retailing giant sears roebuck and co thursday reported robust 
sales growth for the first month of its new lowpricing policy but 
analysts said it will take many months to judge whether sears 
determination to beat competitors is paying off 
sears said its sales rose 119 percent in the five weeks ended 
april 1 to 297 billion from 266 billion in the corresponding 
period a year earlier 
sales at sears stores open for at least a year increased a solid 
96 percent during the five weeks the industry considers these 
samestore sales a better measure of a retailers performance than 
totals that includes the take at newly opened stores 
michael bozic chairman and chief executive officer of sears 
merchandise group said the march volume turned out even better 
than the company had hoped 
clearly everyday low prices are wellunderstood and popular 
with the public and we are pleased with the response to our 
strategy bozic said 
the launch of its everyday low price program which was 
promoted with an aggressive advertising campaign estimated by 
outsiders to have cost about 110 million definitely brought more 
customers into sears stores 
joseph ronning a retail specialist with brown bros harriman 
said the sales growth was a reflection of people experimenting to 
see what sears everyday low pricing is like 
it shows people are going into the stores to find out whats 
happening he said 
one of the strongest points to make about sears latest 
samestore sales were that they rose 154 percent after adjustment 
for the loss of 2 selling days due to easter and the closing of 
sears more than 800 stores nationwide for marking down prices in 
preparation for the policy switch ronning said 
the markdowns were part of a broad effort by sears to hoist its 
sagging merchandise operation the retailer also is adding national 
brands to its mostly privatelabel lineup and cutting costs to 
recapture lost market share 
sears which maintained its ranking as the countrys biggest 
retailer with 1988 revenue of 303 billion has watched its market 
share shrink this decade as gogo discounters such as walmart 
stores inc and specialty merchants have developed significant 
followings among shoppers 
industry analysts said the test will be whether sears manages to 
maintain the sales momentum especially after the fanfare over the 
changes adopted by the 102yearold retailer dies down sears 
advertising already has returned to a more normal level 
karen sack a retail analyst with standard amp poors corp said 
sears definitely enjoyed a far better month than many of the other 
retailers that reported results on thursday 
no2 retailer k mart corp for instance described its sales as 
disappointing and blamed the weather in part 
analysts said some of the weakness in sales at k mart and other 
chain stores may have been the result of all the hoopla generated 
by sears policy shift but it is difficult to quantify precisely how 
much sales revenue might have been taken away by sears 
it will really take the better part of a year to determine 
whether their new policy is really taking hold sack said 
analysts are awaiting an indication if sears bottom line is 
benefiting from the reduced prices 
a sears spokeswoman said the company has been mum about 
predicting any impact on its earnings

taking advantage of strikehobbled eastern 
airlines absence in some lucrative markets american airlines 
announced plans thursday to add 11 flights in miami and 13 in the 
caribbean by june 
the expansion had been part of americans longterm planning 
but the timing was pushed ahead by the machinists union strike that 
has left eastern flying only about 10 percent of its schedule since 
march 4 
easterns potential for returning to full operation with peter 
ueberroths group announcing a deal thursday to buy the miamibased 
carrier didnt bother american 
the likelihood is that eastern will still be the largest 
carrier in the region said robert baker americans senior vice 
president for operations none of what we have announced today 
will rise and fall on what happens to eastern airlines or anyone 
else 
american is expanding from 20 to 31 flights a day in miami and 
from 45 to 52 flights a day in san juan puerto rico adding other 
flights from domestic points to the caribbean and switching to 
larger aircraft on 11 caribbean flights for a total addition of 
3219 seats per day baker said 
service from boston philadelphia and new orleans also would be 
added if american wins federal and foreign approval for requested 
flights to bogota colombia guatemala cit guatemala san jose 
costa rica and grand cayman island he said 
the expansion will give american 94 daily departures from 10 
florida cities well behind delta airlines and easterns old 
schedule 
american is building here in miami for the longterm and 
clearly a large part of our future revolves around florida and the 
caribbean baker said 
the fort worth texasbased carrier has more than 300 aircraft 
on order and will have 485 in service as of friday with the 
addition of its newest a300 airbus he said

congress under the cloud of 94 billion in 
fresh deposit withdrawals from the nations savings and loan 
institutions began amending president bushs bailout bill thursday 
and immediately got into a dispute over reopening some of last 
years deals that provided 38 billion to the industry 
meanwhile the federal deposit insurance corp seized control 
thursday of 38 more sampls at or near insolvency raising to 215 the 
number of troubled thrifts that the agency has put into 
conservatorships since early february in an effort to prevent the 
bailout costs from mushrooming 
on a bipartisan vote the house banking subcommittee on 
financial institutions moved immediately to deny bush some of the 
controls he had sought over officials running the governments 
deposit insurance program 
the subcommittee also amended bushs proposal by transferring 
regulatory oversight of statechartered but federally insured sampls 
from the federal home loan bank board to the federal deposit 
insurance corp 
bush in february proposed transferring authority over federally 
chartered thrifts from the bank board to the fdic which regulates 
commercial banks 
but the committee rejected an amendment by democratic rep 
richard lehman to allow 31 of the nations largest thrifts many of 
them in his home state of california to become banks and escape 
future insurance liability for the costs of the sampl bailout 
the panel also balked temporarily at an effort by rep doug 
barnard jr dga to prevent the government from recovering some 
of the billions of dollars in longterm aid it committed last year 
to buyers of 179 insolvent thrifts 
subcommittee members also questioned the legality of many of 
last years bailouts saying the bank board had committed billions 
of dollars congress had not authorized it to spend 
banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas said 
some of those deals were with multimillionaires who put up little 
or none of their own money 
in one december transaction government aid exceeded the nearly 
6 billion combined costs of the 1970s bailouts of new york city 
and the lockheed corp and the 1980 bailout of chrysler corp 
according to auditors 
barnard in the face of strong opposition temporarily withdrew 
his amendment to prevent the government from seeking to recover 
from holding companies some of the subsidies the fslic had promised 
to sampl purchasers 
but he complained that all of a sudden we are weaseling on 
commitments that were made 
in all the subcommittee has before it 165 proposed amendments to 
the administrations proposal 
the bank board meanwhile released figures showing that 
depositors removed 94 billion from the sampls in february the 
fourth straight month of heavy withdrawals 
the nations 2939 thrifts hold 957 billion in deposits 
withdrawals since october total 354 billion 
januarys withdrawals amounted to 106 billion according to 
revised figures bank board officials attributed the february 
slowdown in the outflow to higher interest rates being offered by 
many sampls 
treasury secretary nicholas brady has said he expects the 
withdrawals to stop if congress approves bushs bailout plan 
estimated to cost at least 157 billion and perhaps more than 
200 billion over the next 10 years depending on economic 
conditions 
the subcommittee adopted by voice vote an amendment providing 
fouryear terms to the chairman and vice chairman of the fdic 
which under bushs plan would take over insuring sampl deposits from 
the bank boards insolvent federal and savings and loan insurance 
corp fslic 
currently the chairman of the fdic now william seidman is 
chosen by its other two board members bush wanted to have the 
chairman report to the secretary of the treasury who could hire 
and fire the chairman at will 
a lot of the problem in where we are now is the lack of 
independence by regulatory agencies said rep peter hoagland 
dneb one of the sponsors of the amendment 
bush also would leave the bank board and its chairman m danny 
wall as the primary federal regulators of statechartered sampls 
but in an indication of disappointment with the way wall has done 
his job rep jim leach riowa won a 3512 vote on his amendment 
to transfer that power to the fdic 
lehmans amendment to exempt the 31 large sampls from a 
bushproposed fiveyear moratorium on leaving the thrift insurance 
fund to escape the higher premiums it charges in relation to what 
banks pay for deposit coverage was defeated on a 2817 vote 
if you let those folks out you are telling the taxpayers back 
home you want them to pay more of the burden said rep gerald 
kleczka dwis who noted that the 31 thrifts hold about 
onefourth of all sampl deposits in the country 
the subcommittee chaired by rep frank annunzio dill plans 
to complete the bill next week and then send it to the full 
committee where gonzalez has indicated he may give it lengthy 
consideration 
all but four members of the full committee serve on the 
subcommittee 
in the senate the legislation appears to moving at a faster 
pace although so far it all has been dealt with only in closed 
sessions in anticipation of formal open meetings next week 
there the banking committee chairman sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich told colleagues that majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine intends to have the senate vote on the bill during the 
week of april 17 
the senate panel is scheduled to begin amending bushs package 
next tuesday and wednesday when annunzios house subcommittee will 
resume its deliberations 
in other action on amendments thursday the house panel 
rejected on a 397 vote a measure by reps paul e kanjorski 
dpa and marcy kaptur dpa aimed at making states where much 
of the problems have occurred chiefly texas and florida raise 
state taxes to pay 20 percent of the bailout costs for 
statechartered thrifts that went belly up 
kaptur blamed loose regulations in those states for 74 percent 
of the sampl aid committed by the government last year saying the 
costs of bailing out texas institutions alone will total three 
times what the united states spent on the marshall plan in 
rebuilding europe after world war ii 
but rep barney frank dmass said the amendment would have 
sent the bill to fort sumter and started a second civil war 
and referring to bush leach questioned whether there is a 
slight chance that a texan in the white house could sign the bill 
with such a provision 
approved on a voice vote a compromise worked out with lobbyists 
for bankers and thrifts a measure that will allow both federally 
insured banks and sampls to use the same insurance logo but with 
different names 
defeated a measure aimed at preventing banks from citing the 
poor condition of the sampl insurance pool in their advertisements to 
lure deposits from thrifts 
defeated an amendment by barnard that would have ordered the 
fdic to increase the pay of bank and sampl examiners by 20 percent at 
an annual cost of 14 million barnard said those examiners are 
leaving those jobs at rate of 12 percent a year because their 
annual pay averages less than 40000

jubilant eastern airlines strikers cheered and sang 
take me out to the ball game when an agreement to sell the 
carrier was announced thursday saying they are ready to tighten 
their belts and show the public what they can do 
details of the proposed sale to a group led by exbaseball 
commissioner peter v ueberroth are still unclear the deal would 
give eastern employees a 30 percent share of the airline in 
exchange for pay cuts and other union concessions possibly totaling 
250 million 
if the union leaders approve the rank and file say they are 
willing to live on less to prove they can run an airline better 
than texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo and they say they 
have shown that an employees human rights must be respected 
whatever happens here at eastern is going to dictate what 
happens with the rest of the airlines and in other industries 
too said mechanic frank martinez we had been stripped of our 
dignity while we were working for frank lorenzo now we have it 
back and we are going to rebuild the airline 
martinez whose wife alice is a flight attendant at eastern 
said he has no illusions that they can live as well as before the 
strike 
it will be painful martinez said we have to deprive 
ourselves of many things we had in the past but the most important 
thing is that we are building for the future 
employees universally blamed lorenzos attitude toward workers 
not wage disputes for the atmosphere of crisis that culminated in 
the march 4 stirke and they said they were glad to see him go 
it looks like mighty casey has struck out laughed sal 
fallavollita an eastern pilot for 26 years we are ready to 
accept concessions if thats what the new management wants ill 
go along with it 
ramp service worker jose lorie said the price of the 34day 
walkout was expensive both to the employees and the airline itself 
we know the airline has been hurt how much well have to 
find out lorie said we just have to go out there with the 
best possible mentality 
not everyone was ecstatic about the sale with some saying they 
want to see the fine print 
ive seen so much deception that im not going to pick up my 
tools until ive seen the contract said julio valentine a 
maintenance worker for 23 years but he said he was willing to make 
concessions to ueberroth 
most echoed the sentiments of stephanie orent a mechanic who 
rocked her little girl in a stroller as she listened to the excited 
chatter at the union hall 
even if we dont all go back to work for those who do its 
the greatest she said lorenzos gone hes gone back to 
wherever he came from and we dont want to see him again

a wisconsin man has been convicted of profiting 
from insider stock trading in the first such case the securities 
and exchange commission has taken before a jury 
after deliberating for about 90 minutes tuesday the us 
district court jury found john clark iii of cedarburg wis 
violated civil securities laws when he bought stock in a company 
knowing his employer was negotiating to buy that company 
the sixperson jury found no violation on the part of russell 
vanmoppes a broker in the bellevue office of piper jaffray amp 
hopwood who executed clarks stock purchases 
no criminal charges were brought in the case and none are 
pending said jim kidney an sec attorney from washington dc 
who tried the case before us district judge thomas zilly 
this is the first insidertrading case the sec has ever tried 
before a jury kidney said 
the us supreme court recently ruled that the sec may seek 
insidertrading penalties in addition to the return of illegally 
obtained profits but it said such penalties can only be sought 
before a jury previous insidertrading cases have been tried 
before judges alone 
sec regulations prohibit profiting on stock trading when it is 
based on information not available to the public 
clark bought stock in affiliated hospital products inc in 
december 1984 after he learned his employer smith amp nephew 
associated cos was negotiating to buy affiliated for at least 50 
percent more than the current market price of the stock kidney 
said the shares were traded on the american stock exchange 
clark bought 3000 shares at prices ranging from 17875 to 
1975 a share the following month smith amp nephew announced its 
offer to buy affiliated for 36 a share two days afterward clark 
sold his shares for 35125 apiece realizing a profit of 47466 
the sec said 
zilly ordered clark to pay 57026 as unlawful profits gained by 
him his wife and by vanmoppes zilly said he also will set penalty 
damages ranging from one to three times the unlawful profits 
after he receives information on clarks financial situation 
the court will require a penalty in this case to demonstrate 
to this defendant and to the world that insider trading will not be 
tolerated zilly said 
kidney said vanmoppes recommended the affiliated stock to 
another client and later bought some himself based on information 
from clark the sec had alleged vanmoppes had used insider 
information but the jury found vanmoppes was not liable under 
insidertrading laws
