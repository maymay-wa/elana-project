a treaty banning genocide finally has the force 
of us law bringing to a close 40 years of opposition by 
conservatives and putting a final feather in the political cap of 
retiring sen william proxmire 
president reagan signed legislation friday to implement the 
treaty which was ratified by the senate on feb 11 1986 by the 
time the senate acted 95 other nations had ratified the treaty the 
implementing legislation was passed last month 
proxmire had delivered more than 3000 speeches over 19 years 
before the ratification vote conservatives fought it all the way 
they contended the treaty undermined rights of americans under the 
constitution and infringed on us sovereignty 
the legislation signed by reagan implements the treaty by making 
genocide the deliberate destruction of a specific population 
punishable under us law and setting stern penalties for violators 
the senate version of the genocide implementation bill is 
officially called the proxmire act to honor the long crusade of 
the wisconsin democrat who is closing out a 31year senate career 
speaking friday in eau claire wis proxmire said he was not 
given enough advance notice to attend the bill signing ceremony 
i was sorry i could not be there but the important thing is 
that it was signed proxmire said it should have been done long 
ago 
the treaty was drafted after world war ii as a response to the 
nazi holocaust that killed millions of europes jews and other 
ethnic minorities it was approved by the united nations at the end 
of 1948 and submitted to the senate early the next year by president 
truman 
the soviet union frequently embarrassed american diplomats by 
claiming that the us failure to ratify the pact was evidence the 
united states lacked a complete commitment to human rights 
reagan signed the genocide bill at a ceremony at chicagos ohare 
international airport saying he was delighted to fulfill the 
promise made by harry truman to all the peoples of the world and 
especially the jewish people 
the president recalled the nazi death camps that claimed millions 
of jews slavs gypsies and others and said similar atrocities have 
since taken place in cambodia the ukraine and ethiopia 
these events only renew our rage and righteous fury and make 
this moment all the more significant for me and all americans 
reagan said 
addressing the senate on oct 14 shortly before the genocide 
bill was passed proxmire said the treaty was made necessary by 
the deliberate murder of 6 million jews 
they were gassed lined up and shot and they were worked to 
death he said why only because they worshipped god in a 
different way 
proxmire drew praise from his colleagues for his long and often 
lonely fight and sen joseph r biden jr ddel told the 
senate i have no single doubt in my mind that there would be no 
treaty without senator proxmire 
the senator from wisconsin never stopped talking his was a 
kind of moral filibuster said seymour d reich international 
president of bnai brith at a reception honoring proxmire a few 
days later 
the proxmire act defines genocide as an action taken with a 
specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a 
national ethnic racial or religious group 
it would apply to activities in which members of those groups 
were killed seriously injured or permanently impaired through the 
use of drugs torture or similar techniques or were subjected to 
conditions aimed at causing the physical destruction of the 
group 
also included are efforts to prevent births within a group or 
forcefully removing children 
if death results people found responsible could be fined up to 
1 million and imprisoned for life where no death is involved the 
punishment is set at a fine of up to 1 million and 20 ears in 
prison 
under the law anyone convicted of inciting another to violate 
its terms could be fined up to 500000 and imprisoned for up to 
five years 
legalistic and conservative objections to senate ratification of 
the genocide treaty were raised from the beginning 
dr william korey director for international policy research for 
bnai brith international wrote in a recent account about the 
struggle to ratify the pact that part of the problem arose over the 
treatys attempt to outlaw genocide in whole or in part 
fears were apparent in various segregationist circles that the 
reference to in part might be applied to a limited form of race 
violence such as lynchings korey said the phrase mental 
harm also raised concerns 
other critics said the united states might be embarrassed by an 
international show trial based on alleged atrocities against 
american indians in the 19th century 
still others expressed fear that ratification could result in 
american citizens being tried against their will by an international 
tribunal without the protections accorded by the us constitution 
these fears were dealt with in 1986 when the senate adopted 
reservations asserting the right of us citizens to contitutional 
protections and giving the united states the right to exempt itself 
from compulsory jurisdiction in genocide cases before the world 
court

a pentagon audit says vague guidelines are to 
blame for millions of dollars in questionable payments to major 
defense contractors for work performed by outside consultants 
defense contract audit agency in a review of 12 of the top 100 
defense contractors questioned the validity of claims for 43 
million out of the 2365 million charged to the government over the 
past year for consultants 
a separate audit by the pentagon inspector generals office 
estimated that an air force logistics center in georgia paid an 
estimated 104 million for spare parts that did not meet contract 
specifications amounting to 89 percent of its inventory 
the review of consultants fees by the defense contract agency 
involved 12 major contractors boeing co general dynamics corp 
hughes aircraft co ibm inc litton industries inc lockheed 
corp martin marietta corp mcdonnell douglas corp northrop 
corp raytheon co unisys corp and united technologies corp 
the audit released friday found that the internal business 
discipline one would expect at a large company for hiring outsiders 
is in most cases nonexistent 
if anything the total for questionable claims is 
understated the audit added 
often contractors simply could not explain what work their 
consultants had performed the auditors wrote and in some cases it 
appears the consultants performed lobbying or publicity work that 
should not have been reimbursed 
the dcaa audit spawned by a massive fraud investigation at the 
pentagon depicts a clubby atmosphere in which major contractors 
rarely ask that consultant contracts be put in writing and 
frequently hire consultants without soliciting competitive bids 
the pentagon in releasing the audit announced it already had 
written new regulations to address the dcaas concerns 
the audit was ordered last july after disclosures that federal 
prosecutors were conducting a wideranging fraud investigation 
focusing on contractors and their outside consultants along with 
selected pentagon employees 
the separate audit on the procurement of spare parts by the air 
force concluded that the service did not receive the quality parts 
it paid for 
a spokesman for air force logistics command at wrightpatterson 
air force base in dayton ohio took sharp issue with the draft 
inspector generals report which was obtained and distributed by 
the project on military procurement a private watchdog group in 
washington 
the figure is very misleading said air force spokesman ken 
perrotte they tested a sample and made projections he said 
challenging both the methods and the calculations used by the 
inspector generals office 
to make their estimate auditors from the inspector generals 
office visited the warner robbins air logistics center 18 miles 
south of macon ga and checked samples of inventory items ranging 
from a bolt costing 695 to more complicated hardware costing 
thousands of dollars per item 
the total value of the items checked was 1144 million of which 
484 million worth were found to have major nonconformances 
which made them unfit for service and 55 million had less serious 
problems known as minor nonconformances 
the auditors checked 1027 samples of 46 different items and 
projected their results against a total of 685925 spare parts 
calculated to have been at the center those projections showed that 
89 percent of the spares did not meet contract specifications

the energy departments estimate of the cost of 
building a superconducting super collider could be nearly 50 percent 
too low a government study says 
the congressional budget office study said the price tag could be 
64 billion if costs follow the pattern for atom smashers already 
built it offered a second estimate which it said was based on more 
conservative assumptions of 51 billion 
the energy department has put the projects cost at 44 billion 
a figure it said was accurate within 10 percent given that final 
design studies will not be done until a site is chosen 
the collider would be a 53mile underground ring of magnets 
capable of whipping proton beams together with 20 times the force of 
the most powerful existing accelerator the tevatron at the fermi 
national accelerator laboratory in batavia ill 
scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from 
studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions 
the study released this week by the congressional budget office 
said the energy department may have underestimated the price of 
collider components such as protoncollision detectors and 
overestimated savings expected from advances in the manufacture of 
superconducting magnets 
superconductors transmit electricity without resistance 
congress has appropriated 205 million for the collider 
including 100 million for research and development in the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 but has not authorized its construction 
illinois arizona colorado michigan north carolina tennessee 
and texas were chosen as finalists from among 25 states bidding for 
the collider which will provide its host with thousands of 
construction jobs and permanent work for as many as 3000 people 
energy secretary john herrington is expected to announce a 
tentative site selection this month and confirm the choice by 
january 1989

a decorated former air force colonel who 
inadvertently shot a 30mm antitank shell into a service station 
gasoline pump has escaped criminal charges 
arlington county general district judge paul sheridan on friday 
dismissed a misdemeanor charge against robert dilger saying im 
convinced that you have suffered enough 
the judge noted that dilger scraped together 50000 to help 
compensate the people injured by flying shrapnel in the august 1986 
explosion 
dilger had pleaded no contest a little over a year ago to the 
misdemeanor charge of discharging a firearm in a public place 
sheridan had postponed sentencing in order to give dilger a chance 
to try to compensate the people hurt in the explosion 
three of the four people injured sued dilger and the federal 
government attorneys for the injured said the government was partly 
at fault for supplying dilger with ammunition 
the army never admitted liability but one of dilgers attorneys 
said the government had agreed to pay 80 percent of the settlement 
to the victims that agreement was reached about two weeks ago 
it seems to me that the injured people have been satisfied 
sheridan said 
the local prosecutor did not object to the dismissal of the 
charge 
dilger who was trying to market the 30mm antitank cannon to the 
pentagon at the time of the accident refused comment after the 
hearing 
dilger told authorities he had been filling his pickup truck with 
gasoline when he noticed his companion raymond donohue was 
examining the cannon when he tried to show donohue how the weapon 
worked it went off nobody could have been more surprised than 
myself 
following the explosion dilger said he picked up one victim and 
pulled her away from the burning pumps then moved the truck and 
another vehicle away from the pumps 
dilger and donohue drove away from the scene but had second 
thoughts and said they had started circling back toward the station 
when stopped by police 
sheridan said he considered criminal penalties because dilger 
winner of three silver stars and four distinguished flying crosses 
in vietnam left the scene of the accident 
the only upsetting part of this was the walking away the 
judge said that is the only reason i would have denied the 
dismissal request 
theresa thompson a former gas station employee had sought 24 
million in damages elda and domenico gargani of arlington who were 
sitting in a nearby car when the pump exploded sought 1 million 
each all three were injured by metal fragments from the explosion

three people receiving intravenous feedings 
have died from a vitamin b1 deficiency the food and drug 
administration announced as it urged doctors to be sure patients 
being fed by needle are getting the essential nutrient 
identities of the patients were not released but the fda said 
friday the deaths were indirectly due to a national shortage of a 
multivitamin preparation usually added to the liquid given patients 
receiving intravenous feedings 
the shortage occurred after a chicago manufacturer of the 
multivitamin supplement lyphomed inc had to cut production after 
the fda ordered a recall in july of some of the companys product 
bill grigg an fda spokesman said that as a result of the 
shortage the federal agency was concerned that patients receiving 
the iv feedings would not receive vitamin b1 or thiamine which is 
essential to the body 
potentially fatal thiamine deficiencies could result because 
thiamine is consumed at a high rate in patients receiving 
intravenous feedings of glucose sugar said the fda announcement 
the announcement came after the american society for parentral 
and enternal nutrition an organization of experts in iv feedings 
warned its 5000 members that three patients receiving iv feedings 
have died as a result of thiamine deficiency marsha regenstein a 
spokeswoman at aspen confirmed the deaths but said the 
organizations legal counsel had advised against identifying the 
patients 
grigg said he had no further details on the deaths 
intravenous or iv feedings are used for patients who are unable 
to take food by mouth this would include those who are unconscious 
or who do not have an intact digestive system due to surgery injury 
or disease 
janet gannon a dietician for aspen said those most at risk are 
patients receiving what is called parentral feedings 
she said such patients receive liquid feedings of 70 percent 
glucose through a needle that leads directly into the aorta a 
shortage of thiamine in such patients can develop in as little as a 
week because the vitamin is essential for metabolizing the glucose 
about 10000 to 15000 patients in the nation are on parentral 
feeding she said 
vitamin b1 is essential for functioning of the cardiovascular and 
nervous system and for metabolism a deficiency results in a 
disease called beriberi severe cases can lead to heart failure and 
death thiamine easily can be added to the routine iv feedings ms 
gannon said 
melissa marsden a spokeswoman at lyphomed the company chose to 
close its orlando fla plant for a time after fda inspectors found 
a problem that involved keeping products sterile she said the 
problem has been corrected and lyphomed is now back into full 
production 
grigg said it is expected that the shortage of the vitamin 
supplement will be corrected soon

president reagan has signed into law 
legislation boosting spending on aids testing research and 
education by up to 870 million a year 
the compromise measure stripped of controversial elements that 
had tied it up for months was approved by the house and senate in 
separate voice votes on oct 13 
white house officials traveling with reagan on friday announced 
in voorhees township nj that the president had signed the 
measure 
fearful that no legislation expanding spending on aids programs 
would be passed because of opposition from conservatives 
particuarly sen jesse helms rnc the measures chief backers 
agreed to bring it up as part of an overall health package that 
skirted the controversial matters of confidentiality for aids test 
results and antidiscrimination protection for those found to carry 
the virus 
as finally approved the measure authorizes 100 million a year 
for aids testing over the next two years and an additional 100 
million in each of the next two years for home health care of people 
with aids 
it also includes up to 300 million in new research funds in each 
of the next three years and 370 million additional for aids 
education 
although disappointed they were not able to push through 
provisions guaranteeing confidentiality and antidiscrimination 
protection aids activists in and out of congress said a bill that 
essentially just expanded spending without breaking new policy 
ground was better than no bill at all 
the main authors rep henry a waxman dcalif and sen edward 
m kennedy dmass have vowed to continue their quest for 
confidentiality and antidiscrimination protection when the new 
congress convenes in january 
whatever the outcome of the presidential election next tuesday 
backers of such provisions are encouraged they will have more 
support from the white house 
both republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis have 
said they support the white house aids commissions call last summer 
for federal antidiscrimination legislation as the single most 
important tool in fighting the disease 
reagan has made no such declaration referring the matter to the 
justice department for study 
bushs top health adviser told reporters this week that the vice 
president if elected would push for antidiscrimination legislation 
health professionals maintain that the best way to curb the 
spread of the virus which federal officials estimate has already 
infected up to 15 million us residents is to do everything 
possible to encourage people to come forward for testing and 
counseling 
and the best way to do that they argue is to insure that people 
who carry the virus will not be punished by arbitrarily losing their 
jobs homes and health insurance 
the chief victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have 
been homosexual men and intravenous drug users although a small 
percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated 
blood heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women 
to their offspring 
as of monday aids had been diagnsed in 76932 americans of whom 
more than half or 43177 have died since june 1 1981 according 
to the federal centers for disease control no one is known to have 
recovered from aids

lloyd bentsen is in california for a final day 
of campaigning there in hopes of putting michael dukakis over the 
top in that most important state 
this is the big prize fortyseven electoral votes he said 
on arrival friday night at the burbank airport 
we win this one we win it all he said 
bentsen claimed the latest polls showed the republican lead 
collapsing and insisted the democrats still had time to catch them 
by election day bentsen planned to attend a getoutthevote rally 
this morning in east los angeles 
the republicans are dropping like a rock in those polls he 
told the cheering crowd of several hundred at the airport rally 
bentsen was in texas and new mexico earlier in the day in 
houston bentsen worked to highlight the democratic tickets 
commitment to the space program which has a major presence in texas 
industry and with the johnson space center in houston 
the texas senator toured the challenger center at the houston 
museum of natural science the center was founded as part of an 
effort in the wake of the 1986 challenger space shuttle tragedy to 
boost interest in science and technology among the young 
bentsen looked at a mock space station to watch fourth graders 
operate various devices and he took an electronic stress test a 
girl held wires to bentsens finger and measured only 16 on a scale 
in which 5 is considered normal 
that means im cool the senator quipped 
bentsen also met with a student audience in the museum 
auditorium and made an unusual miscue 
the man michael dukakis has said would head up his cabinet 
council on space asserted that the next space shuttle launched the 
atlantis would be unmanned in fact the ship will have a crew of 
five for its secret military mission later this month 
aides attributed the mistake to an incorrect briefing paper 
on his way to california bentsen stopped in las cruces nm 
for a rally at that airport with about 500 supporters hosted by 
sen jeff bingaman dnm 
bentsen said he wanted to set em straight on issues the 
republicans have distorted such as gun control and defense the las 
cruces area is near the white sands testing area and government 
research dollars are important to the area economy 
bentsen told the crowd a democratic administration would spend 1 
billion a year on research on star wars the democrats currently 
oppose deployment of a spacebased missile defense system

the french vote sunday on a referendum the 
government hopes will bring peace to the pacific territory of new 
caledonia following a campaign that has generated little enthusiasm 
and confusion about what theyre voting on 
polls leading up to the vote indicate only 38 percent of the 
eligible voters will cast ballots of those who said they would go 
to the polls 84 percent said they would approve the plan 
periodic violence has broken out in the territory since november 
1984 between native melanesians known locally as kanaks and white 
settlers called caldoches nearly 40 people have been killed 
on april 22 melanesians attacked a police station on the island 
of ouvea killing four policemen and taking 27 others hostage on 
may 5 an assault on a cave where the kidnappers held the hostages 
killed two more policemen and 19 kanaks 
the latest attacks sobered caledonians native and european and 
caused them to rethink their attitudes 
the plan to be voted on sunday has attracted great support in 
mainland france governing socialists communists and centerright 
union for french democracy all are backing a yes vote on sunday 
premier michel rocard has taken a frontline role in the campaign 
i dont want there to be any more violence and deaths in new 
caledonia the premier said i say no to civil war and the only 
means of preventing this danger is the yes in the referendum he 
said 
the conservative rally for the republic is campaigning for 
absention it says it cannot disavow its local arm which agreed to 
the plan but also cannot vote for it because of constitutional 
objections 
frances socialist government is asking voters sunday to approve 
measures set out in 96 articles of a long draft law that few people 
have read and because of its legalistic language even fewer have 
understood 
some people interviewed by newspapers and television seem to 
think they are voting directly on independence for new caledonia 
others are not sure exactly what they are voting for though some 
say they will vote anyway 
the essential provision is for a local referendum in 10 years to 
decide if the territory becomes independent or remains french 
meanwhile the new law would divide new caledonia into three 
provinces each with its own local assembly and an elected 
territorial congress with no predetermined ethnic breakdown the 
territory would be ruled directly from paris until next summer when 
the new bodies and local administration would take over 
the population of the archipelago controlled by france since 
1853 is 145000 
fortythree percent are native melanesians mostly favoring 
independence but they are in the minority because most polynesians 
and asians support the european community of 37 percent that 
generally wants to remain french 
the plan to be put before french voters sunday came out of june 
discussions between jeanmarie tjibaou leader of the kanak 
socialist national liberation front and jacques lafleur head of 
antiindependence rally for caledonia in the republic they met in 
paris with rocard and the resulting plan was lauded as one of the 
successes of rocards new government 
a referendum on independence was held in the territory sept 13 
1987 when local voters supported remaining french by 983 percent 
to 17 percent but the main melanesian group had called for a 
boycott keeping turnout to 59 percent 
all eligible french voters including those in new caledonia and 
other overseas territories may vote sunday

keeping the public informed about the illness of 
emperor hirohito has proved to be a marathon job for an overworked 
palace staff and weary press corps 
hundreds of journalists stake out the imperial household agency 
and the seven gates to the moated palace in hopes of snaring 
visitors who have just seen hirohito or of gleaning a clue to his 
health from seeing who is entering the palace the chief doctors 
or a blooddelivery car 
dozens of japanese reporters and cameramen fill the vaulted halls 
of the palace agency rolled up in blankets on the floor slumped 
over lawn chairs or vacantly reading comic books others scribble 
away elbow to elbow at tiny desks in the press room 
some go home so rarely that the media have virtually taken over 
nearby hotels 
weve had a couple of reporters hospitalized out of sheer 
fatigue said a reporter for tokyo broadcasting system a major 
private tv network 
news reports have consisted almost entirely of detailed updates 
on hirohitos pulse temperature blood pressure respiration blood 
transfusions and vague palace comments that the monarch is 
resting 
the 87yearold hirohito began suffering from internal bleeding 
sept 19 and since has been given many blood transfusions 
the sole official source for such news is kenji maeda who until 
july was police chief in northern aomori prefecture 
maeda 49 is head of the imperial household agency general 
affairs division which means he is in charge of security as well as 
palace spokesman when he took the job he hastily studied up on 
imperial history and traditions but concedes there is no time for 
that now 
the 20year police veteran still is getting used to the 
intricacies of the imperial household and the specialized language 
used to talk to and about family members 
i admit it all makes me nervous he says carefully his eyes 
fluttering from lack of sleep its been true onthejob 
training 
maeda works 12 to 13 hours daily seven days a week then faces 
more telephone calls and reporters when he gets home 
the palace press club is a tightly knit grouping of nine big 
newspapers and six tv networks following a japanese media tradition 
that gives them exclusive coverage rights other japanese media and 
foreign reporters are barred from membership 
we understand the medias deep interest said maeda but 
they want everything we just tell them what we feel is necessary 
his office view of black pine camphor and sweet acorn trees is 
marred by a parking lot jammed with media vans bristling with 
antennae and microwave dishes 
six black telephones sit beside maedas desk linked with other 
extensions in the agency the fukiage palace where hirohito is 
bedridden and the national police agency a portrait of the imperial 
family hangs on a wall next to a huge photograph of the emperor 
hosting a banquet for president reagan 
once viewed as a living god the emperor still is seen by many as 
a hallowed symbol of state according to imperial household agency 
rules he may be seen but not heard on television except in rare 
appearances before the public and palace officials refuse to 
describe his private conversations 
maeda like any japanese bureaucrat refuses to talk about what 
happens once hirohito dies dismissing such questions as 
hypothetical 
for the media it has been an enormous expense kyodo news 
service estimates it spends 160000 a day on emperor coverage 
while tv networks face daily bills of 240000 
but the reporting has been a windfall for some one kyodo 
correspondent said he earned 4000 in overtime during the first 
month of hirohitos illness

the oldfavorite pairing of cavalleria 
rusticana and pagliacci returned to the metropolitan opera 
friday night after three years away 
both had their thrilling moments as well as moments that werent 
ghena dimitrova singing her first santuzza in cav at the met 
has wonderful vocal power which she put on the boil as a woman 
scorned her voice can simultaneously have a harsh delivery showing 
santuzzas bitter feelings and a beautiful big sound 
she and tenor ermanno mauro singing turiddu blended well 
though they didnt always attack the notes at the same time their 
duet in which she pleads with him to return contained passionate 
singing 
baritone bruno pola of rovereto italy made his met debut as the 
farmer whose bride has taken up with turiddu he didnt make a 
favorable impression 
soprano ilona tokody of szeged hungary also made her met debut 
friday as nedda in pagliacci she has a strong vibrato which 
sounds unpleasant to americans who usually prefer a clear tone 
mauro sang in pag also he sounded good in both but didnt 
quite make the most of his big pagliacci aria vesti la 
giubba his finale was stirring 
the strongest impressions in the second opera were made by juan 
pons of ciudadela mexico singing the prologue in a focused voice 
which held the ears rapt attention without shouting and baritone 
gregg baker of memphis whose singing as neddas lover sounded 
intensely romantic 
alessandro siciliani of florence italy made his met debut 
conducting with more graceful results in cavalleria rusticana 
than in pagliacci

sen dan quayle says governor michael dukakis 
cannot reconcile talk of the massachusetts miracle with the fact 
that a state currentaccounts fund is nearly 190 million in the red 
we know right now that states revenue collections are way 
below estimates quayle the republican vice presidential 
candidate told a campaign rally in this northeastern louisiana city 
appearing later friday before some 5000 to 6000 auburn 
university students one of the largest quayle crowds of the 
campaign the senator mocked tax hike mike and said young people 
should trust george bush to ensure continued economic prosperity 
quayle was touring the midatlantic states of maryland and west 
virginia today as the long campaign for the white house neared its 
conclusion 
in the monroe speech quayle excoriated dukakis for the 
currentaccounts problem saying it was evidence of mistaken 
taxandspend policies 
this week the citizens of massachusetts awoke to find out that 
their states bank accounts have been overdrawn up to 190 million 
for the past 30 days he said 
he likes to talk about a massachusetts miracle quayle said 
but the only miracle involving massachusetts will be the one he 
needs to get out of the mess he created for his state 
quayle said that despite the totally false denials made by gov 
dukakis in his last debate with george bush we knew the fiscal 
situation was bad 
the state constitution in massachusetts requires a balanced 
budget but the amount of tax receipts that have been coming into 
the states coffers have been less than anticipated by the office of 
state treasurer robert crane consequently the balance in the 
current account accrued a deficit of close to 190 million 
governors faced with lessthanexpected state tax revenues often 
issue what are called revenue anticipation bonds meaning they 
borrow money against the revenue they expect to come in thus 
closing the gap but in the massachusetts situation state officials 
apparently opted to pay the interest on the 190 million overdraft 
rather than face a higher prevailing interest rate on the floating 
of such bonds 
the state has over 1 billion in separate accounts but these 
monies are untouchable they involve funds raised through other bond 
issues for projects such as highway construction and public works 
under the reagan administration the federal debt has more than 
doubled surpassing 2 trillion 
quayle made his fourth visit to louisiana and boasted that he 
and bush have a southern strategy that will produce big 
victories in the region next tuesday 
during the monroe speech the indiana senator said i doubt if 
michael dukakis has been spending too much time in the south he 
thinks alligators are something you buy in a shoe store

united nations the soviet announcement that it is suspending 
its troop withdrawal from afghanistan culminates months of protests 
against the continued arming of afghan rebels by pakistan and the 
united states 
the friday announcement could mark an unraveling of the carefully 
crafted un afghanistan agreement signed april 13 in geneva by the 
soviet union the united states afghanistan and pakistan 
that accord was considered the first un victory in years 
resolving a regional conflict and showing moscow was trying to 
extricate itself from such conflicts worldwide 
the development comes one day after the un general assembly 
adopted its first consensus resolution in which the united states 
the soviet union pakistan and afghanistan agreed on afghanistan 
un diplomats say some nations may have overestimated soviet 
determination to withdraw from afghanistan end an unpopular war and 
cut its losses at any cost 
washington proudly admits arming the moslem rebels and denies it 
is violating the afghanistan agreement but it accuses moscow of 
violating it by aiding the kabul government and most recently by 
providing ss1 scud missiles and using backfire bombers 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in geneva for 
iraniraq peace talks had not seen the moscow report and had no 
immediate comment un officials said 
the soviets on friday announced the suspension of their troop 
withdrawal because of recent afghan rebel successes and indicated 
they might not meet the feb 15 withdrawal deadline unless the 
attacks stop 
it was the clearest soviet statement that continued arming of 
afghan rebels by pakistan and the united states would not be 
tolerated and could jeopardize the withdrawal schedule 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has repeatedly 
protested such pakistani aid saying it violates the geneva 
agreements call for noninterference in afghan and pakistani 
internal affairs 
shevardnadze has said the soviet union might have to reconsider 
and possibly extend its withdrawal schedule if violations and aid to 
the rebels continue and that the united states as a guarantor must 
bear some responsibility 
in september shevardnadze said the soviets have not yet started 
the second phase of their withdrawal lets wait and see it is 
necessary to stop the violations that take place 
he told the general assembly as soon as soviet troops began to 
withdraw a nonstop production line of violations was set in 
motion 
shevardnadze appealed to the five permanent members of the 
security council to discuss agreement violations the five are the 
united states britain china france and the soviet union 
under the afghanistan agreement the kremlin agreed to withdraw 
half its 100000 troops from afghanistan by aug 15 and the 
remainder by feb 15 
the un observer group of 50 soldiers certified the soviet 
pullout but the soviets complained the group operates poorly and 
has not investigated violations the arming of rebels 
the agreement also requires noninterference by afghanistan and 
pakistan in each others internal affairs moscow and kabul say the 
arming of rebels by pakistan and the united states violates the 
agreement most of the aid comes from the united states and is 
funneled through pakistan 
but diplomats say the americans and soviets tacitly agreed if one 
side continues aiding and arming clients the other side may do the 
same 
the state department says the soviets have used ss1 scud 
missiles against rebel positions and backfire bombers to aid afghan 
forces under attack 
washington says the introduction of soviet missiles violates the 
accord moscow says arming the rebels is a violation 
on thursday for the first time in nine years when soviet troops 
moved in to afghanistan the general assembly by consensus adopted 
its annual afghanistan resolution without a divisive vote calling 
for soviet withdrawal or criticisms of the soviet union 
this year a milder resolution expressed satisfaction with the 
troop withdrawal and expectation of its completion by feb 15 it 
was adopted by acclamation with agreement among the united states 
soviet union afghanistan and pakistan

groundbreaking reforms in soviet lithuania are 
fueling cautious hope among lithuanian emigres but also stirring 
discord over the prospect that some degree of independence may be on 
the horizon 
we are all a little bit shocked by the changes said algis 
klimaitis a lithuanian dissident who lives in france and works with 
the baltic world council he said some people are too quick to 
accept the soviet reforms and some people are too skeptical we 
must find a middle way 
the debate over tactics has heated up in the last two weeks 
following an inaugural conference in the lithuanian capital of 
vilnius of the officially sanctioned movement for restructuring 
which takes its name from soviet president mikhail gorbachevs plan 
of economic and social reform 
about 20000 people gathered for the oct 2223 conference where 
more than 1000 delegates including many communist party members 
adopted resolutions demanding sweeping reforms for lithuania 
already one of the most progressive of the 15 soviet republics 
emigres who participated in the conference said that within a few 
days the lithuanian party began to reduce food and medical 
privileges enjoyed by its elite members 
and last week the newly installed party chief algirdas 
brazauskas announced plans to free several prominent political 
prisoners 
vytautas bieliauskas president of the lithuanian world community 
and one of a few us citizens allowed to attend the conference 
said enthusiasm is quite high in lithuania 
people were sitting at the television it was transmitting 
everything from the conference and people were crying he said 
after returning home to cincinnati ohio 
bieliauskas whose organization says it represents a quarter of 
the worlds 1 million expatriate lithuanians received a visa to 
attend the conference but many other emigre activists were refused 
permits 
some claim that by this move soviet authorities were trying to 
drive a wedge into the lithuanian emigre community 
they the people of lithuania are after independence but the 
soviets only want the economic advantage of free enterprise people 
expect more freedom than theyll get said ancietas simiutis 
lithuanias consul generalinexile in the united states 
the soviet union absorbed the baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia in 1940 under a secret pact with nazi germany 
nationalists denounced the pact and several countries including 
the united states continue to recognize baltic diplomats who 
maintain offices in the west 
simiutis is one of many nationalists who are skeptical of 
gorbachevs campaign to reform the soviet system and permit more 
openness about controversial issues 
we think bieliauskas is doing a good job but he might be a 
bit naive because he expects more than the soviets will give 
simiutis said he said the soviets need bieliauskas to help 
legitimize their occupation and called his admission to the 
conference a soviet trick 
bieliauskas responded that the lithuanian organizations 
executive committee voted 81 in favor of him attending the 
conference 
lithuania is occupied by the soviet union but it doesnt 
mean it doesnt exist i deal with people not with the 
government bieliauskas said 
bieliauskas said independence could be possible for lithuania 
but people are not ready the process has just started i 
believe in the process but it will take time he said 
klimaitis of the baltic world council said the older generation 
wants only the reconstruction of the baltics of the 19181940 
period when they were independent but it looks like there are 
other possibilities more creative ideas for a new state he 
said speaking by telephone from strasbourg france 
klimaitis envisioned the republics in a loose confederation with 
the central government in moscow that would have control only over 
military and some foreign affairs 
i think this will be possible klimaitis said because 
gorbachev realizes the region could become the soviet unions big 
dutyfree shop 
soviet politburo member alexander n yakovlev last week appeared 
to rule out independence for the baltic republics by saying in a 
published interview that moscow wouldnt let the baltic states 
conduct their own foreign affairs or print their own currency 
but bieliauskas maintains his hope for independence pointing to 
a younger generation of activists in lithuania 
klimaitis called the youths participation the most encouraging 
sign he saw 
they have had some days of real freedom and they will never 
forget that

the virus program that infected computers 
across the country was created by a graduate student at cornell 
university whose father is one of the governments most respected 
computer security experts the new york times reported in saturdays 
editions 
two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the times 
that robert t morris jr 23 a computer science graduate student 
whom friends describe as brilliant wrote the set of computer 
instructions as an experiment 
the student could not be reached for comment friday the 
newspaper reported 
m stuart lynn vice president of cornells information 
technologies said in a statement early saturday that the university 
had not talked to morris but confirmed that he was a graduate 
student at cornell 
we are investigating his computer files at cornell and so far 
we have determined that his account contains files that appear to 
hold passwords for some computers at cornell and stanford to which 
he is not entitled lynn said we also have discovered that 
morris account contains a list of passwords substantially similar 
to those found in the virus 
earlier lynn said the university cannot say whether or not he 
was responsible for this activity adding weve tried to reach 
him but hes not at home apparently hes left for washington hes 
apparently not in ithaca right now 
several telephone calls to morris seniors home in silver spring 
md near washington went unanswered later an answering machine 
was attached and there was no immediate response to requests for 
calls to be returned 
the virus was introduced into the arpanet the department of 
defense computer network the times said it was intended to live 
there innocently and undetected slowly making copies that would 
move from computer to computer the report said 
but a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out of 
control ultimately jamming more than 6000 computers nationwide 
the virus apparently caused no damage other than the thousands of 
hours that computer scientists and programmers were spending to 
remove it from their systems by friday universities and research 
centers turned their computers back on 
sources told the times the younger morris flew to washington 
friday and is planning to hire a lawyer and meet with officials of 
the defense communications agency in charge of the arpanet network 
to discuss the case 
his father robert morris sr has written widely on the security 
of the unix operating system the computer master program that was 
the target of his sons virus program of which the sources said 
he had no prior knowledge 
the 56yearold morris told the times in a telephone interview 
friday that the virus was the work of a bored graduate student 
he said his son was for his age very well trained in computer 
science he studied it in college and held various summer jobs at 
various places 
the times reported friday that an anonymous caller to the 
newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a 
harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it 
got out of hand 
the elder morris spoke in the presence of officials and lawyers 
of the national security agency and would not discuss the case in 
detail 
he is chief scientist at the national computer security center in 
bethesda md the arm of the national security agency devoted to 
protecting computers against outside attack 
the elder morris told the times that he believed the virus might 
ultimately have a positive effect 
it has raised the public awareness to a considerable degree 
he said it is likely to make people more careful and more 
attentive to vulnerabilities in the future 
earlier the fbi said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to 
determine whether federal law had been violated 
contacted about the times report fbi spokesman lane betts said 
he could add nothing beyond the prepared statement earlier in the 
day 
as the matter is currently under investigation it would be 
inappropriate for me to comment on it betts said

british prime minister margaret thatcher 
pressed communist authorities to open negotiations with the 
opposition during her visit to poland but also advised the 
opposition to act with restraint 
the conservative party prime minister who returned home late 
friday after a threeday visit performed a balancing act in her 
meetings with government officials and leaders of the outlawed 
solidarity union movment 
she declared she had no intention of meddling in the countrys 
internal affairs but then encouraged social strivings for greater 
freedom and human rights while urging the government to stay tough 
in restructuring its economy 
after her visit ended the official pap news agency reported 
public opinion polls showed mrs thatcher was viewed favorably by 52 
percent of the polish population which it said made her more 
popular in poland than in britain 
a poll of polls issued today by the british broadcasting 
corp showed support in britain for mrs thatchers conservative 
party at 47 percent with labor second at 35 percent and smaller 
groups trailing far behind the poll covered the period of oct 
1930 
saying farewell friday night to polands communist party leader 
gen wojciech jaruzelski mrs thatcher thanked him for allowing her 
to meet with different leaders 
during her visit she went to gdansk the birthplace of 
solidarity and met with solidary founder lech walesa as thousands 
of defiant people cheered her and hooted the government 
mrs thatcher who arrived wednesday also spent hours in 
conversation with jaruzelski and prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski hearing their appeals for greater cooperation from the 
west in helping poland tackle its foreign debt problem 
she was told the government is serious about economic and 
political reforms and that the west should recognize polands 
achievements 
mrs thatcher expressed sympathy for the goals at one point 
telling rakowski he was pursuing the same type of restructuring she 
had done in britain and she also told him he might have to endure 
criticism en route to success 
she also seemed to express doubts about the pace of reforms and 
the governments attempts to set up talks with the opposition while 
showing enthusiasm for solidarity 
she was the first western leader to make the significant gesture 
of traveling to gdansk to talk with walesa solidarity was created 
at the lenin shipyards in gdansk in fall 1980 and became the first 
legally chartered free union movement in the soviet bloc 
in december 1981 the union was suspended and it was outlawed the 
next year by parliament 
mrs thatcher told walesa his leadership has achieved so much 
i knew that i had to come and feel the spirit of poland for 
myself she told 20000 poles who gave her a sustained greeting 
outside the lenin shipyard where walesa works as an electrician 
the government announced monday it would close the shipyard on 
dec 1 it said the subsidized state industry is losing money 
opponents called the decision a political attack on solidarity 
mrs thatcher avoided commenting on the dispute telling a news 
conference thats not for me it is for the people of poland to 
decide 
the official media gave the thatcher visit heavy coverage but 
omitted mention of her meeting with walesa 
solidarity leaders had hoped she would press authorities to 
recognize reality and again make solidarity a legal organization 
at a thursday banquet given by jaruzelski she linked western 
financial assistance to a government dialogue with the opposition 
and said poland needs political freedom to achieve economic progress 
that pleased the opposition it was beautiful what she said 
a senior solidarity adviser historian bronislaw geremek told 
reporters 
poland has a crippling 39 billion foreign debt 
government spokesman jerzy urban said friday night it was too 
early to assess the visit 
urban was asked about mrs thatchers suggestion that western 
economic aid would be forthcoming if a real dialogue was 
undertaken with solidarity 
we are skeptical of such attempts to define conditions and of 
such promises he said

a severe earthquake rocked the qinghai region in 
central china on saturday the hong kong observatory reported 
the observatory said the quake occurred at 1019 am and 
registered a preliminary magnitude of 61 on the richter scale 
the quakes epicenter was in the western region of qinghai about 
372 miles north of the tibetan capital of lhasa the observatory 
said 
further details were not immediately available 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans 
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas 
a topscale quake of magnitude 8 is a great earthquake 
capable of tremendous damage in populated areas

the concept is big business in japan where it is known as 
karaoke or empty orchestra 
everything is free for the customer except the beer said 
rick asta choices owner this really helps my places tuesday 
blahs with bigger crowds 
recordahit offers over 600 selections songs from the 1930s to 
the 1980s 
i pick songs whose words im familar with said ms drzal a 
computer programming trainee 
singers get plenty of help copies of lyrics tips on 
vocalizing echoes and other electronic effects backup singers and 
props like sunglasses and cowboy hats 
master of ceremonies steve morse coaxes people on stage like a 
carnival barker 
make a tape theyre great little stocking stuffers for 
christmas he implored 
the show attracts an occasional elvis or michael jackson

when hundreds of army paratroopers 
made a surprise assault on an airport here they were ambushed 
but not to worry they were only beset by autographseeking 
schoolchildren 
some 320 paratroopers flew from fort bragg nc aboard c141 
transport planes and jumped onto the community airport thursday in 
this north florida town practicing how to secure an airfield by 
overwhelming the enemy officials said 
but after the troopers landed children from the keystone heights 
community christian church school ran onto the airfield to talk with 
the paratrooper 
chad sanders 11 was one of about 20 students who chased down 
the troopers who were dressed in combat fatigues and laden with 
gear 
the best part was getting all the autographs and seeing how 
nice everybody is he said they would give their lives for our 
country 
mike merritt a teacher at the private school said the mock 
invasion was a good learning activity for the youngsters and would 
be used in class discussions 
maj roger oliver laughed as he went through a pad of paper 
signing his name we have lots of kids that come out and watch our 
exercises but this is the first time ive been asked for my

the new soviet ambassador to nicaragua 
said his country may increase aid to nicaragua 
we support the sandinista revolution with all our heart 
ambassador valery nikolayenko said friday in his first news 
conference since presenting credentials to president daniel ortega 
on oct 28 
there could be an increase in aid as a result of the 
additional needs of the nicaraguan people nikoloyenko said 
apparently referring to the destruction caused last month by 
hurricane joan 
the hurricane which caused havoc in the caribbean and central 
america was blamed for 103 dead and 186950 homeless in nicaragua 
alone it also caused considerable damage to nicaraguas 
agricultural production 
nikolayenko did not say whether the increased soviet aid would 
include military supplies 
our aid to nicaragua is purely defensive he said 
nikolayenko estimated soviet aid at 490 million a year in 
credits and donations 
he said the soviet union could increase aid to the third world 
because moscow has decreased support of state companies and cut its 
defense budget perestroika or restructuring has decreased state 
subsidies to soviet enterprises and the defense budget decreased 
after disarmament negotiations in geneva the ambassador said 
soviet aid to nicaragua has never dropped from one year to the 
next he said

an 11yearold girl recovering from 
injuries sustained when a lawn dart lodged in her brain said it was 
good news to hear that federal regulators last week banned the sale 
of the game 
the onepound metaltipped dart penetrated about two inches into 
amy herrons skull oct 25 
vanderbilt university medical center doctors said she probably 
saved herself from bleeding to death by leaving it there as she went 
to her mother for help 
i didnt pull it out because i thought it might hurt amy 
said friday in a conversation with reporters 
the girl awake and alert and wondering when she would be allowed 
to go home had been placed in a druginduced coma for several days 
after surgery to minimize damage from the swelling of her brain by 
reducing brain activity 
recounting to reporters how she was injured she said we was 
playing darts to start with and they started throwing them up in 
the air as far as they could throw them 
she said some of her companions were trying to catch the darts as 
they came down i didnt want to play and i started to go back 
home and i didnt see them throw it but they threw it and i looked 
up and it hit me in the head she said 
lamar tucker her stepfather said he was unaware of the 
circumstances of amys injury as she described it 
were going to have to check into that he said 
previously the family thought amy was struck by a dart thrown 
toward a ring on the ground the proper way to play the game which 
is similar to horseshoes 
doctors have told amy she may be released from the hospital by 
wednesday 
they say ill have to stay home for a while that i wont be 
able to go back to school for a while but mother is looking into 
the possibility of getting a teacher to come by the house said 
amy who was listed in fair condition friday 
the injury caused problems with her vision but otherwise left 
her unscathed the mcminnville girl said 
when i look at the elevator and try to push the button it 
looks like its way over there but its right here in front of 
me she said thats the only change ive noticed its the only 
thing i cant do very well now that i could do before 
doctors have not commented on whether amy suffered brain damage 
or can expect any longterm problems from the accident 
we have been very pleased at this point with her situation and 
are very hopeful for a full recovery said dr bennett blumenkopf 
her neurosurgeon her major asset is her age i would rather be 
young than old if i had to recover from anything including a 
hangover 
last week the consumer product safety commission voted to ban 
the sale of lawn darts and said the game probably would be off store 
shelves by christmas 
the darts have been blamed for at least three deaths and several 
thousand injuries in recent years 
the ban did not include a recall and commission member carol 
dawson asked the public to keep the darts out of childrens hands

here is a list of recommendations for computer 
users for virus prevention and control it was drafted by the 
national lan laboratory in reston va and approved this week by 
more than 60 companies 
1 all software should be purchased from known reputable sources 
2 all purchased software should be in its original shrink wrap 
or sealed diskette containers when received 
3 backup copies of all original software should be made as soon 
as the software package is opened backup copies should be stored 
offsite 
4 all software should be reviewed carefully by a system 
manager before it is installed on a computer network 
6 new software should be quarantined on an isolated computer 
this testing will greatly reduce the risk of system virus 
contamination 
7 a backup copy of all system software and data should be made 
at least once a month with the backup copy stored for at least one 
year before reuse this will allow restoration of a system that has 
been contaminated by a timereleased virus a plan that includes 
grandfathered rotation of backup copies will reduce risk even 
further 
8 system administrators should restrict access to system 
programs and data on a needtouse basis this isolates 
problems protects critical applications and aids problem diagnosis 
9 all programs on a system should be checked regularly for 
program length changes any programlength deviations could be 
evidence of tampering or virus infiltration 
10 many shared or free programs are invaluable however these 
are the prime entry point for viruses skeptical review of such 
programs is prudent also extended quarantine is essential before 
these programs are introduced to a computer system 
11 any software that exhibits symptoms of possible virus 
contamination should be removed immediately system managers should 
develop plans for quick removal of all copies of a suspect program 
and immediate backup of all related data these plans should be made 
known to all users and tested and reviewed periodically

a witness testified at the trial 
of mohammed hamadi that during the 1985 twa hijacking hamadi calmly 
said this is the man we killed while looking at a beirut 
newspaper 
ralf traugott a germanborn american citizen who was on the 
hijacked airliner also said friday that he received a mysterious 
telephone call recently in which a caller identified himself as a 
mr hamadi 
about four weeks ago i got a telephone call i thought it was 
kind of strange traugott said the man on the other end of the 
line said hello mr ralf 
i said whos this and he said mr hamadi this is 
beirut lebanon calling traugott testified 
he said the man then hung up without mentioning hamadis trial 
traugott was not further questioned about the call and did not say 
if he thought it was a threat 
hamadi comes from a family of 11 children an older brother 
abdulhadi is security chief in beirut for the fanatical hezbollah 
party of god organization 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder air 
piracy and other crimes in the hijacking thirtynine americans were 
held hostage 17 days and a 23yearold navy diver rogert stethem 
was killed in the ordeal 
traugott caused a stir in the courtroom when he produced a 
lebanese newspaper annahar dated june 16 1985 two days after 
twa flight 847 was seized on a flight from athens to rome 
the newspapers account of the hijacking then in progress at 
beirut airport included photographs of the hijacked plane and a 
photograph of stethems body lying on the tarmac 
traugott said hamadi had been reading the newspaper aboard the 
plane and when i asked him what was in it he said this is the 
man we killed i asked him did you shoot him 
he said no my friend shot him traugott testified he 
said it very nonchalantly like it was no big deal 
hamadi admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied shooting 
stethem he blamed the killing on his accomplice identified by 
court documents as hassan ezzeddine 
in another conversation on the hijacked plane hamadi told 
traugott he was a member of the hezbollah and had been trained in 
iran traugott testified 
hamadi previously denied being a member of hezbollah a radical 
lebanese shiite group backed by iran 
another former american hostage steve willet testified friday 
and confirmed statements by earlier witnesses that the hijackers 
brutally beat the passengers 
under guidelines set by the court to protect the witnesses 
security neither witness named his current residence 
at the time of the hijacking traugotts address was given as 
lunenburg mass while willet lived in choupic la 
hamadi declined comment on fridays testimony 
hamadis lebanese parents arrived friday in west germany to

an intelligencegathering satellite 
capable of spying on 80 percent of the soviet union will be carried 
by the secret space shuttle mission scheduled for late this month 
an industry magazine reports 
when fully deployed the spacecraft will have a span as large 
as 150 feet aviation week and space technology reported it has 
the characteristics of an imaging radar or optical reconnaissance 
involving digital imaging or both 
the radar transmission is designed to penetrate cloud cover and 
would be valuable in both ocean and land surveillance the 
magazine said in its nov 7 issue available friday 
space shuttle atlantis and its fiveman crew will be flying the 
third classified defense department shuttle mission and the 
pentagon and nasa have cloaked most details about it in secrecy 
nasa processing director conrad nagel said the agency was aiming for 
launch on nov 28 or 29 
aviation week said the satellite will be launched into an orbit 
that will enable it to look down on 80 percent of the soviet union 
at least three of the 27 earlier shuttle missions flew over the same 
soviet territory 
the magazine said the satellite will be dropped overboard from 
the cargo bay by an astronaut using the crafts 50foot robot arm 
two astronauts are prepared to take a space walk in case there is 
trouble deploying the satellite 
aviation week said estimates of the cost of the satellite filled 
with advancedtechnology equipment range as high as 500 million 
it said the satellite could be retrieved on a later shuttle mission 
and returned to earth for improvements 
sources who insisted on anonymity earlier told the associated 
press that atlantis would carry an intelligencegathering satellite 
that would help us intelligence officials verify that the soviets 
were complying with arms control treaties 
the sources also said the astronauts will conduct several 
experiments aimed at defining mans role as a military observer in 
space the tests would involve coordination with troop and ship 
movements and missile launchings on earth 
the space shuttle program resumed sept 29 with the successful 
launch of discovery the first shuttle launched since the fatal 
explosion of the shuttle challenger in january 1986 
during the hiatus the pentagon relied on conventional rockets to 
send military payloads into space

employers in metropolitan new york are engaging 
in widespread discrimination against legalized aliens and us 
citizens who appear to be foreigners the first such study of its 
kind in the nation has found 
the study by the new york governors task force on immigration 
affairs said much of the discrimination apparently stemmed from the 
immigration and reform act of 1986 which offered amnesty to 
eligible aliens up to may 4 and then imposed stiffer fines and other 
sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens 
the study begun last month looked at 400 private employers in 
the metropolitan region selected from more than 130000 private 
employers who have more than 4 million people working for them the 
new york times reported today 
by extrapolating from the data gathered from those 400 the study 
found that more than 22000 us citizens or aliens who were 
authorized to work had been at least temporarily denied employment 
in their responses employers indicated confusion about the 
legislation or fear of sanctions the times said 
the panel that conducted the study found that employers 
discriminated by refusing to accept legally valid proof of 
residency by denying employment to those who experience minor 
delays in gathering documentation and by screening out those 
applicants who look or sound foreign 
of the employers surveyed 7 percent admitted they had engaged in 
selective screening or had placed more stringent requirements on 
job applicants who seemed risky under the new sanctions 
the federal general accounting office which is required by 
congress to report evidence of employer discrimination stemming from 
the immigration law is expected to release its annual report monday

although computer viruses have caused little 
damage so far they ultimately may slow the computer revolution by 
requiring the introduction of safeguards that make the machines less 
convenient and accessible 
what i think it does is spell the end of the userfriendly 
era said richard teneyck telecommunications director of the 
boston computer society 
the brave new world of computing i think is still becoming a 
reality but theres a need for a gatekeeper he said friday 
a computer virus is a program that infects other programs by 
modifying them to include a copy of itself it can spread from one 
computer to another and alter or destroy data 
viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone 
lines or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a 
computer 
a virus that swept the country this week temporarily crippled the 
computing centers of many universities and research centers 
business began to return to normal friday as computer operators 
cleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplying program 
in attempts to control viruses there will be much stricter 
limits on who can use certain programs and data bases and under what 
conditions this will make it harder for people to work together in 
computer networks 
new pieces of software no matter how seemingly beneficial will 
be tested at length especially if they come from insecure sources 
certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will be 
run every time someone sits down to use a piece of software causing 
frustrating delays 
there could even be delays in everyday activities such as using a 
credit card 
in short steps to protect against computer viruses may drain 
computers of two of their most important attributes speed and 
accessibility 
even with timeconsuming and expensive precautions viruses will 
remain a problem 
once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almost 
impossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has been 
eradicated said mary carol chruscicki program manager for system 
reliability at a rome ny institute that performs studies for the 
defense department 
some people have expressed concern that the danger of computer 
viruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computers 
were mainframes in locked glass houses operated by people in 
white coats 
ms chruscicki said she does not think that will happen 
the world of information is here and computer users dont want 
to go back to where theyre sheltered from whats out there whether 
its a lowcost product or a free product she said 
the key issue is that with proper precautions one can continue 
to live a normal existence said delbert jones of the national lan 
laboratory in reston va 
more than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelines 
drafted by the national lan laboratory that are intended to prevent 
and control viruses 
among the recommendations 
all software should be purchased from known reputable sources 
new software should be quarantined on an isolated computer for 
testing 
backup copies of all master software and computer data should 
be made at least once a month so the backups can be used if the 
current versions are corrupted by a virus 
its very much like the aids virus the best solution is 
precaution jones said

the fbi says it is studying whether a 
nationwide computer virus attack on a defense department 
computer network broke federal law 
fbi spokesman william carter said friday a criminal investigation 
would be launched if a preliminary inquiry determined that federal 
law had been violated 
the bureau will review the computer fraud and abuse act which 
deals with unauthorized access to government computers or computers 
in two or more states 
if records within the computer systems that were infected are 
found to have been destroyed or harmed the fbi could conduct a 
fullscale investigation carter said 
the virus is an unauthorized computer program that officials this 
week said reproduced in computers nationwide and apparently 
instructed them to send copies of itself to other machines through a 
research network arpanet 
although there was no apparent damage computers were turned off 
as they became overloaded with material 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the virus 
program was created by a graduate student at cornell university 
robert t morris jr 23 whose father is one of the governments 
most respected computer security experts 
two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the times 
that morris wrote the set of computer instructions as an experiment 
the virus was intended to live in the arpanet undetected slowly 
making copies that would move from computer to computer the report 
said but a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out of 
control ultimately jamming more than 6000 computers nationwide 
m stuart lynn cornells vice president for information 
technologies said early today the university had not talked to 
morris but was investigating his computer files 
so far we have determined that his account contains files that 
appear to hold passwords for some computers at cornell and stanford 
to which he is not entitled lynn said in a statement we also 
have discovered that morris account contains a list of passwords 
substantially similar to those found in the virus passwords are 
the codes needed to gain access to computer systems 
the ithaca ny school scheduled a news conference for today 
several telephone calls to the familys home in silver spring 
md near washington went unanswered later an answering machine 
was attached and messages left on it were not returned 
the younger morris also could not be reached the university said 
it did not have a local address for him and lynn said college 
officials believed he was on his way to washington 
arpanet established by the defense departments advanced 
research projects agency is used by researchers and defense 
contractors to share data 
officials said the virus also spread into some government 
computers from nasas langley research center at hampton va to 
the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico 
at los alamos computer security officer jimmy mcclary said the 
virus had caused no damage but a few hundred scientists suffered 
delays in their work 
dr raymond s colladay the director of the advanced research 
projects agency told a pentagon briefing the virus had been 
defeated in roughly 24 hours time after being spotted wednesday 
evening 
he said the pentagon was confident the computer network had 
resumed normal operations 
it was a benign virus by that i mean it didnt destroy 
files colladay said 
colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use the 
system had concluded the virus program while fairly sophisticated 
did not contain any trojan horse bug that could crop up again 
at a later time 
colladay said he had ordered a new study by his agency of the 
security procedures used by arpanet he said pentagon officials 
purposely had designed the network as an open system and 
deliberately rejected various security procedures in the past on 
cost grounds 
colladay and col thomas m herrick the manager of the defense 
data network said the arpanet differed significantly from the 
computer networks that handle classified military information 
herrick said there was never any danger or possibility the virus 
could have jumped from the arpanet to a classified system 
the computer fraud and abuse act prohibits gaining access to a 
federal interest computer without authorization and engaging in 
conduct which alters damages or destroys information 
conviction carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison 
one of the definitions of a federal interest computer is one of 
two or more computers used in committing an offense which are not 
all situated in the same state

a computer vaccine that would block 
the invasion of a computer virus like the one that swept the nation 
this week is under development by scientists at los alamos national 
laboratory 
los alamos computer security officer jimmy mcclary said two main 
efforts are under way to guard against future viral attacks both 
using computers more to get to people who are attacking 
computers 
the first is to use computers to guard computers against 
viruses enhanced intrusion detection techniques that let you look 
for unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computer 
system he said friday 
the other approach is to develop antiviral code 
vaccines if you like to carry the analogy further that amount to 
selfexamining code so the code itself will know if someone makes 
an unauthorized change to it 
computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenient 
for researchers at universities and research centers but did no 
known permanent damage and did not enter classified computers 
the new york times reported today that the virus was created by 
robert t morris jr 23 a cornell university graduate student 
morris father chief scientist of the national security agencys 
national computer security center in bethesda md said the virus 
could make people more careful and more attentive to 
vulnerabilities in the future 
the younger morris could not be reached for comment 
mcclary said scientists at los alamos a federal nuclear weapons 
research center were able to identify the virus and cleanse it from 
the labs system 
the most useful aspect of these sort of events is that they 
occur in an unclassified nonsensitive environment that lets us 
look at the techniques used to introduce these viruses said 
mcclary 
the virus infiltrated the defense department network that links 
computers at scientific laboratories nationwide infecting los 
alamos its sister lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
california and numerous other government and private research 
centers 
this is the largestscale virus attack that i have seen that 
was distributed across the country mcclary said 
a computer virus is a program that infects other programs by 
modifying them to include a copy of itself it can spread from one 
computer to another and alter or destroy data this virus did its 
damage by making repeated copies of itself slowing computer 
processing and eating up computer memory space 
viruses usually are communicated by data transmission over phone 
lines or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a 
computer 
mcclary said scientists working at remote terminals all using 
the unix operating system began experiencing delays in gaining 
access to their research data late wednesday he said he believes 
the first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered the 
computers 
thursday morning laboratory scientists disconnected the access 
route of the virus the electronic mail system by which scientific 
data is transmitted among research institutions he said 
later that morning the us department of energy informed the 
lab the computer virus existed 
los alamos and the other laboratories will analyze the virus code 
to determine its source mcclary said

ten years ago when bob beal paid 7500 for a 
parking space on tony beacon hill some of his friends thought he 
was nuts 
but this year two spots in the same garage changed hands for 
135000 each and 10 more buyers put their names on a waiting 
list so whos nuts now 
id say it looks like it was a pretty good investment beal 
said wouldnt you 
of course not all parking in this city is so expensive a space 
in the garage under the boston common goes for 110 a month all you 
have to do is sign up and wait your turn which at the present 
rate would come in about seven years according to the state agency 
that runs the 1500car garage 
while prices on beacon hill and the wait at the common may be 
extreme examples there is no question that parking has become 
expensive timeconsuming and frustrating in downtown boston 
on an average day according to a recent study by the citys 
transportation department 99 percent of the spaces in the financial 
district are filled by 10 am by noon the occupancy rate rises to 
102 percent the extra 2 percent reflecting illegally parked 
vehicles 
while many major cities have similar problems bostons is 
particularly acute because the parking supply has been frozen since 
1973 when the federal environmental protection agency and a state 
environmental agency set a cap of 35500 spaces in an effort to 
control smog 
only a few cities have such caps others include neighboring 
cambridge and portland ore and in the face of public 
exasperation the city is preparing to seek a partial reprieve 
early next year said transportation commissioner richard a 
dimino the city will present a plan calling for the addition of 
5000 spaces 
in addition the city is trying to encourage car and van pools by 
reserving spaces for them in municipal garages and it is looking to 
build new garages in outlying areas 
to get the new spaces boston will have to prove to the 
environmental agencies that lifting the cap would not make the air 
quality situation any worse and preferably would make an 
improvement said barbara kwetz a state air pollution regulator 
to a large extent bostons parking problem is a matter of simple 
geography downtown covers less than 2 square miles and is bound by 
boston harbor to the west and the charles river to the north and 
east 
but the crunch also has been exacerbated by a building boom in 
which highrent office buildings have drawn more workers and in 
some cases supplanted parking lots or garages 
city officials contend that there is no lack of parking 
enforcement bostons corps of parking officers has jumped almost 50 
percent in the last year from 65 to 95 and the city has been 
issuing tickets at the rate of 150000 a month 
still a 15 ticket can seem cheap compared to the price of 
parking in a garage according to the transportation department the 
average hourly rate across the city is 360 but in some areas 
like the back bay it goes as high as 6 
already several of the citys largest companies including new 
england telephone fidelity investments and the bank of boston 
formed an organization named friends of post office square that 
broke ground last month for a 1400car underground garage in the 
heart of the financial district 
a good measure of the value of downtown parking was provided by 
the organizations sale of 450 shares of preferred stock in the 
garage each share entitles the owner to rent a space in the garage 
for the regular monthly fee expected to be about 340 
all 450 shares were sold in advance for 65000 each

harvard university has agreed to recognize a 
3500member union at the school after a bitter 13year organizing 
drive 
adopting a conciliatory tone harvard president derek bok said 
friday the university decided against appealing a judges recent 
ruling that the union won a fair election in may 
with this decision and the expected certification of the 
union by the national labor relations board we will commence a 
new chapter in our relations with the harvard union of clerical and 
technical workers bok said i will work to make this 
relationship as constructive and harmonious as possible 
anne taylor a harvard administrator responsible for union 
relations said the university hurriedly printed up several thousand 
well make it work buttons in the school colors of crimson and 
white and handed them out to coincide with boks announcement 
i hope people see this as a positive statement by harvard about 
how were going to approach this situation because thats the way 
it was intended she said 
the union drive which began in 1975 was viewed by national 
labor leaders as a test case for organizing whitecollar workers 
derek boks statement is the most respectful gesture that 
harvard could have made to its employees right now said union 
organizer kristine rondeau 
harvard with its main campus in cambridge and the union have 
agreed to 60 days of informal talks before entering contract 
negotiations rondeau said 
the union which represents nonprofessional employees at the ivy 
league college is affiliated with the 11 millionmember american 
federation of state county and municipal employees 
noting that 83 percent of the harvard unions members are women 
afscme president gerald mcentee said the harvard victory is 
enormous and broadly meaningful and will help women in work places 
all over the country 
the union won the may 17 election by a margin of 1530 to 1486 
harvard filed a series of legal objections to the vote contending 
that union organizers kept track of voters at the polls and used 
coercive tactics 
after hearings in august an administrative law judge issued a 
strongly worded decision oct 24 dismissing harvards objections

polands national airline established two firsts 
by ordering advanced us aircraft and planning to offer two classes 
of service in the new jets 
boeing co will sell three 767 widebody jets to lot polish 
airlines marking the first time a soviet bloc nation has purchased 
modern american jets the deal announced friday is worth 220 
million to boeing and general electric co the engine supplier 
lot also said it would offer business and economyclass service 
on the jets only one class of service currently is offered on the 
sovietmade aircraft that make up lots 45plane fleet 
the stateowned airline said the three jets would be used on 
flights linking poland with the united states and thailand it said 
they should help double its traffic between poland and the united 
states as early as next year 
the moves were seen as the first attempt by an eastern bloc 
airline to compete with western concerns for western passengers 
particularly business travelers who pay higher fares but also 
demand a high level of service 
boeing officials said they hoped the deal though relatively 
small would lead to more deals with poland and other soviet bloc 
nations 
were very proud and pleased that we were selected its a 
major breakthrough for us said rudy hillinga director of sales 
for central and eastern europe for boeing commercial airplanes co 
boeing said it will be the first to deliver modern widebody 
jets made in the west to a soviet bloc nation because it will 
deliver its first two planes to poland before europes airbus 
consortium delivers two a310s to east germany under a previously 
announced deal 
boeing will deliver two 767200s in april and may 1989 and one 
767300 in june 1990 all will be extendedrange models powered by 
general electric cf680c2 engines boeing declined to specify how 
the 220 million price was split between boeing and ge 
although poland has a desperate shortage of hard currency to buy 
western goods the airline is an exception because it brings in hard 
currencies every time it flies to the west that made the financing 
relatively easy 
in a deal financed by unspecified western banks lot will lease 
the airplanes and engines for 12 years at the end of which it will 
own them hillinga said boeing and ge will be paid by the banks 
lot said it will use the jetliners on its routes between warsaw 
and new york chicago and bangkok thailand later montreal and 
toronto will be added

five black police officers filed a 55 million 
federal lawsuit against the dallas police department alleging the 
department intentionally mistreats its black officers 
the filing of the suit thursday came less than two months after 
the 207member black firefighters association filed another 
discrimination suit against the city 
both lawsuits claim that longstanding discrimination by white 
supervisors prevented black officers from advancing 
the city denied the firefighters charges first assistant city 
attorney kenneth dippel said friday he had not yet seen the 
pleadings in the latest lawsuit 
itd be inappropriate for me to comment at this time he said 
defendants in the police suit are the city former police chief 
billy prince current chief mack vines mayor annette strauss and 
city manager richard knight 
the suit claims black officers dont receive equal treatment in 
hiring discipline and promotional consideration 
the dpd intentionally mistreats its black officers said c 
victor lander a lawyer representing the five officers 
it also requests classaction status to include all of the 
estimated 300 black officers on the 3100member force 
we realize were going to receive some criticism from white 
officers and also some of the black officers said calvin howard 
chairman of the national black police association and one of the 
five plaintiffs a lot of young black officers are not familiar 
with problems that have gone on in the past 
city councilwoman diane ragsdale agreed that black officers face 
discrimination the concerns are quite legitimate said 
ragsdale who is black 
the police department has been criticized this year for its use 
of deadly force and its relations with minority communities 
the issue came to a head in january when a white officer was shot 
in the face three times with his own gun by a black homeless man 
described as mentally ill two witnesses said the shooter was urged 
on by a few young black men who yelled shoot him shoot him

two men acquitted of kidnapping and conspiracy 
charges for abducting a unification church member and trying to 
deprogram her were relieved by the verdict and said they would 
continue to work with cult members 
i think the verdict is telling people there is such a thing 
as coercive persuasion and saying people have the right to religious 
freedom cults take those rights away from people said dennis 
whelan 53 of omaha neb 
he and robert brandyberry 41 of columbus ohio were acquitted 
friday after six hours of deliberation 
brandyberry who cried after the verdict and whelan said they 
would continue their work in some way 
using the rare choiceofevils defense the men contended 
their actions were permissible because they intended to rescue 
the woman from a greater evil the rev sun myung moons unification 
church 
they were charged with seconddegree kidnapping and conspiracy in 
the may 26 1987 abduction of britta adolfsson 30 from a denver 
street the defendants had faced two to eight years in prison for 
kidnapping and one to four years for conspiracy 
this is a rescue ladies and gentlemen not a kidnapping 
whelans attorney james martin davis said in closing arguments 
thursday what denny and bob did was a necessary emergency measure 
to avoid permanent injury 
tord and margit adolfsson the womans parents paid the 
defendants about 8000 to abduct and deprogram their daughter 
because they thought she was going to south korea to participate in 
a second mass marriage the swedish womans 1982 marriage 
performed during a mass wedding ceremony by the church ended in 
divorce in 1985 
deprogramming entails persuading a person to abandon rigid 
commitment to certain values or beliefs of a cult by undoing the 
effects of indoctrination 
prosecutors argued that whelan a private detective and 
brandyberry a deprogrammer and exunification church leader were 
motivated by money and hatred for the organization moreover the 
defendants created the emergency by playing on the familys 
unfounded fear that the woman was being brainwashed and on the brink 
of marriage they said 
jeffrey pagliuca brandyberrys lawyer said adolfsson although 
29 at the time of the abduction was a naive little school girl 
when she came to the united states in 1979 as an exchange student 
and was lured into the cult in 1980 
britta adolfsson had said she was terrified by the abduction 
which ended when she escaped from a lyons kan house by jumping 
through a secondstory window she remains a unification church 
member 
unification church president mose durst said the judge erred in 
allowing the case to be tried 
to put a religion on trial is to contradict everything in the 
constitution the ramifications of this are horrible especially for 
minority religions durst said

a leading television network went to court today 
demanding prosecutors return seized videotapes allegedly showing a 
businessman offering bribes to a lawmaker involved in a stock 
trading scandal 
the tokyo district public prosecutors office investigating the 
alleged bribery case seized four master tapes from the nippon 
television network corp on tuesday 
kyoichi tokiwa a network official told a news conference today 
his company filed a complaint in tokyo district court seeking an 
injunction against the seizure that he said violates freedom of 
the press as guaranteed by the constitution 
the videotapes contain scenes some broadcast by the network 
that reportedly show hiroshi matsubara a recruitcosmos co 
official offering cash packets to yanosuke narazaki an opposition 
party member of parliament 
narazaki has been a leader of a parliamentary probe into a 
scandal involving the sale of recruitcosmos shares to dozens of 
politicial leaders and other prominent people at bargain prices 
before the stocks were publicly traded 
when the shares were listed on the overthecounter market in 
1986 they quickly rose in value and the purchasers made large 
profits 
network officials said they made the videotapes with narazakis 
cooperation after he told them matsubara tried several times to 
bribe him 40000 to tone down his investigation 
the tapes reportedly were made with a hidden camera aug 30 and 
sept 3 at narazakis residence near parliament after some scenes 
were aired matsubara was arrested oct 20 and charged with 
attempted bribery 
top politicians including prime minister noboru takeshita 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa and former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone say they were not directly involved but that aides bought 
the shares 
opposition officials and newspaper reports say at least 140 
people and more than 12 million recruitcosmos shares were involved 
government officials have said the stock sales were not illegal 
unless they involved political or other favors in return but the 
case has raised ethical questions about links between business and 
politics in japan 
opposition parties say hiromasa ezoe founder of recruitcosmos 
parent company recruit inc offered the unlisted shares to 
politicians business leaders and others in exchange for privileges 
and special favors for his company

a law giving orthodox rabbis sole authority over 
conversions to judaism stands a good chance of being passed by the 
new parliament prime minister yitzhak shamir said in an interview 
broadcast today 
the socalled who is a jew law has been denounced as 
discriminatory by american jews more than 80 percent of the 6 
million us jews who are affiliated to congregations belong to 
reform or conservative movements 
the law is a key demand of four orthodox and ultraorthodox 
religious parties engaged in coalition talks with shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc after tuesdays general election 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member parliament and needs the 18 
seats of the religious parties to form a majority government that 
would also include extreme rightwing parties sixtyone seats are 
needed to govern 
the who is a jew law does not appear to be a sticking point 
in the coalition talks most likud legislators including shamir 
voted for the proposed law when it was last put to a vote in 1987 
at the time it was narrowly defeated 
if there are now more parliament members who agree to this the 
law there are more chances that it will pass shamir said on 
israel radio 
israels law of return which grants automatic citizenship to all 
jews defines jews as those born to a jewish mother or converted to 
judaism the amendment demanded by the orthodox would change the 
definition to read converted according to orthodox jewish law 
although the law would not disqualify most conservative or reform 
jews movement leaders have said it would symbolically expel them 
from the jewish fold and alienate them from israel 
but shamir dismissed such concerns before every vote on some 
religious law there is a big noise among american jews shamir 
told israel radio i think there is a lot of exaggeration im 
convinced well reach some understanding with the american jews 
shamir also sought to allay fears by secular israelis that likud 
would give in to blackmail by the religious parties that demand a 
ban on driving movies and soccer on the jewish sabbath 
i dont foresee any decisive chances shamir said everyone 
will be able to continue to live as he does now 
he did not specify which demands by the religious parties the 
likud would reject or accept 
shamir reiterated that he rejected demands by potential extreme 
rightwing coalition partners to annex the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip and to expel the 15 million palestinians living there 
he told israel radio that the likud stuck by the 1978 camp david 
accords which says the final status of the occupied lands should be 
determined by negotiations between the parties to the conflict 
despite the differences shamir said he was confident he could 
put together a coalition soon certainly it will not be easy but 
a government will be formed he said 
the leftofcenter labor party which won 39 seats also held 
coalition talks with the religious parties but its chances of 
forming a government are seen as slim 
many top labor officials have urged party leader shimon peres to 
stop the negotiations and accept a role in the opposition

staffers of atlantas two daily newspapers 
expressed dismay over the resignation of their top editor who cited 
a lack of shared values and mutual trust with the newspapers 
senior management 
bill kovach who left the top post at the new york times 
washington bureau to take over the journal and constitution in 
december 1986 announced his resignation friday 
stunned staffers then gathered 119 signatures on a petition 
urging publisher jay smith to reconsider his acceptance of kovachs 
resignation 
and a fullpage advertisement in todays combined editions of the 
papers which are essentially one newspaper with different 
editorial pages was purchased and signed by 123 of the papers 
approximately 400 staffers 
it said they were deeply saddened by the sudden resignation of 
editor bill kovach we are disturbed that it was so readily 
accepted 
according to a story in fridays editions of the atlanta journal 
smith said an irreconcilable difference in management styles 
surfaced in a discussion friday morning 
smith said that although he and kovach were in accord 
philosophically over the direction the newspapers have taken the 
management difference caused him to accept the editors resignation 
kovach said his resignation brought to an end two years of 
effort to develop a set of shared values and mutual trust with the 
senior managers of the company it became clear this week that 
no such relationship existed 
exactly what precipitated friday mornings developments was 
unclear neither the journals story nor kovachs statement went 
into detail 
but according to todays edition of the new york times some 
staffers suggested that the newspapers management had been under 
pressure to rein in kovach because of his aggressive businessnews 
coverage 
kovach reportedly riled some of the citys most highly visible 
corporate citizens with articles that included descriptions of 
discriminatory lending practices in atlantas poorest neighborhoods 
spokesmen for concerns including the citizens and southern 
national bank cocacola co and georgia power co told the times 
that the companies had played no role in kovachs departure 
smith said only that the disagreement was fairly narrowly 
focused he acknowledged that he and kovach differed on several 
issues including control of the newspapers washington bureau and 
the amount of money to be committed to covering news 
he said the budget dispute was settled several weeks ago but 
smith declined to comment on whether their dispute over control of 
the washington bureau was related to kovachs resignation

the soviet unions decision to suspend 
its troop withdrawal from afghanistan violates the geneva accords 
and raises doubts about moscows commitment to end the war a top 
pakistani official said today 
moscow announced the suspension friday and said it sent advanced 
weapons to afghanistan because of unrelenting pressure from moslem 
guerrillas witnesses have reported seeing mig27 jets and ss1 scud 
missiles in afghanistan 
the soviets also accused the united states and pakistan of 
violating the geneva withdrawal agreement by sending arms to the 
insurgents 
the soviet actions reflected moscows frustration over how the 
afghan army has handled the fight in the nearly three months since 
the red army reached the halfway point in withdrawning its estimated 
115000 men 
the announcement friday appeared to indicate the soviet 
withdrawal might not be completed by the feb 15 deadline set in the 
april 14 geneva agreement mediated by the united nations the 
withdrawal began may 15 
the decision of the soviet union to suspend further withdrawals 
of its troops is a matter of concern and disappointment foreign 
minister sahabzada yaqub khan said in a statement today 
the suspension and the new soviet weapons represent a violation 
of the letter and spirit of the geneva agreements and are 
incompatible with the understanding that the only military activity 
to be undertaken by soviet forces would be in defense of their 
withdrawing troops yaqub khan said 
he called the escalation of soviet military activity a form of 
support of the desparate and isolated kabul regime kabul the 
capital of afghanistan has recently come under heavy missile 
attacks by the guerrillas 
soviet forces intervened in afghanistan in 1979 to replace one 
fledgling marxist government with another

indian and maldivian military officers 
negotiated on the high seas today with foreign mercenaries who fled 
the maldives in a boat with about 18 hostages after failing to 
overthrow the government 
we have started talking said maj zahir of the maldives 
national security service we have not yet reached any conclusion 
there are many lives involved there are threats to life the 
major gave only one name 
the negotiations began after two indian warships halted the boat 
with the mercenaries and their hostages at sundown today the talks 
were still under way said ak banerjee the indian high 
commissioner in male the capital 
zahir said that out of concern for the hostages safety soldiers 
refrained from boarding the boat whose location he declined to 
reveal we fear that the mercenaries may harm the hostages so we 
want to be cautious he said 
the mercenaries boat was intercepted en route to sri lanka said 
an indian general who helped rescue besieged president maumoon abdul 
gayoom after the attempted coup thursday on the indian ocean island 
nation 
maldivian officials and foreign diplomats in sri lanka said the 
mercenaries were thought to be sri lankan tamil guerrillas the 
general who spoke on condition of anonymity said the mercenaries 
boat escaped from male on friday after indian paratroopers reached 
the maldivian capital the maldives is 500 miles southwest of india 
and more than 600 miles west of sri lanka 
banerjee whose rank is equivalent to ambassador said between 27 
and 32 people died in the attempted coup this figure may be 
understated because the mercenaries may have removed their dead 
he said 
he gave no breakdown of the deaths a short time earlier 
banerjee and a maldivian foreign ministry official ahmed suleem 
said at least 20 people were killed including 13 civilians and 
seven maldivian security men 
banerjee said the mercenaries estimated to number about 150 
fled in two boats and one dingy he said the four who fled in the 
dingy surrendered friday on a neighboring island one boat carried 
mercenaries and the hostages and the whereabouts of the other boat 
was unknown he said 
shops and businesses in the maldives were closed today after 
president gayoom declared a day of mourning for those killed in the 
attempted coup 
suleem said there were about 18 hostages aboard the boat halted 
by the indian navy and that the hostages included transport minister 
ahmed mujithaba and his wife no one could say how many mercenaries 
were on the boat 
a senior indian air force officer at the south indian airport at 
trivandrum said the hostages were hustled aboard the 5000ton boat 
when the gunmen fled through blasts of indian machinegun fire on 
friday 
in sri lanka a spokesman for the biggest tamil militant group 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam denied involvement in the 
attempted coup 
the tigers have been waging a fiveyear separatist war against 
sri lankas sinhalesedominated government 
in the maldives indian troops started a new housetohouse 
search operation today for arms and foreign gunmen who may have 
failed to escape said a male resident reached by telephone from 
colombo sri lanka the residents were advised by state radio to 
stay indoors today 
the maldives population 190000 gained independence from 
britain in 1965 and became a republic in 1968

the soviet unions ambassador in afghanistan today 
said the geneva agreement leading to the withdrawal of soviet 
soldiers from the wartorn country was near ruin and he called for 
a new international debate on it 
the statement by yuli vorontsov to afghan legislators came one 
day after soviet deputy foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh said 
the soviet union had stopped withdrawing its soldiers because of 
unrelenting pressure from rebels 
bessmertnykh also said moscow sent advanced weapons to 
afghanistan an apparent reference to mig27 jets and ss1 scud 
missiles spotted there 
the moves appeared designed to increase pressure on antimarxist 
afghan guerrillas who have stepped up their attacks since the 
soviets began withdrawing may 15 and on their backers the united 
states and pakistan 
pakistan today condemned the soviet moves saying they violate 
the geneva accords and raise doubts about moscows commitment to end 
the war 
vorontsov told a group of afghan legislators that the supply of 
modern weaponry to the guerrillas by the united states and pakistan 
is a very serious blow to the geneva accords which practically 
torpedoes them 
the time has come for a new international debate of all aspects 
of the situation in afghanistan and around it because foreign 
powers pakistan and the united states are involved here the 
official soviet news agency tass quoted vorontsov as saying in kabul 
vorontsov said the united nations which helped negotiate the 
april 14 geneva agreement could help straighten out the situation 
bessmertnykh said the soviet union still is committed to 
completing its troop withdrawal from afghanistan by feb 15 but he 
added that soviet compliance with the geneva accords also depended 
on whether the other signers obeyed it as well indicating that the 
soviets may be considering keeping soldiers in the country after the 
deadline 
vorontsov did not address that issue and did not say what kind of 
an international debate the soviet union wants on afghanistan 
soviet newspapers published this morning did not carry 
bessmertnykhs announcement that the soviet union was halting its 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
in a statement from islamabad pakistans foreign minister 
sahabzada yaqub khan said the suspension and the indroduction of 
new soviet weapons are incompatible with the understanding that 
the only military activity to be undertaken by soviet forces would 
be in defense of their withdrawing troops 
more than 13000 soviet soldiers have died in afghanistan and the 
war has become increasingly unpopular in the soviet union soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev calls the war a bleeding wound 
and nobel peace prizewinner andrei sakharov says it is one of the 
greatest tragedies of our times 
but bessmertnykhs statement showed deepening soviet frustration 
with how forces of afghanistan president najibs prosoviet 
government are faring against the insurgents since the soviet 
withdrawal began 
in september foreign minister eduard a shevardnaze said the 
soviets had finished the first part of a pullout set to end feb 15 
but had not begun the second phase saying it depended on whether 
violations of the accords cease 
un observers have said half the soviet troops withdrew by aug 
15 so shevardnadzes statement meant the red army retreat stopped 
since then the withdrawal began may 15

president chadli bendjedid appointed a 
premier today and asked him to form a new government to begin 
solving the countrys economic crisis the algerian news agency 
reported 
the appointment of health minister kasdi merbah to the post came 
two days after algerians overwhelmingly approved changes to the 
constitution that grant the premier new powers 
another provision of the reform approved by 92 percent of the 
voters in thursdays referendum is aimed at separating the ruling 
national liberation front the only legal political party from the 
daytoday running of the government 
algerians took to the streets last month to protest a declining 
standard of living food shortages and a lack of jobs by official 
count the riots left 176 people dead when troops fired into crowds 
that failed to disperse 
the rioting ended when bendjedid promised political and economic 
reforms begining with the referendum and the naming of a new 
government

the new premier has served under bendjedid as minister of 
agriculture and for the past 10 months as minister of health

presidential race

the japan times englishlanguage independent of tokyo with 
only a few days left before the us presidential election next 
tuesday we cannot help but ask ourselves what does this election 
mean for japan 
a black and white view of the election might suggest that 
vice president george bush represents continuity whereas gov 
michael dukakis stands for change mr bush supports free trade 
whereas gov dukakis seems to be leaning toward protectionism mr 
bush defends the free market whereas gov dukakis supports 
government intervention and yet the distinctions between these two 
men are not at all so clear 
either of them will be likely to emphasize japanus relations 
as a central element in their foreign policy 
on trade mr bush has vowed to uphold the reagan 
administrations devotion to free trade in principle if not always 
in practice gov dukakis has been transformed in a few short 
months from the free trader among the democratic contenders to a 
protectionist in comparison with mr bush 
on the economy mr bush adheres to the laissezfaire 
principles of the reagan era gov dukakis meanwhile proposes an 
economic development strategy which at times follows closely on 
the model of japanese industrial policy 
paradoxically perhaps a revival of us competitiveness would 
serve japans best interests in the long run if the us industrial 
erosion continues no american leader will be able to fight off the 
forces of protectionism if the us economy resurges however this 
could provide an important engine for growth in japan 
if mr bush wins as the polls indicate he will we can only 
hope that he will be magnanimous enough in victory to learn some 
lessons from his opponent as from his predecessor

the times of london independent the suspicion that the 
country may have lost some of its freedom of maneuver through 
careless expansion of the budget deficit has encouraged the drift 
towards economic jingoism 
this has been more pronounced in the case of gov dukakis and 
sen bentsen who cheerfully reneged on earlier free trade 
convictions but vice president bushs recent lunge at japan was 
also depressing 
mr bushs promise to balance the budget by 1993 is 
not credible he promises to do so through a flexible freeze of 
spending without raising taxes mr dukakis recipes seem 
equally implausible economic growth some spending cuts lower 
interest rates and efforts to collect unpaid taxes 
whoever wins on tuesday the european community and japan 
will have to reckon with the deficits as an international problem 
which the incoming administration is powerless to tackle without 
their cooperation this means that western europe must do nothing to 
fuel protectionism on the other side of the atlantic 
the european community could make a start by offering 
clear timetabled commitments to roll back agricultural 
protectionism it is economically in western europes interest this 
campaign has also made it clear that it is also a political 
imperative the next us president will need to enter the white 
house in january bearing gifts from americas friends

as a brilliant intuitive man along kennedyesque intellectual lines 
but they have forgotten that these qualities fascinating to 
europeans are not irresistable to american voters who mainly look 
to their government leaders for security efficacy and consistency 
qualities bush has in good supply in addition dukakis is no

although they are us citizens 
puerto ricans cannot vote for president on election day but the 
next occupant of the white house could help determine whether this 
caribbean island remains a us commonwealth or becomes the 51st 
state 
the republican candidate vice president george bush has aligned 
himself with the prostatehood party democrat michael dukakis is 
for commonwealth 
the spanishspeaking island of 33 million people 1000 miles 
southeast of florida has been a us commonwealth for 36 years 
although it has nearly as much control over its affairs as the 50 
states puerto rico is not a state it is not a colony either 
although some say it comes close a small but vocal minority favors 
independence 
all three main parties popular democratic independence and new 
progressive want the relationship with the united states to 
change they are putting up candidates for governor legislators 
mayors and one nonvoting us congressional delegate 
gov rafael hernandez colon the procommonwealth candidate is 
seeking a third term and in polls has maintained a comfortable lead 
over his chief rival san juan mayor baltasar corrada del rio who 
favors statehood 
hernandez colon wants strong us ties but more autonomy dukakis 
is his man 
i am a dukakis supporter and dukakis supports me he said in 
an interview with the associated press the statehood party is 
with george bush and the republicans deny puerto rico any change 
for example hernandez colon was not pleased when secretary of 
state george shultz turned down a request in 1986 to seek a treaty 
with japan to give japanese firms tax breaks in the island 
hernandez colon first elected in 1972 and reelected in 1984 
wants more leeway in economic foreign trade and immigration issues 
his popular democratic party runs under the slogan bread land 
and liberty implying puerto rico has its cake and eats it too 
we have the best of both worlds said law professor marcos 
ramirez puerto rican people dont want the us to get out but 
they also dont want them to rule the country 
as us citizens puerto ricans are eligible for us military 
service and welfare benefits but they dont pay federal taxes and 
cant vote for president 
the island received 65 billion in us aid this year and with 
tax exemptions for american companies it has caribbeans strongest 
economy 
hernandez colons campaign focuses on economic gains he cites a 
drop of 14 percent in the unemployment rate which was more than 23 
percent in 1985 when he took office economic growth has been 5 
percent over the same period according to government figures 
corrada del rio says the governor should thank the united states 
for the strong economy 
if the economy has grown the credit belongs to president 
reagan not to you he said in a television debate 
his new progressive party whose slogan is statehood security 
progress says a statehood advantage would be to vote in us 
elections 
its a sovereignty issue said the partys sen oreste ramos 
we are governed by people we cant vote for and we want to 
participate in that process 
the independence partys gubernatorial candidate ruben berrios 
martinez a harvardeducated law professor says puerto rico is 
grossly overdependent on the united states 
chickens we import chickens he said were not capable of 
raising our own 
berrios party hasnt won more than 6 percent of the vote in 20 
years 
all candidates have promised a referendum on the status issue 
after the election but hernandez colon said he wants beforehand a 
us pledge to honor the outcome 
in the last referendum in 1967 60 percent wanted commonwealth to 
continue 39 percent preferred statehood and 1 percent supported 
independence 
whatever this elections outcome puerto ricos status is not 
likely to change soon congress would have to approve any proposal 
still if corrada del rios statehood party wins and so does 
bush the chances of puerto rico becoming a state would be enhanced 
and what if the polls are right and bush and hernandez colon both 
win 
i can work with the republican administration the governor 
said its just in relation to our status that the republicans 
dont cooperate

israels election failed to produce a clear 
statement on how israelis want to approach peace with the arabs and 
on the future of the occupied territories 
the balloting for parliament seats was seen as a referendum on 
the peace issue after 11 months of a palestinian uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip but results indicate israelis 
remain deeply divided on the issues 
shlomo avineri a political scientist at hebrew university in 
jerusalem said about 30 percent of israelis want to annex occupied 
land while another third prefer territorial compromise 
the people in the middle found an easy option voting for 
ethnic or religious parties but not coming down on the major issue 
of peace said avineri 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc will likely lead the 
next government probably by forming a coalition with small 
rightwing parties and orthodox religious factions but the 
electorate did not give shamir a mandate for introducing hardline 
policies 
shamir is committed to expanding jewish settlements but he was 
quick to assure voters he would not go along with rightwing calls 
to annex the west bank and gaza strip or expel its 15 million 
palestinian residents 
foreign minister shimon peres leader of the leftist labor party 
failed to convince voters there was a reliable arab partner for 
peace 
peres had argued that israel should accept arab demands for an 
international conference because it was the only way to get jordans 
king hussein into the process as a standin for the plo 
but hussein appeared to vacillate reinforcing a widely held 
belief in israel that he lacked the courage of the late egyptian 
president anwar sadat who came to jerusalem to make peace 
hussein announced july 31 that he was cutting ties with the 
palestinians and the occupied lands then in the final days of the 
campaign he signaled he had changed his mind he met with plo chief 
yasser arafat and egypts hosni mubarak and gave a belated 
endorsement to peres plan as a step forward 
at the same time arafats supporters let it be know the 
palestine national council was planning a declaration of palestinian 
independence reinforcing rightwing alarms that peres approach 
would lead to creation of a palestinian state 
what the organization plo had somehow neglected to do was to 
offer any convincing proof that it was itself a legitimate partner 
to peace talks said the prolabor jerusalem post 
the final blow for the credibility of arab intentions came in 
firebombings in the final days of the campaign an israeli woman and 
her three children burned to death last sunday and a likud supporter 
was seriously hurt as voting was under way tuesday 
israelis go to the right when fears for security go up said 
jay rothman of the independent leonard davis institute for 
international relations 
he said israelis feared that in an international conference 
other countries would gang up and demand concessions that would 
threaten the nations security 
moderate palestinians however were equally disappointed in the 
israelis for failing to give a mandate to negotiations 
in the past israelis complained that they lacked a partner for 
peace now its the arabs who cannot find a partner in israel 
said palestinian journalist daoud kuttab 
some palestinians like nablus businessman said kenaan predicted 
palestinians would react by stepping up violence in the occupied 
lands more than 300 arabs and 10 israelis have died since the 
uprising began dec 8 
its obvious israelis dont want peace but we will hit back 
said kenaan 
in meetings with small rightwing parties shamir refused 
extremist demands for annexation of the occupied land and the 
expulsion of arabs 
shamir clarified that the idea of transfer of arabs will not 
be included in the guidelines of the next government the concept is 
rejected by the likud said shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir 
shamir pledged to support new jewish settlements in occupied 
areas but ahimeir noted the effort would be constrained by the 
amount of money available

particularly prevalent in economically booming areas 
in some rural factories 20 percent of the workers are children

well what do we do now george bush asked 
ronald reagan the morning after they were elected eight years ago 
either bush or michael dukakis will face that question come 
wednesday and the answer is not as evident now as it was in 1980 
the long campaign between republican bush and democrat dukakis 
has been filled with political symbols such as the flag and the 
pledge of allegiance but short on specifics about what either 
candidate actually would do in the white house 
there have been no overriding issues such as a faltering economy 
or a threat to peace that have compelled bush or dukakis to come 
forward with bold ideas for example neither candidate has been 
willing to offer a concrete program for shrinking the huge budget 
deficit 
reagans election was viewed as a mandate for a change in course 
from the carter administration he pledged to cut taxes build up 
the pentagon and cut down the government 
bush ahead in the polls a few days before the election promises 
to stay the course set by reagan when you have to change horses 
in midstream doesnt it make sense to switch to the one whos going 
the same way bush asked 
on the other hand if dukakis managed an upset there would be a 
major upheaval in policy and personnel the best america is yet to 
come he promises but again few specifics 
with the now familiar invitation to read my lips bush says 
he will not raise taxes and indeed will try to cut capital gains 
taxes he says he will oppose new spending by congress and 
personally negotiate with lawmakers for a flexible freeze on the 
budget 
he promises to keep americas military strong pressing ahead 
with research and eventual development of the star wars missile 
defense shield while at the same time seeking progress with the 
soviet union and he says he will clean up the environment and 
strive to improve education 
bush also promises more money for child care including a toddler 
tax credit of up to 1000 per child under age 4 for poor families 
he has proposed no less than five summits including an early 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to size each other up 
correctly 
bush has pledged to convene a nato summit as one of my first 
acts as president he says there will be a global conference on 
the environment at the white house within the first year in office 
and a summit of western hemisphere nations to chart strategy for a 
war against drugs 
moreover bush says he will meet with all the governors to 
discuss the most urgent problems facing our nations schools 
in addition each year the president of the united states meets 
with the leaders of the six other richest nations in the world at an 
economic summit bush says he will make agriculture the top item on 
the agenda 
dukakis promises a crackdown on tax cheats who he says beat the 
treasury out of 110 billion a year he says hell hire more tax 
inspectors which bush seized on as a promise that dukakis would 
put an irs agent in every kitchen 
on taxes dukakis says no responsible candidate can rule out the 
possibility of new taxes but that hed ask an increase only as a 
last resort 
to fight drugs dukakis said he would double the number of agents 
at the drug enforcement agency within five years and hire 800 more 
federal prosecutors to handle drug cases 
he says he will wipe out the trade deficit in four years and put 
the country on the course toward a balanced budget 
on defense he calls star wars a fantasy but still would put 1 
billion in the budget for it about 25 percent of what it gets now 
dukakis promises to find a sensible affordable way to modernize 
the landbased nuclear missile arsenal but opposes the mx missile 
dukakis also would scrap two planned aircraft carrier task 
forces but said he would bolster military readiness with a 
conventional defense initiative he says he would lay out the 
prospect of better economic ties to the soviet union as a way of 
achieving concessions on arms control human rights and other 
superpower problems 
under dukakis the environmental protection agency would become a 
cabinet agency 
dukakis would seek legislation to require employers to provide 
health insurance to all employees he also proposes to raise the 
minimum wage from 335 an hour to at least 455 
while a dukakis administration would bring a wholesale turnover 
in government managers bush would be expected to keep at least 
several of reagans cabinet officers including possibly treasury 
secretary nicholas brady attorney general richard thornburgh and 
education secretary lauro cavazos 
former treasury secretary james a baker iii now bushs campaign 
chairman is a likely bet for secretary of state in a bush 
administration

rare furniture designed by architect 
frank lloyd wright will return to its original home in springfield 
following efforts by gov james r thompson and more than 800000 
in donations 
thompson said friday he has negotiated deals for the stateowned 
danathomas house museum to buy the furniture a 704000 double 
pedestal table lamp a 20000 drafting table and four dining room 
chairs costing 120000 
there are only a few major pieces from the dana home that are 
still privately owned so the opportunities to purchase them either 
at auction or by private sale agreements are extremely rare 
thompson said 
experts describe the danathomas house built by wright for 
60000 around 1903 as one of the finest examples of the 
architects prairie school houses open to the public 
the house commissioned by susan lawrence dana and now maintained 
by the illinois historic preservation agency is one of the most 
completely furnished of all wrights buildings 
the lamp was purchased by the danathomas house foundation 
through a direct sale arranged without fee by christies auction 
house in new york thompson said noting that it is scheduled to 
arrive upon final payment next june 
considering the nearhysteria surrounding the acquisition of 
authentic wright pieces and the rapidly escalating prices being 
offered by collectors we were pleased that christies agreed to the 
private sale of this rare lamp he said 
the chairs were bought from a colorado family and were returned 
to the dana house in september the drafting table will be bought 
from a private owner through christies

george bush said today he will continue 
campaigning hard against the democrats who he said thought they 
were going to kick my brains out and get away with it at their 
atlanta convention 
they can dish it out but they cant take it he told campaign 
workers at republican headquarters before setting out on a 
doortodoor getoutthevote tour 
in answer to reports that he was tiring and cutting back the 
vice president promised that the day would be one of the darndest 
days weve ever seen so that everybody will be exhausted 
his campaign schedule however was being altered a rally in 
colorado springs tonight was rescheduled for sunday morning 
replacing a fresno calif event 
a cbs poll showed his race with michael dukakis tightening but 
bush said i dont believe those polls 
and finally he told reporters do i feel ive got a good shot 
at winning absolutely 
in livonia mich friday night with his wife barbara and 
daughter dorothy at his side bush said youre looking at three 
tired people here 
bushs campaign strategists were changing his schedule several 
times a day as they figured which battleground states to send him 
into 
theyre making strategic decisions based on a whole lot of 
lastminute data including polling local pressures and the ability 
to checkmate our opponent press secretary sheila tate said 
the idea is to use the last three days of the campaign trying 
to make inroads not let him get any momentum and make it 
impossible for dukakis to win the states his campaign says it is 
counting on to garner the 270 electoral votes needed for victory 
bushs schedule changes were coming on such short notice that the 
secret service was doing only a fraction of the advance work that 
normally begins several days before a visit to any city 
todays swing included new jersey pennsylvania illinois and 
colorado 
on friday bush was in michigan for the second time in a week as 
a poll published in the detroit news showed dukakis had pulled 
within four percentage points of him statewide 
bush planned to be back again in michigan on sunday night after 
a day trip to california 
earlier friday in an interview with the associated press bush 
said he was satisfied with the conduct of a presidential campaign 
some have labeled one of the most negative in recent history 
the idea that this campaign is so different from others i 
dont believe it i dont think the american people believe it all 
this stuff about being turned off you can always go out and find 
people to say that he said 
he also expressed dismay that a consulting firm headed by his 
longtime associate frederick m bush no relation had sought 
business with the haitian government by touting the firms ties to 
the vice president 
i denounce it i dont like it i think its wrong bush said 
frederick bush said the intiative in his name was done without 
his approval by his partner michael govan 
asked how frederick bush deputy fundraising director of bushs 
primary election campaign and now a republican national committee 
consultant could have allowed it to happen george bush said ask 
him how he could allow it to happen 
bush said the lobbying episode does not indicate what would 
happen in a bush administration because ive been in public life 
for 20 years and no one has ever made any allegations about 
impropriety on my part because they know how strongly i feel about 
ethics in government 
the vice president interviewed on his plane between events in 
connecticut and ohio dismissed suggestions that his campaign was 
easing off in anticipation of victory as his weekend schedule 
filled up to bolster his argument 
we cant do any more we just cant bush said 
also in the ap interview bush suggested working toward a free 
trade pact with mexico similar to the one recently negotiated with 
canada he said he opposes such an arrangement at this time with 
japan

the morning of nov 10 1938 fritz 
kleinmann saw synagogues aflame by afternoon the 15yearold boy 
and his father had been arrested and beaten by nazis within months 
fritz his father and thousands of other austrian jews were deported 
to the buchenwald concentration camp 
in april 1945 kleinmann was freed from the dreaded mauthausen 
the third death camp in his ghoulish odyssey through nazi terror he 
weighed just 77 pounds 
today kleinmann 65 a slender quickwitted man sits in his 
apartment in a nondescript tenement bloc in suburban vienna and 
recalls how his terror began on the night now called kristallnacht 
in the morning of nov 10 we saw two synagogues burning in the 
leopoldstadt then a largely jewish district of vienna then we 
waited for the knock on the door 
in the afternoon i was arrested so was my father after i was 
maltreated at police headquarters i was allowed to go home 
because i was only 15 
a day later police released kleinmanns father who two decades 
earlier had been seriously wounded and decorated as a soldier in the 
austrohungarian army 
those world war i decorations did not impress the nazis when 
kleinmann and many of his family were deported the next year 
half of my family were gassed including one sister and my 
mother kleinmann said another sister and a younger brother 
escaped and ended up in the united states where they still live 
they burned synagogues and other places of worship it was 
terrible howling people were standing by screaming 
antisemitic slogans kleinman recalled 
the firefighters arrived all right but they were under orders 
not to extinguish the synagogue fires they protected nearby 
buildings from catching fire until the jewish temples were burned 
out 
speaking the broad german dialect of the viennese working class 
kleimann said the officially endorsed pogrom was a welcome 
opportunity for many viennese to vent their antisemitism they 
looted and stole from jews humiliated and mistreated them 
the terrible thing was that our neighbors my friends my 
fathers friends were among those beating us vilifying us 
spitting at us young people who had been my playmates were suddenly 
nazis who turned against us he said 
unlike in germany the nazis in vienna then home to some 200000 
jews did not wait for kristallnacht to start burning and 
ransacking existing nazi documents and data in viennas fire 
department show numerous jewish temples were devastated in october 
that year 
on oct 16 firemen were called to extinguish a fire involving 
the community temple records show 
according to a report on kristallnacht by austrian jews some 
7800 people were arrested and an unknown number killed in vienna 
alone the detained were taken to socalled collection camps and 
brutally treated while 4083 vienna shops were plundered the 
report found 
some 680 people many of them jews committed suicide on nov10 
and subsequent days said the report by intellectuals camp 
survivors and members of the jewish community 
many synagogues some of them local landmarks were completely 
gutted with mobs throwing hand grenades to set them ablaze 
it was only this year that vienna city authorities unveiled 
plaques to mark remind citizens of the sites where synagogues stood 
50 years ago but kleinmann and the few who survived the holocaust 
never forgot 
it took only three weeks after the nazi anschluss of march 1938 
for kleinmann to lose his apprenticeship in house decorating his 
fathers trade 
like tens of thousands of others he was jobless because he was a 
jew his family was too poor to emigrate and survived on meals from 
a jewish relief service 
at first aryan friends helped kleinmanns father survive 
slipping him illegal work soon the help turned to scorn and 
insults 
kleinmanns two sisters were often picked up by nazi patrols 
mostly former friends for rubbing the practice of forcing jews 
to rub walls pavements and cobblestone roads to remove painted 
slogans predating the nazi annexation 
i remember that one day i asked a former friend why he was 
picking up my sister kleinmann said he said he was ordered to 
get hold of the girl by a nazi cell foreman whom she had once 
refused to kiss in the doorway

as in hundreds of other towns across 
nazi germany terror struck jews in this picturesque village on the 
infamous kristallnacht a halfcentury later students there are 
still confronting the nazi past 
last month the 23 students in stephan kolbs history class heard 
a former jewish resident describe the tensions that led up to the 
brutality of nov 910 1938 
later in a roundtable discussion with the associated press 
students in this town of 11400 people north of frankfurt discussed 
the night when thugs ransacked the homes of the 10 to 15 jews who 
lived in usingen then a rural village 
martin stenzel 18 said kristallnacht named for the sparkling 
shards of broken glass that littered streets and sidewalks after the 
vandalism was a channeling of aggression against the jews 
asked about constant reminders of kristallnacht and other nazi 
atrocities he said there is the danger the nazi era could be 
disposed of or settled in a way but this history should always be 
alive 
stenzel also sees sharp differences among generations in west 
germany which has paid more than 80 billion marks 44 billion at 
1988 values to nazi victims and their families 
the older generation has kept the prejudiced view of jews he 
said adding that this wasnt true with younger generations 
sonja moses 20 said i can well imagine there were feelings 
of jealousy because the jews were merchants and in general were 
better off financially but i just dont think it could happen 
again people are more broadminded now they wouldnt do it again 
none of the six students taking part in the oct 13 discussion at 
the christianwirth school was jewish all are working toward the 
abitur the examination which grants a prestigious diploma roughly 
equivalent to a junior college degree in the united states 
ms moses like her classmates also said the older generation 
views the nazi era far differently from todays younger germans 
my grandmother tells me that hitler brought order to the 
country said ms moses adding that her grandmother dwells on the 
chaos that plagued the weimar republic after world war i she says 
after hitler came to power it wasnt that way anymore you could 
walk down the street without being afraid 
albrecht pachl 18 agreed the biggest danger was that the 
legacy of the nazis could eventually be put aside 
but he too noted that some germans think it is time to stop 
dwelling on the past 
many people feel under attack including from people outside 
the country pachl said of holocaust reminders 
he said he remembered watching television documentaries as a 
child 
i had the feeling it was aimed at me as a german pachl said 
kerstin dumke 18 said of kristallnacht violence i can 
imagine that some people were swept up by what was happening even 
if they didnt have any hatred for the jews beforehand 
like the others interviewed ms dumke has traveled to other 
countries and she said the nazi past comes up there too 
theres less interest in what is happening today than what 
happened in the past its something that you drag around with you 
all the time she said 
the students had heard from ernst lilienstein 67 an usingen 
native who emigrated a year before that terrible night a retired 
new york city educator lilienstein studied at the christianwirth 
school more than 50 years ago according to the 42yearold kolb 
for some of them it was the first time theyd ever seen a jew 
knowing it was a jew certainly it was the first time many had 
really talked to a jew kolb said 
in a telephone interview from his home in new york city 
lilienstein said of his meeting i was amazed both at their lack 
of knowledge about what really happened but also at their interest 
in questioning me

mitchell maulfair claimed he got bladder cancer 
because he handled plutonium during the 26 years he worked at the 
rocky flats nuclear plant near denver 
maulfair who retired about two years before the cancer was 
diagnosed filed suit against the energy department contractors who 
operate the nuclear weapons facility as part of a 1986 outofcourt 
settlement maulfair agreed not to discuss any payments he might 
receive or make any further charges that the cancer which was 
removed surgically and has not recurred was caused by exposure to 
the plutonium processed at rocky flats 
if i disclose anything about the agreement they can come back 
and sue me said the 71yearold maulfair who now lives in fort 
laramie wyo they have people like me pretty well shutup 
maulfairs case is symptomatic of the problems faced by the 
90000 workers at the energy deparments nuclear weapons production 
complex in documenting any relation between exposure to radiation 
and cancer or other diseases 
four of the 17 major facilities operated by the department in 13 
states have been wholly or partially closed down for safety reasons 
bringing nuclear weapons production to a virtual halt and energy 
secretary john s herrington has informed congress that it could 
cost as much as 110 billion to clean up radioactive contamination 
at the sites and make them safe 
however present and past workers in the nuclear weapons complex 
say they still face a wall of secrecy around the effects of 
radiation on their health 
safety concerns have prompted unions and individuals to file 
dozens of lawsuits across the country 
additionally some unions and other critics are demanding that 
the energy department provide independent researchers or another 
federal agency with data it has collected on 600000 people who 
worked in the nuclear weapons production complex starting with the 
top secret manhattan project in 1942 
the research is being conducted by oak ridge associated 
universities a consortium of 49 colleges unversities and other 
institutions analyzing the data under contract with the energy 
department 
critics and they are legion have accused the energy department 
of suppressing and distorting data and delaying the research and 
failing to inform workers at nuclear weapons plants of the practical 
implications of scientific findings 
dr anthony robbins director of the federal governments 
national institute for occupational safety and health from 1978 to 
1981 said there is a potentially great risk to workers in the 
nuclear weapons complex 
the real issue is that the energy department has chosen not to 
look too closely at the problem said robbins 
the criticism had prompted senior officials in the department to 
review their health policies said c anson franklin assistant 
energy secretary for public affairs 
there are two issues we are looking at one is the narrow issue 
of access to the data for people who claim they have attempted to 
see it and have been denied said franklin that issue might be 
resolved within the month he said 
the department also is reviewing the wider issue of what we are 
doing with epidemilogical studies and that officials might decide 
that major changes were needed in the way scientific analysis is 
conducted and how the results are presented to workers 
the department has spent 42 million since 1964 analyzing the 
health and death records of 300000 of the 600000 workers who have 
worked in the federal nuclear weapons complex 
that research has been turned over to the oak ridge group and 
its published findings are ambiguous an oak ridge research team 
headed by donna l cragle under contract from the energy 
department found in a study released last month that a 
statistically significant number of a sample of 1274 male 
workers at the savannah river plant died from leukemia a cancer of 
the blood system 
however the study also said the incidence of leukemia was 
unexplained meaning that researchers were unable to establish a 
direct link between cancer and possible exposure to radiation at the 
plant which produces plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons 
and it found fewer than the expected number of deaths from 
other types of cancer and diseases sometimes associated with 
exposure to radiation 
the three working reactors at the plant near aiken sc have 
been closed down for safety reasons and the first will not be 
restarted until next month at the earliest according to energy 
department officials 
workers at the plant could have been exposed to external 
radiation from nuclear fuel processing activities and internal 
radiation from inhalation or ingestion of tritium uranium fission 
products iodine activation products or other radionuclides 
including americium plutonium and neptunium the oak ridge group 
said in a statement 
it said that while examining individual cases the researchers 
also found that a statistically significant but yet unexplained 
increase in the number of deaths from all types of leukemia combined 
among hourly employees hired before 1955 who were employed at srp 
savannah river plant between five and seven years 
an energy department spokesman will callicott said that the 
results obtained by the oak ridge group indicate the work needs to 
continue 
robbins a professor of public health at boston university and 
former colorado state health commissioner said the oak ridge 
results were skewed because they failed to take into account the 
healthy worker effect the disease rates among savannah river 
workers he said were compared with those of the general 
population which includes elderly and hospitalized people rather 
than the working population which is healthier overall 
if they come back with an answer that says that leukemia is 
elevated then my conclusion is that the rates are much higher than 
normal robbins said 
cragle the oak ridge researcher said a lot of the criticism 
kind of goes overboard the healthy worker effect was not 
relevant because if you keep track of the popluation over a period 
of 20 years the worker population begins to resemble the overall 
population she said 
and she said the research was going as quickly as possible under 
the current budget 
david ortlieb director of the health and safety department of 
the international chemical workers union based in akron ohio 
complained that the energy department had not told nuclear complex 
employees about the results of the oak ridge survey 
the energy department has not notified workers of their 
studies said ortlieb it seems that their primary interest is 
to publish their findings in scientific journals workers do not 
read scientific journals there is not a system of informing 
workers 
cragle said that she and other researchers met regularly with 
workers at the feed materials production center in fernald ohio 
and had prepared a video for the savannah river plant moreover she 
said the results were published in laymans terms in the plant 
newspaper at savannah river 
a pennsylvania group the three mile island public health fund 
filed a freedom of information act request with the energy 
department in may 1987 to gain access to the disputed data with the 
intention of turning the information over to a noted british 
epidemiologist dr alice stewart said fund executive seretary 
jonathan berger 
anson the senior department spokesman said a decision would be 
made on the request in a couple of weeks but declined to 
elaborate

the election of 100 years ago sunday was one of 
strangest in us history the candidate who won the popular vote 
lost the election 
grover cleveland the incumbent president won a narrow popular 
victory against challenger benjamin harrison cleveland had 
5540309 votes and harrison 5439853 
but harrison took new york ohio and indiana by narrow margins 
for an electoral vote total of 233 to the presidents 168 that has 
not happened since but new york and ohio are among the pivotal 
states this time too 
both cleveland and his wife took the defeat as a temporary 
setback on leaving the white house frances cleveland told the 
staff 
i want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments 
in the house for i want to find everything just as it is now when 
we come back again four years from today 
they did come back too in 1892 cleveland defeated harrison 
winning both the popular and electoral vote to become the only 
president who ever served two terms that were not consecutive 
unknown practitioners of dirty tricks started a rumor in the 1888 
campaign that cleveland abused his young wife whom he married in 
1886 there apparently were no grounds for the rumor which seemed 
to have done him little harm any more than the story that he was 
supporting an illegitimate child that one was true and he admitted 
it at once the story gave rise to a celebrated street song 
maw maw wheres my paw 
gone to the white house 
haw haw haw 
there was some doubt whether the child was his he had known the 
mother a widow named maria halpin during his early political 
career in buffalo ny she named her son oscar folsom cleveland 
in the 1884 election which cleveland won over james g blaine a 
supporter suggested 
we are told that mr blaine has been delinquent in office but 
blameless in private life while mr cleveland has been a model of 
official integrity but culpable in his personal relations we should 
therefore elect mr cleveland to the public office which he is so 
well qualified to fill and remand mr blaine to the private station 
he is admirably fitted to adorn 
the voters took the advice 
indifference to scandal was not the only thing that made 
campaigns different then cleveland ran into trouble in 1888 because 
he had a budget surplus the federal governments revenue amounted 
to 371 million 103 million more than its spending 
much of the embarrassing surplus came from tariffs on imported 
goods cleveland a democrat wanted lower tariffs that was partly 
because he wanted to import more cheap manufactured goods for the 
benefit of farmers who were important supporters of his party 
harrison a republican got support from industrialists who 
wanted a high tariff to protect their products from foreign 
competition 
after the 1888 election harrison and the 51st congress got rid 
of the surplus it was called the billiondollar congress 
because it was the first that ever spent that much there was some 
help from harrison a civil war hero himself he appointed as 
commissioner of pensions corporal james tanner whose policy was 
to help every old comrade that needs it

democrat michael dukakis buoyed by surveys indicating a 
tightening presidential race declared today that the republicans 
began celebrating a little early george bush shrugged off the 
numbers and said you know me i dont believe those polls 
the candidates launched their final weekend of campaigning amid a 
blizzard of preelection polls aides hastily reconstructed 
campaign schedules on the basis of those numbers and thus dukakis 
was spending the day in illinois michigan and texas while bush 
focused on new jersey pennsylvania illinois and colorado 
in rock island ill dukakis told a warehouse rally i think 
the republican party began celebrating a little early dont you 
they were taking you for granted 
he also continued his populist appeal 
were on the side of people who live off a family budget not a 
family fortune he said hes on their side were on your 
side 
bush said he didnt trust new polls indicating a closer race 
you know me i dont believe those polls he said 
the republican nominee told workers in his clark nj 
headquarters that the democrats set the negative tone of the 
campaign 
let me tell you what ive had to do because i think 
everybody here and everybody across the country knows that when the 
national democratic campaign came on and that convention they 
thought they were going to kick my brains out and get away with it 
they can dish it out but they cant take it he said 
both presidential candidates were showing no signs of letting up 
in the final three days of the campaign as a poll released friday 
showed that bushs lead shrank from 12 points to seven points in 
three days the cbs news poll said bush was leading 51 percent to 44 
percent among probable voters but also indicated as much as 24 
percent of voters may not have made a final decision 
another half dozen national polls were expected over the weekend 
as well as a flurry of statebystate surveys 
a poll of minnesota voters for example showed bush leading 48 
percent to 45 percent the first time the republican has led dukakis 
in that state the northstar poll was conducted by the st paul 
pioneer press dispatch wccotv and wccoradio the fourpoint 
margin of error made the lead statistically meaningless 
lloyd bentsen was in los angeles for a rally aimed at nabbing 
californias 47 electoral votes we win this one we win it all 
he said upon arrival friday at burbank airport 
dukakis who has entered the final stages of his campaign by 
invoking traditional democratic themes and names further aligned 
himself with that past by marching in chicagos democratic 
torchlight parade 
although dukakis had been growing increasingly hoarse in this 
final week his voice was working at nearly full throttle when he 
told a postparade rally 
in 1960 john kennedy and lyndon johnson went into that last 
weekend down eight points in the polls he told an audience that 
went to its feet more than a dozen times were doing better than 
that you can feel that surge and you can feel that excitement 
he was joined by his wife kitty who was recovering from a viral 
infection and four former rivals sen paul simon dill jesse 
jackson former gov bruce babbitt of arizona and sen al gore jr 
dtenn 
bush interspersed his campaign appearances with individual media 
interviews he president reagan and running mate dan quayle pounced 
on a boston herald headline what a mess referring to the 
states finances 
he got into it by overspending bush told a rally in 
fairfield conn how did he get out of it or try to by raising 
taxes a total of 180 million this year alone now hes 
borrowing like mad writing checks that he doesnt even have enough 
money in the bank to cover 
reagan campaigning in voorhees township nj said 
massachusetts ranked 30th among states in annual job growth in 1986 
and 1987 and with yesterdays papers reporting a state bank 
account overdrawn by as much as 190 million for a month the 
massachusetts mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day 
he likes to talk about a massachusetts miracle quayle said 
in monroe la but the only miracle involving massachusetts will 
be the one he needs to get out of the mess he created for his 
state 
bush and dukakis interviewed backtoback friday on abcs 
world news tonight were asked about the nastiness that has 
pervaded their race bush said his own campaign has been 
hardhitting but its been fair and its been accurate 
dukakis countered that bush was attacking him to divert 
attention from a failed record on the war against drugs from the 
kind of sleaze and corruption weve seen in washington 
in an interview with the associated press bush also said the 
idea that this campaign is so different from others i dont 
believe it i dont think the american people believe it all this 
stuff about being turned off 
both campaigns were pouring a fortune into network advertising 
campaigns over the weekend 13 million was the announced figure 
for bush and 375000 for dukakis not to mention additional 
thousands on both sides for commercials targeted to battleground 
states 
in addition to their weekend advertising plans each candidate 
has paid nearly 1 million to buy a halfhour slot on all three 
networks on election eve dukakis will make his final appeal at 8 
pm est followed by bush at 830 pm

george bushs lead in the polls is causing some 
political operatives to worry that the networks might call a 
landslide win early on election evening and discourage potential 
voters in some close senate races 
sen john kerry dmass chairman of the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee said pleas to the tv networks to withhold 
conclusions about the elections outcome until after west coast 
polls are closed have yielded little 
we have asked them not to call the race based on exit 
polling kerry said but he acknowledged that the competitive 
drive is going to escape any kind of restraint 
both bush and democrat michael dukakis have pledged not to make 
any statement of victory or defeat until all polls on the west coast 
have closed 
the pledges from the two camps are a significant step to 
increase voter participation in tuesdays election said rep ron 
wyden dore who solicited the statements from the two campaigns 
television executives have said they will not call the election 
in any state until its polls are closed but they also have made it 
clear that if a candidate exceeds the 270 electoral vote margin 
needed for election they will not sit on the news 
polls in eastern states begin to close as early as 6 pm while 
the closing time in california oregon washington and hawaii is 11 
pm eastern time for alaska poll closing is midnight eastern time 
kerry said the effect of announcing a presidential election 
victory before all polls are closed might be to discourage west 
coast voters from casting their ballots even though local races 
might be very tight 
in washington the race between democratic rep mike lowry and 
republican former sen slade gorton is a dead heat as is the nevada 
contest between incumbent sen chic hecht a republican and 
democratic gov richard bryan 
those races as well as potentially close senate contests in 
montana and california could be affected by an early outcome in the 
presidential race kerry said 
it was disastrous in 1980 when democratic sen warren 
magnuson of washington lost after the networks called the election 
for ronald reagan shortly after 8 pm and president carter conceded 
soon afterward kerry said 
then there were reports that voters lined up at polling places 
went home without voting after hearing the outcome of the 
presidential race reported based on network exit polling 
this time it is unclear what effect an early call might have on 
the closest western senate races kerry said for example that 
because lowry has devoted followers and a highly organized campaign 
he might be able to turn out his supporters anyway and such a 
development might hurt his opponent gorton 
but regardless of the effect he said discouraging any voter 
negates the electoral process and is wrong 
legislation to address the problem through instituting a uniform 
pollclosing time across the countrys six time zones has not been 
able to get through congress

leftist guerrillas have stepped 
up attacks in the capital staging bold daylight raids and 
threatening to fulfill their pledge to bring the 9yearold war to 
the cities 
urban commandos last week hit the national guard headquarters 
with mortar and rifle fire killing four soldiers and wounding 38 
people it was the largest attack in the city in seven years 
this is only the beginning the rebels boasted in a broadcast 
on their clandestine radio venceremos prepare yourselves 
salvadorans the hour is near 
the barracks attack capped more than a month of increased 
activity by the farbabundo marti national liberation front a group 
of five leftist armies battling the usbacked and supplied 
government since 1979 
the rebels say they are showing their strength the us embassy 
says the guerrillas are losing in the country and the city attacks 
are an act of desperation and a search for publicity 
the ultraconvervative national republican alliance known as 
arena blames the raids on a power vacuum in president jose 
napoleon duartes christian democratic government 
duarte is ill with terminal cancer and for the first time in 
years the march elections will include leftist candidates 
us ambassador william walker linked renewed rebel activity to 
the presidential elections and a nov 14 meeting of the organization 
of american states in san salvador 
with the worlds or at least the hemispheric spotlight on 
them they are using dramatic gestures to say were here the 
ambassador said 
the guerrillas promised to take the war to the cities early last 
year but until recently their attacks were infrequent and small 
however since sept 13 the guerrillas have maintained pressure 
in rural areas and moved into new regions of this 
massachussettssized nation of 5 million 
as of today i know what the war is before it had been only on 
the television said isabel burgos a resident of zaragoza after 
an oct 6 attack on the town 12 miles south of san salvador 
that same day commandos using grenade launchers staged a 
rapidfire morning attack on the legislative assembly in san 
salvador 
on oct 18 two car bombs exploded in parking lots in the posh 
escalon neighborhood 
there are no more areas of tranquility for the guardians of 
exploitation it is not fair that the bombs and explosions are heard 
only in the rural zones in the homes of the poor the rebels said 
in a broadcast 
the military has increased patrols in the sprawling capital but 
the 1 million or so inhabitants seem unaffected by the war 
workingclass neighborhoods still teem with activity crowds cram 
the outdoor cafes in the chic zona rosa scene of a 1985 hitandrun 
shooting that killed six americans including four us marines 
however the guerrillas occasional calls for transportation 
stoppages are largely respected 
the us embassy which overseas 15 million in aid per day to 
the salvadoran government says the guerrillas are frustrated 
because they havent been able to topple the elected duarte 
administration 
theres no doubt of increased actions in the capital in the 
last couple of months walker said in an interview last week 
but blowing up a hamburger joint is not a great demonstration of 
military strength 
asked about wednesdays national guard attack he said they 
can do that on occasion and will be able to do that for some time 
but it doesnt particularly demonstrate military prowess 
more than 65000 salvadorans many of them civilians have been 
killed in the war the last attack as large as the national guard 
attack came in january 1981 when the guerrillas launched a failed 
final offensive 
groups traditionally sympathetic to the guerrillas including the 
roman catholic church criticized the recent actions especially the 
car bombs 
carlos diaz barrera a member of the newly formed democratic 
convergence a coalition of three leftist parties also said 
civilians should be respected but added that the barracks attack was 
a legitimate act of war 
these are the effects and not the causes of the war the causes 
are internal produced by extreme poverty the oligarchy and us 
intervention diaz barrera said

far longer than it had to be and too nasty as 
well the 1988 presidential campaign is as certain to trigger calls 
for reform as it is to elect the 41st president of the united states 
the money the tone and the timing are ripe for examination 
whether republican george bush or democrat michael dukakis is the 
winner on tuesday 
a bush victory would send the democrats into another agonizing 
round of internal debate this was the guy the democrats wanted to 
run against the wimp who couldnt win 
republicans are less inclined to try to reinvent the wheel after 
every defeat but a dukakis victory would accelerate the 
conservative drive to purge moderates and create a more 
ideologically oriented party 
a bush victory would revive talk by republicans of a political 
realignment in their favor and would force democrats to confront new 
evidence that americans like divided government republican 
presidents and democratic congresses 
whichever candidate wins the big loser could be iowa 
politicians are growing weary of the state whose caucuses 
dominate the first two months of the nomination campaign 
bush finished an embarrassing third in the 1988 iowa caucuses 
reason enough for him to support any move to diminish the states 
influence 
on the democratic side the state often seems a collection of 
special interest groups intent on demanding that candidates take 
positions theyll regret during the general election campaign 
new hampshire does its best to diminish iowas impact by 
consistently reversing the results of the caucuses but the early 
new hampshire primary doesnt have much more support than the iowa 
caucuses 
beyond the purely political consequences of tuesdays outcome 
the sheer ugliness of this campaign ought to prompt calls for change 
a familiar figure returned to prominence in 1988 the fat cat 
through much of the campaign the candidates disappeared from public 
view after dark 
they werent getting some rest or curling up with position 
papers they were schmoozing with 100000 contributors 
dukakis liked to say he was more interested in the lathe 
operators and the machine operators than in the sharp 
operators on wall street but his campaign spent a lot of time 
getting the candidate together with the operators willing to write 
big checks toward a 50 million fundraising goal 
the democrats were only trying to catch up with what the 
republicans had been doing for years raising big bucks for 
partybuilding political activity not covered by federal 
limits on contributions 
that soft money was a campaign asset over and above the 461 
million in public funds given to each candidate 
a lot of the money went for good causes such as voter 
registration drives but it also returned the parties and the 
candidates to an uncomfortable dependence upon fat cats maybe 100 
contributors will have the same access to a president bush or a 
president dukakis as 100000 contributors maybe not 
a common saying during much of this as well as past past 
campaigns was that voters havent started paying attention yet 
for months and months and months we were told that voters were 
ignoring the whole process 
then why in heavens name will the 1992 presidential campaign 
begin on nov 9 1988 
the simple answer is the need to raise millions of dollars the 
only solution probably is to have a latestarting candidate win his 
partys nomination and go on to be elected president politicians 
are like television programmers they always try to duplicate the 
most recent hit show 
the most disturbing aspect of the 1988 campaign was the negative 
tone 
can that be changed not so long as it works every politician 
who knows the road to election is the low one wont hesitate to take 
it

michael dukakis told voters today the 
republicans were taking you for granted and predicted he would 
upset george bush on election day 
dukakis continued his populist appeal as he addressed a warehouse 
rally of 5000 
were on the side of people who live off a family budget not a 
family fortune he said hes on their side were on your 
side 
dukakis noted new polls showing him closing the gap 
i think the republican party began celebrating a little early 
dont you they were taking you for granted he said 
dukakis had another grueling day planned today with more rallies 
in lansing and detroit mich and a joint appearance with running 
mate lloyd bentsen in texas before heading to colorado to spend the 
night 
the democratic presidential nominee received a rousing welcome in 
chicago on friday night marching with four former rivals and 15000 
people in a traditional torchlight parade and later addressing a 
rowdy rally attended by another 6000 supporters 
in 1960 john kennedy and lyndon johnson went into that last 
weekend down eight points in the polls were doing better than 
that dukakis said you can feel that surge and you can feel 
that excitement 
his voice has been raspy for days because of the busy schedule 
but dukakis sounded friday night as if his voice was making a 
comeback 
we know this race is not over he said to thunderous applause 
at the postparade rally were going to work even harder and 
every day until those polls close on the 8th of november and were 
going to retire mr bush 
dukakis recalled a joke used by john kennedy in the 1960 
campaign when thenvice president richard nixon was trying to 
succeed president eisenhower he amended it for the current race in 
which vice president bush is vying to succeed president reagan 
the lead elephant is about to leave the circus dukakis said 
of reagan and the animal that serves as the symbol of the republican 
party and the no 2 elephant has stopped dead in his tracks hes 
coasting and were fighting all over this country 
dukakis aides to support their contention dukakis is closing 
fast on bush cited a new cbs poll that showed dukakis trailing bush 
51 percent to 44 percent they also said internal campaign polls 
said dukakis was now ahead in illinois and michigan mustwin states 
in his upset formula 
but dukakis trails in texas ohio and new jersey and would need 
to win at least one of them if he is to realize his plan which also 
counts on victories in pennsylvania new york california and a 
number of smaller states 
it appears the dukakis campaign has given up on ohio and will 
attempt to win texas dukakis aides had been talking about returning 
to ohio but no such stop is scheduled and dukakis may make a second 
appearance in texas tonight if arrangements can be worked out 
polls have shown bush with a consistent lead in texas but the 
dukakis camp insists bentsen a texas senator is still capable of 
delivering his state 
at the chicago event as he did earlier in the day in new york 
and kentucky dukakis ridiculed bushs recent adoption of the new 
dukakis battle cry im on your side 
four days before the election after all the ads and 
distortions and the rest of it he says hes on your side dukakis 
said whos he kidding whos he kidding 
dukakis chided bush for supporting a capital gains tax break the 
democrat called a boon for the rich and declared 
hes not on our side hes on their side and the american 
people are going to reject him on tuesday 
marching in the parade with dukakis were former rivals paul 
simon the illinois senator jesse jackson tennessee sen albert 
gore jr and former arizona gov bruce babbitt 
also on hand was kitty dukakis who rejoined her husband after 
spending several days in a minnesota hospital with a respiratory 
virus

british bookmakers say george bush is now a hotter 
favorite than at any time in the campaign to defeat michael dukakis 
in tuesdays presidential election 
william hill and coral two of the countrys major bookmakers 
said saturday they had shortened the odds to 1to7 on vice 
president bush and lengthened the odds on the massachusetts 
governor to 4to1 
the 1to7 odds on bush means if the republican candidate wins a 
bet of 7 would win 1 plus the original stake a bet of 1 on 
dukakis the democratic candidate would win 4 plus the stake

a cornell university student whose father is a top government 
computer security expert created the virus that slowed 6000 
computers nationwide said a report today and the school found that 
the young man possessed unauthorized computer codes 
but cornell staff may not be able to determine if robert t 
morris jr a graduate student in the universitys computer science 
program was the source of the virus m stuart lynn vice president 
of information technologies at cornell said at a news conference 
today in ithaca ny 
three sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the new 
york times that morris 23 whom friends describe as brilliant 
devised the virus as an experiment 
cornell officials did not suspect the virus may have originated 
in their computer system until reporters asked questions friday 
night after the times report was published lynn said 
we are investigating his computer files at cornell and so far 
we have determined that his account contains files that appear to 
hold passwords for some computers at cornell and stanford to which 
he is not entitled lynn said we also have discovered that 
morris account contains a list of passwords substantially similar 
to those found in the virus 
passwords are the codes needed to gain access to computer systems 
the students father robert morris sr is chief scientist at 
the national computer security center in bethesda md the arm of 
the national security agency devoted to protecting computers from 
outside attack he has written widely on the security of the unix 
operating system the computer master program that was the target of 
the computer virus 
the elder morris reached today at his home in arnold md said 
his son would not be available for comment until next week 
computer viruses behave like biological viruses in that they 
duplicate themselves and spread from computer to computer through 
electronic mail systems or other networks they consume computer 
processing power and storage space and some but apparently not 
this one destroy stored information 
the virus was introduced into arpanet a department of defense 
computer network linking universities research centers and defense 
operations officials said it was intended to remain there 
undetected slowly making copies that would move from computer to 
computer the times said 
but a design error caused it instead to replicate out of control 
the times reported friday quoting an anonymous caller to the 
newspaper who said he was an associate of the programs designer 
the virus jammed more than 6000 computers nationwide starting 
wednesday but it apparently caused no damage other than lost 
research time and the thousands of costly hours that computer 
scientists and programmers were spending to remove it from their 
systems by friday most universities and research centers had 
turned their computers back on 
george strawn director of the computation center at iowa state 
university in des moines described the impact of the virus at his 
school as a slight case of the sniffles 
doug van houweling vice provost for information technology at 
the university of michigan said no files were damaged but many 
hours of work were needed to clean out duplicate waste files the 
virus created 
hanswerner braun a computer expert at the ann arbor mich 
school said the main effect of the incident was to call attention

seething hatred of the jews 
fanned by adolf hitlers propagandists exploded 50 years ago in the 
nazis wellcoordinated night of ransacking torching and beating 
called kristallnacht 
boastfully dubbed crystal night by the nazis because of the 
sparkling shards of glass from thousands of smashed windows that 
single night of terror was also the dawn of the murderous sevenyear 
holocaust 
the nazis eventually killed an estimated 6 million jews and 
hundreds of thousands of others they labeled undesirables 
throughout germany on nov 910 1938 nazis rampaged against 
jews in major cities as well as those few left in small towns after 
years of persecution 
the balance of the terrifying destruction according to official 
nazi count 195 synagogues and 7500 businesses destroyed thousands 
of homes ransacked officially 36 jews were slain some as they 
fled burning buildings other accounts however indicate that at 
least 1118 synagogues were vandalized and as many as 1000 jews 
were killed or committed suicide 
thousands more jews men women and children were beaten more 
than 30000 were arrested and shipped off to concentration camps in 
the first major step in the systematic nazi campaign to annihilate 
european jews 
the action which became known as the night of broken glass 
in english stunned the outside world and bluntly heralded the 
nazis intentions to aryanize society and business 
germans in both east and west have for months been making 
elaborate plans to mark the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht 
including solemn ceremonies panel discussions and new publications 
even half a century later the memory of the terror haunts its 
victims 
alfred jachmann was an 11yearold in the town of arnswalde now 
choszczno in northern poland 
we were sleeping behind shutters with the windows closed 
jachmann recalled in an interview we were jerked out of our sleep 
by the crashing glass we heard the screams the synaogue is 
burning 
my father screamed yes the skys all red we lived just 500 
meters from the synagogue we were hiding behind him for three 
hours we were shaking from fear and terror uniformed nazis rushed 
into our house they arrested my father without saying a word he 
said 
my sister gerda and i were crying terribly added the 
61yearold jachmann now head of the jewish home for the elderly in 
frankfurt my sister mother and i had to leave arnswalde within 
three days 
jachmanns mother father and 13yearold sister all died in the 
auschwitz concentration camp jachmann also sent to auschwitz 
later saved himself by plunging into the snow when nazi 
machinegunners mowed down prisoners in january 1945 
in what the nazis called spontaneous antijewish 
demonstrations kristallnacht raged across the german reich 
including austria and the recently annexed sudetenland region of 
czechoslovakia in addition to homes businesses and synagogues the 
nazi gangs ransacked jewish hospitals orphanages and homes for the 
elderly 
in the city of erfurt near weimar all jewish men aged 18 to 80 
were rounded up and forced into a local gymnasium 
some of the nazis especially took to task jews whom they 
personally knew to vent their fury on them said local bnai 
brith president harry stern 
we had to line up and march around to the sounds of the 
horstwessel song a nazi favorite then we were commanded to 
scream death to the jews and we had to do it said stern some 
were savagely beaten with whips he said 
then we were loaded into buses and brought to buchenwald where 
we arrived at dawn stern recalled in historian wolfgang benzs 
recently published book the jews in germany 193345 
in other cities jews were herded into courtyards before the men 
were separated from their families and sent to concentration camps 
valentin senger then a nonpracticing jew from a staunchly 
communist family witnessed the outcome of kristallnacht in 
frankfurt where some of the worst violence took place 
on the morning of the 10th i went to the factory where i 
worked and on the way to the factory i ran into a secretary she 
said have you heard the synagogue is burning he recalled 
senger described the mushroom cloud of smoke coming from the 
direction of the boerneplatz when he reached the synagogue he said 
smoke was billowing from the roof flames leaping through the 
windows 
hundreds of people were standing nearby he said the area 
was blocked off by police the fire department was there but they 
werent trying to put out the fire they had instructions to let the 
synagogue burn but to keep nearby buildings from burning 
i stood there and never heard any words of approval or applause 
or bravos the people looked stiffly and silently into the fire no 
one critcized it either the fear was too great 
that was the first time i felt i belonged to them i belonged 
there thats my people my synagogue was burning i really felt 
that i was a jew the 69yearold retired journalist told the ap 
in an interview i saw they were rounding up the jews and putting 
them on trucks that same day the jews were being mistreated and 
beaten 
senger survived in frankfurt by hiding from the nazis and using 
false documents 
much to the annoyance of nazi finance chief hermann goering 
kristallnacht had an unforeseen and nearly disastrous impact 
the damage calculated at 25 million reichsmarks worth about 
625 million shocked german insurance companies they noted that 
just replacing the broken glass would hurt the third reich since 
the glass had to be imported with muchneeded hard currency 
i wish you had killed 200 jews instead of destroying so many 
valuables goering told reinhard heydrich the nazi fanatic who 
gave the teletyped orders for kristallnacht 
eventually the nazis confiscated the insurance proceeds and 
slapped the jews with a 250 million fine 
fifty years later the anniversary is still creating conflict 
including debate over the best way to mark the day and the extent to 
which government leaders should participate 
roman catholic bishops from east germany west germany and 
austria last month issued a joint statement that sharply questioned 
christian leaders failure 50 years ago to publicly condemn the nazi 
night of terror the bishops implied that christian failings 
were partly responsible for the holocaust 
in september ignaz bubis leader of the frankfurt jewish 
community stunned the government when he publicly urged chancellor 
helmut kohl to have president richard von weizsaecker write kohls 
speech 
kohl has occasionally upset west german jews with what they 
consider insensitivity toward their concerns weizsaecker on the 
other hand has gained the jews admiration for urging germans to 
face the nazi past 
west german jews also frequently object to the word 
kristallnacht saying it minimizes the atrocities that followed the 
rampages they prefer the term pogrom night 
when the nazis came to power in 1933 germany had 530000 jews 
about 32000 jews live in west germany today in east germany the 
estimated number of practicing jews is 450600 with no permanent 
rabbi

there was a carnival atmosphere when 30000 
people gathered on a dusty hillside 75 years ago to see water 
carried almost 226 miles through the citys new owens river aqueduct 
from the eastern sierra nevada 
there it is take it shouted william mulholland the city 
water superintendent 
los angeles took it and more 
conceived with foresight planned with guile built in 
determination and surrounded by profiteering and hyperbole the 
aqueduct which opened nov 5 1913 has spun a compelling history 
the aqueduct to the owens valley was the foundation of the 
modern megalopolis it allowed los angeles to invent itself said 
william l kahrl whose 1982 book water and power is considered 
an authoritative history of the project 
what was done in the early 1900s is still very much with us 
said abe hoffman whose book vision or villainy is another 
definitive study the city of los angeles has been on a growth 
mentality really all the way 
water allowed los angeles to make the desert bloom 
it made arid real estate in the san fernando valley suddenly 
valuable and led to widespread speculation 
but water diverted southward to los angeles also prevented the 
owens river valley from blossoming into the center of commerce that 
its turnofthecentury residents wanted it to be 
los angeles officials ensured this by buying land in the owens 
valley at first covertly to acquire the water rights and later 
imperiously to take irrigated farmland out of production and save 
even more water for the city 
valley residents reacted by repeatedly bombing the aqueduct and 
armed night riders took to the roads the city responded with 
truckloads of armed guards 
today los angeles owns about 300000 acres in inyo and mono 
counties along the nevada border 
storytellers sympathetic to the ranchers portrayed the owens 
valley as a democratic eden and the sinuous aqueduct as the evil 
serpent causing their ruination 
nor could hollywood resist the temptation of embellishing the 
tale with john wayne in the 1935 film new frontier and jack 
nicholson in the 1974 movie chinatown a tale of graft and greed 
i would classify chinatown as a fine film and a great story 
but not good history hoffman said 
mulholland the selfeducated ditch digger who masterminded the 
aqueduct had a tragic downfall 
he pronounced the new saint francis dam northwest of the city 
safe hours before it collapsed in 1928 more than 400 people were 
killed homes and businesses were washed away and mulholland 
resigned in disgrace 
kahrl and others have concluded that the los angeles department 
of water and power was neither benevolent nor malicious in its 
treatment of the owens valley it was just coldly practical 
the irony said mulhollands granddaughter catherine now 
65 is that all the land los angeles acquired in the owens valley 
is pristine and gorgeous and its los angeles thats been trashed 
so many mini malls i think the developers have gotten away 
with murder in the last 20 years

irancontra prosecutors are using a new grand 
jury to review testimony from last years congressional hearings in 
an apparent investigation of possible perjury by witnesses in the 
case 
the prosecutors working for independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
have been playing videotapes of the housesenate hearings to the 
federal grand jury that has been meeting regularly on the case for 
about three weeks said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
because grand jury proceedings are secret it is unclear who 
might be suspected of lying under oath either to congress or to the 
original irancontra grand jury that returned indictments earlier 
this year 
but the panel could compare testimony a witness gave to congress 
with facts developed by walshs investigation as well as sworn 
statements that the individual or others made to the original 
irancontra grand jury 
so far the grand jury has not heard any live witnesses 
according to the sources indicating prosecutors are laying 
groundwork for the investigation by playing the videotapes of the 
1987 hearings 
the grand jury has been meeting two or three times a week for 
several hours it hears other cases unrelated to the irancontra 
affair 
the new grand jury unlike the one that indicted former white 
house aide oliver l north and other figures in the irancontra 
affair is free to review congressional testimony given under grants 
of limited immunity from prosecution for evidence of perjury 
such grants of use immunity prohibit prosecutors from using a 
witness testimony or evidence derived from it to prosecute that 
individual in court on criminal charges 
the immunized testimony however could be used as evidence in a 
perjury case if the witness lied to congress or a grand jury 
it could also be used as evidence that another person committed a 
crime raising the possibility the new panel could develop leads 
from the congressional hearings that could not be followed up by the 
original irancontra grand jury 
walsh and most of his prosecutors carefully isolated themselves 
from news coverage of the housesenate committee hearings to avoid 
exposure to the immunized congressional testimony 
the independent counsel did not want to be left open to defense 
accusations that his office illegally relied on the immunized 
testimony as evidence to prosecute the irancontra defendants 
he also took measures to ensure that members of the original 
irancontra grand jury were not exposed to immunized congressional 
testimony 
the team of prosecutors presenting evidence to the new grand jury 
is led by k chris todd one of the few members of walshs staff who 
has been exposed to the congressional testimony 
todds appearance at the proceedings signaled that the new 
irancontra grand jury is reviewing immunized congressional 
testimony and that perjury is a likely subject of the inquiry 
walsh said in court last spring that todd had been exposed to 
testimony given to congress and was not participating in the 
prosecution of north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
but walsh testified that todd was continuing to do unspecified 
work on his staff 
north poindexter hakim testified on capitol hill under limited 
grants of immunity from prosecution they are accused of conspiring 
to defraud the government by diverting millions of dollars of 
proceeds from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
secord the fourth defendant in the case gave congressional 
testimony without any immunity from prosecution 
no dates have been set for any of the four trials ordered in the 
irancontra conspiracy case 
members of the house and senate panels openly expressed doubts 
about credibility of some of the congressional witnesses including 
poindexter 
in their recently published book men of zeal two members of 
the committee sens william cohen rmaine and george j mitchell 
dmaine note that poindexter said 184 times he could not recall 
events about which he was questioned 
the memory lapses by a navy rear admiral known for his keen 
intellect raised serious questions about poindexters 
credibility the two senators wrote 
walshs staff would also be in a better position to evaluate the 
congressional testimony that secord and hakim gave about secret 
swiss bank accounts and dummy corporations through which the arms 
money flowed 
the congressional panels never saw the records of the secret bank 
accounts which walsh only obtained after protracted legal 
proceedings in swiss courts 
in addition walsh has the cooperation of willard zucker an 
american lawyer and financier whose geneva company has handled many 
of hakims business affairs for many years 
unlike the defendants in the case a number of figures in the 
irancontra affair testified both on capitol hill and before the 
original irancontra grand jury 
walsh is not barred from using congressional testimony that was 
not given under immunity grants 
but his staff and the original grand jury generally avoided 
exposure to accounts of the housesenate proceedings so they 
wouldnt learn about the testimony of immunized witnesses from 
questions that were put to other witnesses 
but the new grand jury would be free to compare the different 
versions of testimony by many witnesses who appeared before the 
original irancontra grand jury and on capitol hill

a presidential campaign shaped by sound 
bites and attack ads is finishing the same way it began on 
television 
with their color schemes and teleprompters anthems and pledges 
flags and balloons and children galore the party conventions last 
summer were made for tv 
and television will also host the campaign windups a halfhour 
of democrat michael dukakis followed by a halfhour of republican 
george bush on each of the three major networks on election eve 
cost per candidate nearly 1 million 
the dukakis program showcases the massachusetts governor 
answering questions in a town meeting setting and contains footage 
of his family and his running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen the 
bush effort summarizes the vice presidents achievements beliefs 
and plans for the nation 
the two candidates set new records this year for money spent on 
commercials expected to top 30 million apiece and for free air 
time in 10and 20second sound bites on the news as well as talk 
and interview shows 
some say the campaigns also set a new record for negative 
advertising and polls indicate tv ads had plenty of influence 
twentyfive percent of probable voters in a cbsnew york times 
poll conducted in late october said political advertising had helped 
them decide how to vote that compares to a 1984 postelection poll 
in which 12 percent of registered voters said commercials had helped 
them decide 
the test of a good president isnt who comes up with the best 
commercial dukakis said friday on nbc in what sounded like an 
admission of defeat on the media front 
bushs ads helped him define not only the issues of the campaign 
but his largely unknown opponent as well 
america cant afford that risk bushs attack ads said of the 
prospect of electing dukakis whom he bashed on crime taxes the 
environment and defense ready on day one to be a great 
president probush ads said depicting him as an experienced 
world leader with a warm human side 
dukakis advertising effort beset by indecision settled in the 
final days on two populist taglines the best america is yet to 
come and dukakisbentsen on your side the themes reflected 
his campaigns endgame focus on the economic concerns of workers 
and the middle class 
foremost among the general election ads that left lingering 
impressions was a bush spot called revolving door a stark 
30second procession of inmates filing in and out of a revolving 
iron gate capped with an ominous aerial view of prison grounds and 
a guard tower 
the narrator says dukakis vetoed the death penalty and gave 
weekend furloughs to first degree murderers not eligible for parole 
while out many committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and 
many are still at large on the screen the number 268 flashes 
implying thats how many firstdegree murderers escaped and 
committed crimes in fact only one did willie horton 
that ad combined with another bush commercial called crime 
quiz and the millions spent by independent groups hitting on the 
same themes helped fuel an image of dukakis as soft on crime 
the governor was slow to respond though he eventually came up 
with ads citing figures showing that crime has dropped substantially 
in his state while he has been in charge 
dukakis also struck back with a series of packaging of george 
bush ads that created a furor among consultants and columnists 
too confusing too elitist they said of the spots which showed 
actors playing cynical bush handlers trying to disguise their 
candidates alleged shortcomings 
the dukakis campaign maintains the packaging series served 
its purpose by halting a slide in the polls the series soon gave 
way to more traditional attacks on bushs record and judgment plus 
a wellreceived ad in which dukakis speaks directly into the camera 
about a fathers concern for the future 
day care wasnt such a challenge drugs werent such a threat 
when he raised his family he tells viewers today to stay even 
most families have to have two working parents if i were a 
young father today id want to know that my government wasnt blind 
to the changes in my life 
the dominance of television was highlighted by two commercials 
that featured none other than you guessed it commercials 
one an upbeat musical spot for bush shows people watching 
excerpts of upbeat bush ads on tv the other perhaps more 
reflective of the campaigns tone shows dukakis watching a bush 
attack ad dukakis snaps off the tv set in disgust full of lies 
and he knows it declares the democrat this isnt about defense 
issues its about dragging the truth into the gutter

president reagan proclaiming himself at 
the end of a long political journey pressed his case today for 
the anointing of vice president george bush as his successor 
all the progress we have made is on the line reagan said in 
a speech prepared for delivery at a republican rally at macomb 
community college 
with less than three days remaining before voters go to the 
polls reagan warned this election isnt over yet not by a long 
shot 
from this detroit suburb reagan was traveling to mesquite 
texas to speak in a rodeo arena 
in his weekly radio address reagan also put in a noholdsbarred 
plug for his vice president 
yes my fellow americans there is a choice a very important 
choice a vote for george bush is a vote for optimism its an 
endorsement of what weve done these past eight years reagan said 
the president who taped his address prior to departing on 
saturdays campaign swing urged voters to pay attention to each and 
every issue before them 
there are ballot propositions on issues from gun control to the 
size of cow stalls and yes everyone of these choices is vital 
every one is crucial every one gives you an opportunity to say 
this is what i want the future to look like this is the country i 
want to live in reagan said 
the freedom to vote as one wishes is what separates america from 
totalitarian regimes where the elections are sick jokes reagan 
said 
did you know that in the most recent election in the stalinist 
nation of albania the vote tally was 1820652 to one reagan 
asked 
on monday he returns for his third round of campaign appearances 
in california the richest prize with 47 electoral votes 
were now at the end of a long political journey that marks for 
me my last campaign as an officeholder reagan said 
im here today to bring home the simple fact that all the 
progress we have made is on the line he told his audience 
todays activities are part of a getoutthe vote campaign and 
i just want to tell each one of you go to the polls on tuesday and 
get your friends to go too 
this election isnt over yet not by a long shot and as 
winston churchill once said we must continue the struggle until 
victory is won he said 
his message about bushs opponent michael dukakis and other 
democrats was the same as it has been 
whether its their opposition to voluntary prayer in school 
support for gun control or the left wing judges appointed in a 
state like massachusetts or a weakkneed defense policy their 
views can only be described by the dreaded lword liberal liberal 
liberal 
i just happen to think america is on a roll reagan said 
speaking at an openair rally at a voorhees township nj 
shopping mall friday reagan said the voters choice on tuesday will 
be just as clear as when they chose him over jimmy carter and 
walter mondale 
reagan scoffed at dukakis stewardship in his three terms as 
governor of massachusetts 
between 1986 and 1987 while america as a whole was creating 
more new jobs than the rest of the industrial world put together 
under the governor his state ranked an abysmal 30th among our 
states in the annual rate of total job growth said the president 
himself the former governor of california 
and with yesterdays papers reporting a state bank account 
overdrawn by as much as 190 million for a month the massachusetts 
mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day he said 
the president was referring to reports appearing thursday that 
the massachusetts government was running a deficit and would have to 
increase revenues or reduce spending to meet the state 
constitutional requirement for a balanced budget 
heaping scorn on dukakis claim to crowds that he is on your 
side he said now let me ask you biggest job growth in the 
industrial world or one of the slower rates in the nation and a mess 
like that you tell me whos on your side the liberal governor or 
george bush 
yes the choice is just as clear as the choice in 1980 and 
1984 he said declaring that the democrats offer liberal tax 
and spend economic stagnation international weakness while the 
republicans offer limited government strong defense and firmness 
with the soviets 
with bush already ahead in new jersey polls reagan also 
campaigned for senate candidate pete dawkins an underdog in a 
hardfought race with democratic sen frank lautenberg

a member of vietnams parliament 
predicted saturday the united states and vietnam will establish 
diplomatic relations next year he also said his countrys 
occupation of cambodia has lasted too long 
nguyen xuan oanh made the comments to reporters after arriving in 
the philippines following a monthlong lecture tour in the united 
states 
oanh also reported renewed efforts to resolve the fate of 
american servicemen missing in southeast asia 
i think that once the new government will be installed in 
washington perhaps by midyear or the end of next year we will 
resume recognition of diplomatic relations between the united states 
and vietnam said oanh a former south vietnamese deputy prime 
minister 
during his us visit oanh said he met with reagan 
administration officials as well as members of congress and 
received very encouraging and positive signs from them he did 
not name the people he met 
oanh also met with american businessmen during the visit which 
he said was part of a campaign to lure western investment in 
vietnam the nation is one of the poorest in the world and needs 
american aid and investment that is now banned by a us trade 
embargo 
oanh said vietnam is making progress in efforts to end its 
10year occupation of cambodia 
the country has promised to withdraw its 100000 to 120000 
troops from cambodia by the end of 1990 a condition washington has 
imposed before it will recognize the hanoi government 
oanh said his government was setting up offices throughout 
vietnam for people to report any knowledge of missing american 
soldiers the information would then be used for a joint 
usvietnamese search for remains of missing american personnel he 
said 
he said vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 to end massacres by the 
khmer rouge government and attacks on vietnamese communities along 
the border between the two countries 
but the mistake that we have done i think is that we have 
stayed there too long he said should we have withdrawn perhaps 
a few years ago we would not have provoked the kind of criticism 
that we have now 
he said vietnam is willing to withdraw all its troops from 
cambodia and allow a un peacekeeping force to take over in 
exchange for guarantees that the khmer rouge will not return to 
power 
oanh served as a deputy prime minister of the usbacked south 
vietnamese government and was jailed for a year after the capital 
saigon now ho chi minh city fell to the communists in 1975

a 45yearold father of six has been 
convicted of molesting and sodomizing two teenage daughters for 
half of their lives and faces a sentence of life in prison 
the conviction of edward r dickey ended a weeklong trial marked 
by tearful testimony from the daughters ages 18 and 16 
dickey a roofing contractor crossexamined his daughters 
himself on the first day of the trial the 18yearold testified 
that her father had fondled and molested her since she was 9 the 
16yearold said her father began molesting her at age 8 
deidre lee dickey 18 cried friday when the verdict was read and 
said her fathers conviction was too severe i think it was real 
unfair miss dickey said he doesnt deserve to be in there 
jail ive been there 
in the pretrial phase of the case judge bryant huff had jailed 
deidre lee and her mother peggy sue dickey for more than a week 
for refusing to testify 
during the trial huff repeatedly chastised dickey who was 
acting as his cocounsel for what the judge called attempts to slow 
the pace of the trial 
in his closing arguments dickey quoted thomas jefferson george 
washington and jesus christ and claimed courts use the most 
extreme form of psychological warfare to coerce children to give 
false testimony to convict parents of sexual abuse 
assistant district attorney don johstono also quoted jesus 
telling the jury in his summation it is better to have a 
millstone around your neck and be thrown into the sea than to lead a 
child to sin 
he told the jury there had indeed been brainwashing but that it 
had been done by dickey and his wife not the government 
after deliberating for morre than three hours the jury convicted 
dickey on eight counts of child molestation aggravated child 
molestation sodomy and aggravated sodomy 
huff ordered dickey held without bond until sentencing on 
thursday 
dickey could be sentenced to life in prison for the aggravated 
sodomy conviction and more than 150 years in prison on the others 
dickeys wife said her husband likely would appeal the verdict 
her next fight she said will be to regain custody of her 
children from gwinnett county officials 
all of the dickeys children except deidre lee the oldest are 
in custody of the county social services agency the couples 
16yearold daughter a younger daughter and two young sons are in 
foster care the couples 13yearold daughter is staying at the 
county childrens shelter 
dickey also was charged with molesting the 13yearold daughter 
but prosecutors agreed to drop the charge to spare the girl the 
trauma of testifying 
johstono said the verdict affirmed that dickey who had no prior 
criminal record was a very sick individual

tishomingo high school was leading 1614 
with seven seconds to go when tailback shane hill got the ball ran 
55 yards to the end zone laid down and waited for the clock to run 
out for a twopoint safety 
but it was the wrong end zone and the two points went to the 
other school and that was exactly what the tishomingo coach 
wanted 
tishomingo needed a victory by four or more points over falkner 
high school to advance to the playoffs so tishomingo coach david 
herbert weighed the chances of his team going 40 yards on one play 
against falkners sturdy defense or making a long field goal 
finally he told his quarterback and son dave herbert to give 
the ball to hill for the twopoint safety 
it took the younger herbert so much time talking his skeptical 
teammates into the play that they were charged a fiveyard delay of 
game penalty 
when dave told them what we were going to do one of our 
tackles said your daddy must be crazy the coach said 
but what herberts plan did was tie the score 1616 to put the 
game into overtime and allow tishomingo to win 2216 and earn its 
class 1a playoff berth 
hills mother turned to a friend and asked if her son had 
gone crazy the coach said of the surprise play both sides were 
silent they couldnt visualize someone going 55 yards the wrong way 
i was watching falkner coach joe horton and i think he 
realized what our strategy was i saw him take off his cap and throw 
it on the ground

karl johnstone has never been disciplined 
or censured in his nine years as a judge but he fears voters may 
oust him from the bench on tuesday because a state agency has 
branded him unqualified 
the agencys recommendation that voters remove the anchorage 
superior court judge has drawn attention to alaskas unique system 
of judicial review 
alaska is the only state with an official panel that reviews its 
judges and publishes findings about their judicial fitness in other 
states bar associations sometimes issue ratings 
in the 12 years since the council began making recommendations 
johnstone is the first superior court judge found unqualified only 
four other judges all from lower courts have received the unwanted 
distinction 
the alaska judicial council is used as a model for other 
jurisdictions which are thinking about adopting some method to 
evaluate judges already sitting on the bench said hal brown a 
former state attorney general and the councils executive director 
we have been told by the american bar association that we give 
out more information than any other jurisdiction brown said 
thats not to say our system is entirely satisfactory because it 
isnt 
alaskas governor appoints judges from a short list of nominees 
submitted by the council but all state judges periodically go 
before voters 
the recommendations about judges up for retention are published 
in the state voters pamphlet and in most of the states daily 
newspapers 
in johnstones case he scored poorly in integrity judicial 
temperament and overall performance especially as ranked by his 
fellow jurists 
he is the first judge since the surveys began who lawyers and 
judges have scored less than acceptable in integrity that more 
than anything else led to the negative recommendation brown said 
the council of three lawyers three nonlawyers and the chief 
justice of the state supreme court usually recommends retention of 
the 17 judges up for retention nov 8 only johnstone was found 
unworthy of a yes vote 
the recommendations are based on a review of court records 
complaints findings of the state judicial conduct commission 
interviews investigations by the council staff and surveys of 
lawyers judges magistrates police and probation officers 
anchorage lawyer robert erwin a former state supreme court 
justice said its unclear to voters what is meant by integrity 
are you talking about his honesty is his work not any good 
are you talking about his character the thing is its not 
focused erwin said 
when you talk about somebodys integrity you really strike at 
the core of his being erwin said the implication given the 
intelligence of the people involved is that theres something 
horrendously wrong with judge johnstone or his colleagues wouldnt 
vote this way 
johnstone noted that his record as a judge and attorney is clean 
ive never been sanctioned or disciplined or censured either 
privately or publicly by the judicial conduct commission or by the 
alaska bar association when i practiced law he said 
he attributed his poor rating to some lawyers dissatisfaction 
with a program he started to speed the disposition of cases and make 
attorneys more accountable 
erwin said the rating system encourages guilt by association 
the council cant say but in the most general terms what the 
problem is and then the accused cant defend himself he said 
critics also say survey results often are based on a small number 
of respondents and can be skewed by anonymous attorneys seeking 
revenge against a judge 
brown pointed out that in the johnstone survey 528 attorneys and 
judges and 103 police and probation officers responded 
the people who are rating judge johnstone are giving it 
thought and in a sufficient number in my mind at least that it 
overcomes any real possibility of a conspiracy being engineered 
he said 
the verdict is not yet in on the effect of the councils 
recommendations on voters of the four judges previously found 
unqualified two were ousted in their second retention election the 
other two were retained but later resigned

the soviet ambassador to afghanistan stepping up 
pressure on afghan rebels to halt their advances said saturday the 
agreement on soviet withdrawal is near ruin because of us and 
pakistani arms supplies to the insurgents 
the statement to legislators in the afghan capital kabul 
followed an announcement friday that the soviet union had stopped 
removing its soldiers from afghanistan because of increased attacks 
by islamic guerrillas 
soviet ss1 missiles and sophisticated mig27 warplanes also have 
been sighted in afghanistan in the past week 
the concerted diplomatic and military pressure indicated the 
guerrilla offensive against the prosoviet afghan government has 
pushed the soviet union past its level of tolerance 
yuli vorontsov the newly appointed soviet ambassador said the 
supply of weapons to guerrillas by the united states and pakistan 
is a very serious blow to the geneva accords which practically 
torpedoes them 
vorontsov in addition to being the ambassador to afghanistan is 
a first deputy foreign minister with considerable influence and 
experience negotiating the red armys exit from afghanistan 
vorontsov spoke during a meeting of the foreign affairs 
commissions of the two houses of the afghan parliament his remarks 
were carried by the soviet news agency tass 
the time has come for a new international debate of all aspects 
of the situation in afghanistan and around it because foreign 
powers pakistan and the united states are involved here that 
push the opposition toward continuing the bloodletting he said 
vorontsov said un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
could play an important role in any new debate on afghanistan 
perez de cuellar in geneva on saturday for iraniraq peace 
talks did not comment on the afghanistan developments during brief 
remarks to reporters 
the united nations helped negotiate the agreement signed in 
geneva in april that led to the beginning of the soviet withdrawal 
the agreement was signed by the soviet union united states 
pakistan and afghanistan 
the soviet union and afghanistan say the supplying of arms to the 
afghan rebels is a clear violation of the agreement 
but diplomats say the united states and soviet union tacitly 
agreed at the time of the signing that one side could continue 
arming its client if the other did the same 
in keeping with terms of the agreement the soviet union withdrew 
half of its 100000 soldiers from afghanistan between may 15aug 
15 the withdrawal is to be completed by feb 15 
but alexander bessmertnykh a first deputy foreign minister told 
reporters in moscow on friday the withdrawal was suspended for the 
time being because of rebel bombings mortar and rocket attacks 
he also said the soviet union has sent fresh soldiers into 
afghanistan with more powerful weapons but he said the quantity of 
troops and weapons has not increased 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the soviet moves 
raise speculation that they arent going to live up to the geneva 
accords 
bessmertnykh said the soviet union still is committed to 
withdrawing all its soldiers according to schedule but added that 
soviet compliance with the geneva accord depended on whether the 
other signers obeyed it as well 
that indicated the soviets may be considering keeping soldiers in 
the country after the feb 15 deadline 
none of the national daily newspapers published saturday reported 
bessmertnykhs comment that the troop withdrawal was suspended 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced 
one prosoviet government with another and remained to fight the 
insurgency more than 13000 of them died in the fighting

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address saturday 
my fellow americans after a vibrant and fractious and exciting 
year we will at last be going to the polls on tuesday and 
exercising our most important right the right to choose our future 
the right to vote theres nothing more glorious than the blessing 
that is our godgiven freedom to choose those who will lead us and 
theres no sight more moving than a lone american walking into that 
voting booth casting a ballot in secret and thereby determining the 
destiny of this great country 
and make no mistake the choice this year at the top of the 
ballot is crucial dont listen to the cynical pundits who tell you 
this election isnt about the issues oh yes it is in fact its 
about more than the issues its about the direction this countrys 
going to take over the next four years and beyond its about the 
kind of economy we want the kind of defense we want the kind of 
values we want the choice is yours 
but yes my fellow americans there is a choice a very very 
important choice a vote for vice president george bush is a vote 
for optimism an expression of faith in the american experiment 
its an endorsement of what weve done these past eight years and 
of our heartfelt promise that tomorrow and the days to come will be 
brighter still 
no one knows better than a man who has sought the highest office 
in this land what an awesome responsibility it is to be the vessel 
of change the selection of a people in control of their present and 
their future its truly humbling and id like once again to thank 
all of you who placed your faith in me and id like to tip my hat 
to those who supported others but their took their responsibility 
as citizens of a democratic society seriously and with care i have 
heard your voices like those before me and those after me i have 
heard your voices and i hope i have justified your faith 
you know the two men who wish to succeed me on tuesday you know 
also so many others tens of thousands of candidates on state and 
local and school board ballots from hawaii to maine and there are 
ballot propositions on issues from gun control to the size of cow 
stalls and yes every one of these choices is vital every one is 
crucial every one gives you an opportunity to say this is what i 
want the future to look like this is the country that i want to 
live in and i believe you must take every choice from county 
sheriff to president of the united states with equal seriousness 
thats because our system depends upon you every single one of you 
alexander hamilton one of our founding fathers said it best 
no laws have any validity or binding force without the consent and 
approbation of the people well what weve learned in the course 
of human history is that dictators may coerce and tyrants may 
control but the people who obey them do so only because there are 
threatened with bodily harm to themselves or their families if they 
do not these societies are not just and theyre not good and 
perhaps most telling they do not work they do not work because the 
people have no voice they have no say their elections are cynical 
frauds sick jokes 
did you know that in the most recent election in the stalinist 
nation of albania the vote tally was 1820652 to one yes without 
the fundamental freedom of the right to choose hope disintegrates 
expectations for the future suffer and life itself becomes gray and 
dreary 
and that means a weak economy low standards of living high 
infant mortality and general gloom now compare that kind of 
society with the democratic societies where the last two centuries 
have seen the expansion of opportunity and freedom steady increases 
in standards of living and a constant belief that things will get 
only better 
and why because we who live in democracy are all our own 
masters and we know that the future is ours to build and that the 
only limits upon us are those we place on ourselves 
you can imagine how very moved i was last may to be in the lenin 
hills at a podium before an audience of students at moscow state 
university speaking to them about the wonder and glory of human 
freedom individual freedom think of those students only if 
theyre very lucky and rise high in the communist party will any 
one of them ever have the influence on the course of their countrys 
history and world history that each of you can have just by going 
into the voting booth 
so my fellow americans on tuesday breathe in the intoxicating 
air of human freedom in every polling place and voting booth in the 
nation and reaffirm the words in the declaration of independence 
all men are created equal 
thank you and until next week god bless you and god bless 
america

a judge allowed her child to run around her 
courtroom during proceedings called litigants and others pure 
trash and threatened to shoot a lawyer says a state panel that 
publicly reprimanded her 
the reprimand issued friday against district judge marsha anthony 
of houston is the most severe action the state commission on 
judicial conduct can take short of removing a judge from the bench 
officials said 
the commissions findings said ms anthony had among other 
things called people in her courtroom pure trash left the 
bench crying and shouting threats at attorneys and told one lawyer 
that she had a gun and could shoot two holes in his back before he 
could leave the courtroom 
the comments of judge anthony are not consistent with the 
temperament required of a member of the judiciary said the 
commissions report adding tha she brought discredit to the 
judiciary 
ms anthony was elected to the district court in 1984 and her 
term expires dec 31 however the commission said it is not to 
the benefit of the judiciary or the public to allow improper conduct 
to go unsanctioned solely because of an approaching expiration of a 
term 
ms anthony was elected as a republican in 1984 but ran in this 
years democratic primary for a seat on the state supreme court she 
was defeated in march 
according to the commissions report signed by executive 
director robert c flowers ms anthony failed to respond to the 
charges through personal interview telephone communication and 
handdelivered written interrogatories 
the commissions report said the disciplinary panel concluded 
that ms anthonys cumulative actions constituted willful or 
persistent conduct that was clearly inconsistent with the proper 
performance of her duties 
ms anthony could not be reached for comment she wasnt in her 
office friday and a secretary said saturday that the judge was not 
expected until monday her home number was not listed 
as listed in the report the commissions findings also included 
during a court proceeding the judge failed to control the 
actions of her 9yearold son who distracted lawyers jurors and 
herself by running around and crawling behind the judges bench 
ms anthony told her son in the presence of litigants and 
others in the courtroom son you see these people out here 
theyre trash theyre pure trash all of em 
in one proceeding she held a lawyer in contempt and told him 
to pay a fine to her favorite charity ie a personal friend in 
the hospital 
on jan 13 a jury acquitted ms anthony of charges of 
threatening a kingwood woman and her son in a dispute over a childs 
broken toy 
several bar associations have rated her the worst judge in harris 
county 
ms anthony is the judge whose temporary injunction propelled the 
states controversial no pass no play statute regarding high 
school athletics to the state supreme court which ruled the law 
constitutional

guitar in hand setting several jurors to swaying in their seats as 
he played a series of his hits 
the case brought by fantasy records was sent to the sixmember 
us district court jury late friday deliberations begin monday 
fogerty is accused of copying the melody of his 1970 creedence 
clearwater revival hit run through the jungle when he wrote 
old man down the road the lead single for his 1984 comeback 
centerfield album fantasy owns the rights to the earlier song 
he was aware of the fact that his stature as a star had been 
eroded by the passage of time norman rudman a lawyer for fantasy 
records told the jury the desire to succeed may stimulate a 
desire to recapture the things hed done before 
but fogertys lawyer kenneth sidle said fogerty is a great 
songwriter he doesnt need to copy his old songs to come up with 
good new songs 
any similarities between the two songs were due to the fact that 
they were written by the same person with the same musical style 
and vocabulary common to many of his past and present songs 
sidle said 
on the witness stand fogerty played several of his creedence 
clearwater revival hits proud mary green river down on

a naturally occurring toxin is the focus of 
research into an epidemic of dolphin deaths along the east coast 
the lead investigator said saturday 
more than 800 dead and dying bottlenose dolphins many with skin 
lesions washed ashore from new jersey southward to florida 
beginning in june 1987 the last dead dolphin was spotted in florida 
in february 
researchers originally suspected a virus or bacteria but are now 
concentrating on toxins that could have poisoned the marine mammals 
said dr joseph geraci professor of wildlife diseases at the 
ontario college of veterinarian medicine in guelph canada he 
presented a report on his investigation at an oceans 88 conference 
here 
he expects final conclusions in about six weeks 
geraci said that while high levels of pollutants and various 
viruses were found in the dead dolphins tissue neither appears to 
have killed them 
we suspect that we are dealing with a point source something 
at sea that might have been a natural toxin or some other 
pollutant geraci said 
he said all the dolphins appear to have been poisoned in early 
summer 1987 
some died right away some lived long enough to become infected 
with bacterias those animals languished for as long as six eight 
months after the initial event he said 
most industrial pollutants have been tentatively ruled out and 
scientists are concentrating on natural poisons geraci said one 
battery of tests for biological toxins found nothing but tests are 
continuing he said 
the events that led to a rare red tide along the east coast 
although not the red tide itself may be to blame the canadian 
scientist said 
red tides occur when microscopic algae become so populous that 
the water appears stained red in great concentrations they release 
toxins that are deadly to some fish and once in the food chain the 
toxins can harm other creatures including man 
while common on the west coast of florida in the gulf of mexico 
red tides are almost unheard of on the east coast although in 1987 
a red tide spread as far as north carolina killing shellfish there 
geraci said 
however that event occurred in the first part of november 
whereas the dolphins were dying as early as june he said 
there may have been events that spawned this red tide on the 
east coast that were also associated with the mortality of the 
dolphins geraci said he declined to elaborate saying that could 
compromise the objectivity of the investigation 
warm water calm seas high nutrient levels low salinity and 
rainy periods followed by sunny weather are some of the factors that 
contribute to red tides 
the pattern of mortality the extended time when it took place 
the geographic range all lead us to suspect that we are dealing 
with an agent or condition which these animals might have contacted 
at about the same time in early summer of 87 geraci said

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address delivered by sen lloyd 
bentsen dtex the democratic vice presidential candidate 
good afternoon my name is lloyd bentsen and im the democratic 
candidate for vice president its my job to deliver the official 
response of my party to president reagan and thats a difficult 
assignment even though hes been out campaigning for our opponents 
i think every american wishes president reagan well as he nears the 
end of his presidency and even though president reagan is trying to 
lend george bush a helping hand ill bet hes been disappointed in 
the behavior of those who now carry the republican banner 
a presidential campaign should be a magic moment for america a 
time when were proud of ourselves as a democracy because were 
proud of our candidates there hasnt been much about the campaign 
of george bush and dan quayle that would make any american proud 
they spent millions of dollars your tax dollars to raise false 
fears and make you believe this election is about phony issues they 
hired the best political hit men republican money can buy and they 
set out to assassinate the character of governor michael dukakis my 
running mate 
i think democracy is too fragile america too special for us to 
reward that kind of negative campaigning we cant elect a candidate 
who is trying to divide america into its lowest common denominator 
the republicans want you to believe this election is about right and 
left mike dukakis and i say its about right and wrong and whos 
really on your side we say its wrong for the republicans to duck 
the issues and distort the truth we say the best america solves 
problems creates opportunity and fights hard for working men and 
women who have suffered from eight years of republican indifference 
when it comes to issues of concern to the middleincome folks in 
america were right and the republicans are wrong were on your 
side and they are not mike dukakis and i are right when we say a 
college education should be a right and not a privilege for every 
qualified high school graduate we have a college loan program to 
make that dream a reality were on your side when we say america 
needs a government that will stand up and fight hard for american 
jobs and american products 
were right when we say countries enjoying full access to our 
markets must give us full access to their markets mike dukakis and 
i are on your side when we pledge never to cut your social security 
benefits and to protect programs like medicare we are right when we 
say trade and budget deficits just have to be reduced we are on 
your side when we offer programs to help young couples save for that 
first home were right when we tell you how well provide health 
insurance for 37 million americans who lack coverage and live in 
terror of illness and financial ruin 
we are right when we demand justice in the justice department and 
when we demand competence not contempt for government service 
george bush and dan quayle are wrong dead wrong when they turn 
their backs on issues of concern to middleincome america and tell 
you that this country can toast into the future with the status quo 
if we permit this election to be decided by the mudslingers and the 
truthtwisters well do a grave disservice to our democracy well 
set a dangerous precedent and put america on notice that when it 
comes to choosing a president anything goes and the truth really 
doesnt matter 
when you walk into that voting booth on tuesday stop for a 
moment consider the issues that really matter to you education 
health care good jobs at good wages making america number one in 
the world ask yourself if dan quayle is really qualified to be 
president ask yourself if america can do better and if your answer 
is yes vote for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen because were on 
your side 
mike dukakis has said the best america is yet to come and i 
believe that were fortunate to live in the greatest nation on 
earth and one reason for its greatness is that all our citizens 
possess that precious right to vote weve done well in this 
country but together we can do better and i believe the best 
america will come when we go to the polls on november the 8th and 
elect mike dukakis president of the united states of america

a law that would boost the power of israels 
orthodox religious establishment but alienate many american jews has 
a good chance of passage in the new parliament prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said saturday 
also saturday defense minister yitzhak rabin said his 
leftofcenter labor party might join a coalition with shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc if labor fails to form a government with 
religious parties 
a rightistreligious coalition will bring terrible things to 
this country rabin told israel tv in view of our national 
responsibility i dont rule out a broadbased government under 
certain conditions that would enable us to attain our goals in the 
areas of diplomacy and security 
likud leaders have said they would not accept labor as a 
coalition partner s long as labor insists on an international middle 
east peace conference 
both likud and labor have negotiatiated separately with orthodox 
and ultraorthodox parties about possibly forming a governing 
coalition in the knesset or parliament 
the socalled who is a jew law is a key demand by the 
religious parties 
it would give orthodox rabbis sole authority to validate 
conversions to judaism it has been denounced as discriminatory by 
american jews most of whom are affiliated with the reform and 
conservative movements of judaism 
before every vote on some religious law there is a big noise 
among american jews shamir said in an interview on israel radio 
im convinced well reach some understanding with the american 
jews 
in tuesdays election likud won 40 seats in the 120member 
chamber but needs the mandates of the religious parties and three 
extreme rightwing parties to form a majority 
the labor party which won 39 seats has held coalition talks 
with the religious parties but its chances of forming a government 
with them are considered slim 
most likud legislators including shamir backed the who is a 
jew proposal when it was put to a vote last year and narrowly 
defeated 
if there are now more parliament members who agree to this 
law there are more chances that it will pass shamir said in 
the radio interview 
existing law defines jews as those born to a jewish mother or 
converted to judaism it recognizes conversions by all three 
branches of judaism but orthodox rabbis argue that only their 
conversions are valid they want the law to be changed to read 
converted to judaism according to orthodox law 
should we have nonjews among us registered as jews which is 
of course a lie avner shaki head of the national religious 
party said on israel radio 
the proposed law would not affect most conservative or reform 
jews but members of the two movements have said it would 
symbolically expel them from the jewish fold 
shamir is ready to give the religious parties as much as they 
want said shulamit aloni head of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement in an interview on israel radio they can change our 
lives lock us in at home on saturdays and holidays 
but shamir dismissed fears by secular israelis that the likud 
would make too many concessions to the religious parties which also 
demand a ban on driving movies and soccer on the jewish sabbath 
i dont foresee any decisive chances shamir said everyone 
will be able to continue to live as he does now 
secular israelis make up about twothirds of the population

the kentucky court of appeals has cleared 
the way for trial on a lawsuit filed by a woman who had to deliver 
her own stillborn fetus and seeks damages from a hospital for 
outrageous conduct 
pamela v seitz says she delivered the child into a bedpan on 
march 11 1985 at humana hospitaluniversity of louisville with the 
assistance of only a roommate 
she alleged that for 15 to 20 minutes she and the roommate had 
been unable to get hospital personnel to assist them and that the 
nursing staff had intentionally deactivated her intercom buzzer 
after she used it several times to complain of pain 
when a nurse finally arrived at the room after the birth ms 
seitz and the roommate contend the nurse yelled at ms seitz who 
was hysterical to shut up as she was disturbing other 
patients the court of appeals said in its opinion friday 
david monohan a lawyer for humana acknowledged that the nurse 
used harsh words but said she did so only to calm the patient 
in order to determine what had happened and later apologized 
monohan said there was absolutely no evidence that the buzzer 
had been disconnected and said nurses responded in 15 to 20 
seconds after they heard ms seitzs screams 
ms seitz who had two previous miscarriages and had a highrisk 
pregnancy doesnt contend that humana was responsible for her 
babys death our complaint is with how she was treated said 
her lawyer ken sales 
monohan said ms seitz was in a regular patient room rather than 
the hospitals obstetrical section on the advice of her doctor 
unexpected premature expulsions of the fetus can happen without 
the ability of anyone to predict it monohan said no one did a 
thing wrong 
writing for the court of appeals judge boyce clayton took no 
position on the truth of ms seitzs claims but said she had 
presented enough evidence to meet the threshold for trying to prove 
outrageous conduct 
under kentucky law plaintiffs may recover damages for conduct 
outrageous in the extreme even if they havent been physically 
injured 
the court of appeals said plaintiffs must show they suffered 
severe emotional distress rather than mere bad manners or hurt 
feelings 
they also must prove the wrongdoers conduct so intolerable it 
offends against generally accepted standards of decency and 
morality 
the opinion reversed a jefferson circuit court ruling

at times margaret thatcher seemed more 
like a politician on the campaign trail than a prime minister on an 
official visit when citizens of this communist state flocked to see 
the british leader 
during last weeks threeday visit polish workers battling for a 
free trade union welcomed as a hero the staunchly anticommunist 
leader who has battered british labor unions and axed thousands of 
jobs to cut losses in coal mines shipyards and steel mills 
the communist government also gave her red carpet treatment 
but gerald kaufman a spokesman for britains socialist 
opposition labor party accused mrs thatcher of turning the visit 
into a hypocritical ego trip 
in poland she has held a dialogue with trade unionists oozing 
syrupy pseudosympathy in britain she tramples on trade unionists 
and never has any dialogue with them he said saturday 
in poland she associates with men fighting to keep a shipyard 
open in britain she shuts most of our shipyards down he said 
her visit began two days after polands leaders announced they 
will shut down gdansks moneylosing lenin shipyard dec 1 
she distanced herself from polish leader wojciech jaruzelskis 
admiring references to her own tough line with labor unions and 
closures of moneylosing enterprises 
the situation was completely different we were elected to stop 
abuses of power by trade union leaders in a democracy aides 
quoted her as telling jaruzelski 
mrs thatcher got a rousing welcome from about 20000 people 
friday in gdansk when she became the first western head of state to 
meet lech walesa in the heartland of his banned solidarity labor 
movement 
solidarity loved her for telling gen jaruzelski at a banquet 
that he must negotiate with the union and other opposition groups as 
the price for longterm financial aid from the west 
he responded coolly 
their joint public engagements had an air of formal correctness 
but the commemorations at monuments to those who died in world 
war ii the soberfaced jaruzelski in military uniform and the 
prime minister in a black coat and hat were more than rituals 
both leaders recalled that hitlers invasion of poland in 1939 
triggered world war ii with the british declaration of war on 
germany and praised the gallantry of poles who fought in the british 
armed services 
she stopped business during a warsaw market trip that was 
reminiscent of an electiontime visit 
in gdansk she looked near tears at a service in the shipyards 
roman catholic parish church st brygida as the congregation 
joined in a polish national hymn their arms raised in the 
solidarity victory sign 
mrs thatcher dodged reporters questions about her views of the 
shipyard closure but she told walesa it is apparent that no one 
can stop you 
jaruzelski added an informal touch which aides said delighted 
mrs thatcher 
he unexpectedly came to warsaw airport to see her off friday 
night and sent two bouquets of flowers to her plane

a judge says the orange county jail 
insulted human decency by housing naked inmates in unsanitary padded 
cells but the sheriffs department says the dozen padded cells are 
necessary and used properly 
our philosophy is to treat inmates with dignity assistant 
sheriff john hewitt said friday at a news conference the cells 
are always clean and they are properly used we provide the finest 
care we can for them 
us district judge william gray has ordered that inmates put 
into the cells be given bedding cloth gowns toilet paper and 
access to washing facilities 
gray issued the order wednesday in a lawsuit filed oct 8 by the 
american civil liberties union he said housing naked inmates in 
unsanitary conditions was an insult to human decency 
the lawsuit claimed the padded cells were unfit to live in and 
were used to improperly punish inmates 
they are the best alternative for the unfortunates who are 
suffering mental disturbances that are dangerous to themselves or 
other people hewitt said 
the judges order reaffirmed existing policies for the cells 
said dr eugene dorsey director of the psychiatric unit he said 
inmates put in the cells receive medical evaluations and approval is 
sought from a psychiatrist 
we have no quarrel with grays order dorsey said more 
clothing and amenities are something we can comply with but i think 
its sometimes safer not to give the individual something they could 
strangle themselves with 
a different picture was described by a doctor who worked in the 
jail from april 1987 to august 1988 
every time i walked into one of those cells there was vomit 
urine and filth on the floor dr manuel perezpabon said he 
testified that the cells were something out of a detentioncamp

democrats are so confident theyll do well in 
tuesdays house and senate races that they are throwing down the 
gauntlet for the next president already saying they not the white 
house will have the mandate to chart americas course for the next 
four years 
behind that confidence is the likelihood of democratic advances 
in the senate and perhaps the house plus the perception that the 
presidential candidates have done little to define a clear vision of 
what should happen after election day 
in the current arithmetic it appears likely democrats will pad 
their 5446 senate advantage by one or two seats house democrats 
will remain dominant as well perhaps adding a small handful of 
seats to their current 255177 majority 
but both sides also are prepared for surprises ive never seen 
the electorate as volatile as it is right now says sen john 
kerry of massachusetts head of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee 
presidential mandates are created when a president makes a 
persuasive case based on a clear election day tide that his 
victory amounts to a popular directive to pursue certain policies 
theres not a prayer of a chance that congress will accept any 
definition of a george bush mandate said thomas mann a 
political analyst at the brookings institution a more solidly 
democratic congress is also likely to deny bush if he wins the 
traditional honeymoon period of cooperation 
a victory for michael dukakis would bring less friction but 
eking out a comefrombehind win is not the stuff of which mandates 
are made 
whether bush wins or not there is a very clear commitment to 
continue what congress started two years ago addressing trade 
health care issues that have been ignored kerry said 
instead of resembling 1980 when reagan was swept into office 
along with a republican majority in the senate the next two years 
are more likely to look like the last two when reagan was a lame 
duck and congress largely set the national agenda mann said 
the way to think about this is not as the president leading 
congress but of the two as truly equal partners seeking 
accommodation and negotiation he said if bush adopts that mode 
and demonstrates some flexibility then he can get some things 
done 
sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vicepresidential nominee 
made it clear on the campaign trail last week that bush if elected 
will be unable to expect much deference from capitol hill 
i dont see how a president has any kind of mandate if he wins 
by negative advertising said bentsen who is virtually certain to 
be reelected to his texas senate seat regardless of what happens in 
the presidential race 
polls too are showing that voters are unhappy with the choices 
for president and want to congress to have a strong balancing role 
a wall street journalnbc poll published oct 28 showed that by a 
22point margin voters prefer to have the white house and congress 
controlled by different political parties 
in both the senate and house a proincumbent bias helps 
democrats 
fifteen democratic senators are seeking reelection and all but 
two john melcher in montana and frank lautenberg in new jersey 
are considered relatively safe a dozen republican senators are 
facing the voters one david karnes of nebraska trails badly in 
the polls two others chic hecht of nevada and lowell weicker of 
connecticut are locked in deadheat struggles to hold on 
there are six open seats where no incumbent is seeking 
reelection each party currently controls three 
one gop seat virginia is regarded as certain to switch to the 
democratic column for former gov charles robb rep james jeffords 
is expected to hold the vermont republican seat for his party the 
democrats appear likely to lose one of their open seats in 
mississippi to gop rep trent lott and to hold onto another 
wisconsin where millionaire businessman herb kohl has bought enough 
television time to make himself well known 
two open seats the florida democratic slot and the washington 
state republican one remain tossups and will be the most closely 
watched contests on election night 
kerry said a late surge by dukakis was helping democrats 
particularly by generating enthusiasm that would help motivate 
voters to the polls the getoutthe vote boost would be especially 
helpful among black voters many of whom have harbored resentment 
toward the party over what they regard as ill treatment of their 
favorite candidate the rev jesse jackson 
republicans meanwhile were hoping bushs lead in states like 
florida new jersey and mississippi would help their senate 
candidates in florida gop candidate connie mack was airing a tv 
spot in which bush endorses him 
were more enthusiastic about our chances than we have been at 
any time in the cycle said tom mason spokesman for the national 
republican senatorial committee while he conceded the possibility 
the gop might lose a couple of seats mason added we could just 
as easily be plus two or better 
in the house incumbency remained the most potent force at work 
in campaigns it appeared likely that as in past years nine out of 
10 sitting lawmakers will be returned to office 
of 27 open seats which were the most open to party turnover 
republicans hold 15 and democrats hold 12 giving democrats the 
mathematical edge for possible pickups another 70 incumbent races 
considered reasonably close are split about evenly between the two 
parties

in this usually placid nation of 
palmfringed tropical islands people are trying to come to grips 
with a violent intrusion that left scores dead 
i never thought i would see a man in combat in my life hasan 
malik a 29yearold diving instructor said saturday 
i heard gunshots for the first time said amir abdullah who 
works in his fathers cafe on males main street i didnt know 
what had happened 
two days after gunmen tried to overthrow the government 
bloodstains still marked the ground outside the presidential palace 
and the national security services building headquarters of the 
1200man force that is the countrys only defense organization 
while rain drizzled down members of the force patrolled males 
gray sand streets in jeeps and on motorcycles outside the capital 
city of one and twostory white brick homes indian paratroopers 
could be seen 
but the tuna trawlers that had stayed out of sight since the 
failed coup again docked at males jetty 
by evening people thronged males streets to buy freshly caught 
fish from the trawlers they carried the big fish home in their arms 
and on the handlebars of their bicycles the main mode of land 
transportation 
the maldives are normally a very peaceful quiet place we are 
all as brothers said businessman redeem mohammad didi 
the economy of the overwhelmingly moslem nation depends largely 
on fishing and tourism special islands have been set aside for 
tourists where they drink the alcoholic beverages forbidden to the 
182000 maldivians under islamic law 
tourists seemed largely untouched by thursdays attempt to 
overthrow president maumoon abdul gayoom and by the news that about 
30 people died the gunmen fled after indian paratroopers arrived 
we came to know about the coup only 12 hours after the 
mercenaries landed said lars granlof of sundstahl sweden 
granlof a radio journalist and his wife were staying at the 
kurumba village beach resort on an island five miles from the male 
atoll 
the tourists did what they came to do said raheem murad an 
indian on a business trip we are cut off and life here was 
totally normal 
some tourists were upset because their departures were delayed 
when the attack prompted officials to close the airport to 
commercial traffic 
i have stayed three days extra here with my family said 
satya prakesh who wanted to return to india where he works for 
indian airlines i am paying 500 rupees 34 a day room rent 
that was relatively cheap though many of the beach resorts cost 
between 100 and 200 a night

would score major points with his populist appeal of recent days 
he did acknowledge polling figures indicating that dukakis is 
narrowing bushs lead in public opinion 
weve said all along its going to be a close race right down 
to the wire he said and quayle conceded that im sure there 
are some nervous nellies in the gop campaign but he added

to focus on the top of the ticket these last days and see which

president chadli bendjedid on saturday 
appointed a former military chief to be the new premier after 
algerians approved reforms giving the premier greater power in 
governing the nation 
kasdi merbah replaces abdelhamid brahimi as premier according to 
a statement from the presidents office merbah will appoint a new 
government 
in a referendum thursday algerians overwhelmingly approved 
changes to the constitution aimed at reducing the power of the 
ruling national liberation front the sole legal party in this north 
african nation of 25 million 
the referendum grants the premier greater powers which are now 
wielded mostly by the president through a sovietstyle central 
control and makes him responsible to the national assembly or 
parliament 
last month algerians took to the streets to protest their 
declining standard of living food shortages and lack of jobs 
demonstrations in algiers and provincial towns became violent 
troops moved in and 176 people died in six days according to 
official count 
the rioting ended when bendjedid promised political and economic 
reforms including the referendum and a government shakeup 
merbah is known as a cando guy said one western diplomat 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he is objectiveoriented 
and reformminded he may be just the guy to oversee the changes 
bendjedid is planning 
merbah who has kept a low profile in the statecontrolled press 
has a reputation among algerians for integrity and honesty 
the 50yearold premier fought in algerias war of liberation 
against the french colonizers in the 1950s after algerian 
independence in 1962 merbah was made an army colonel and was 
appointed director of national defense he was among the officers 
who led the june 19 1965 coup that ousted president ahmed ben 
bella 
the new president houari boumedienne made merbah chief of 
military security the countrys most powerful police force 
merbah was credited with tipping the balance among the military 
officers who brought bendjedid to power in 1979 after boumediennes 
death bendjedid named merbah secretarygeneral of defense and in 
1980 viceminister of defense 
since 1984 merbah held a series of offices including minister 
of industry minister of agriculture and minister of health 
as agriculture minister mesbah oversaw the conversion of 
algerias enormous state farms to small private collectives one 
of algerias more successful attempts at making the economy more 
efficient and productive 
the new government faces an economic crisis brought on by the 
plummeting prices of petroleum products which represent 97 percent 
of the countrys export earnings 
sources close to the government who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said benjedid is planning a modified form of 
privatization for some industries and also hopes to find ways of 
diversifying the economy

a virus that clogged computers across the 
country probably was created without malice or intent to cause 
damage school officials and associates of the student suspected of 
creating it said saturday 
if cornell university graduate student robert t morris 23 was 
the source of the virus last week he had enough computer savvy that 
he could have caused catastrophic damage to the network the virus 
invaded fellow students said 
hes very clever very intelligent said cornell computer 
student david baraff who said he has known morris since they both 
worked a summer at atampts bell laboratories even in high school 
he was already good at this stuff 
if he had wanted it the virus to be malicious it would have 
been really malicious baraff said 
while the virus program kept computers extremely busy and jammed 
their memories by ordering the machines to replicate itself it 
destroyed no data officials at effected centers said it eventually 
affected about 6000 computers at military and civilian research 
centers 
other than his reputation as an accomplished hacker morris has 
been virtually nameless and faceless in the two months since he 
entered cornells doctorate computer science program students said 
the new york times quoted sources as identifying morris as the 
creator of the virus 
he was quiet and always working on things said student kevin 
asplen maybe this is what he was working on 
morris a firstyear student in the graduate computer science 
program would just be programming all the time though i dont 
really know what he was working on said student richard chapman 
who said he worked at a terminal near morris in one of their 
classes 
other students in the same class said they could not even 
remember what morris looks like 
i wouldnt even be able to tell you who he is student james 
allen said 
given the nature of computer science where work is generally 
done alone at a terminal its not unusual for students to remain 
aloof students said 
the skills to break into arpanet the defense 
departmentsupported network into which morris allegedly unleashed 
the virus from cornells computer system also are not unusual 
students said 
i would presume we would all be considered quite good 
hackers graduate student paul stodghill said he shares an office 
with morris but said he rarely has seen him there 
but morris was a little better at hacking unauthorized 
manipulation of computers than others associates said 
morris was highly recommended to cornell by his undergraduate 
professors at harvard university but more for his practical 
computer skills than his academic record according to his adviser 
cornell instructor dexter kozen 
if the virus is traced to morris appropriate disciplinary 
action will be taken said m stuart lynn cornells vice 
president for information technologies he would not give details on 
what actions might be taken 
dean b krafft research associate in computer science at 
cornell said it will be hard to prove whether morris was 
responsible because its not a question of having eyewitnesses 
its not like we have any fingerprints left behind from 
programs used to create the virus

days i am pleased that we have had a reaffirmation of the 
commitment to the ceasefire perez de cuellar said the 
political determination to abide by the ceasefire was very clear 
during the talks 
iran and iraq have explained their positions in detail he said 
but indicated they remained far apart 
i would mislead you if i told you we had fantastic progress 
the un chief said 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati told reporters that 
the question of troop withdrawals was one of the problems 
he repeated irans insistence that the withdrawal to 
internationally recognized boundaries should be the next step to 
follow the ceasefire 
iraq has demanded that the shattalarab waterway its only 
outlet to the persian gulf be immediately cleared of the silt and 
war debris that is blocking it and linked this to a troop withdrawal 
iraqis foreign minister tariq aziz said the talks have been 
useful he said he and perez de cuellar had exchanged diplomatic 
notes on the privileges and immunities of the un iraniraq military 
observer group that is monitoring the ceasefire

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis at a rally saturday 
in lansing mich 
i smell victory in the air i dont have to tell you whats 
happening out there you can feel it and sense it and taste it 
i think the republican party started celebrating a little 
early dont you ive got a message for them were the ones who 
are going to be celebrating on the eighth of november as a matter

eighth of november i think hes slipping and were surging he 
thinks he can inherit the white house i think you have to earn the 
right to be president of the united states 
george bush and the republican party have run what has to be 
the most cynical and i think distorted campaign in history its 
been a campaign of distortions and lies and outright garbage and the 
more they slip this weekend the more youre going to hear 
americans this weekend all over this country are looking hard 
and asking the fundamental question in this campaign is it george 
bush or mike dukakis who is standing up for working families in this 
country if you believe we ought to be exporting american 
products and not american jobs then were on your side 
if you believe in equal rights and civil rights and want an 
attorney general who respects the law and the constitution and a 
justice department that understands the meaning of the word justice 
and a supreme court that understands the constitution then were 
on your side 
if you believe in college opportunity for every young person 
then were on your side and if you believe that its time for 
america to fight a real war and not a phony war on drugs then 
were on your side

democrat lloyd bentsen gloating that 
republicans are dropping like a rock in the polls rallied 
volunteers saturday in delegaterich california and told radio 
listeners the election shouldnt be decided by mudslingers and the 
truth twisters 
the republicans are panicking because the truth is catching up 
with them said the democratic vice presidential nominee blasting 
what he contends are false advertisments by george bushs campaign 
the republican philosophy was if it sounds good were going 
to say it and never mind the facts he said 
bentsen speaking at a rally of about 250 democratic precinct 
workers and other supporters in east los angeles said it was now up 
to them to get out the word and win california and the election for 
him and michael dukakis 
my friends this is the big one 47 electoral votes he 
said we win it in california we win it across this nation 
bentsen was joined at the rally by sen alan cranston dcalif 
and rep esteban torres dcalif and was introduced by actress 
rita moreno 
ill tell you the republicans are dropping like a rock in the 
polls bentsen said repeating his assertion that michael dukakis 
would like harry truman confound the experts and win 
a cbs poll released friday showed bush leading democrat michael 
dukakis by seven points among probable voters down from the 
12point lead in a survey taken earlier in the week 
i see some of those republicans popping their champagne 
corks he said on nov 9 theyre going to have one of the 
worst hangovers theyve ever had 
bentsen wrapped up a oneday swing through california with a 
speech later saturday in san francisco to a union audience 
emphasizing the democrats classconscious theme that they were on 
your side 
the texas senator delivering the democrats response to 
president reagans weekly radio address blasted the republicans for 
negative campaigning and said even though president reagan is 
trying to lend george bush a helping hand ill bet hes been 
disappointed in the behavior of those who now carry the republican 
banner 
they have spent millions of dollars your tax dollars to 
raise false fears and make you believe this election is about phony 
issues he said they hired the best political hit men 
republican money can buy 
if we permit this election to be decided by the mudslingers and 
the truth twisters we will set a dangerous precedent and put 
america on notice that when it comes to choosing a president 
anything goes and the truth really doesnt matter he said 
bentsen also was scheduled to appear on two television interview 
shows on sunday part of the democrats aggressive media strategy in 
the waning days of the campaign late last month the campaign aired 
a fiveminute spot on network television featuring bentsen 
unprecedented for the no 2 person on the ticket 
at the east la rally the bilingual bentsen mixed a little 
spanish in with his english 
and he also threw in a yiddish expression chutzpah which 
roughly translates to gall to describe one of bushs claims 
against dukakis but he botched the pronunciation of the word 
afterward aides asserted jokingly that it was a texas dialect 
later in the day in a san francisco union hall near fishermans 
wharf more than 500 democratic campaign workers staged a boisterous 
rally for bentsen 
were on the side of working ment and women of america 
bentsen declared citing the democratic plans for new health care 
education and housing programs 
again attacking the republican ads he said were not going to 
put up with it and the american people arent going to put up with 
it he said 
were armed with the truth and were going to set the record 
straight he said 
tony podesta the dukakisbentsen campaign director in 
california said 80 getoutthevote rallies were being held in the 
state this weekend

a computer virus is a tiny program introduced to computers either 
as a prank or vandalism 
just as a biological virus disrupts living cells to cause 
disease a computer virus invades data processors and disrupts 
normal operation of the machines 
a virus duplicates itself spreading into other programs in the 
computer and infecting one computer after another as users share 
floppy disks or link up over telephone lines 
mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative message 
on a users screen deadly forms can destroy data or cripple a 
computer some are time bombs designed to wreak havoc on a 
preprogrammed date 
the virus that infected 6000 university and military computers 
nationwide last week apparently did its damage by rapidly 
duplicating itself thereby slowing computers processing speed and

economic manager says reform showing results more needed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a politburo member addressing communist party and 
government leaders saturday said economic reforms are showing 
results but must be followed by improvements in food and consumer 
goods 
nikolai n slyunkov spoke at the traditional kremlin gathering 
marking the anniversary of the bolshevik revolution in 1917 
during the meeting president mikhail s gorbachev talked and 
joked with yegor k ligachev a member of the ruling politburo and 
considered to be a conservative rival of gorbachev 
ligachev who had been considered the no 2 man in the kremlin 
hierarchy was downgraded and given the agriculture portfolio in 
gorbachevs shakeup at the end of september 
two politburo members viktor p nikonov and ukrainian party 
chief vladimir v shcherbitsky were absent there was no 
explanation for nikonovs absence but it was believed shcherbitsky 
was presiding over anniversary ceremonies in kiev 
slyunkov is the former party chief in byelorussia which has been 
held up as an example of economic reform 
today like never before we need strict discipline but not 
the discipline of the fist but the discipline of interested 
conscious democracy he said 
the call to social action is not fear but interest economic 
stimulus slyunkov said 
he told the gathering of hundreds of party and government leaders 
along with scientists and military officers that the national income 
is rising because of an increase in labor productivity 
but the soviet union still must supply its citizens with more 
consumer goods and food he said and part of the solution is the 
lease system of farming that gorbachev is promoting to give farmers 
a greater interest in their work 
slyunkov expressed the partys support for greater openness in 
public discussion if it does not question the partys power 
without offering specifics slyunkov said the party also 
recognized the need to work out new relations between members of the 
countrys more than 100 nationalities 
ethnic tensions have been especially strong in the southern 
republics of armenian and azerbaijan and in the baltic republics of 
the northeast

george bush on saturday endorsed continued 
import quota agreements benefiting the steel industry an issue that 
had dogged him in pennsylvania where he is in a tight battle with 
michael dukakis 
a dukakis spokesman called bushs announcement just three days 
before the election cynical and cowardly 
a handful of major steel firms had been lobbying the vice 
president for a commitment on the quotas and sen john heinz 
rpa said bush would lose the state and its 25 electoral votes 
unless he promised to extend the trade pacts which expire next 
september 
bush released a letter to heinz saturday saying that one of his 
key trade policy goals as president would be to achieve 
international consensus on eliminating unfair steel trade 
practices 
pending that i can assure you of my intention to continue the 
voluntary restraint program after sept 30 1989 bush said in the 
letter as vice president i worked to prevent the sacrifice of 
our industry to those who choose not to subject themselves to the 
discipline of the market and i have no intention of abandoning that 
commitment if i am elected president 
dukakis spokesman gene sperling said the democrat has been in 
support of extending the steel agreements for the entire campaign 
dukakis challenged bush to come out in favor of it sperling 
said this is the most cynical and cowardly action one can 
imagine he bush had the entire campaign to come out for the steel 
idustry 
pressured by the industry and by congress the reagan 
administration negotiated fiveyear steel trade agreements with 
japan south korea and other leading steelexporting nations in 
september 1984 the idea was to give american companies breathing 
space from subsidized foreign competition by pressuring competitors 
to restrict imports on a productbyproduct basis 
with the steel industry turning a profit last year and with some 
importers complaining of steel product shortages it has been hotly 
debated whether the import curbs should be extended 
heinz said bushs letter demonstrated the vice presidents 
commitment to the nations manufacturing base and provided proof 
i believe that we will carry pennsylvania and other industrial 
states where the contest is too close to call

solidarity founder lech walesa said 
saturday the government must suspend its decision to close the lenin 
shipyard before he will meet the interior minister to discuss 
convening talks on polands future 
in this situation our meeting depends exclusively on the 
authorities in spite of numerous disappointments i trust that this 
time we manage to come to agreement walesa said in a communique 
there was no immediate response from the government but walesas 
statement appeared to leave the two sides no closer to convening the 
governmentopposition talks originally planned for midoctober 
government spokesman jerzy urban said friday that the 
governments decision to close the lenin shipyard in gdansk on dec 
1 was irreversible 
the solidarity trade union was formed at the shipyard in 1980 and 
became the first free union movement in the soviet bloc when it was 
chartered by the government but it was suspended in december in 
1981 and outlawed in 1982 
saturdays developments followed more than three weeks of verbal 
sparring between walesa and the government over when the talks can 
begin 
the talks had stalled over whether walesa would drop two advisers 
from solidaritys proposed delegation who the government considers 
extremists 
walesa has said he would not allow officials to interfere in the 
composition of solidaritys delegation he also said he would not 
agree to a preliminary meeting with interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak if the meeting would include personnel matters 
kiszczak on wednesday renewed the offer of a preliminary meeting 
in a letter sent to walesa 
walesa said saturday he would meet with kiszczak if the 
government suspended the shipyard decision and honored a previous 
promise to rehire workers dismissed for striking during a wave of 
labor unrest in august 
walesa delayed a formal reply to kiszczak until after the 
departure friday of british prime minister margaret thatcher 
the government on monday announced its plan to close the lenin 
shipyard and said the action was taken because of the economic need 
to shut down moneylosing statesubsidied industrial plants 
but solidarity said the decision by the new prime minister 
longtime solidarity foe mieczyslaw f rakowski was political 
talks among representatives of the opposition authorities and 
other social groups were first proposed by kiszczak during the 
strikes in august

president daniel ortega on saturday 
urged the new us government to respect the central american peace 
agreement regardless of which party wins tuesdays election 
current us policy is not interested in having peace in 
central america and wants a military solution that crushes the 
sandinista revolution and the popular movement in el salvador 
ortega told reporters after meeting salvadoran leftist leaders 
he blamed the united states for the breakoff in ceasefire talks 
between his sandinista government and usbacked rebels known as 
contras in september 
what is most serious is that in the days before the election in 
the united states we are hearing aggressive and interventionist 
rhetoric that threatens the central american region ortega said 
the central american governments must urge the current american 
government and the one that emerges from the election to respect the 
esquipulas agreements 
five central american presidents including ortega signed a 
peace agreement on aug 7 1987 the plan known as esquipulas ii 
after the guatemalan town where the presidents had met calls for 
ceasefires amnesties and democratic reforms 
it also calls for an end to outside aid to insurgents and to the 
use of a countrys territory by rebels from neighboring nations the 
united states accues nicaragua of helping leftwing rebels fighting 
to overthrow the salvadoran government

washington more women working outside the home have allowed 
most american families to keep the buying power they had 10 years 
ago according to a study released saturday 
forty percent of families however have not keep pace with the 
increasing cost of living over the past decade said the study by 
the economic policy institute 
the head of the liberal think tank said the report shows average 
american families have been under greater economic pressure during 
the past decade than at any time since world war ii 
without new economic policies it is clear that families can no 
longer count on steadily increasing incomes and that the next 
generations cannot expect to live better than their parents said 
institute president jeff faux an economist 
the institute established in 1986 by prominent liberal 
economists describes itself as a nonpartisan nonprofit group it 
has opposed the conservative economic policies of the reagan 
administration 
the report said salaries for most women have increased faster 
than inflation while salaries for all but the richest american men 
havent kept up 
the study documents a growing gap between rich and poor in the 
united states and says that young adults who do not finish college 
are doing substantially worse than those who were the same age a 
decade ago 
it also says low wages are forcing growing numbers of unattached 
young people 15 million more than a decade ago to return to 
the nest of their parents households rather than living on their 
own 
economists stephen rose of seattle and david fasenfest of 
louisville who wrote the report said they used statistical methods 
that take into account family size they also used the most 
conservative costofliving figures to overcome objections to 
previous studies that also showed widening inequality and slow 
income growth 
some conservative economists have argued that americans are doing 
better because families are smaller even if family incomes have not 
kept up with inflation 
this is an important first step in measuring the real economic 
benefit of having a wife work rose said in a telephone interview 
he said figures cited by the reagan administration and others seem 
to show improved economic conditions while polls show that people 
think they are worse off 
income from a working wife he said may add to family income but 
may cost more in child care restaurant and other expenses 
more wives are working now because they feel they have to 
because they have to have a certain relative standard of living 
he said 
the report says the number of working wives increased from 554 
percent in 1979 to 661 percent in 1986 
wives earnings adjusted for inflation increased 121 percent 
from an average 14064 in 1979 to 15768 in 1986 the study says 
while husbands adjusted earnings dropped from 23204 in 1979 to 
22240 in 1986 
even with wives working the study says roughly two out of five 
american families those earning less than about 27000 a year in 
1986 earned more than they did 10 years ago but the increase did 
not keep up with inflation adjusted income for all americans 
increased 73 percent however 
if women had worked only the number of hours they did in 1979 
the study says average wages would have increased only 49 percent 
with three out of five families or those earning less than 40000 
lagging behind the inflation rate 
with more women working average adjusted family income increased 
from the equivalent of 38492 in 1979 to 41288 in 1986 the study 
says 
the nations wealthiest 20 percent earned nine times more than 
the poorest in 1986 compared with seven times in 1979 it says the 
top group includes families that earned over 59533 in 1986 their 
income averaged 94104 compared with 9133 for the lowest fifth 
of the population 
rose said the trend of a widening gap between rich and poor is a 
reversal from earlier decades 
institute research director lawrence mishel said the report was 
intentionally released prior to the presidential election but it 
was not intended to be issued so close to election day tuesday 
we think its an important part of the debate as to how well 
people have been doing this shows evidence that people are 
struggling to get by and that things are not going as well as they 
used to he said

here are excerpts from speeches by republican presidential 
nominee george bush at a rally in pennsylvania at immaculata college 
outside philadelphia and earlier in new jersey 
from clark nj at gop headquarters 
new jersey has always been considered a key battleground 
and there is a feeling that if we work hard in this state well win 
it and we have a very good chance to win it 
let me tell you what ive had to do because i think 
everybody here and everybody across the country knows that when that 
national democratic campaign came on and that convention they 
thought they were going to kick my brains out and get away with it 
they can dish it out but they cant take it 
weve got three days of campaigning left and the key is get out 
that vote we are building a strong getoutthevote effort from the 
east coast to the west 
we cant go any further or work any harder and were going to 
just keep doing it let someone else sort out all these polls 
and do i feel i got a good shot at winning absolutely but im 
not going to turn things around at the last moment and try to 
lighten up on campaigning were just going right down to the 
wire 
from immaculata college 
i can hardly believe only two and a half days left before we go 
to the polls and am i glad of that we are in a tough state and 
i came here to pennsylvania because this state is critical 
referring to boston herald and boston globe articles on the 
precarious state of the massachusetts economy 
these papers better be careful they better because the liberal 
governor is going to start accusing them of negative campaigning

michael dukakis and george bush hurtled through a final weekend 
of campaigning the underdog democrat vowing saturday to work for 
those living on the family budget not the family fortune while 
his rival pledged he wouldnt be outhustled by the liberal 
governor from massachusetts 
the two combatants raced across america at a pace that defied 
endurance while their managers were pouring millions of dollars into 
a campaignending television advertising drive 
the republicans professed no public concern that their lead might 
be dwindling in the races final days george bush is not jittery 
dan quayle is not jittery said the no 2 man on the ticket 
the latest polls agreed bush still led but differed on the 
trend cbs reported a margin of 5243 a slight gain for bush over 
results broadcast 24 hours earlier pollster louis harris said bush 
led 5144 with the trend slightly in dukakis favor 
candidates in the 33 senate races and 435 house contests on 
tuesdays ballot also went through a final weekend of working as 
did the two dozen rivals contesting the 12 statehouse races 
democrats were rated as favorites to renew their control in the 
senate and prohibitive favorites to hold a majority in the new house 
everyone was straining for the finish line of a campaign marathon 
we are all very tired said barbara bush speaking for 
candidates and their entourages everywhere 
despite the fatigue there was no letup with the election three 
days away 
dukakis used increasingly sharp tones to criticize republican 
vice presidential candidate quayle and accused bush of running a 
campaign of lies and just plain garbage 
i think the republican party began celebrating a little early 
dont you dukakis said to his crowds as he made his way through 
four states theyre taking you for granted 
bush also had four states on his itinerary although aides were 
juggling his schedule on the run in a bid to counter dukakis moves 
he knocked on doors in one new jersey neighborhood made a few 
getoutthevote telephone calls painted a campaign sign and told 
reporters i dont believe in polls let someone else sort out 
all these polls 
urged by local republicans to make a gesture to an industry 
critical to the pennsylvania economy the vice president endorsed 
continued import quotas on steel after their scheduled expiration 
next sept 30 barring an international fair trade agreement 
bush and dukakis campaigned with one eye on the crowds and the 
other on the spate of polls being conducted over the weekend to 
chart the race in its final days 
bush aides spread the word that their own polls showed a modest 
improvement in the vice presidents support overnight and claimed a 
lead in the range of 810 points nationally democrats said it was 
more like five or six points 
an associated press tabulation showed bush leading for as many as 
359 electoral votes but many of them were from states where dukakis 
seemed to be gaining and the vice president could not count on the 
270 needed for victory the survey showed dukakis leading for as 
many as 101 electoral votes while 78 votes were in states rated as 
tossups including pennsylvania missouri and illinois 
the two presidential rivals complimented one another in separate 
interviews with television personality david frost although the 
words had a certain backhanded quality to them 
the contacts ive had with him have been very pleasant bush 
said of his rival but ive been accused of liking liking you 
know almost everybody and i think there is a lot of good in 
everyone and certainly in my opponent 
dukakis said i dont normally get personally angry or annoyed 
at the people that i run against he added he was surprised and 
disappointed at bushs campaign and added theres something i 
think out of character about this and there are people who know him 
who believe that 
so much for the pleasantries such as they were 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen delivered 
the democratic response to president reagans weekly radio address 
and campaigned in california he accused bush of false campaign 
advertising and said the republican philosophy is if it sounds 
good were going to say it never mind the facts 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle was campaigning 
in west virginia 
bush was endorsed by a handful of democratic municipal and union 
officials from new jersey and said i will try if im elected 
to be a fairplay president in terms of the working men and women in 
this country and in terms of labor itself 
in pennsylvania he vowed were not going to be outhustled by 
the liberal governor from massachusetts 
the vice president also brushed aside persistent democratic 
complaints about his campaign saying they can dish it out but 
they cant take it 
dukakis depicted bush as a child of privilege who as president 
would help the wealthy he wants to make the rich in this country 
even richer the massachusetts governor said were on the side 
of people who live off the family budget not the family fortune 
the democrat appeared on stage in rock island with a man wearing 
a mask that bore the likeness of former president richard nixon 
said iowa sen tom harkin yes its hard to believe richard 
nixons running again only this time hes using the name george 
bush 
reagan campaigned for bush and the republicans in his weekly 
radio address and he dusted off an old standby from past campaigns 
in personal appearances in michigan and texas 
we need you to ride with us he told a crowd at a rodeo 
center in mesquite texas and if you would i hope youll help 
win just one more for the gipper

republican nominee george bush maintained a 
comfortable lead for the presidency in two national opinion polls 
saturday with michael dukakis slipping a bit after advancing in one 
of them 
bush led by nine points 5243 percent in a cbs newsnew york 
times poll conducted wednesday through friday recouping slightly 
from his sevenpoint lead in a cbs poll finished the day before 
he had led by 12 points in a cbs survey early in the week 
the new cbstimes survey indicated a potential for further 
movement in voter sentiment it found that a quarter of likely 
voters were undecided only leaning or did not rule out changing 
their minds 
still bush has led by six or more points in every poll since 
oct 10 and has been ahead in nearly every survey since he accepted 
his partys nomination at the republican national convention on aug 
18 
the other poll conducted wednesday through friday by louis 
harris and associates put bush ahead by six points 51 percent to 
45 percent that was virtually unchanged from a sevenpoint bush 
lead in a harris poll late last week 
harris polls have had the race a bit closer than others 
even with his lead both new polls found some criticism of bush 
in the cbstimes poll 62 percent said the campaign was more 
negative than usual up from 48 percent a few weeks ago and more 
blamed bush 
in the harris poll 71 percent agreed that bush seems to be 
running down his opponent too much and not discussing the real 
issues 
there were 1252 likely voters in the harris poll 1452 in the 
cbstimes survey both had margins of sampling error of plus or 
minus three percentage points

saudi oil minister hisham nazer on 
saturday called on opec members to fix oil prices for a period of 
two to three years in its search for a way to stabilize the market 
in a statement distributed by the saudi press agency nazer said 
again that saudi arabia will not abide by its opecdecreed 
production quota unless the cartels 12 other members adhered to 
theirs 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has not been 
able to defend its benchmark price of 18 per barrel because its 
member states have been violating their quotas 
opec is set to examine production quotas later this month and 
consider increasing the output ceiling to halt violations 
nazer said he hoped the ministerial meeting scheduled for nov 21 
in vienna would lead to an agreement on a maximum price for a 
period of two or three years under the meticulous surpervision of 
production and prescribed quotas to help remedy the disruption and 
stabilize the market in the interest of all 
he did not suggest any figures 
we look forward with big hope that the forthcoming meeting 
of oil ministers of opec will produce clear firm resolutions that 
define production quotas and the ceiling nazer said 
he added we are surprised at the insistence of some of the 
foreign media to pursue the campaign of distortion and incitement 
against the kingdom 
he apparently referred to recent reports that saudi arabias oil 
production had reached 7 million barrels a day when its daily quota 
was set for 4365 million barrels saudi arabia is opecs largest 
oil exporter and the most powerful force in the cartel 
nazer blamed the chaos in the oil market on nonadherence by 
some member states in opec to the resolutions adopted by the 
organization in geneva december 1986 on production and pricing 
we have repeatedly said and reaffirm today that the kingdom of 
saudi arabia will be the first state to respect adherence to its 
defined quota on condition that all member states in opec abide by 
their quotas in a categoric and decisive manner he said 
we categorically reject that the kingdom alone abide by its 
quota while others exceed theirs

between 500 and 1000 chanting antiku klux 
klan demonstraters celebrated victory saturday before independence 
hall a week after white supremacists called off a rally for the 
same day 
a skirmish between socalled skinheads and the demonstrators 
broke out in front of the federal building near the liberty bell 
but no arrests were made police capt ricard delise said 
the antiklan rally was organized by the partisan defense 
committee to protest the proposed rally by the klan and other white 
supremacist groups the committee held their rally despite the 
klans decision to cancel 
we believe blacks and working people have won a victory and 
forced the kkk and skinheads to back down said jon brooks 
spokesman for the committee the idea of the mobilization was to 
make it as broad as possible anybody who wanted to stop the klan 
was welcome 
brooks said he did not know how many people the new yorkbased 
committee brought to philadelphia but said several buses were used 
speakers led the occasionally rainsoaked crowd in chants of 
hey hey ho ho the ku klux klan has got to go and some people 
milled around carrying signs protesting the klan and some calling 
for a workers revolution 
at least five skinheads showed up for the white pride day 
unaware that the klanorganized rally was called off oct 26 as 
opposition grew 
the skinheads socalled for their closecropped hair wore 
redlaced black combat boots and blue jeans with swastikas and 
american flags pinned to black jackets they were allowed to stand 
just north of the antiklan rally 
we originally came up for the klan rally today since were 
from baltimore we didnt know it was canceled said skinhead 
dennis baranowski we didnt come here to get violent 
he said the skinheads advocate partitioning the country setting 
aside the five northwestern states for whites and the rest for 
blacks 
estimates of the crowd size varied with police counting nearly 
500 protesters and the national park service saying there were 
nearly 1000 on hand 
scores of police patrolled the perimeter of the rally on foot and 
horseback delise would not say how many police were there but park 
superintendent hobart cawood said he had brought in 120 park rangers 
and police from washington to help the 20 park service officers 
stationed in philadelphia 
tours went on as usual at independence hall where the 
constitution was signed and the liberty bell 
it free speech is one of the marks of our country its 
tragic we have to have so many police police and security said

the syrianbacked amal militia and 
proiranian hezbollah said saturday they have agreed to a 
nonkidnapping pact to avoid a military confrontation between the 
two main shiite moslem factions in lebanon 
the pact announced in statements issued by both groups would 
apply to abductions by one group of partisans of the other it would 
not involve the 14 foreign hostages believed held in lebanon 
amal arabic for hope and hezbollah or party of god have been 
locked for years in a bloody struggle for dominance of lebanons one 
million shiites 
the statements issued by the two groups said the agreement was 
sponsored by the command of the syrian army contingent in charge of 
security in beiruts westerm moslem sector 
but sources on both sides speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they doubted the agreement would last despite pressures from 
syria and iran to unify moslem ranks in lebanon 
the syrians sent troops into south beiruts shiite slums may 27 
to halt battles between the two rivals that left about 300 people 
killed and 1000 wounded 
a truce was arranged but it has been strained by more kidnappings 
and the syrian command pressed both factions to sign the new accord 
the statements said the last 17 kidnap victims were exchanged 
under the auspices of syrian army officers after the agreement was 
signed friday night 
the latest effort to end the hezbollahamal feud came after a 
visit to syria by iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati who 
made several calls for unity among lebanons moslem factions and met 
with hezbollah representatives 
these moves appeared to be an effort by both syria and iran to 
counter iraqs recent intervention into lebanese politics arab 
diplomatic sources say the iraqis have sent weapons and ammunition 
to the lebanese forces the christians main military militia since 
a unsponsored ceasefire halted the iraniraq war aug20 iran 
and iraq went to war in september 1980

judges order barring the state from using a law that limits people 
to 10 minutes in the voting booth 
us district judge robert p aguilar in san jose issued a

voters out of the booth and thats not how it was going to be used 
this time he said

scheduled to hear arguments sunday from lawyers representing state 
and county elections agencies and from civil rights lawyers who 
claim the limit disenfranchises those with language difficulties or 
for whom english is a second language

in barring use of the law aguilar called it a virtual literacy 
proficiency test which is specifically outlawed by the federal 
voting rights act 
the temporary restraining order was sought after marin sonoma 
and santa clara counties announced they would rely on the measure to 
speed people through the voting process election officials were 
concerned about a complicated ballot tying up the booths 
the decision to enforce the time limit was especially 
controversial in santa clara county where bilingual ballots are not 
available in the voting booth

presidential ticket a us senator state candidates 29 state

swindall is accused of lying to a grand jury when he said he did 
not remember being told that an 850000 home mortgage loan he was 
seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds 
us attorney robert barr said saturday the justice departments 
office of public integrity in washington dc will handle the 
investigation 
neither of these the office of public integrity nor my office 
is in the habit of wasting our time on frivolous pursuits said 
barr we have asked them to look into it because we believe there 
is something that requires and demands an investigation and they 
obviously feel the same way since they have started the 
investigation 
swindall said the investigation was politically motivated 
i am not going to talk about anything going on in the justice 
department because i intend when i am reelected to investigate 
the entire handling of this matter swindall said 
swindall said the house judiciary committee of which he is a 
member will investigate the matter he declined to say whether any 
of his campaign staff had been subpoenaed in the latest 
investigation

la law character arnie becker might consider 
himself above joining any club that would have him as a member but 
reallife counterparts of the television divorce lawyer decided 
saturday they werent ready to ask him anyway 
against an evershifting legal and social backdrop the american 
academy of matrimonial lawyers scheduled a fourday meeting to 
discuss such weighty matters as custody and surrogacy and the 
economic hardships of nofault divorce for some women 
but tucked between the serious seminars the academy found time 
for a panel discussion entitled arnie becker how real is he 
the elite group also mulled over whether he would make a good 
member 
im not comfortable thinking about arnie or any other character 
strictly as a role model because dramatically thats too limiting 
a standard to hold him to said bill finkelstein an la law 
story editor and producer who writes arnie beckers character 
portrayed by actor corbin bernsen for the popular television show 
finkelstein a lawyer who has put aside his practice while 
working on la law sat in on saturdays panel 
like everybody else arnie has different sides some heroic and 
some anything but heroic arnie has done things that if someone 
i knew in real life had id say what a jerk 
by the same token finkelstein continued hes done some 
things i greatly admire and in this company in dress behavior and 
other measures id say hes basically middle of the pack there are 
a fair share of matrimonial lawyers more flamboyant than arnie 
leonard loeb president of the academy credits arnie beckers 
character with raising public awareness of the legal specialty but 
says its impossible to know whether the character has actually 
influenced members of the profession 
the character is bigger than life but not unreal said loeb 
and were up closer than most people we see the warts and 
freckles we understand many of the things he goes through i 
suppose the jury is still out to what extent the portrayal has 
helped 
the jury returned saturday however with a verdict against arnie 
becker by a vote of 5014 academy members said he should not be 
considered at this time said loeb 
the vote fortunately was nothing more than a honorarium and 
probably wont affect beckers television following besides 
fictional characters cannot join the elite academy which is made up 
of about 1000 of the nations 40000 divorce lawyers the american 
bar associations family law section by contrast has about 16000 
members 
one thing arnie becker has going for him is the perception that 
la law has not only glamorized the business it has encouraged 
more young people to enroll in law school 
enrollment is definitely up said finkelstein but i dont 
know whether that means i get the credit or the blame

some 500 health care professionals have 
vowed that if a california ballot measure forcing them to report 
positive aidstest results becomes law they will defy it a 
spokesman for the group said saturday 
employees at the largest anonymous testing center in san 
francisco also said they would refuse to reveal names of those who 
test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus if proposition 
102 is approved on tuesday 
proposition 102 would ban anonymous testing for the aids virus 
require health officials and others to report the names of people 
reasonably believed to be infected with hiv and require those 
infected with the virus to report the names of their spouse or 
sexual partners insurance companies could also test for the virus 
the bottom line is when police come to our door and ask for the 
names well have to say we will not be accomplices to something 
designed for discrimination said rabbi yoel kahn of congregation 
shaar zahav which operates an outreach to the gay and lesbian 
community in san francisco 
the irresponsibile use of this information can result in people 
losing jobs their health insurance and their homes added kahn 
who fears that as a clergyman he may be required to report those 
carrying the virus 
under the initiative doctors face misdemeanor charges and fines 
of 250 for each patient they fail to report 
despite that dr floyd huen medical director of highland 
hospital in oakland said 50 physicians had signed a pledge not to 
report the names of patients infected with hiv 
i signed it i will not turn over anyone in my practice huen 
said this is bad public health policy because it will keep people 
away from being tested and treatment because of fear that they will 
be reported 
huen said many staff members are considering shredding patient 
records if the initiative passes 
francis salmeri a spokesman for the alternative test site said 
workers have decided if the measure passes they will continue 
offering free anonymous hiv tests 
under no condition will we give out names salmeri said 
supporters of the measure reacted angrily to the pledge program 
i do not think responsible people should ask people to break 
the law said paul mero an aide to rep william dannemeyer of 
fullerton 
dannemeyer cosponsored the initiative with paul gann the tax 
crusader who helped spearhead property taxslashing proposition 13 a 
decade ago and who is now suffering from acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome because of a tainted blood transfusion 
gov george deukmejian provoked an outcry from medical experts 
last week when he announced he would vote for the proposition three 
members of an advisory state aids committee resigned their positions 
in protest 
the governors endorsement prompted us surgeon general c 
everett koop to denounce the measure saying it would set back aids 
research a minimum of five years

president reagan told supporters in the 
lone star state on saturday that even though hes riding off into 
the sunset the reagan era can continue if voters cast their 
ballots for george bush 
reagan pulled out all the sentimental stops as he battled for 
bush on a oneday trip to the battleground states of michigan and 
texas on the final weekend of the presidential campaign michigan 
with 20 electoral votes and texas with 29 are crucial for the 
democrats 
the president appealed directly to conservative democrats in both 
states who could put his vice president over the top in the 
evertightening race against michael dukakis he said this campaign 
is special for him 
the election is in just three days and im on my final campaign 
swing reagan said at a suburban dallas rodeo grounds he said 
although come january im going to be riding off into the 
sunset i feel a little like im on the ballot myself this year 
at the indoor arena reagan arrived in a horsedrawn carriage 
the president clad in a brown suit and waving a gray cowboy hat 
smiled and waved as the crowd hollered 
although not naming him reagan held democrat dukakis up to 
ridicule as the candidate who will take america backwards and 
hailed bush as the man of the future 
america stands on the brink of an era of national greatness 
that will exceed anything that any country on earth has ever known 
before reagan boasted 
only if bush is elected reagan predicted will the nations 
economy continue on the upswing will communism remain in 
retreat and will american culture and technology dominate the 
world 
from televisions dallas to disneyland to the space shuttle 
discovery an entire planet is watching and following us and yes 
america truly is the envy of the world reagan said 
at the rodeo center in mesquite he cautioned aginst complacency 
and overconfidence we need you to vote we need you to ride with 
us and if you would i hope youll help win just one more for the 
gipper and really lets all do this together for america 
the president is set to make a trip to california on monday in an 
attempt to stall any electioneve slide of his home states 47 
electoral votes toward dukakis 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said during the trip back 
to washington late saturday that reagan felt very good about his 
day of campaigning and looks forward to the visit to california 
where the white house finds the race to be a close one 
fitzwater said white house tracking information showed our 
oppositions effort in recent days appears to have leveled off and a 
surge has returned to bush 
and as he has for the past week of crosscountry campaign jaunts 
on bushs behalf reagan said the choice between bush and dukakis is 
a clear one 
at a rally in macomb county community college near detroit 
reagan accused bushs rival of opposing voluntary prayer in school 
supporting gun control and a weakkneed defense policy and 
appointing leftwing judges such as those in a state like 
massachusetts 
thats why im here today to bring home the simple fact that 
all the progress we have made is on the line todays activities are 
part of a getoutthevote campaign and i just want to tell each one 
of you to go to the polls on tuesday and get your friends to go too 
to cast their and your votes for george bush reagan said 
i want to ask those of you some people call reagan democrats to 
join me and come home with me today come home to me and to george 
bush reagan said 
reagan in his weekly taped radio address hailed the vibrant 
and fractious and exciting campaign year 
there is no sight more moving than a lone american walking to 
that voting booth casting a ballot in secret and thereby 
determining the destiny of this great country he said he added 
another plug for bush 
yes my fellow americans there is a choice a very important 
choice a vote for george bush is a vote for optimism its an 
endorsement of what weve done these past eight years and of our 
heartfelt promise that tomorrow and the days to come will be 
brighter still reagan said

george bush tried to rally finalweekend 
support saturday in a rapid series of campaign stops knocking on 
doors working telephones painting signs and declaring let 
someone else sort out all these polls 
in a day of crosscountry campaigning bush dismissed new public 
opinion polls suggesting he was still ahead of democrat michael 
duakakis but by a narrowing margin 
bushs route on saturday in part shadowed campaign stops by 
dukakis as republican strategists sought to blunt the democrats 
concluding campaign blitz 
i dont believe in polls the vice president told reporters 
in clark nj during a morning visit to his union county campaign 
headquarters where he briefly worked a phone bank and got down on 
hands and knees to help children paint campaign signs 
at a rally at immaculata college in the philadelphia suburb of 
malvern bush called pennsylvania with its 25 electoral votes 
critical it can go either way i am going to work not just here 
but all across the country from this coast to the west coast we 
are not going to be outhustled by the liberal governor from 
massachusetts 
earlier bush told reporters in new jersey let someone else 
sort out all these polls 
but he also added do i feel ive got a good shot at winning 
absolutely but im not going to turn things around at the last 
moment and try to lighten up 
we cant go any further or work any harder bush said 
the vice president and his entourage also walked doortodoor 
along a leafy street of an affluent neighborhood in westfield nj 
near newark calling on people in three houses and urging them to 
vote for him 
the invasion squad hitting your beautiful home bush joked 
at the first home he visited 
we were overwhelmed to say the least said sherry rogers 
after bush visited her and her husband tom rogers she said the 
majority of the neighborhood was very probush 
he also planned a getoutthe vote street walk in peoria ill 
before heading to colorado on sunday bush was to campaign in 
california and then head back east again for more campaigning in 
the midwest before ending on monday in texas 
as saturdays campaign activities drew to a close bush told 
reporters aboard his plane were in the highest degree of 
tension sometimes i get extraordinarily tired but its 
understandable 
sometimes i sleep sometimes i dont he continued its 
the total tension 
bush campaign officials kept making last minute schedule changes 
based on overnight polls and taking into account dukakis 
movements 
at the new jersey campaign office bush was endorsed by a handful 
of democratic municipal and union officials from nearby comunities 
i will try if im elected to be a fairplay president in 
terms of the working men and women in this country and in terms of 
labor itself he told campaign workers afterward 
meanwhile the bush camp shrugged off a cbs poll released friday 
indicating his doubledigit lead of a week ago was shrinking to 
seven points from 12 a survey released saturday by the network 
showed bush increasing the lead to nine points 5243 
his wife barbara said i dont believe the polls we take our 
own polls and ours look all right mrs bush who rode one leg of 
saturdays campaign swing on the plane chartered by news 
organizations added we are all very tired 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate said the campaign was constantly 
shifting its schedule to shore up support in key battleground states 
and to attempt to outmaneuver dukakis 
bush and mrs bush also walked down the main street of 
chillicothe ill in a cold drizzle giving thumbsup signs and 
shaking hands with many of the several thousand townspeople who 
lined both sides of the street 
he vowed in a speech in front of the town fire station as he has 
done for days to run as if i was ten points back 
bush praised the town as middle america with the strongest 
values that exist 
meanwhile a senior bush campaign official who spoke only on the 
condition of anonymity said that shadowing dukakis was one 
aspect of bushs strategy in his final drive 
its a complicated strategy the official said you bracket 
him dukakis you checkmate him you fuzz up his message by using 
his own language against him 
craig fuller bushs chiefofstaff said colorado the next 
stop was a state where bush had been firmly ahead but in which the 
race has tightened 
he said bushs remaining travel was being guided entirely from 
washington by campaign chairman james a baker iii campaign manager 
lee atwater and pollster robert teeter 
my colleagues in washington are cool and cautious they are 
concerned when there is any signs of shrinkage fuller said 
campaign officials meanwhile said two new ads would be aired 
nationally through monday 
alixe glen a campaign official said both were positive ads one 
a photo composite with singercomposer lee greenwood singing god

employers fearing penalties under the new federal 
immigration law are discriminating against legal aliens and us 
citizens who appear to be foreigners according to a study 
the study conducted by the new york task force on immigration 
affairs confirmed fears expressed by experts who said the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 would result in 
discriminatory behavior against certain workers 
the report which was to be released monday found that many 
employers were still unfamiliar with provisions of the new law and 
that some simply refuse to consider job applicants who look or sound 
foreign 
it is clear from our data that the scope of these 
discriminatory practices is broad the task force panel said 
the panel estimated that more than 22000 us citizens or aliens 
authorized to work were either temporarily denied work or not 
hired by an employer in the state 
the act offered amnesty to eligible aliens until may 4 of this 
year and starting in june called for stiff fines and other 
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens 
the task force based its study on 400 randomly placed telephone 
calls last month to employers in new york 
the federal general accounting office which is required by 
congress to investigate evidence of employer discrimination 
concerning the law is expected to release its own report on monday

michael dukakis campaigning in southern 
texas on saturday accused his republican opponents of big brother 
tactics aimed at intimidating hispanics and discouraging them from 
voting 
he called on republican george bush to apologize and to halt 
radio commercials airing along the mexican border that democrats 
allege may discourage qualified minority voters from going to the 
polls 
if you believe as we believe that the right to vote freely and 
without intimidation is the most sacred right we have as americans 
im sure you share my anger at these republican radio commercials 
dukakis said 
the only purpose for those ads is to scare voters into not 
voting dukakis said these big brother tactics have no 
place in america have no place in texas this is not a 
dictatorship this is a democracy 
dukakis waging an intensive final weekend of campaigning before 
tuesdays presidential election spoke to several thousand people at 
an evening rally outside the hidalgo county courthouse 
making a final push to carry texas where he trails in the polls 
dukakis flew to this town in southernmost texas rio grande valley 
it was near mcallen the home of running mate lloyd bentsen and 
where dukakis made his first stop following his nomination at the 
democratic convention in july 
advertisement being aired in the heavily hispanic area remind 
listeners it is illegal for noncitizens to vote and say election 
officials will be on guard the ads mention possible jail terms 
and fines 
the us justice department said thursday it would look into 
possible intimidation 
i think its time that mr bush repudiated those ads and 
stopped them and apologized to you dukakis said 
earlier saturday dukakis spoke to a large crowd in rock island 
ill and said of the republicans they were taking you for 
granted 
later in lansing mich dukakis accused bush of campaigning on 
lies and just plain garbage and said i think the american 
people are fed up with the republican campaign theyre fed up with 
the negativism and the falsehoods and the misrepresentations 
dukakis fastpaced schedule took him from illinois to michigan 
to texas to colorado on the last saturday of his presidential 
campaign at each stop he declared that large and enthusiastic 
crowds were a sign that despite his deficit in public opinion 
polls he was overtaking bush 
do i smell victory in the air he said you can feel it and 
sense it and taste it 
dukakis spoke to a crowd gathered inside an airport baggage room 
in lansing before flying to the detroit suburb of taylor hundreds 
more stood outside in the rain and dukakis sprinted through the 
rain to shake hands and greet those who waited in the downpour 
the democrat heaped fresh scorn on gop vice presidential 
candidate dan quayle bush had said in a television interview with 
david frost that if elected he might put quayle in charge of the 
white house crisis management group 
dan quayle dukakis said in charge of managing the most 
serious crises we face in the country thats a frightening thing 
isnt it 
in rock island the massachusetts governor depicted bush as a 
child of privilege who as president would benefit only the most 
wealthy 
he wants to make the rich in this country even richer 
dukakis said 
were on the side of people who live off the family budget not 
the family fortune he said 
dukakis appeared on the stage at a rock island exhibition hall 
with a man wearing a mask that looked like former president richard 
nixon sen tom harkin of nearby iowa compared bush to that former 
president who resigned in disgrace 
just as there was no new richard nixon in 1968 there is no new 
george bush in 1988 harkin said 
dukakis repeated his claim that his campaign is coming back 
hes coasting and were fighting back he said hes slipping 
and were surging 
dukakis buoyed by a cbs news poll showing a narrowing margin 
with bush was campaigning at a frenetic pace in the final days to 
the election 
he flew to rock island from chicago and from there flew to 
michigan for rallies in lansing and detroit 
he was flying on to denver late in the evening and was heading to 
the west coast on sunday 
dukakis was spending nearly every available moment in search of 
votes he planned a day of campaigning in california on monday and a 
middleofthenight rally in iowa on his redeye flight home to 
boston to vote and await the returns aides were considering a final 
stop in ohio too on the way home 
the cbs poll released friday night showed dukakis trailing bush 
by 7 percentage points down from 12 points just three days earlier 
campaign aides contended their own polling had the race close in 
battleground states although democratic party officials said he 
remained well behind in ohio

a graduate student suspected of creating a 
virus that invaded computer nerve centers nationwide started 
playing with computers in his teens and has been fascinated with 
them since his father said saturday 
but robert morris sr a top government computersecurity expert 
refused to comment on whether his son robert morris jr 23 
concocted the virus that clogged an estimated 6000 military and 
university machines 
at any rate he said the episode may prevent a serious security 
breach in the future 
its going to be remembered for a long time said the elder 
morris chief scientist at the national computer security center in 
bethesda md and i think well see a substantial improvement in 
the way computers and networks are administered 
in an interview at their home in arnold about 25 miles southeast 
of baltimore roberts mother anne morris said her son got his 
first summer job working with computers when he was 15 and a series 
of similar summer jobs followed 
as children all three of the morris youngsters read a science 
fiction book called shock wave rider that was the first 
publication to raise questions about computer viruses in his own 
mind 
that was one of the most tattered books in our kids room 
mrs morris said 
both parents said their son is a likable attractive young man 
who is highly skilled with computers 
the elder morris said the virus episode will clearly raise the 
awareness of the existing vulnerabilities particularly of network 
systems 
morris also said he felt ambivalent about the incident 
im close to this in two ways he said i myself am a 
computer user but im also a father that makes it difficult to 
separate the two roles although of course they have to be 
separated 
morris said he is convinced the virus was unleashed accidentally 
it seems there was no malicious intent involved no harm was 
intended or actually done in the host computers other than 
overload and that appears to be a design error he said 
however he said both he and his son are taking steps to obtain 
legal representation 
morris who attends cornell university in ithaca ny could not 
be reached for comment saturday his roommate said morris did not 
come home friday and she did not know where he was university 
officials also were unable to contact him lynn said 
morris sr said his son is simply unavailable and will 
remain unavailable until he has time to retain a lawyer

a cornell university graduate student whose 
father is a top government computersecurity expert is suspected of 
creating the virus that slowed thousands of computers 
nationwide school officials said saturday 
robert t morris jr 23 a firstyear student in a doctorate 
computer science program has a reputation as an expert computer 
hacker and is skilled enough to have written the rogue program 
cornell instructor dexter kozen said 
the new york times quoted sources as saying morris created the 
virus which on wednesday night began infecting an estimated 6000 
university and military computers connected through the arpanet 
computer network established by the pentagon 
the virus slowed down computers by replicating itself over and 
over and taking up memory space but it is not believed to have 
destroyed any data 
the origin of such programs is hard to investigate and it may be 
impossible to trace the virus back to morris said m stuart lynn 
vice president of information technologies at cornell 
at this stage were simply not in a position to determine if 
the allegations are true lynn said at a news conference he said 
he did not know how long the investigation would take 
its quite conceivable we may not be able to say with any 
certainty if the virus was created in cornells computer system 
he said 
he said the university had been contacted by the fbi but there 
was no indication any criminal charges would be filed officials 
said the school could discipline morris if he was involved 
the fbi said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determine 
whether federal law had been violated 
morris could not be reached for comment saturday his roommate 
chansong da said morris did not come home friday and she did not 
know where he was university officials also were unable to contact 
him lynn said 
reached at his home saturday in arnold md robert t morris 
sr chief scientist at the national computer security center in 
bethesda md would not say where his son was 
morris told the washington post his son is simply unavailable 
and will remain unavailable until he has time to retain a 
lawyer 
morris sr said he met with fbi agents for about an hour saturday 
to explain why his son will not immediately comply with their 
request he said the family has had preliminary discussions with an 
attorney and expects to hire one by monday 
morris said he is in regular contact with his son and that they 
have discussed the allegations 
i certainly will not report anything of our conversations he 
said i am simply not in a position to deny or confirm the 
allegations i have no direct knowledge 
a federal law enforcement official confirmed saturday that the 
fbi is attempting to determine what role morris son may have played 
in creating the virus the inquiry is rapidly developing right 
now the official said 
the elder morris has written widely on the security of the unix 
operating system the target of his sons virus program the times 
reported he is widely known for writing a program to decipher 
passwords which give users access to computers 
cornell officials said they began examining morris computer 
files friday night after the times identified him 
morris had passwords in his files for some computers at cornell 
and stanford to which he is not entitled although those could 
have been placed there by someone else lynn said 
a computer file dated oct 26 found in cornells system saturday 
is the earliest indication that morris may have been writing the 
program that spawned the virus lynn said 
the times reported in its sunday editions that friends of morris 
said he quickly realized the virus program was out of hand and that 
he arranged for a friend to send out instructions oh how to 
eradicate the virus 
the instructions however were posted on a socalled electronic 
bulletin board that few people would see the newspaper said 
the purpose of the virus program was to spread a tiny program 
throughout the country and the rest of the world and have it 
secretly take up residence in computers memories the paper said 
the program was to always hide in the background to escape 
detection 
it probably wasnt a malicious act said dean krafft research 
associate in computer science at cornell 
it would have been extremely simple to take this virus 
structure one step further so that it was extremely destructive 
krafft said with a couple more lines in the program it could 
have wiped out files in all 6000 computers 
the computers affected by the virus all used the unix 43 
operating system program a modification of the unix system 
developed by atampt that was produced by the university of california 
at berkeley unix operating systems are the most popular software 
for workstation and medium sized computers 
if it was morris he apparently found a gaping hole in the 
system that im amazed no one exploited before kozen said while 
the loophole in the system was not evident before the virus was 
unleashed in retrospect its really quite obvious 
he is reputed to be a good hacker and i guess this would be 
the proof of it if its found that he did cause the virus kozen 
said 
bob ford a spokesman for bell laboratories said the younger 
morris worked in the companys computing science research center at 
murray hill during the summers of 1983 and 1984 and that his job 
included writing computer programs 
the times quoted computer scientists as saying one of morris 
projects at atampt was rewriting security software for most computers 
that run the unix system 
the summers were before and after morris freshman year at 
harvard university where he received his undergraduate degree ford 
said morris lived in millington nj at the time 
from what i hear he is extremely bright obviously ford 
said the code he worked on was intended for internal use only 
the programs were not intended for use outside of bell labs 
ford said the elder morris worked at bell labs at murray hill and 
whippany for 26 years before retiring in 1986 
some computer centers were forced to disconnect from arpanet and 
shut computers down but by friday most reported that the virus had 
been eradicated 
however at the university of illinois researchers decided 
friday evening to pull off arpanet for the duration 
this virus has too many skills and its not worth the risk 
said paul pomes a research programmer at the school experts there 
thought they had defeated the virus only to find that the system 
had been reinfected 
some researchers said the virus had several variations and that 
it was making an effort to capture passwords and break the super 
user code which allows a user to work on a system with no 
restrictions at all 
despite his reputation as a hacker morris was an average student 
who kept to himself according to faculty and fellow students 
i havent seen too much of him in my course kozen said 
hes said to be brilliant but thats directed to a certain area 
and that area is not his classes i get the feeling he doesnt waste 
too much time on homework but put him at a keyboard and hes a 
whiz

the rev al sharpton led a group of emotional 
speakers saturday in a call for the arrest of mayor w wilson goode 
and others for their part in the 1985 move bombing 
attorney alton maddox jr would not be specific about the groups 
plans to protest the lack of indictments by two grand juries but he 
said he sharpton and others would continue speaking out until 
officials who directed the police siege of the groups fortified 
west philadelphia row house are convicted 
the person who called for the bombing must be arrested 
immediately indicted immediately and convicted immediately and the 
first person who must go to jail is wilson goode maddox said 
a philadelphia county grand jury and a federal grand jury both 
decided not to return any indictments in the may 1985 bombing which 
started a fire that left 11 people dead in the move house and 
destroyed 61 homes 
earlier in the week sharpton said a lawsuit would be filed on 
behalf of louise james and laverne simms whose brother move leader 
john africa died in the confrontation ms james owned the move 
house but did not live there at the time of the bombing the 
rebuilt house has since been confiscated 
maddox would not say whether there are definite plans to file 
suit but said he and sharpton are seeking a congressional inquiry 
into the bombing 
goode declined extensive comment after the federal grand jury 
released its findings saying at the time two grand juries have 
fully investigated this matter and have reached a point of no 
criminality involved for that i am pleased 
neither goode nor his press secretary karen warrington could be 
reached for comment saturday night neither has a listed phone 
number 
the same grand jury system that has plagued us in new york and 
rendered a very racist and nazilike verdict in the tawana brawley 
case has even more so returned a ruthless verdict to these two 
women sharpton said referring to ms james and ms simms 
sharpton and maddox have served as advisers to miss brawley 16 
who was found last fall with dog feces spread on her and racial 
slurs scratched in her skin she said she had been abducted and 
raped by six white men some of whom were flashing policelike 
badges a new york grand jury recently ruled miss brawley who 
refused to testify before the panel fabricated the story 
sharpton and the others spoke to about 100 people at a west 
philadelphia nightclub saturday 
ms james began sobbing when she recalled identifying the bodies 
of her son and brother who died in the move bombing 
there were two gurneys one with what was left of my son and on 
another a torso no head no legs she said 
she chastised philadelphia residents for not coming to her aid in 
the three years since the bombing and said it was a shame she had to 
go to new york to find a champion for her cause in sharpton 
sharpton said he is just now stepping forward on the issue 
because the federal grand jury declined to issue an indictment in 
september

president reagan on saturday exercised a pocket 
veto of legislation that would have limited advertising during 
childrens tv shows and required stations to provide informative 
programming for youngsters 
the president said in a statement that while he supports efforts 
to improve the quality of childrens programs this bill simply 
cannot be reconciled with the freedom of expression secured by our 
constitution 
the bill which passed the senate on a voice vote in october and 
the house by a 32878 margin in june would have reimposed 
advertising limits abandoned by the federal communications 
commission four years ago the fcc had said the marketplace itself 
could best regulate commercials 
while i applaud efforts to increase the amount and quality of 
childrens television programming the constitution simply does not 
empower the federal government to oversee the programming decisions 
of broadcasters in the manner prescribed by this bill reagan said 
in his statement 
childrens tv advocates had pressed for passage of the 
legislation maintaining that under the fccs philosophy of 
deregulation advertising during childrens shows has increased and 
the quality of the programs has deteriorated 
peggy charren president of the cambridge massbased action for 
childrens television which has pushed for the bill for 20 years 
said the veto was another example of ideological child abuse in 
the reagan administration 
the ultimate effect of the veto is that we will continue to 
have a broadcast industry that spends all its time figuring how to 
benefit from children instead of how to benefit children she said 
the bill would have limited commercials in childrens program to 
10 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on 
weekdays stations would have had until 1990 to comply with the 
advertising limits 
it also would have required stations to serve the educational 
and information needs of children in their overall programming 
the fcc would evaluate those efforts in considering whether to renew 
stations licenses 
reagan in his veto message said that conditioning license 
renewals upon the federal governments determination as to the 
adequacy of a licensees programming would violate the first 
amendment 
it would inhibit broadcasters from offering innovative programs 
that do not fit neatly into regulatory categories and discourage the 
creation of programs that might not satisfy the tastes of agency 
officials responsible for considering license renewals he said 
fcc chairman dennis patrick had said the legislation was 
unnecessary and illadvised particularly because the commission 
was considering taking action on its own related to the 
commercialization of childrens television 
the legislation was a bipartisan compromise that had been 
stripped of a proposal to prohibit programs that feature toy 
manufacturers products critics call such shows programlength 
commercials 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters which helped craft the compromise said of the bill 
while we recognize this legislation charted some new territory we 
were willing to accept its outcome 
frankly we expected the president to sign it fritts said 
under any circumstances we are very sensitive to our 
responsibility to provide quality programming to children and we 
will continue to do so with or without legislation 
reagan also signed a number of other measures that won 
legislative approval in the waning days of the 100th congress 
a law banning the sale of lawn darts a game that is blamed for 
the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands of others 
the bill requires the consumer product safety commission to carry 
out the ban which is moving to do so on its own 
the socalled bork bill designed to protect the privacy of 
video store customers by prohibiting the unauthorized release of 
information about what tapes they rent or purchase 
the bill grew out of last years hearings on the nomination of 
robert h bork to the supreme court during the deliberations a 
weekly newspaper in washington dc obtained and published the 
video rental records of bork whose nomination ultimately was 
rejected by the senate 
a law banning the shipment of reallooking toy guns and of 
imitation guns unless they have a blaze orange plug in the barrel 
the law was enacted in part because of shootings in which imitations 
were mistaken for real weapons 
a law extending for two years the temporary authority for cash 
awards by inspectors general to federal employees whose disclosures 
of fraud and mismanagement result in cost savings to the government 
a law designating certain lands and waters in pettaquamscutt 
cove ri a national wildlife refuge

with copper at recordhigh prices near 150 a pound you could 
convert your life savings to pennies sell them as scrap and pocket 
a nice piece of change right 
wrong 
the economics of the recycling business aside youd have to melt 
nearly 73 worth of todays pennies to extract a pound of copper 
according to the us mint todays pennies are 25 percent copper 
and 975 percent zinc 
pre1982 pennies are 95 percent copper but at 181 pennies to the 
pound even the copperrich oldies wont be worth more than their 
face value unless coppers value surpasses 192 and it might 
some analysts are even talking about 2 copper which does not 
seem farfetched considering the metals dramatic gains over the 
past two years in november 1986 copper for spot delivery on new 
yorks commodity exchange was worth about 60 cents a pound spot 
copper closed friday on the comex at 149 
many experts expect the worldwide copper shortage caused by 
lagging production and labor disputes to persist until the second 
half of 1989 which means copper likely will remain a bull market 
for some time 
but there are ways other than pennypinching to profit from it 
unlike the array of investment vehicles available for precious 
metals investing in copper is pretty much limited to futures 
stocks and the physical copper market 
copper futures are traded on the comex in 25000pound lots 
futures traders agree to buy and sell these huge amounts of copper 
for future delivery but they almost always cash out of the market 
before the delivery date 
smallinvestor participation in the copper futures market has 
surged in the past year and continues to grow said james steel 
metalsmarket analyst with refco inc a large chicagobased 
commodities brokerage firm 
a lot of small traders have picked up on this market he 
said the number keeps growing he said as the market continues 
to throw out more and more bullish signals 
trading in copper stocks also has increased said david burgher 
an analyst with barrett day securities inc in new york 
shares of phoenix arizbased phelps dodge corp the worlds 
largest copper producer reached an alltime high of 4950 this 
past week on the new york stock exchange after beginning the year at 
3250 burgher said 
asarco inc another large us copper producer is trading 
around 2950 after hitting a low of 2937 earlier this year he 
said 
between the worldwide shortage and the 2weekold copper miners 
strike in peru i think copper is going to go much higher 
burgher said 
copper recycling is also on the rise the institute of the scrap 
recycling industry a washingtonbased trade association estimated 
that the amount of copper recovered from scrap will rise about 5 
percent this year to 3314 million tons from 3152 million tons in 
1987 
industrial scrap accounts for the bulk of copper recycling but 
backyard recyclers also are getting into the act said norm 
schroeder associate editor of american metal market a daily 
newspaper of the scrap metal industry 
theres been an increase in the collection of obsolete copper 
scrap old electrical wire copper tubing schroeder said 
people like electricians and plumbers save it and sell it when the 
price gets high and the markets real right right now 
but several scrap brokers contacted by the associated press said 
they had no interest in recycling pennies 
its barely worth stooping over to pick up a penny said

as voters head to the polls to elect a new 
president the treasury department will be at the auction block 
peddling 30 billion in new securities to replenish the governments 
coffers 
up for sale to wall streets biggest brokers and later to be 
sold by them to the public are 19 billion in three and 10year 
notes and 11 billion of 37day cash management bills 
but absent again from the threeday quarterly refinancing 
schedule which begins on election day is the 30year bond 
as was the case in the previous auction the government lacked 
the authority to issue any more long bonds however the treasury 
hopes to sell 9 billion of them later this month or early in 
december after president reagan signs an authorizing tax bill 
proceeds from the electionweek sale will be used toward raising 
22 billion in new cash and refinancing 168 billion in old debt 
part of the 26 trillion national debt 
economists are split as to how the auction might go since it 
comes at a time of great uncertainty as the nation elects a new 
leader and interest rates continue to rise 
most though agree that yields will have to be high enough to 
attract domestic and foreign money 
i think the yield levels will be more attractive from an 
investors standpoint said f ward mccarthy chief financial 
economist for merrill lynch capital markets 
and if his forecast is correct that interest rates will ease up 
after the election that should be especially sweet for buyers at 
this quarters auction but patience has to be exhibited he 
warned 
economists agree a potential saving grace of the auction will be 
the absence of the 30year bond 
too many things are happening and none of them are good for 
bonds said robert a brusca chief financial economist for nikko 
securities co international 
not having a long bond is probably a great help because its a 
highrisk piece of paper and hard to adjust so quickly in front of 
changing economic circumstances 
the bellwether 30year bond plunged in value and its rate soared 
friday after the government reported that the nations october 
unemployment rate fell 01 percentage points to 53 percent the 
lowest level since may 1984 
the credit markets were unnerved by the fact the report showed 
employers added 325000 new jobs last month an indication that the 
manufacturing sector of the economy remains strong and higher 
inflation may not be far behind 
but some economists argue the markets have overreacted a bit 
there are two sides to this economy said david resler chief 
economist for nomura securities international inc the production 
side is rolling along at a good clip but there are signs that 
point to a slowdown in demand from the consumer sector and that 
should prevent inflation 
still he and others concede whatever voters decide at the polls 
can change even the bestprepared economic forecasts

the dollars summer radiance has turned as pale 
as the withered lateautumn leaves 
pessimism about the dollars outlook intensified this past week 
not only because of evidence the economy is slowing down but also 
over uncertainties about the monetary policies of the next 
president whoever he may be 
although the dollar rose friday on surprisingly strong october 
employment figures reported by the labor department many currency 
strategists said they believe the dollars value will continue to 
erode 
this assessment represents a shift from about three weeks ago in 
how the world viewed the dollar which was strong and resilient 
through the summer and part of the fall 
the selling pressure hurt the dollar especially in the beginning 
of the week despite efforts by the central banks of japan and the 
united states to stem the weakness by purchasing dollars in the 
foreign exchange markets 
much of the reason lies in government economic statistics that 
point to a slowdown in what had been a modestly expanding economy 
late last month for example the commerce department said 
thirdquarter growth slowed to 22 percent the lowest in nearly two 
years last tuesday the department said its index of leading 
indicators forecasting gauge fell 01 percent in september the 
third drop in five months 
this suggested that the federal reserve the us central bank 
would not be forced to preempt inflation by raising interest rates 
such a move at least in the short term would have boosted the 
dollars value by making dollardenominated investments worth more 
after trading at about 130 japanese yen and more than 185 west 
german marks in the middle of october the dollar has since fallen 
to about 125 yen a nearly 4 percent decline and 179 marks a 32 
percent drop 
i think you have to say concern about the economy is the main 
reason said stephen leach currency analyst for chemical bank in 
new york 
when you go back to the summer and say why was the dollar 
strong it was because of relatively high interest rates and 
expectations of higher interest rates to come he said now 
people are coming around to the view that we havent been getting 
higher rates and perhaps getting lower rates 
another important reason for the dollars most recent 
depreciation is the tuesday presidential election many strategists 
say 
although most believe republican george bush will win over 
democrat michael dukakis both candidates have offered only vague 
ideas for how to reduce americas swollen trade and budget deficits 
key areas of concern that have battered the dollars value in the 
past 
everybody is bearish on the dollar said william harrington 
senior foreign exchange analyst at the wefa group an economic 
forecasting concern in bala cynwyd pa 
earlier financial markets would have viewed a bush victory as 
much more of a boost for the dollar and the capital markets now 
theyre not so sure harrington said were not hearing 
convincing stories on either side on how the deficits will be 
reduced 
even if bush were to promote a sound plan for reducing the 
deficits harrington said a democratic congress will be ready to 
give george bush back his own they are going to resist legislation 
he proposes 
though a dukakis victory is considered increasingly remote the 
dollar likely would tumble if he won largely because his 
supervision over the unwieldy us economy is untested other 
currency strategists said 
at this point bush is more of a known commodity whereas a 
dukakis administration is a total unknown said thomas f 
carpenter vice president and chief economist for asb capital 
management a washingtonbased investment advisory service even 
the people in a dukakis administration wouldnt be sure how theyd 
manage policy if they got in 
despite the prevalent view that the dollar will decline 
carpenter said the friday unemployment report showing joblessness 
hit a 14year low of 53 percent last month may have diluted some of 
the pessimism about the currency and at least keep it stable for a 
while beyond the election 
everybody involved in pricing financial assets all bought the 
slowdown thesis he said what remains now if youre an 
optimist is that the economys doing well not booming not 
weakening

the arrival of november plunged the stock market 
from a raging fever into a cold sweat 
in the wake of takeover fever which swept through wall 
street in octobers final days a chill settled in this past week 
when the market began to nervously count down the days until 
tuesdays presidential election 
many institutional investors clung to the sidelines leaving the 
field to professionals and putting a damper on trading volume 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials barely stirred all week 
finishing with a net loss of 409 points at 214580 
although wall street expects george bush its favored candidate 
to win theres been enough uncertainty to keep investors on edge 
political pollwatching seems to have replaced technical 
chartwatching for the moment 
the market came to life briefly on thursday when the shaky 
dollar stabilized and the dow average brushed against the 2178 mark 
before ending the day at 217034 
then on friday new unemployment data showing surprising strength 
in the economy drove the bluechip indicator down 2454 points the 
government reported that the nations jobless rate fell to 53 
percent in october the lowest level in 14 years as the economy 
created more than 300000 jobs 
through most of the week anticipation of the jobless data had 
given the market another thing to worry about and deepened its 
preelection anxiety 
people sort of threw in the towel for this week said philip 
puccio a senior vice president of dillon read amp co 
once the hoopla of the election is over wall street probably 
will pick up where it left off before the takeover frenzy hit 
worrying about interest rates 
early in the week many observers had been expecting the federal 
reserve to keep credit policy and interest rates stable in the near 
future recent signs that the economy is slowing and inflationary 
pressures are easing would make the fed loathe to push interest 
rates higher they believed 
that view gained credence monday when martha r seger a member 
of the feds board of governors estimated that the us economy has 
slowed in the third quarter and will grow by 1 percent to 2 percent 
next year 
seger told the economic club of detroit that recent economic data 
have allayed fears of rekindled inflation 
but a recent slide in the dollar raised concern that the central 
bank could nudge interest rates higher to bolster the us currency 
although the dollar steadied late in the week the fear of higher 
rates was rekindled by fridays unemployment figures 
the level of shortterm interest rates remains the most 
important likely determinant of stock prices says robert j 
nurock publisher of the astute investor newletter out of paoli pa 
lower shortterm rates would help stimulate business 
besides the stagnant dow other readings for the week showed the 
new york stock exchange composite index down 138 at 15570 the 
nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market down 175 at 
38102 and the american stock exchange market value index off 228
