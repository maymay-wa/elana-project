spill has killed about 27000 sea birds and the death toll can be 
expected to increase for at least a few more months the us fish amp 
wildlife service said 
we just dont know how long its going to go on said vivian 
mendenhall marine bird coordinator at the agencys anchorage office 
she said the numbers of dead birds being found has dropped off 
since the initial fatalities after the tanker struck a reef in 
prince william sound on march 24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons 
of crude oil spilled into the sea 
in general seabirds over water cannot detect oil and do not 
discriminate between clean places and dirty places in deciding where 
to touch down mendenhall said 
figures released friday by a federal information office in valdez 
show 563 of 1326 seabirds received alive at rescue centers have 
been released nearly 600 have died at the facilities

said

ballet goers who werent pleased that the kirov 
ballet opened its us tour here monday with the unfamiliar le 
corsaire could rejoice friday night when the wellknown 
giselle was danced like a beautiful poem 
farukh ruzimatov thus far the most impressive dancer in this 
highcaliber company danced count albrecht it is thrilling to see 
an artist so secure in his technique that he never has to press but 
lets his art flow with time to present subtleties 
ruzimatov looked noble in features and bearing but so did gennadi 
babanin as the woodsman hilarion so it was plausible that giselle 
would accept the count as rural and fall in love with him ruzimatov 
made count albrecht really in love with giselle his partnering of 
her was gentle and attentive when his royal fiancee arrives he 
walks with her with ill grace instead of immediately ditching 
giselle for her as some do when dancing the count 
and ruzimatov made some sudden very exciting bursts into 
dramatic dancing 
zhanna ayupova danced giselle she was good but not riveting 
early in act 1 but she made her mad scene unusually poignant and 
she was exquisite in act 2 as the ghost of herself the 
gisellealbrecht duets were tenderly emotional all the principal 
dancers conveyed the emotions of the characters they danced 
the corps de ballet dancing was shimmering accurate but soft 
without the sharp edge that the word accurate can convey this 
production isnt afraid to have the orchestra playing in act 2 with 
nobody on stage which strongly builds anticipation 
there are moments from this exceptional giselle to cherish 
and remember 
after the kirov ballet closes at the metropolitan opera july 22 
it will appear at kennedy center in washington july 25 to aug 6 
the war memorial opera house in san francisco aug 9 to 16 and 
orange county performing arts center costa mesa calif aug 18 to 
27

anne droid looks like a typical mannequin except 
for an unusual twinkle in one eye that twinkle means anne droid can 
see you she can also hear and even remember 
anne droid is a surveillance mannequin designed to watch for 
shoplifters an idea that has caught the eye of some retailers 
my wife is a jeweler says f jerry gutierrez anne droids 
creator we were in a jewelry store and they had a tv monitor set 
up but i couldnt find the camera then the jeweler showed me this 
tiny thing and i thought my god that would fit in a mannequin 
at the time gutierrezs job was to restore mannequins a 
business he started when he was laid off as a carpenter 
now the 40yearold gutierrez has designed a line of mannequins 
with builtin cameras and microphones which he hopes business 
owners will use to fight shoplifting 
gutierrez inserts a miniature camera behind a mannequin eye and 
the image is projected on a monitor that can be viewed privately 
for sound a microphone is placed in one nostril everything the 
mannequin sees or hears can be recorded on videotape 
its got a perspective no other surveillance system has said 
eric freehling who owns odyssey jewelry and watch out watches in 
denver 
he said when he first heard about gutierrezs mannequins he was 
interested only in getting one for his store 
i thought it was a heck of an idea freehling says then i 
realized he didnt have as much of a business background as he 
needed to get off the ground with my cpa background and a lot of 
experience in retail i told him id see if i could help 
a partnership developed as did a spinoff from the mannequin 
restoration business called anne droid security systems freehling 
pitched in 115000 to help launch it 
basic security mannequins cost about 2400 not including extras 
like a timelapse vcr gutierrez said 
one gentleman travels a lot and he wants to have a male 
mannequin that would watch television to give the appearance 
someone is home he said if that wasnt a deterrent the 
mannequin would double as security for him by recording anyone 
entering the room 
gutierrez said he has an order for 10 mannequins from a major 
denver retailer but wouldnt give the companys name and did not say 
how many hes sold altogether 
this is covert surveillance he explained some businesses 
dont want the customers to know they are being watched 
shoplifting and employee theft cost the nation 508 billion 
annually said detective gail riddell who heads the denver police 
shoplifting unit 
i think its an interesting idea said susan henderson owner 
of bikboks a store in a tony denver shopping district she has 
ordered a male anne droid for delivery in the fall and plans to use 
it for nighttime surveillance

her new breed leaving them hungry and weak before long mrs 
ferguson said saber began snooping around the kittens and acting 
kind of goofy 
before the fergusons knew it saber stepped in and took over 
when mrs ferguson tried to put the kittens in with their natural 
mother her husband gordy said saber just went berserk

residents weary of wending their way through 
sewer construction will grab plungers and kazoos for some 
lighthearted fun at a sewerfest later this month 
it started out as one of those hokey things said jan pierce 
a coordinator of the event i havent laughed so much in ages 
putting it together we hope the community will have some fun with 
it 
since last year barricaded streets have forced oberlin motorists 
to take inconvenient routes and the rough roads have rattled car 
alignments construction is set for fall completion 
ms pierce said she had to buy three new tires because of the 
rough going on streets along construction sites 
we dont know from day to day how the streets will go said 
ms pierce its frustrating we all feel it on a personal level 
the twoday sewerfest sponsored by the oberlin downtown 
merchants association features a parade july 21 with jackhammers a 
dump truck and the city sewercleaning machine and a kazoo marching 
band with people dressed in sewercleaning uniforms 
residents are invited to submit essays on their worst war 
story because of the construction with a 250 prize for the 
winning entry the essays will be bound and given to the librarys 
community history department 
oberlin police chief robert jones said officers who often got the 
complaints for the blocked and tornup streets can laugh it off 
during the festival 
policemen are always at the brunt of all the complaints 
jones said you get used to it and just smile the humorous idea 
of sewerfest was quite refreshing 
the festival he said will be a way to let out the 
frustrations people have been going through

charter boat captain frank mundus said to 
be the inspiration for the shark fisherman in the movie jaws 
has for years wrestled fearlessly with the mightiest of the seas 
but now the 63yearold folk hero has a new challenge after 45 
years on the water he forgot to renew his charter boat captains 
license and must pass a tough coast guard exam to get it back 
its bloody embarrassing said mundus as he stood in front 
of his boat cricket ii after an allday outing thursday 
im scared to take that test said mundus who has only a 
ninthgrade education its all book work but ill just have to 
knuckle down and study the rules are the rules 
he doesnt have to study he knows everything said coast 
guard spokesman james mcgranachan who added that the service told 
mundus they would help him by reading the questions to him 
a lot of people fail the test but not people like him 
mcgranachan said its in his blood by now everything we have 
heard about him is that he is a good captain 
mundus said he forgot to renew his license when it expired in may 
1988 and during the following oneyear grace period because he was 
working hard and was distracted by his upcoming wedding to a 
28yearold english woman 
the legendary mundus who was wearing a gold pierced earring in 
his left ear and a pearly white sharks tooth around his neck still 
takes groups out on his boat but must have a licensed charter 
captain aboard with him 
its only a minor inconvenience said the balding lanky man 
but he was quick to add im still the boss here i wouldnt 
trust my captains chair to anybody 
if it werent for the people i take out i wouldnt stay 
alive he said i have more fun going out than they do 
mundus a native of point pleasant nj has been a charter boat 
captain in montauk since 1951 
stories of mundus shark fishing adventures are said to have 
inspired peter benchley to write the bestselling novel jaws 
benchley according to mundus went on a few shark hunts with him in 
the 1970s the shark fisherman character was called quint in the 
movie 
mundus says his personality goes from carefree to serious when he 
sees a shark he wants 
if i see something over 1000 pounds i say to myself im 
going to get that fish i dont care if we tear the boat apart to 
get it 
in 1964 mundus boat harpooned a 4500pound white shark which 
is listed in the guinness book of world records as the largest shark 
harpooned in this century in 1986 his boat took in a 3500pound 
shark which he said is the largest fish in the world to be caught by 
a rod and reel 
the head of that shark hangs in mundus house and it is one of 
its teeth that hangs around mundus neck 
but his years on the water are winding down 
his 42foot custombuilt fishing boat is up for sale at 150000 
and he said if he sells it next summer it will probably be his last 
season running the charter 
he plans to retire to hawaii with his wife jenny the couple met 
after she wrote him from her home in cornwall england of her 
interest in sharks they corresponded for several months before 
mundus invited her to the united states last november 
mundus said he is building his hawaiian retirement home in the 
hills amidst the fruit trees 
but he knows he will always think about his days on the water 
when its time to go ill just give a sigh of relief and walk 
away thinking we caught all the largest fish

president bushs proposal to link a pay raise 
for top government officials with a requirement they be evaluated 
every three years is being criticized by the chairman of a house 
civil service subcommittee 
rep gary l ackerman dny chairman of a panel that oversees 
federal pay claims the plan would inject even more partisanship 
into the federal personnel structure than exists already 
it creates a system in which there will be a political litmus 
test people will have to snooker up to their supervisors and kiss 
their rings to keep their pay raises ackerman said thats not 
what government service is all about 
the bush proposal would raise salaries for senior government 
executives by 8 to 25 percent the evaluation every three years 
would certify they deserve the higher salary 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater claims the 
certification would assure that these people perform at a level 
that justifies the higher salary we do not believe it would weaken 
their rights 
the package bush sent to congress friday would give pay raises to 
some 7900 federal officials including 700 political appointees 
and another 7200 career executives these include top foreign 
service employes and three and fourstar generals and admirals 
the mostsenior officials including the political appointees 
agency heads and other highranking officers would receive the full 
25 percent lesserranking executives would receive smaller boosts 
down to 8 percent 
bush also proposed a ban on congressional honoraria such as 
outside speaking fees to be phased in over the next 18 months 
the white house said the ban on outside income would open the way 
to a congressional pay raise but bush stopped short of actually 
proposing one leaving that politically touchy issue for 
congressional leaders to decide 
i will work with congress toward this end bush said on the 
pay raise issue in a letter to house and senate leaders 
bush earlier this year gave his support to a proposed 51 percent 
pay raise for members of congress endorsed by the reagan 
administration but the plan was rejected in congress after a public 
outcry 
bushs package also includes a new superpay category to enable 
200 federal employees with specialized and critical skills such 
as physicians or space scientists to earn salaries well above what 
their regular pay grades would allow up to 124400 a year 
that would also be the new pay of cabinet officers under the pay 
plan up from 99500 now and the package would raise vice 
president dan quayles salary from 99500 to 124400 
the salary of the president 200000 would remain unchanged 
the pay of senior government officials has eroded significantly 
in relation to the pay of executives in comparable jobs in the 
private and notforprofit sectors of the economy bush said in 
sending the plan to congress 
the pay issue was highlighted friday when michael f ballhaus 
jr the director of nasas ames research center in mountain view 
calif since 1984 said he was resigning because of low pay and 
regulations limiting his employment after government service 
the basic pay package would cost taxpayers 101 million in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 and 147 million the next year the 
provision for a new category of high pay for specialized positions 
would add 8 million more in each of the next two years 
the increases proposed friday would be in addition to a 36 
percent costofliving increase the president is seeking for all 22 
million civil service workers 
robert tobias president of the national treasury employes union 
called the package unfair highly political and another karate 
chop at the real backbone of the federal work force 
it may stem the tide of flight at the top but would further 
oppress the millions of employees who act as the glue holding the 
government together he said 
however carol a bonosaro president of the senior executives 
association which represents members of the federal senior 
executive service who would be covered by the proposed pay raise 
said the package was an important first step 
still she added it should also be noted that a 25 percent pay 
increase for senior executives even if the full 25 percent is 
received at one time falls far short of achieving full 
comparability with the private sector state and local governments 
and nonprofit organizations

in an move that many economists expect will 
make borrowing easier the federal reserve eased credit conditions 
for the second time in four weeks 
analysts predicted the development would send a variety of 
consumer and business interest rates lower in coming weeks 
including home mortgage rates and commercial banks primelending 
rate 
one analyst said a onehalf percentage point reduction in the 
prime rate the benchmark rate for many consumer loans could come 
as early as monday the prime rate stands at 11 percent 
the fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we have 
passed the peak on interest rates said david wyss an economist 
with drimcgraw hill an economic consulting company in lexington 
mass 
the fed began easing its credit policy last month changing 
course after a yearlong effort to drive rates higher as a way of 
dampening inflationary pressures 
that credit squeeze had brought complaints from president bush 
and others that the central bank ran the risk of pushing the country 
into a recession 
the central bank is trying to engineer a socalled 
softlanding for the economy in which growth slows enough to 
dampen inflationary pressures but without a recession 
economists based their belief that the fed eased again this week 
on a slight decline in the federal funds rate which edged down 025 
percentage point to 925 percent thursday and friday 
the federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each 
other to make overnight loans it is influenced by daily decisions 
the central bank makes on how much money to make available to the 
banking system and is considered the best early warning signal of 
fed intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions 
the funds rate dropped for the first time in a year in early 
june when it declined from 975 percent to 95 percent 
many analysts said they expected to see further 025 percentage 
point declines over the next several months if inflation moderates 
further and various business barometers continue signaling a 
slowdown 
the labor department reported friday the nations unemployment 
rate climbed from 52 percent to 53 percent in june reflecting 
continuing job losses in manufacturing and construction 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said he expected the feds 
creditloosening moves would prompt banks to cut their primelending 
rate to 105 percent perhaps as early as monday 
other economists predicted that mortgage rates would soon dip 
back into the singledigit range perhaps falling to as low as 95 
percent for fixedrate mortgages such mortgages stand at 1003 
percent down from 1007 percent the previous week according to a 
national survey released friday by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp 
the latest easing came while fed policymakers were holding two 
days of meetings as part of their midyear review of monetary 
strategy 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan will reveal details of 
this weeks discussions when he delivers the feds midyear 
assessment of the economy in congressional testimony july 20 
at a may 16 meeting of the federal open market committee fed 
policymakers decided to leave credit conditions unchanged however 
they noted a variety of economic statistics pointing to slower 
growth according to minutes of that meeting released friday 
the fomc is composed of members of the federal reserve board in 
washington and five of the 12 fed regional bank presidents

housing secretary jack kemp says more agency 
programs may be suspended but promises to revive the 
scandalwracked department and make sure the money gets to hands 
of needy people not greedy people 
kemp also said friday that his predecessor samuel pierce shares 
blame for huds problems which congressional and agency 
investigators believe have cost the government hundreds of millions 
if not billions of dollars 
kemp promised a thorough review of the department of housing and 
urban development and made his most direct comments to date on his 
assessment of pierce 
im making a lot of changes so that by definition is 
suggesting that secretary pierce unfortunately a very decent and 
honest man did not in my view manage hud as carefully or closely 
as it should have been managed kemp told reporters after speaking 
to a republican group 
that reflects on mr pierce and i say this with sadness not 
anger it reflects on the reagan administration 
kemp said said he and president bush will be to blame if they are 
unsuccessful in reforming the agency a massive task that involves 
major internal reviews of virtually all the agencys major programs 
three programs have been suspended or canceled and kemp said 
there may be more as his review progresses 
but im not going to announce them today he said 
kemp in promising to revive the agency dismissed questions from 
the congressman heading a subcommittee investigation of huds 
problems kemp is to testify next week before the subcommittee 
rep thomas lantos dcalif head of the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing said thursday 
that he feared kemp was using the investigation to kill housing 
programs 
i dont want to end the system i want to make it work kemp 
said were going to spend a lot of money but i want to make sure 
the money gets to the hands of needy people not greedy people 
pierce has been recalled to testify before the subcommittee to 
face questions about a north carolina project hud funded that was 
pushed by a onetime law partner of the former hud secretary 
a hud official who approved the funding janet hale now works at 
the office of management and budget and was told late thursday that 
she should steer clear of hud matters that could be related to the 
investigations 
ms hales predecessor as deputy secretary of housing shirley 
mcvay wiseman has said she quit because pierce wanted her to 
approve the north carolina project over the objections of career hud 
officials pierce promoted ms hale to succeed wiseman and she 
approved the project in 1985 
ms hale also faces questioning over her response to an audit by 
huds inspector general that found numerous abuses of a program 
under which hud jointly guaranteed loans for developers with lenders 
that hud now says has cost the agency more than 100 million 
hud inspector general paul adams told congress last week that a 
1984 audit found that lenders on eight projects under the program 
had inflated appraisals by 36 million and that auditors then 
proposed a series of corrective measures to agency officials

the food and drug administration says people 
who turn to overthecounter potions to prevent baldness or improve 
their sex lives arent getting what they pay for 
to protect the public from fraudulent claims the fda is banning 
nonprescription antibaldness creams and lotions and aphrodisiac 
products 
though overthecounter hairgrowth products have dwindled in 
number since the fda indicated in 1985 that it wanted to remove the 
products from the market they have continued to be an area of 
considerable fraud 
the ban of all such products will provide a greater and more 
uniform protection to the public the fda said 
few of these types of products are on the market and those 
available usually are sold by mail or through barbers or beauticians 
the industry has been anticipating this for a long time john 
t walden a spokesman for the nonprescription drug manufacturers 
association said friday after the fda announced plans to ban the 
two products 
the number of companies marketing nonprescription aphrodisiacs 
also has shrunk in anticipation of a ban no manufacturer defended 
its product during the agencys review 
the bans will become effective in six months 
for antibaldness products the ban applies to those available 
without a prescription that are used externally 
the only product approved by the fda for stimulating hair growth 
on the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percent 
solution of minoxidil which is applied to the scalp the drug is 
manufactured by the upjohn co and sold under the name rogaine 
the fda also said it will ban on a casebycase basis vitamins 
food supplements or other products taken orally that claim to grow 
hair or retard baldness because no evidence exists proving they 
work 
an fda advisory panel recommended the ban after it evaluated a 
number of ingredients in antibaldness medicines including lanolin 
olive oil wheat germ oil and vitamins the panel found none of 
these prevented baldness or promoted hair growth 
the fda said that once the ban is in effect manufacturers of any 
nonprescription remedy claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair 
will have to provide proof that it is safe and effective before it 
can be sold 
ingredients commonly found in products billed as aphrodisiacs 
include cantharides a chemical derived from the dried bodies of 
beetles estrogens strychnine yohimbine fennel mandrake anise 
licorice and zinc the fda said 
some of these are contained in food products but none of those 
would be covered by the ban unless specifically labeled as an 
aphrodisiac 
the fda advised people with sexual problems to seek treatment by 
a medical professional and not try to medicate themselves male sex 
hormones affect sexual drive and performance but because they are 
powerful hormones with potentially serious side effects supplements 
of such hormones should be used only under a doctors care the 
agency added 
the fda review of both types of products is part of an ongoing 
evaluation of overthecounter medicines that began in the early 
1970s to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all of their 
ingredients 
the american pharmaceutical associations handbook of 
nonprescription drugs lists no aphrodisiac or antibaldness products 
walden said none of his associations members who represent 95 
percent of the fdaregulated nonprescription drugs on the market 
markets either type of product

airlines must respond to government alerts of 
terrorist threats but could face fines if they disclose them to the 
public under a federal aviation administration order to take effect 
monday 
the order replaces the system of issuing security bulletins that 
brought criticism from relatives of victims of the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland in december that killed 270 people 
the new system however rejects the relatives demand that 
passengers on any flight be advised of threats against their flight 
instead airlines that disclose such threats without faa 
authorization would face a 10000 fine individuals could be fined 
1000 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who announced the faa 
order friday earlier said such disclosures would compromise 
security and disrupt commercial aviation 
faa spokesman john leyden said the new system for alerting 
airlines will include two types of advisories information circulars 
and security directives 
the information circulars will deal with general threats of 
hijackings bombings or other terrorist actions leyden said 
they are basically a headsup warning and would require no 
particular action he said 
the stronger security directives however would require 
countermeasures by an airline such as additional baggage 
inspections leyden said these would be in response to specific 
threats against an airline an airport or an individual flight and 
might include such information as the threatened time and method of 
attack he said 
until now airlines have not been required to take any specific 
actions in response to security bulletins although steps were 
sometimes recommended 
before the bombing of flight 103 notices of threats against us 
airlines on the flights route were posted in at least one foreign 
embassy but not distributed to the general public the state 
department later said the bulletin should not have been posted in 
its moscow embassy and that no information about threats is supposed 
to go to government employees that does not also go to the public 
us and european authorities later said they concluded the 
threat was a coincidence and not related to the bombing of flight

democrats and republicans are wooing the 
nations oldest and largest hispanic group 
democratic national chairman ronald h brown and labor secretary 
elizabeth dole appeared within hours of each other friday at the 
annual convention of the national league of united latin american 
citizens brown offering more political clout and dole more jobs 
the remarks reflected the value the two parties have placed on 
hispanic voters in recent elections highlighted last year by 
promises from both presidential nominees that they would name a 
hispanic to a cabinet post 
brown told the group that republicans were merely paying lip 
service to hispanics 
the difference is very stark and distinct said brown 
republicans take a madison avenue media approach thats the way 
you deal with the american public with little slogans with little 
oversimplified phrases but with no understanding of what the 
problems of people are and how you deal with the problems of people 
selling candidates its like selling toothpaste or detergent 
by contrast said brown the democratic party is committed to 
the economic and political empowerment of the hispanic community i 
dont think its just coincidence that every member of the 
congressional hispanic caucus is a democrat 
dole speaking later in the day emphasized a pending jobs bill 
rather than politics 
mrs dole said her top priority is to reduce minority youth 
unemployment and she asked the groups support for a bush 
administration bill that would reform the federal jobtraining 
program 
the legislation she said would add skills training literacy 
remedial education and counseling provisions to the job training 
partnership act she urged members of the group to attend a senate 
subcommittee session next week at which the bill will be drafted 
she also pledged more jobs at her department for hispanics she 
said hispanic employment at the transportation department rose by 25 
percent while she was secretary during the reagan administration 
and said i intend to get the same results at the department of 
labor 
brown said that for democrats there is nothing more crucial 
than the 1990 census in its efforts to reach minorities he said 
the party will be working to make sure hispanics and blacks who 
might not be counted do end up on the census bureau rolls 
the 1990 census will be used in redrawing congressional district 
boundaries 
the census bureau estimated the hispanic population at 17 
million in 1985

of the 282foot vessel which boasts a disco movie theater and 
handcarved onyx toilets 
it really was no more than a bump said bill gifford who 
owns the marina where the clam boat unloaded but when you bump a 
40 million yacht owned by donald trump you can expect to have 
problems 
indeed in a terse statement released from his new york office 
trump said the people who did it were totally incompetent it 
never should have happened 
trump said he will seek damages gifford said he expects his 
insurance company will cover all costs

a vietnam veterans group says people with 
serviceconnected disabilities should be able to get governmentpaid 
care from the doctor of their choice because va hospitals are 
falling down on the job 
the 35000member vietnam veterans of america issued the call 
friday after details of a draft report by the general accounting 
office critical of the department of veterans affairs was published 
in the washington post 
the report by the government watchdog agency said officials were 
unable to prove they had checked the licenses of more than half the 
doctors the va hired between 1986 and 1988 
if the government is unable to provide acceptable health care 
through the veterans hospital system then these veterans should 
have the right to seek medical treatment elsewhere mary r stout 
president of the veterans group said in a statement 
in its statement the vietnam veterans group referred as well to 
a report of high mortality rates at va hospitals the new report 
also noted that some medical residents at the nations 172 va 
hospitals had criminal arrest records that went unreported 
the department of veterans affairs disputed the reasoning used by 
the vietnam veterans group 
any attempt to connect the mortality review or the gao report 
with the quality of care is totally inappropriate said 
spokeswoman donna st john explaining that mortality rates fail to 
reflect the condition of the patients who enter a particular 
hospital hospices for example have reported 100 percent rates 
she noted the gao report according to the post said the 
conditions cited do not mean that the medical services provided by 
the va are substandard or that va physicians are incompetent 
the study was requested by sen frank murkowski ralaska 
ranking minority member of the senate veterans affairs committee 
his staff said it could not release a copy of the report because it 
was in draft form the va said it could not release the draft 
report either 
the full report with va comment is due for release in august 
murkowski wrote a 1985 law telling the va to act on problems at 
hospitals after the american medical association found 87 doctors 
with revoked suspended or restricted licenses who were working for 
the agency 
va officials said they could prove they had checked the licenses 
of only 105 of the 207 physicians hired from 1986 to 1988 the draft 
report said the report also said the va had not fulfilled promises 
to ensure that its doctors are qualified to practice their 
particular specialties 
a further problem was detected with medical residents who work at 
va hospitals according to the draft report the government watchdog 
agency said a records check with the fbi found that 165 of the 
16756 residents had been charged with criminal offenses between the 
early 1970s and may 1987 the post reported 
among the more serious offenses were 68 charged with drunken 
driving and 67 charged with drug violations five with vandalism and 
five with burglary the records did not indicate how many charges 
led to convictions

a federal court complaint alleging 
illegal fishing was filed friday against two canadian vessels seized 
off southeast alaska and the crews were to return to canada without 
their boats 
canada meanwhile filed a protest with the state department in 
washington dc demanding release of the boats seized by the us 
coast guard in waters claimed by the united states southeast of 
ketchikan 
mark davis acting us attorney for alaska filed the complaint 
in us district court at anchorage citing violations of the 
federal magnuson act the complaint seeks forfeiture of the vessels 
the gear and the fish on board 
the 4000 pounds of salmon aboard each boat was sold to a 
ketchikan cannery friday and the proceeds were to be held by the 
court pending resolution of the complaint officials said 
no criminal action was planned against the crew members said 
timothy burgess an assistant us attorney in anchorage this 
action is only against the vessels themselves he said 
mike harpold a federal immigration agent in ketchikan said the 
crew members avoided immigration charges by voluntarily returning to 
canada the four men and three women were to leave ketchikan late 
friday night 
the crews had been held on their boats at the ketchikan coast 
guard base since wednesday coast guard spokesman ed moreth said 
from juneau

washington said his government issued a verbal protest over the 
incident wednesday and delivered a formal diplomatic protest note to 
the state department friday 
we would like to see the immediate release of the vessels and 
their crews mckechnie said 
he said the boats the viscount and the fonzie were seized after 
a hot pursuit in disputed waters because jurisdiction over the 
area is disputed we believe there should be restraint 
exercised mckechnie said 
what took place was a divergence from the normal practice of 
restraint he said 
the coast guard said the canadian vessels were found fishing 
illegally in us waters of dixon entrance between southeast alaska 
and canadas queen charlotte islands 
the coast guard said the cutter cape hatteras found the boats 
fishing about onequarter mile north of the dixon entrance boundary

the viscount was carrying a crew of four and was under the 
supervision of master bruce devereau of vancouver british columbia 
howard wilson of parksville british columbia was master of the 
fonzie which had three crew members 
the united states and canada have not agreed on fishing 
boundaries in the area involved despite efforts at negotiations 
since 1903 
moreth said it is the first time canadian fishing vessels have 
been detained off alaska in the last couple of years 
devereux told canadian press his vessel was boarded in canadian 
waters and he was roughed up coast guardsmen jumped aboard the 
viscount without permission and threatened to use whatever force 
was necessary to take the the boat into port he said friday 
devereux said two coast guardsmen came aboard and slammed him 
against a stove with a club crewman brad dean was briefly 
handcuffed he said 
another crew member dianne cheadle protested devereuxs 
treatment 
i said hey you cant do this hes the skipper hes got 
control of this boat cheadle said 
moreth said none of the crew members had filed complaints about 
their treatment we did get information that the captain of the 
viscount was very uncooperative he said

hopkins was the second voa reporter and the fourth american 
journalist ordered out of the country since the crackdown against 
prodemocracy protesters began in beijing on june 34 a total of 
seven foreign journalists have been ordered expelled from china 
on the domestic front communist party hardliners who called the 
army in to put down student prodemocracy protesters appeared 
determined to wipe out moral and cultural backsliding as well as 
political dissent 
a forum organized by the party propaganda department denounced 
the spread of pornography and blamed it on ousted party chief zhao 
ziyang while police raided beijing book stalls and confiscated 
banned books one province ordered that copies of a banned book be 
burned 
a highlevel government advisory body the chinese peoples 
political consulative conference adopted a resolution condemning 
what it called the antichina wave stirred up by the reactionary 
forces in the west 
the official xinhua news agency reported the resolution which 
also vowed to continue to develop friendly ties with all 
countries 
many governments deplored chinas june 34 army attack on the 
studentled protesters for a freer society the united states japan 
and european countries imposed limited economic sanctions 
china has responded with a series of increasingly defensive 
statements reflecting a siege mentality not seen in more than a 
decade 
the media directed its sharpest words against the united states 
which it accused of human rights violations in its treatment of 
minorities and demonstrators 
is america in any position to say anything to china asked a 
commentary in the party newspaper the peoples daily 
china accused france of violating international law by allowing 
two chinese fugitives to criticize china from french soil

cultural as well as political deviations the propaganda department 
organized a forum of writers and artists to demand a cleanup of what 
one speaker called all sorts of garbage that have appeared in 
our society

the government is seeking nearly 2 million in 
fines from a ford motor co subsidiary that allegedly failed to 
properly record injuries and illnesses in violation of an agreement 
reached with the automaker two years ago 
ford electronics and refrigeration corp of lansdale pa has 15 
working days to contest the fine proposed friday by the occupational 
safety and health administration 
osha said the company had willfully ignored a 1987 agreement 
between the agency and ford in which the automaker settled 
workersafety complaints at two other plants and agreed to a 
companywide reform of its record keeping practices relating to 
illnesses and injuries 
a ford spokesman said company officials were reviewing the 
citations and had no immediate comment 
the pennsylvania subsidiary was cited for 241 willful violations 
of the agreement for allegedly misrecording or failing to record 
injuries and illnesses it also was cited for serious violations for 
allegedly overexposing workers to the hazards of lasers and 
repetitive motion 
other employers who enter into agreements with osha to abate 
job safety and health violations and hazards should realize that 
this case shows we mean business about enforcing settlement 
agreements labor secretary elizabeth dole said in announcing the 
proposed fine 
the action stems from osha inspections of the lansdale plant that 
began earlier this year following an employee complaint about 
exposure to asbestos osha said the agency said the plant employs 
about 2600 workers and manufactures auto parts such as cruise 
control units and fuel injection systems 
willful violations are defined as situations in which the 
employer knew of a violation of osha standards or was aware that a 
hazardous condition existed but made no attempt to correct it 
serious violations cover alleged offenses in which the employer knew 
or should have known a workplace activity posed a substantial 
probability of death or serious physical harm 
if ford contests the fine the case would be referred to an 
administrative law judge who would hold hearings on the matter if 
either side appeals a judges finding the case is referred to the 
quasijudicial occupational safety and health review commission any 
appeals from that proceeding would go to the us court of appeals

oliver l north wants to perform 1200 hours of 
community service in an antidrug program imposed as part of his 
sentence while appealing three irancontra convictions 
norths attorneys filed a motion for a stay friday of the 
150000 fine imposed by us district judge gerhard a gesell but 
added the former white house aide would like to begin promptly the 
important community service program ordered by the court 
gesell on wednesday ordered north to perform the community 
service by helping administer a new program to help district of 
columbia youths living in public housing avoid drugs 
the judge told north the work involved applying his 
administrative and organizational skills to a program targeted to 
see if we cant stop the scourge of drugs that hits the young people 
of this city 
defense lawyers said north was anxious to begin work because we 
understand that the next six to 12 months is a critical startup 
period during which the program could best use the assistance of lt 
col north 
north was also placed on two years probation for his conviction 
on charges of aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress 
destroying or altering government documents and illegally accepting 
a home security system 
in another development friday fundraiser carl r spitz 
channell was placed on two years probation for illegally using a 
taxexempt foundation to help north raise donations for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
us district judge stanley s harris cited channells early 
cooperation with the investigation by independent counsel lawrence 
e walsh after his april 29 1987 guilty plea to conspiring to 
defraud the treasury 
the judge said it makes it very difficult to impose a 
sentence when crimes have been committed by someone so firmly 
dedicated to furthering the interests of the country 
channell could have received a fiveyear sentence and fined up to 
250000 for his guilty plea he admitted raising 2 million through 
the taxexempt national endowment for the preservation of liberty 
for the nondeductible purpose of purchasing weapons for the 
nicaraguan contras 
the foundation which channell headed used white house briefings 
and private meetings between prospective donors and thenpresident 
reagan to raise 10 million for the contras at a time us military 
aid was banned by congress

president bush is prepared to offer to send 
english teachers to hungary when he visits budapest next week a 
move that would be establish the first informal us peace corps 
mission to a european country 
us officials said friday that the project is part of a package 
of proposals bush is examining as he prepares to travel to poland 
and hungary 
he mostly will offer economic assistance provided government 
leaders in poland and hungary commit themselves to austerity 
programs according to the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the programs would accelerate us cultural and business ties 
with the soviet bloc nations as they open up their political 
systems hungary in particular has been moving its marxist economy 
toward a freemarket system 
bush who leaves for poland on sunday is visiting the east 
european countries on his way to a sevennation economic summit 
meeting in paris 
hungary two years ago suspended russian as a compulsory language 
in schools the us hope is that english will become more common 
poland which carries the burden of a 36 billion debt is hoping 
for financial aid 
a senior us official briefing reporters at the white house 
dismissed reports that warsaw expected 10 billion in us or 
western help but he left open the possibility of a more modest 
economic program which bush would coordinate with the leaders of 
britain canada france italy japan and west germany at the 
economic summit

a civil rights group says a ruling by a federal 
appeals court that the education department may be sued to seek 
stricter enforcement of laws is an important step toward reviving a 
major civil rights case 
a panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the district of 
columbia on friday reversed a lower courts ruling that students in 
18 states lacked legal standing to bring the case to speed up 
desegregation of public schools and state colleges 
on the basis of his 1987 ruling us district judge john h 
pratt had dissolved two 1983 orders that set timetables for the 
education departments review of desegregation plans submitted by 
states for public schools and universities 
in fridays ruling a threejudge panel held the plaintiffs had a 
direct stake in the effective enforcement of antidiscrimination 
laws because they were enrolled in schools colleges or 
universities that engaged in proscribed discrimination 
plaintiffs in this action beyond question are the intended 
beneficiaries of the statutes under which they sue and could prove 
a direct harm if the laws are not enforced the panel ruled in an 
opinion by judge ruth b ginsburg 
while the court did not issue a final judgment in the case 
pending resolution of other significant legal issues the decision 
was hailed by the naacp legal defense and education fund inc as 
an important step toward reviving the case 
its very crucial that the courts have upheld our right to sue 
under these civil rights statutes said janell m byrd an 
attorney for the new yorkbased organization 
judge pratts ruling would have closed the door not only on 
this litigation it would make it very difficult to sue the federal 
government for failure to enforce a statute she said 
the suit which dates back to the nixon administration produced 
court decisions by pratt ordering the government to revoke federal 
aid to segregated schools and universities under the 1964 civil 
rights act 
it resulted in a series of court orders and a 1977 consent decree 
under which the department of health education and welfare and 
later the department of education were given timetables for 
reviewing discrimination complaints and later plans for ending the 
last vestiges of segregation 
the reagan administration sought in 1982 to dissolve the 1977 
consent decree saying it could not be legally bound by an agreement 
entered into by the carter administration 
that issue is now before the appeals court along with several 
others that remain as legal hurdles for civil rights lawyers seeking 
to revive the case 
the case involved enforcement of desegregation laws against 
schools and universities in alabama arkansas delaware florida 
georgia kentucky louisiana maryland mississippi missouri north 
carolina ohio oklahoma pennsylvania south carolina virginia 
west virginia and texas

once burned twice shy goes the adage and 
yellowstone national park officials who watched their forest go up 
in smoke last year are ready to douse any blaze at a moments notice 
a year after massive fires charred nearly half of the park its 
administrators have beefed up fire crews obtained a new helicopter 
and other gear they are determined not to allow a wet spring lull 
them 
they are armed as well with a new federal mandate to squelch 
fires in the nations forests 
we could have four to five crews 80 to 100 people on a fire 
line within four to five hours if it is warranted park 
spokeswoman sandy robinson said this week in a telephone interview 
thats excellent response time 
no substantial fires have been reported in yellowstone this 
summer but just 150 miles to the south of the park a 2400acre 
fire was burning friday in the bridgerteton national forest and 
there were outofcontrol wildfires in utah and california 
under a policy begun in 1972 yellowstone crews in previous years 
let naturally caused fires burn unless they threatened people or 
structures 
but last year more than 200 fires seared an estimated 13 
million acres of the park and surrounding national forests 
radically altering the face of the most venerated national park 
last month the interior department announced it was suspending 
the letburn policies in national parks and forests 
in addition it ordered a moratorium on controlled or limited 
fires george berklacy a spokesman for the national park service 
said at the time that he doubted the moratorium would be lifted this 
summer 
one hundred park employees are ready to leave their jobs as 
naturalists security guards and rangers and head into the 
yellowstone backcountry to tackle fires robinson said 
three lookout towers have been manned since june 15 at 
yellowstone and will be staffed until sept 30 with a fourth tower 
staffed on a parttime basis robinson said 
all reports of smoke are being checked out she said 
several false alarms turned out to be dust devils or steam rising 
from thermal areas she said 
while the 22 millionacre park in the northwest corner of 
wyoming has enjoyed a relatively wet spring and early summer record 
high temperatures this weekend may signal the beginning of the fire 
season robinson said 
we always have a high degree of preparedness robinson said 
we are more prepared this year in part due to the firefighting 
efforts of last year 
hundreds of firefighters were marshaled to battle last years 
blazes while a debate raged among naturalists and government 
administrators on whether the policy to let the fires burn made 
sense 
the park has added a helicopter and now has two of the craft to 
dump water on fires and a sixperson crew trained for a chopper 
assault on any fire that flares up robinson said 
an extra 75 to 80 employees have been trained to fight fires 
giving yellowstone 275 employees with red cards the firefighting 
certificate robinson said 
we have 100 that are already outfitted that we can call out 
immediately she said 
yellowstone also has 100 new chain saws and two new water pumps 
robinson said the park itself is better prepared for the 1989 
fire season because last summers fires consumed much of the 
available dead wood and created natural fire lines fire that 
reaches recently burned areas burns itself out 
park firefighters already have had one chance to test their 
preparedness 
on june 14 a small fire caused by a spark from a cleanup 
operation burned onetenth of an acre at craig pass southeast of 
old faithful a crew drove to the site rappeled down the slope and 
doused the fire with hand tools and bags of water

businesses looking to expand in congested 
cities like new york chicago and san francisco usually turn to 
skyscrapers or the suburbs but a group of engineers and architects 
says a better solution lies just below the surface 
building underground has the potential to provide millions of 
square feet of clean energyefficient space in the nations major 
cities according to the american undergroundspace association 
underground has the benefit of allowing greater density in 
urban areas and mitigating the need for sprawl susan nelson the 
groups executive director said in a recent interview you save 
land doing that you save energy and transportation and you just 
create a more vital city center 
getting that message across however has proven to be difficult 
for the minneapolisbased nonprofit organization 
visibility really is a major problem with underground 
construction nelson acknowledges i think youll find that many 
architects arent interested in it because they like to make a 
statement its hard to make a statement underground 
since it was founded in 1976 the association has been touting 
the benefits of underground facilities to business and government 
leaders and helping exchange information among professionals 
interested in the idea the group now has 400 members in 39 states 
and 25 countries 
subterranean buildings are ideal for researchers and 
industrialists who need clean work environments because few airborne 
pollutants can invade the underground nelson said 
they also save energy because the ground offers protection from 
cold winter winds and the hot summer sun but energy concerns have 
waned along with the price of oil in recent years 
i think there was more activity in the late 70s when we were 
more concerned about energy nelson said i think its a matter 
of not being presented with the idea 
to help remedy that the association recently published a book 
titled groundworks featuring 15 underground projects built in 
north america during the 1980s 
they include the law library addition at the university of 
michigan in ann arbor all three stories of which are below ground 
the smithsonian institution museum complex in washington dc 
which is 96 percent below ground and extends 60 feet below the 
surface and the civil and mineral engineering building at the 
university of minnesota which is 95 percent below ground and goes 
down 110 feet 
also featured is the minnesota correctional facility a 
maximumsecurity prison in suburban oak park heights 
the fivestory prisons exterior walls are almost completely 
earthcovered minimizing its visibility and providing another 
barrier to escape said assistant warden james crawford 
crawford said he has heard no complaints from prisoners or 
employees at the 7yearold facility 
they have access to the outside he said of the 400 inmates 
of course all of their cells have windows facing a central 
courtyard 
not surprisingly nelsons own office is located in a socalled 
earthbermed building near downtown minneapolis the fourstory 
buildings first floor is built below ground and earth has been 
built up to cover the second and third floors on two sides of the 
building 
misconceptions are holding back more widespread use of 
underground space nelson contends 
there is the myth out there that it is very expensive she 
said cost depends on the difficulty of digging in a particular 
spot and in some places its inexpensive she said 
theres also a psychological aspect nelson said i think 
they feel they will be claustrophobic they dont like the idea of 
no windows but you can work in a skyscraper and never walk past a 
window during the day 
i think the expectation of being underground is quite different 
from the reality people who work underground generally like it

adm william j crowe retiring head of the 
joint chiefs of staff says his historic 11day visit to the soviet 
union revealed the superpowers are entering a period of uneasy 
transition 
crowe in a speech friday before the national press club said 
such circumstances do not make me feel comfortable 
he said he hopes the two military giants are moving toward a new 
era in the superpower relationship but to conclude that we are 
already there would be a serious mistake 
the 64yearold admiral speaking a day after president bush 
rejected a new call from soviet president mikhail gorbachev for 
talks to eliminate shortrange nuclear missiles in europe said he 
believes us should avoid dramatic counterresponses to kremlin 
initiatives at this point 
crowe met for more than an hour with gorbachev two weeks ago in 
moscow during his precedentsetting tour of oncesecret soviet 
military installations and visits with soviet military officers 
it was the first formal visit of a joint chiefs chairman to the 
soviet union and was the latest in a series of highlevel visits 
designed to dispel distrust between the superpowers

the department of agriculture will buy 15 
million worth of apples in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus 
created when consumers stopped buying amid fears over use of the 
chemical alar 
the industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of 
apples from last years crop valued at between 40 million and 56 
million remain unsold 
the department friday said apple stocks were 53 percent greater 
on may 31 than the average for that date for the previous three 
years and prices to growers had fallen by 3 to 4 per carton from 
what they were a year ago 
the top grade of red apples produced in washington state were 
recently selling for between 750 and 8 per box about 2 below 
the cost of production the nations 20000 apple growers have 
estimated losses at well over 100 million in sales 
alar is used to enhance red color to ease harvesting by delaying 
ripening so that most apples ripen together and to lengthen shelf 
and storage life the chemical penetrates throughout the fruit 
tissue and cannot be washed off like many pesticides 
the alar controversy began in late february when a private 
environmental advocacy group the natural resources defense council 
said apples treated with the chemical substantially increase the 
risk of cancer in children

environmental protection agency officials say 
they are optimistic that oileating microorganisms may soon become 
valuable tools in cleaning up the exxon oil spill in alaska 
preliminary findings from an experiment in which nutrients were 
used to enhance the growth of such organisms on small sections of 
alaskas contaminated beaches appear to show success epa 
administrator william reilly said friday 
in some cases the number of organisms multiplied 100fold only a 
week into the experiment and even in the early stages some beaches 
treated with nutrients showed a striking disappearance of the oil 
from rock surfaces the epa said 
reilly said that the results were potentially good news and 
that if the preliminary findings hold up exxon corp may begin 
later this summer to treat large sections of beach with nutrients to 
enhance oileating microorganism growth 
eric brathauer assistant administrator for research and 
development said it will be several weeks before some remaining 
questions about the experiment will be resolved

youve heard of the silent majority meet the 
sedentary majority 
a decade ago the government hoped americans would be in better 
shape by now but federal health officials report at least five of 
the 11 physical fitness goals they set for us adults arent going 
to be met 
despite jane fonda video workouts chic outfits and the 
widespread thinking that thin is always in only 8 percent of the 
countrys adults participate regularly in vigorous exercise 
defined by the national centers for disease control as 20 minutes of 
exercise at least three times a week 
evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the 
incidence of many medical conditions including heart disease 
colon cancer diabetes and obesity the cdc said in its weekly 
report 
in 1980 when the cdc published its goals for 1990 it hoped that 
60 percent of americans age 1865 would get such regular exercise 
but objectives for participation in regular physical activity 
will not be fully met the agency said 
officials impressed by the lack of enthusiasm for hard exercise 
said their goals for 2000 are likely to be less arduous 
some of the other objectives for the nation published in 
1980 and the likelihood of reaching the goals by next year 
half of americans 65 and older should walk swim or engage in 
other appropriate aerobic exercise at least three times a week 
not likely a 1985 survey showed that although 46 percent of older 
americans said they walked for exercise just 8 percent met the 
threetimesaweek 20minute level 
more than 90 percent of youngsters 1017 should participate 
three times a week in 20minute sessions of vigorous exercise not 
likely a 1984 survey found only 66 percent of children exercised at 
that level 
more than 60 percent of children 1017 should participate in 
daily school physical education programs not likely a 1984 survey 
placed the figure at 36 percent only up by 3 percent from a 1974 
survey 
more than 70 percent of us adults should know that 
cardiovascular health is best promoted by exercising at least three 
times a week for 20 minutes or more and at a level that makes 
heart rate and breathing a lot faster but not so much that 
talking is impossible not likely a 1985 survey found that fewer 
than 40 percent got those questions right 
there are a number of avenues of research attempting to get at 
the answers why exercisers exercise and why nonexercisers 
dont said dr gregory w heath a cdc researcher 
among the reasons being studied he said are ignorance of 
exercises benefits poor access to exercise opportunities and 
simple attitudes against it 
heath noted that exercise at lower levels of intensity while not 
matching the official fitness goals still can convey not only 
some fitness benefit but some health benefit 
he said the goals for 2000 now in the works may allow for 
people wanting a little less vigorous exercise 
only one of the 11 goals for 1990 was deemed likely to be met 
having more than 25 percent of large companies offer some kind of 
fitness program a 1985 survey found that 32 percent of worksites 
with 250749 employees and 54 percent of those with 750 or more 
offered fitness programs 
other goals involved more technical matters of health services 
and fitness evaluation techniques

seeking new worlds 275 billion miles 
from earth nasas voyager 2 spacecraft discovered a third moon 
orbiting neptune and is likely to find many more scientists say 
its nice after years of preparation for the neptune 
encounter to have voyager now starting to make these discoveries 
jet propulsion laboratory astronomer steve synnott said friday 
ninetyninepointnine percent of the time this discovery process 
is frustration so it is finally nice to dig a nugget out of all the 
mud 
synnott detected the moon temporarily designated 1989 n1 in 
photographs taken by one of the space probes television cameras 
previously only two moons had been detected from earth 
project scientist ellis miner said recently that voyager might 
discover at least 10 small moons orbiting neptune 
voyagers 1 and 2 with total mission costs of 865 million now 
have discovered at least 18 moons three at jupiter at least four 
and possibly seven at saturn 10 orbiting uranus and one so far at 
neptune 
that boosts the total lunar count to 16 for jupiter at least 17 
for saturn 15 for uranus and three for neptune 
synnott who helped discover several of those moons was asked 
how he celebrates when he finds an entire new world 
i usually go home and have a beer he said 
the jet propulsion laboratory operates americas unmanned space 
exploration program for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
voyager 2 was launched from florida in 1977 explored jupiter in 
1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 today it was 267 billion 
miles from earth and 428 million miles from neptune speeding at 
42200 mph toward its aug 24 close encounter with the solar 
systems fourthlargest planet 
voyager will be 275 billion miles from earth when it sweeps 
3000 miles above neptunes north pole cloudtops at midnight edt 
aug 24 but its curving path to neptune will equal 443 billion 
miles 
neptunes other moons are nereid and the backwardorbiting 
triton discovered through telescopes on earth in 1949 and 1846 
respectively 
in 1981 scientists using telescopes believed they detected 
another neptunian moon but its existence hasnt yet been confirmed 
by voyager 
with a diameter estimated at 125 to 400 miles 1989 n1 is smaller 
than nereid estimated at 190 to 620 miles across or triton with 
an estimated diameter of 1400 to 2240 miles or roughly the size 
of earths moon 
synnott first detected the moon as a smudge in images taken by 
voyager 2 on june 21 he confirmed the discovery wednesday by 
examining images 
i never really jumped and screamed but i clenched my fist 
nodded my head to myself and said yup that ones real he said

former white house aide oliver north spared 
prison when he was sentenced this week on charges stemming from the 
irancontra affair isnt relying on a possible presidential pardon 
i dont think much about that were going to press the appeal 
and im confident in the outcome north said at a closed 
fundraising session in tampa friday 
and in his first public appearance since being sentenced 
wednesday north also spoke to about 400 young republicans in 
orlando 
he told them he would not rule out a run for congress though he 
acknowledged his conviction on felony counts prevents his holding 
federal office 
north said he first has to overcome tremendous legal problems 
from the scandal adding that he had other worries as well

his role in the reagan administrations secret scheme to arm the 
contras he will spend two years on probation

he did absolutely nothing with any criminal intent said

united states constitution coalition head bruce gagnon said 
north was convicted may 4 of obstructing a congressional 
investigation destroying documents and illegally accepting a

president bush is more sensitive to black concerns 
than his predecessor but the conservativedominated us supreme 
court will continue to erode minority rights naacp leader benjamin 
hooks said 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
the nations oldest and largest civil rights group with 500000 
members predicts 18000 to 20000 people will attend its 80th 
annual convention that opens sunday in detroit 
a series of us supreme court decisions narrowing federal civil 
rights laws and allowing white workers the right to countersue in 
affirmative action cases will be a hot convention topic hooks said 
at a news briefing friday 
the question on the minds of black folks around the country is 
how we deal with the recent spate of supreme court decisions that 
just emasculate the civil rights laws the naacp executive 
director said in fact its going to get a lot worse before it 
gets better 
a side effect of the supreme courts rulings has been interest in 
the naacp from people who werent involved before 
ive seen young blacks in professional roles who havent 
supported us sending checks and wanting to demonstrate hooks said 
while the high court is shutting the door on blacks the 
president seems willing to open them hooks said 
bush unlike ronald reagan has shown a genuine desire to see the 
united states overcome its history of racism hooks said 
theres no question in my mind that bush is going to be a 
better president than reagan he said it would be hard to be a 
worse president than reagan 
hooks said bush unlike reagan has been accessible to black 
leaders and has met with him and the congressional black caucus as 
well as with south african antiapartheid leaders the revs desmond 
tutu and allan boesek 
hooks said he has known bush for many years and considers him the 
heir to the republican partys eastern more moderate wing 
he wants to do a good job but he wants to be elected again 
hooks said there are various pressures working on him 
overall despite progress toward racial equality the naacp today 
faces many of the same tasks it had 80 years ago said hooks a 
former federal communications commission member who became naacp 
executive director in 1977 
its a sad fact that were still about the same thing we were 
when we were founded in 1909 eliminating all forms of racial 
discrimination he said racism sexism are alive and well 
vice president dan quayle 1988 democratic presidential contender 
jesse jackson and us housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp are among those scheduled to address the naacp convention 
which runs through thursday 
asked how delegates would receive quayle who would be making his 
first appearance before a black group hooks joked oh hell get 
a reception seriously hell get a cordial reception im sure if 
we didnt want to hear him we wouldnt have invited him 
other officials addressing the convention will be democratic 
national committee chairman ron brown gov james blanchard mayor 
coleman young and united auto workers union president owen bieber 
filmmaker spike lee whose movie do the right thing has 
sparked a debate over race relations and tv talk show host oprah

prosecutors in the tax evasion trial of 
james and david taggart have summoned the operators of some of the 
east coasts most exclusive shops to testify about purchases made by 
the former ptl aides 
cartier inc representative gary saage jr told jurors friday 
that david taggart bought several expensive items at the companys 
new york flagship store including an 85000 diamond and sapphire 
pin and witnesses from other expensive shops including gucci 
testified about other items including a 10000 rolex watch 
the taggarts are charged with failing to pay 487000 in income 
taxes from 1984 to 1987 federal prosecutors say they diverted 11 
million of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash 
advances on ptl credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay 
the credit card bills 
all of the witnesses testified that their shops catered to the 
wealthiest us consumers 
a person who shops in our store sort of doesnt ask the 
price said frederick bodner who described the taggarts as 
regular customers at his exclusive clothing shop in palm beach fla 
in other testimony the former executive secretary to ptl founder 
jim bakker said she once forged bakkers signature at the direction 
of david taggart on a memo that turned a 45000 loan into a 
45000 bonus 
shirley fulbright said the memo gave her a 90000 bonus 45000 
of which was used to pay off the loan 
david taggart had used a similar forged memo for loans of his 
own she said 
earlier friday a tax attorney testified that missing records and 
huge salaries paid to ptl leaders made it difficult for him to 
defend the ministrys taxexempt status in the face of internal 
revenue service questioning 
i felt their tax exemption was in jeopardy michael wigton 
testified i felt they needed to have some effective answers 
he said one of his biggest concerns was excessive compensation 
the distinction is when insiders or controlling parties used 
their power to use nonexempt money for their own purposes he 
said 
wigton a former irs specialist in exempt organizations who is 
now in private practice was retained by ptl in late 1985 to fight 
the irss proposed revocation of ptls taxexempt status 
the irs action stemmed from an audit of ptl for the years 
19811983 
wigton testified under questioning by prosecutor david brown that 
he was unable to obtain documents on credit card cash advances and 
american express charges that dealt specifically with david taggart 
he described one incident in which he was unable to get american 
express receipts a set of copies he requested from the credit card 
company was lost at ptl he said a second set of copies also was 
reported lost by ptl officials he said 
they just disappeared said wigton 
most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses and 
other charges incurred by david taggart he said

the united mine workers have called a 
threeday memorial to cool passions raised by a long strike but 
union officials cant guarantee that wildcat strikers will return to 
the mines after the holiday 
theyve looked to the government for a solution to their 
problems and see people hauled off and carted off to jail said 
john duray a spokesman for the umw in washington dc 
more than 37000 miners were on wildcat walkouts in eight states 
friday protesting the pittston cos refusal to sign a national 
contract with 1800 miners in west virginia the walkouts began june 
12 
they also were incited by millions of dollars in fines levied 
against the union by judges and the arrests of strike leaders and 
supporters 
theres a whole lot of talk about law but theres not any 
justice duray said the systems broken down 
violence has increased with the miners frustration duray said 
prompting umw president richard trumkas call friday for a threeday 
memorial period beginning monday 
it was the first official union sanction for wildcat action 
which judges around the country have been declaring illegal but 
trumka said his objectives were anything but provocative 
the union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calm 
the volatile situation in the coal fields he said in a statement 
released by the union although the union has requested that they 
return to work the conditions which led to the protest remain 
unchanged 
all umw members east of the mississippi river will be asked to 
stay away from work monday through wednesday except those at 
westmoreland coal co the union used memorial days for westmoreland 
workers in virginia in april 
duray said he didnt expect a settlement with pittston by 
wednesday and couldnt predict whether the miners would return to 
work 
most of the nations mines have been closed for two weeks in a 
national vacation period and were scheduled to restart midnight 
sunday it was unclear how the memorial wildcat action would affect 
the reopenings 
bituminous coal operators association spokesman morris feibusch 
refused to comment on trumkas call 
about 2000 striking miners surrounded a meeting hall in beckley 
55 miles southeast of charleston on friday to protest the firing of 
28 colleagues the first union men fired since the start of the 
wildcat strikes the protestors prevented a hearing between union 
officials and the toneys branch coal co 
i think thats only going to worsen the situation democratic 
rep bob wise said of the firings once you get the genie out of 
the bottle its going to be hard to get it back in 
wildcat strikes have spread through the appalachian and 
midwestern coal fields in apparent violation of the umws national 
contract with the bcoa 
the national labor relations board on friday asked a federal 
judge in alton ill to order 8500 coal miners in illinois to end 
their wildcat strike and return to work 
the nlrb cited the union for violations at some mining operations 
in west virginia saying its members were using violence threats 
and intimidation 
the board also said it planned court action to force miners back 
to work at two coal mines in indiana 
pittston workers mined coal for more than 14 months without a 
contract before walking out april 5 refusing a company request that 
miners work mandatory overtime and on sundays and refusing proposed 
cuts in medical benefits for pensioners

the soviet union and its warsaw pact 
allies today signed an agreement to seek a nuclearfree europe with 
significantly fewer soldiers and arms the official soviet news 
agency tass reported 
the document calls for a stable and secure europe free from 
nuclear and chemical weapons for substantial cuts in armed forces 
arms and military spending tass said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev signed the redcovered text 
of the 16page accord with a flourish and a smile for photographers 
who were allowed to attend a brief signing ceremony the signing 
took place in a marblecolumned hall in bucharests former royal 
palace 
in remarks friday at a palace dinner for the east blocs top 
communist party and government officials gorbachev said the 
documents adopted by the pact in the twoday annual summit contain a 
serious palpable answer to the proposals made by the nato 
countries 
president bush on may 29 called for cuts in us and soviet 
troops to 275000 soldiers each stationed in europe outside of the 
soviet union and for reductions in weapons and combat aircraft 
we took new steps today toward european security and 
rapprochement and eastwest dialogue gorbachev said 
east german leader erich honecker meanwhile flew home early this 
morning suffering from an illness that was serious enough for him to 
miss the signing ceremony with his warsaw pact collegues 
the 76yearold leaders illness was variously described as a 
gallbladder ailment by the east german news agency adn as acute 
biliary trouble by the romanian news agency agerpres and as a 
kidney problem by roman officials and east german journalists in 
bucharest bile ducts carry digestive fluids from the liver or 
gallbladder to the intestinal system 
gorbachev expressed the hope that the new east bloc agreement 
will allow the two military alliances in europe to rapidly and 
successfully complete negotiations for arms reductions 
i think one could say that owing to our comradely talks today 
one more serious step was taken offering prerequisites to the 
further progress of the alleuropean process gorbachev said at 
the dinner 
details of the documents were to be released later today 
the soviet leader said the pacts important resolution will 
help narrow the gap between nato and the east bloc and bring success 
at the vienna negotiations on a reduction of conventional weaponry 
in europe 
gorbachevs host romanian president nicolae ceausescu told the 
dinner the warsaw pact declaration expresses the east blocs 
determination for the conventional arms redutions talks in vienna 
to end with best possible results and in the shortest possible 
time 
ceausescu renewed what he termed the soviet blocs appeal to 
nato to give up its policy of nuclear deterrence and expressed 
hope that new steps by the east bloc would draw a favorable response 
from the north atlantic treaty organization 
gorbachev said that if moscows allies agreed the kremlin would 
be ready to make further unilateral cuts in its european nuclear 
arsenal once nato agrees to talks on reducing shortrange missiles 
earlier in the week while in france gorbachev assured east bloc 
allies that each is free to find its own way to socialism 
each country and each party has its own specifics and can 
continue its own individual road to socialist democracy and 
progress he said 
gorbachev added however that he hoped perestroika the social 
and economic reforms he has championed in the soviet union would 
serve as a model 
officials at the talks refused to comment on whether the 
discussion involved friction between reformoriented leaders in 
hungary poland and the soviet union and their more orthodox 
counterparts elsewhere in the bloc

rival black factions that have 
sometimes battled each other are working on a plan for unified 
action to end apartheid a zulu leader said 
i can well see future historians tracing a whole new political 
era and in fact the final collapse of apartheid to this very 
document and to the united action that it made possible said zulu 
leader mangosuthu buthelezi late friday 
he made the comments in a statement released in advance of 
todays meeting of his political organization inkatha 
buthelezi declined to provide details of the plan he said it 
would be discussed at a meeting of the african national congress 
united democratic front and inkatha however he gave no date 
the plan was drafted last month at a meeting in durban of 
delegates from inkatha the front and the congress of south african 
trade unions 
inkatha backers have been battling supporters of an alliance of 
the two other groups for three years in natal province in feuds and 
revenge attacks that have killed about 2000 people 
in early june the three groups opened peace talks and violence 
has decreased sharply since then 
the outlawed anc the leading antiapartheid group is not part 
of the talks but its views are represented in them by delegates of 
the front 
the front the union group and the anc have in the past called 
buthelezi a collaborator with the apartheid system of racial 
discrimination because of his position as chief minister of the zulu 
homeland and his opposition to tactics such as strikes boycotts 
and other sanctions 
he says these measures harm blacks more than the government 
buthelezi a member of the anc in his youth also believes the ancs 
bomb attacks and its claim to be the sole representative of south 
africas blacks have hindered united black action 
however the zulu leader said he now has high hopes for an 
agreement we could well be entering into an era in which black 
politics is given a completely different face he said 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

prime minister sousuke uno plagued by scandal at 
home will try to project an image of international leadership at 
the paris summit of industrial nations july 1416 
but the prime minister is rumored to be near resignation because 
of a sex scandal and his political party is at a low point in its 
34 years of rule 
for japan the annual meeting with the united states west 
germany great britain france italy canada and the head of the 
european community has in recent years been a stage on which it 
tried to meet demands that it take leadership responsibilities in 
line with its position as the capitalist worlds secondlargest 
economic power 
uno is expected to pledge increased aid to poor countries urge 
cooperation to solve global environmental problems stress the need 
for exchange rate stability and argue against isolating china from 
the international community with sanctions government officials 
have said 
but back home in japan the liberal democratic party already 
reeling from a bribery scandal that forced the resignation of prime 
minister noboru takeshita has been further damaged by reports that 
uno kept several paid mistresses 
the party suffered a major loss in a tokyo municipal election a 
week ago and prospects for a july 23 election for the upper house 
of parliament are dim 
uno has denied reports he plans to resign but a number of party 
elders have reportedly called on him to step down 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the government is confident uno can credibly represent japan at 
the summit despite his weak position at home the summit nations 
can expect smooth implementation of whatever we say at the 
summit the official said 
government officials have indicated to reporters some of japans 
plans for the meeting on the following topics 
china the summit countries are expected to discuss a response 
to the suppression of a democracy movement in which hundreds and 
perhaps thousands of students and citizens were killed 
as a close neighbor of china its largest aid donor and its 
largest trading partner outside of hong kong japan has been more 
cautious than other countries in condemning the crackdown and 
imposing economic sanctions while japan has temporarily stopped 
discussions of aid and suspended meetings of senior officials at 
the summit it is expected to represent the voices of a number of 
asian countries opposed to driving their giant neighbor into 
isolation 
we have to have in mind how best to encourage reform and an 
opendoor policy in china it is not an appropriate policy in the 
long term to isolate china or push it toward a rapprochement with 
the soviet union taizo watanabe foreign ministry spokesman said 
friday 
coordination of economic policies japan will support efforts to 
control inflation that threatens a number of summit countries 
officials say 
japan also will stress the need for stability in exchange rates 
some government officials suggest uno will push for strengthening 
coordinated intervention in currency markets but it is unclear just 
what japan may recommend 
we will try to convince other countries of the necessity of a 
stable exchange rate system said a foreign ministry official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity he did not say how stability might 
be achieved 
third world debt japan is considering increasing the recycling 
of its large trade surplus in aid to debtridden developing 
countries to as much as 50 billion over three years following a 
30 billion program from 1986 to 1989 according to a report by the 
kyodo news service 
foreign ministry officials would not confirm the figures cited in 
the report but it is expected that japan will make a major 
development aid pledge 
trade japan will push through the settlement of trade disputes 
through multilateral forums such as the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade it may with other countries at least indirectly criticize 
the united states for its recent decision to implement a provision 
of a 1988 trade act naming japan brazil and india as unfair traders 
potentially subject to sanctions 
environment japan will propose increased global cooperation to 
solve environmental problems including depletion of the ozone 
layer global warming the destruction of tropical forests and ocean

in another setback for japans embattled governing 
party the agriculture minister angered women throughout the country 
saturday by reportedly saying women are useless in politics and 
should stay home 
the chairwoman of the top opposition party said women will 
remember the comments in national elections later this month 
agriculture minister hisao horinouchi meanwhile said he was 
misunderstood 
i deeply apologize for having made remarks that have bothered 
so many women horinouchi a senior member of the liberal 
democratic party said at a televised news conference saturday 
evening after reports of his comments surfaced i would like to 
retract them completely 
major newspapers on saturday quoted horinouchi as saying in a 
campaign speech that in the end womens task is to stay home and 
take care of their families 
japans largest newspaper the yomiuri shimbun quoted horinouchi 
as posing the rhetorical question can women be useful in the 
political world even if they advance into parliament they 
cant work as legislators he said 
several women represent the liberal democrats in the diet 
japans parliament 
the masscirculation sankei shimbun newspaper quoted horinouchi 
as adding englands prime minister margaret thatcher is 
special she has a husband and children but socialist party 
chairwoman takako doi is single and it is beyond such a persons 
ability to serve as prime minister 
horinouchi reportedly made the comments friday in a speech to 
party members in western mie prefecture he was campaigning for an 
election july 23 for half the 252 seats in the upper chamber of the 
diet 
prime minister sousuke uno in trouble himself because of 
allegations he kept several paid mistresses told reporters early 
saturday he would seek an explanation from horinouchi 
ms doi who was campaigning saturday in osaka said she was 
flabbergasted by the comments 
but i believe that the response to the agriculture ministers 
remarks will be clearly shown by election results she said 
by speaking that way he showed his lack of understanding 
michiko matsuura head of the japan league of women voters told the 
associated press and women are going to react against this when 
they vote 
analysts predict the liberal democrats the majority party in 
parliament for 34 years could suffer major losses in the elections 
because of voters anger over a new 3percent consumption tax an 
influencepeddling scandal that forced prime minister noboru 
takeshita to resign and unos alleged extramarital affairs 
anger at horinouchis remarks was not limited to opposition 
parties a woman who answered the phone at the liberal democratic 
partys election committee said the comments were unpleasant and 
ridiculous 
such remarks are discriminatory against women and are 
unforgivable said a statement issued saturday by lawmaker manae 
kubota head of the socialist partys womens bureau 
the socialist party the only major opposition group led by a 
woman and socialistbacked candidates scored a victory in tokyo 
municipal elections one week ago tripling their strength in that 
128member body from 12 seats to 36 the governing party lost 20 
seats and now holds 43 
in the tokyo vote 17 women were elected up from seven in the 
previous election in 1985 and analysts noted a high turnout among 
woman voters which they attributed in large part to the uno sex 
scandal 
in a byelection june 29 in northern niigata socialist candidate 
kinuko ofuchi a 44yearold mother of two defeated a liberal 
democratic candidate 
after a former geisha said uno paid her more than 21400 to be 
his mistress for four months uno late last month was reported to be 
considering resigning though reports have alleged he had 
extramarital affairs with several other women he has denied doing 
anything immoral 
the allegations were first made by a respected weekly magazine 
soon after uno replaced takeshita on june 2 
takeshita was forced to resign due to links with the recruit co 
a publishing conglomerate accused of doling out millions of dollars 
in political donations and underpriced shares of stock in exchange 
for political favors

president bush embarks sunday on a historic 
trip to poland and hungary offering encouragement for their 
revolutionary economic and political reforms and urging the rest of 
communist europe not to be lagging way behind 
bushs journey marks the first visit to eastern europe by an 
american president in nearly 12 years and the first ever to hungary 
the trip also will take bush to paris for an economic summit with 
six western allies and to the netherlands for a oneday visit 
bush hopes the paris meeting will produce a coordinated aid 
program for poland and hungary which are in the forefront of 
reforms in warsaw pact countries but are struggling with massive 
foreign debt 
the fourday stop in warsaw gdansk and budapest will be watched 
closely for comparisons with mikhail s gorbachevs triumphant visit 
last month to west germany where he was greeted by crowds of 
hundreds of thousands of people and with the soviet presidents 
justconcluded trip to france where the reception was more 
restrained 
declaring himself unconcerned by gorbachevs popularity in the 
west bush said last week he expects a warm reception in the east 
us officials have been working with opposition groups in poland 
and hungary to turn out huge cheering crowds 
but in an interview with hungarian journalists in washington 
released saturday by the governmentrun media in budapest bush 
stressed he was not trying to stir the people against their 
government 
i think a country like the united states ought not to 
overpromise ought not to overexhort for others to be like us and 
thus make problems worse for the people bush said 
the eisenhower administration had encouraged the hungarian revolt 
but was powerless when the soviets crushed it in 1956 
this is a winwin trip for bush said larry sabato a 
university of virginia political scientist gorbachevs tepid 
reception in france lowers the standard of comparison between 
the two leaders trips 
in poland the oppositions newspaper printed an advertisement 
welcoming bush and his wife barbara and telling people where they 
could be go to see them 
similar leaflets were distributed in gdansk where the bushes 
will lunch at the home of solidarity leader lech walesa before 
visiting a workers monument outside the lenin shipyard the baltic 
sea birthplace of the trade movement 
bushs trip comes at a time of extraordinary change and political 
uncertainty in both poland and hungary 
when bush delivers a speech before the polish national assembly 
nearly half the lawmakers will be representatives of the oncebanned 
solidarity union they won their seats in the freest elections in 
eastern europe in the postwar era 
when he meets with the communist leadership in hungary he will 
be talking to selfdeclared reformers who until recently were on the 
fringes of power hungary permits free speech tolerates dissidents 
has a stock market with nearly 150 listings and unlike poland has 
a plentiful but expensive supply of consumer goods 
these are historic times bush said in a speech last week 
whats at stake is not just movement towards economic and 
political liberalization in poland and hungary but the prospect of 
ending the postwar division of europe 
at a separate news conference bush prodded all of the soviet 
unions partners to adopt reforms saying that better relations with 
the west hinge on certain conditions 
a little more democracy a little more freedom a little more 
openness 
come along with the flow things are changing in eastern 
europe dont be lagging way behind get out in front dont be 
afraid of democracy and freedom it isnt going to hurt anybody 
bush said his trip was not intended to stir up trouble for 
gorbachev or drive wedges between moscow and its allies 
i am delighted when he goes to germany bush said i am 
pleased when he goes to france it is good for world peace that he 
takes those trips and i expect he will be delighted when i go to 
poland and when i go to hungary 
while bush appeals for change in eastern europe poland and 
hungary are pleading for western assistance to help them cope with 
crippling western debt with a combined total exceeding 55 billion 
bush already has rejected solidaritys proposal for a 10 billion 
package of credits and investment guarantees from the west bush 
said that polish leaders communists and reformers alike have to 
accept the need of moving their economy to a freemarket system 
secretary of state james a baker iii dismissing 10 billion as 
not feasible or possible at this time said that to simply 
grant relief or make highly concessionary loans without reform in 
the final analysis will not get them where they want to go 
baker said that was the approach used in the 1970s and it 
certainly didnt have beneficial effects 
officials said that bushs aid proposal will require austerity 
measures by the poles and hungarians and will not involve direct 
financial help 
more likely bush is expected to offer support for loans from 
international lending institutions such as the international 
monetary fund press for restructuring and rescheduling of debt owed 
by poland and hungary and offer incentives for private investment in 
those countries bush announced some of these steps in a speech in 
april 
the administration expressed disappointment that congress had not 
completed action on a package of trade concessions for poland and 
hungary by the time of bushs trip 
one measure would make exports from poland eligible for dutyfree 
treatment a second bill would allow a fiveyear extension of 
mostfavorednation trade status to hungary that has the effect of 
suspending a law that bars trade concessions to certain communist 
nations until the united states is satisfied they have liberalized 
emigration policies 
in a reward for hungarys decision to hold talks on multiparty 
elections bush also said he will seek approval to lower tariffs for 
hungarian imports

carlos menem a threetime 
provincial governor and former political prisoner who has stirred 
hopes in a country mired in economic crisis was sworn in today as 
argentinas 46th president 
the 59yearold attorney and son of syrian immigrants called for 
national unity his acceptance speech in congress drew repeated 
applause 
argentina is not well he said its broken from these 
ruins we will construct the country we deserve 
this crisis is not an excuse it is an opportunity a 
challenge he told senators deputies and guests in the ornate 
chandeliered chamber 
it was the countrys first peaceful transition of political power 
between two elected presidents since 1928 
with faith and hope were going to move forward he said 
earlier today as he left his apartment for congress crowds along 
the way were enthusiastic but sparse on a chilly overcast winter 
morning 
also today congress formally accepted the resignations of 
president raul alfonsin and vice president victor martinez 
alfonsins election in 1983 ended a harsh sevenyear military 
dictatorship 
in a short written statement read by the parliamentary secretary 
alfonsin said the governments room for action was too limited to 
have much chance of success in dealing with problems in which any 
delay would cause greater suffering for everyone 
menem 59 won election may 14 to return the peronist party to 
power in the pink government house for the first time since 1976 
alfonsin a human rights attorney was prevented by law from 
running for reelection beset by increasing economic problems and 
military unrest alfonsin succumbed to pressure and decided to give 
up power five months before his constitutional mandate ended 
the preceding peronist government was overthrown by a military 
coup after isabel peron was toppled in march 1976 she was put 
under house arrest and menem then the governor of rural la rioja 
province was jailed for nearly five years 
menem takes over a nearly bankrupt country that has been wracked 
by hyperinflation rising unemployment and worsening unrest 
including food riots in which 14 people were killed in may 
the central bank is virtually without reserves and is 45 
billion behind in payments on the 60 billion foreign debt which is 
the thirdlargest in the developing world behind brazil and mexico 
the austral the national currency has lost 97 percent of its value 
against the us dollar in four months 
prices on goods and services have to be readjusted for inflation 
nearly daily far outstripping wage increases that are usually 
granted monthly and hunger in a country that exports beef and grain 
to the world is becoming more common 
residents of shantytowns in rosario argentinas thirdbiggest 
city and a meatpacking center looted food stores again this week 
prompting the arrests about 750 people 
about 25 percent of the 10 million residents in metropolitan 
buenos aires live in poverty a threefold increase since 1980 
according to the national institute of statistics and census nearly 
one of every three argentines lives in buenos aires the countrys 
cultural and financial capital 
menem plans to act quickly in the hopes of curtailing inflation 
and restarting argentinas agriculturalbased economy toward that 
end he appointed a multiparty cabinet that pledged national unity 
to lower the fiscal deficit and to try to attract foreign investment 
menem who likes to wear white suits and sport his trademark long 
sideburns reportedly has plans to try to streamline inefficient 
state companies but similar plans by the alfonsin government were 
repeatedly blocked by the peronists who are laborbased and fear 
loss of jobs 
argentines once jubilant at the election of alfonsin now view 
menem with a desperate hope 
i dont know if im happy or sad i just hope he can do 
something said roberto cucho a public relations specialist 
gas food bus fares everything seems to have gone up by 100 
percent in one day its infernal 
delegations from more than 70 countries seven of them led by 
heads of state and including us commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher have arrived for the inauguration 
it will be the first time in 61 years that an elected argentine 
president has given up power to an elected president from a 
different party 
the country has suffered six military coups since 1930 
alfonsin was to have served through dec 10 he announced on june 
12 that he was powerless to stabilize the economy menem 
subsequently agreed to take office early 
the heads of state included perus alan garcia and nicaraguas 
daniel ortega during the afternoon ortega and menem chatted at the 
luxurious alvear palace hotel sipping the herbal tea mate

the army has temporarily grounded more than 
3400 uh1 huey helicopters so a defective part installed in some of 
the choppers can be replaced a spokesman said saturday 
the spokesman lt col john chapla said the grounding was 
ordered following confirmation that a part that does not conform to 
the armys manufacturing standards may have been installed in some 
helicopters 
he said the part known as a universal control lever is a 
component of the system in uh1h uh1v and uh1d series helicopters 
that enables the pilot to control the aircraft 
army analysis indicated that the part showed hydrogen 
embrittlement a defect that leaves the part subject to potential 
failure chapla said failure of the part could cause loss of 
control of the aircraft 
the spokesman said the us army has about 3000 uh1h hueys as 
well as 400 to 500 uh1v helicopters specially equipped for medical 
evacuation 
the uh1ds have been provided to other countries and chapla said 
the army was advising foreign governments that they also should be 
grounded he said he did not have information on how many 
helicopters of that model were involved 
chapla said two other huey helicopter models the uh1c and uh1m 
were not affected by the grounding order

rival shiite moslem militias battled in 
the streets of west beirut on saturday while syrian and christian 
gunners dueled with howitzers across the citys dividing green line 
by police count six people were killed and 28 wounded in the 
separate fighting 
a police spokesman said three people were killed and 12 wounded 
in overnight clashes between the syrianbacked mainstream shiite 
amal militia and the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
the two factions are vying for dominance of the 12 million 
shiites the largest sect in lebanon 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with police rules 
said the fighting with automatic rifles and rocketpropelled 
grenades damaged dozens of cars and started fires in several 
apartments 
the intermittent clashes erupted anew july 1 with the fighting 
over the last two days starting in the seaside ouzai district and 
spreading to nearby haret hreik 
helmeted syrian troops responsible for security in west beirut 
patrolled the two districts in an effort to disengage the 
combatants the police spokesman said 
the situation is calm but very tense gunmen remain in 
entrances to buildings he said 
another three people died and 16 were wounded in artillery duels 
between syrian and christian gunners police said 
this brought the overall toll to 408 people killed and 1574 
wounded in the confrontation which began in march after the army 
commander gen michel aoun closed illegal militiarun ports that 
were sapping the nation of tax revenues 
syria and its allied militias retaliated by bombarding the 
christian enclave home to about 1 million people 
the dispute was complicated friday by threats from nabih berri 
head of the shiite amal militia to obtain mediumrange missiles to 
counter sovietdesigned frog7 missiles believed delivered to the 
christians from iraq 
the missiles have a range of 43 miles meaning they could hit the 
syrian capital damascus from the 310squaremile christian enclave 
northeast of beirut 
berri syrias closest ally in lebanon threatened to deploy 
frog7s in moslem areas 
lakhdar ibrahimi the assistant secretary general of the arab 
league met with aoun on saturday in an effort to resolve the issue 
it was his third meeting with aoun in as many days 
a source close to aoun speaking on condition of anonymity said 
ibrahimi is proposing that a special security committee be created 
to search ships heading to ports to ensure they are not carrying 
weapons 
syria accepts this proposal the source said 
he said aoun accepts that a ban on the import of weapons be 
imposed on all militias in lebanon but he strongly rejects the 
imposing of such measures on the lebanese army because the army 
cannot be treated as a militia the source added 
whether an army imports weapons or not is a decision for its 
command and its national authorities to take this is a practice of 
sovereignty that the general will not give up he said 
after his 90minute discussion with aoun ibrahimi crossed to 
west beirut and held a meeting with 10 moslem parliament deputies 
he described his talks as good and positive but refused to 
disclose details 
ibrahimi was sent by the leaders of morocco saudi arabia and 
algeria who were assigned by an arab summit in may to find a 
settlement to lebanons 14yearold civil war

the district of columbia council is poised to 
pass legislation that would hold handgun manufacturers financially 
liable for shooting injuries or deaths but progun forces hope to 
stop the measure on capitol hill 
the bill created in an attempt to slow the record murder rate 
and drugrelated crime wave in the nations capital is the first of 
its kind in the nation it would allow relatives of shooting and 
murder victims to sue the manufacturer and dealer of the weapon 
a final vote on the legislation will be held tuesday if passed 
it must be reviewed by congress which has ultimate legislative 
authority over the district 
i dont think congress will allow the bill to become law 
said richard gardner state and local affairs director at the 
national rifle association the bill places an extreme limitation 
on interstate commerce and the federal government is the only body 
that can regulate interstate commerce 
since the districts strict 1976 handgun ordinance bans the sale 
or manufacture of weapons in the nations capital the law could 
only be applied to manufacturers in other states gardner said 
its going to be tough up there conceded council chairman 
david clarke one of the bills sponsors i wouldnt even 
undertake it if i didnt believe so strongly that the legislation 
would help 
speaking at a public hearing on the bill held last month dc 
corporation counsel frederick cooke also said the bill might violate 
interstate commerce provisions protected by the constitution 
however clarke argued that plenty of legal precedent exists for 
such a bill 
strict liability laws exist in many states and have not been 
held to infringe on interstate commerce clarke said some 
states regulate dynamite other states liquor the newness here is 
the application to handguns 
the bill passed by an 84 margin in a preliminary vote held two 
weeks ago 
however at least one house member is planning to fight the bill 
if it pases the council 
rep stan parris rva a frequent critic of the district 
government is expected to try to block the legislation when it 
reaches the house last month parris likened the bill to an attempt 
to hold black and decker responsible for the texas chainsaw 
massacre 
parris was on vacation and unavailable for comment friday his 
office said 
rep bob carr dmich a member of the house appropriations 
district of columbia subcommittee is being pressured by the nra to 
oppose the measure but carr aides said he is unlikely to introduce 
legislation to scuttle the city law 
the nra is also asking other members to oppose the bill gardner 
said 
city officials have said extra police and stricter handgun 
legislation are needed to stem the murder rate through friday 
225 people have been killed in washington in 1989 compared with 153 
at that time last year in 1988 a record 372 people were killed 
police blame more than 60 percent of these slayings on drugs

a tehran newspaper said saturday that 
britains moslems might resort to violence if the british government 
does not punish author salman rushdie the islamic republic news 
agency reported 
the moslems in britain might have to consider ways that perhaps 
might not sit well with the desire for coexistence the agency 
quoted the englishlanguage daily tehran times as saying in an 
editorial 
if and when such developments shape up it will be only out of 
ignorance that one could blame the moslem community for the violence 
that might occur the paper added 
the warning came two days after a bomb blast damaged a london 
bookshop british authorities said the bomb was part of moslems 
campaign against rushdies latest novel the satanic verses 
which some consider insulting to islam 
moslems have demanded the amendment of britains blasphemy law so 
that legal action can be taken against rushdie 
the indianborn author who is a naturalized british citizen has 
been in hiding since feb 14 when the late iranian spiritual leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini issued an edict urging moslems to kill 
him 
two iranian moslem clergymen backed khomeini by offering a total 
of 52 million for rushdies death 
moslems in britain have staged several public demonstrations 
since then demanding the banning of the novel and rushdies 
punishment 
the issue led iran to break diplomatic relations with london in 
march 
the tehran times said that it was predictable that given the 
racist orientation of the cabinet of british prime minister 
margaret thatcher no justice would be done to the moslem 
minority

a major international association of computer 
professionals is planning to lift an 8yearold ban on contacts with 
the soviet union because of improvements in human rights and 
scientific freedom according to the groups president 
at the same time the association for computing machinery has 
sent letters to chinese leader deng xiaoping and other beijing 
officials expressing shock over violent suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement and warning that professional exchanges with 
china could be jeopardized 
bryan kocher president of the 73000member new yorkbased 
association said the ban on formal contacts with moscow had been 
adopted in 1981 primarily in response to the soviet invasion of 
afghanistan 
we stopped cooperating with any conferences that were being 
sponsored in the soviet union he said we stopped allowing 
their official delegations to register for our conferences 
basically we just shut them out 
kocher said he expects that the ban will be rescinded at the next 
meeting of the associations board of directors scheduled for late 
next month in san francisco 
the soviets have lightened up quite a bit and gotten out of 
afghanistan so the reason for banning cooperative ventures with 
them has now disappeared he said 
kocher added that we are mightily impressed by the progress 
thats being made there in the soviet union and would really like 
to encourage further progress in the area of human rights and 
scientific freedom 
regarding china he said it was estimated that 10 percent to 15 
percent of the 40000 chinese students currently attending us 
colleges and universities are studying computer science or 
engineering 
a fair number of those students and some of the visiting 
faculty are members of the acm kocher said we are rather 
concerned about what might happen to those people if they try to go 
back which we assume they will at some point 
he noted that a lot of the students here were supporting the 
freedom demonstrators there and theres some amount of worry that 
their professors and our colleagues have about their safety when 
they return 
kocher and barbara simons head of the associations scientific 
freedom and human rights committee late last month sent letters to 
deng and zhou guangzhao president of the chinese academy of 
sciences saying they were shocked by the recent violent 
suppression of peaceful dissent in china 
it is our sincere hope that technological exchanges with china 
involving computer professionals will not be further jeopardized by 
repressive policies of the chinese government kocher and ms 
simons wrote 
in a report to be published next month the scientific freedom 
and human rights committee said that of 134 soviet computer 
professionals listed in its last report four years ago 73 have been 
released from prison or emigrated 
with the accession of soviet president mikhail gorbachev and 
his policy of glasnost openness there have been improvements with 
respect to human rights it said 
the report said the number of political prisoners both 
computer professionals and others has decreased significantly and 
many reported as having been denied exit visas have now emigrated 
but it added that while crediting the soviet union with 
improvements we note that many human rights problems have yet to be 
resolved 
the report is to be published in the august issue of the 
associations journal communications of the acm

ask the us state department to pressure british officials to 
ignore the ruling and extradite jens soering a west german 
diplomats son 
updike called the ruling outrageous and said he it believed it 
was based on politics and diplomacy rather than logic 
soering 22 is accused of stabbing and slitting the throats of 
derek and nancy haysom in their bedford county home in march 1985 
the retired steel executive and his wife were the parents of 
soerings girlfriend at the time elizabeth haysom she pleaded 
guilty to helping plan the slayings and is serving a 90year prison 
sentence in virginia soering was arrested in britain 
the european court of human rights ruled friday that extraditing 
soering would violate his human rights because he faces the death 
penalty 
rulings by the court a branch of the 23nation council of 
europe are not binding to the 23 nations but are rarely ignored 
soering who is in a london prison has been fighting extradition 
to the united states since may 1986 west germany has also requested 
his extradition seeking to let him stand trial there under a law 
that allows west germans accused of crimes in other countries to be 
tried in their homeland he would face a maximum sentence of 10 to 
15 years if tried in west germany 
soering boasted in a letter to ms haysom a few months after 
their arrest in london that diplomatic steps would block his 
extradition to bedford county she had returned to the united states 
voluntarily 
those yokels dont know whats coming down soering had 
written in a letter which became public during ms haysoms legal 
proceedings he predicted he would go to west germany and then 
ill be out in a surprisingly short time 
updike was incensed by that prospect friday 
this individual brutally murdered two human beings updike 
said during a news conference at the bedford county courthouse 
they may very well turn him loose 
soerings attorney said the european courts decision means 
that the tragedy of four years ago will not be compounded by another 
homicide 
for the us it means that a significant segment of the 
worlds population now rejects the us death penalty system 
richard neaton said in a statement released from his office in 
detroit where soerings father was stationed 
updike said the decision is founded in politics and diplomacy 
it is without question outrageous 
the international court allowed extradition in two previous death 
penalty cases he said and the only difference in this case was 
that the defendant had diplomatic and political connections 
updike also challenged the courts argument that soering if 
found guilty would face years on death row punishment that would 
breach his rights under the european human rights convention 
if there is a delay in the appellate process it occurs at his 
request updike said 
updike maintained he would not compromise by dropping the capital 
murder charge and agreeing to try soering on lesser charges of 
firstdegree murder 
i do not negotiate with murderers he said im not going 
to negotiate with him or anyone else on his behalf murder is 
not a matter of diplomacy 
soerings father klaus soering is vice consul at the west 
german consulate in detroit the german government argued on behalf 
of his son before the european court 
the council of europe the oldest organization striving for 
european unity was founded in 1949 and is separate from the 
12nation european economic community

sen john glenn the first american to orbit 
the earth says he does not favor a high level of cooperation with 
the soviet union in space because the united states would have to 
reveal a lot of advanced technology 
i dont want to see the focal point of the worlds attention on 
scientific greatness going to the soviet union and the kids of the 
world aspiring to go to patrice lumumba university in moscow instead 
of ohio state or cal tech or mit the ohio democrat said in a 
television interview taped for broadcast on sunday 
i dont want to see us transfer a lot of technology over there 
and help that whole program out glenn said on the program john 
mclaughlins one on one 
he said the united states and the soviet union have had 
cooperative programs for a long time the 1975 apollosoyuz linkup

in the space station program by buying a module as the european 
space agency and the japanese are doing 
if we start cooperation like that ok glenn said but as 
far as having another apollosoyuz type thing id sort of question

bush administration officials said saturday 
that hardline positions adopted by israeli and palestinian leaders 
have dealt a potentially fatal setback to hopes that proposed 
elections in the occupied territories could be a step toward peace 
an official who flew to this arabian peninsula sultanate aboard 
secretary of state james a bakers plane told reporters that 
neither side had shown much restraint since the palestinian election 
proposal was set forth by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir in 
april 
at a news conference in brunei on friday baker characterized as 
not helpful a series of restrictions agreed to by israels likud 
party concerning terms for the proposed election in the west bank 
and the gaza strip 
flying here from brunei for a 36hour visit reporters traveling 
with baker were told that the likud position was akin to the 
palestinian demand announced previously that elections are not 
feasible so long as the israeli occupation continues 
these are the kind of things that fall under the category of 
deal breakers said the official insisting on anonymity we had 
requested that both sides refrain from doing that both sides have 
done it 
the official said that both sides are responding to the pressure 
of hardline elements from within their respective ranks 
the likud demands most upsetting to us officials involved the 
pledge to continue expansion of israeli settlements in the 
territories and the demand that elections be deferred with the 
palestinians end their 18month uprising against israeli rule 
we will continue to try to work with this proposal because we 
always thought it offered us the best possibility of getting the 
parties into negotiations the official said 
but he added theres no doubt that this makes it harder to 
make progress 
the elections would be designed to choose interlocutors who 
would be authorized to negotiate terms of a settlement with israeli 
officials 
the official said that if the election idea proves unworkable 
the united states may look a bit more closely at proposals to 
advance the peace process through an international conference on the 
middle east 
but were not at that point yet he said 
at his friday news conference baker indicated that one source of 
encouragement to him was that the new restrictions concerning the 
elections were those of the likud party and not the israeli 
government 
the us position is that the administration deals with 
governments and that the likud stand is an internal israeli domestic 
political issue 
but the senior official who briefed reporters seemed to 
acknowledge that there is not much of a difference between the likud 
position and that of the government under israels coalition 
arrangement between the likud and the labor parties 
baker arrived here in the early morning hours after visits to 
japan and brunei where he attended a conference of the sixmember 
association of southeast asian nations asean and other outside 
parties 
although he has brief meetings planned with omani officials the 
principle purpose of the trip purpose of his visit is to rest up for 
the fourcountry european trip he will undertake with president bush 
starting sunday in poland 
the highlight of the trip will be the sevennation economic 
summit of industrialized countries in paris this week

seventytwo years after congress stripped 
buffalo bill cody of his medal of honor the indian scouts name has 
been restored to the honor roll 
hes entitled to the honor he was given the honor and he 
should have the honor said buffalo bills grandson 76yearold 
bill g cody weve always contended that once he was awarded the 
medal they shouldnt revoke it especially after he was dead 
william f buffalo bill cody who became a famous western 
showman after the indian wars received the medal in 1872 for his 
gallantry as an army scout during the wars 
but it was revoked along with medals of 910 other recipients in 
1917 after congress retroactively tightened up the rules for the 
honor among other changes congress held that only enlisted men and 
officers could receive the award a scout was considered a civilian 
in all five scouts lost medals in 1917 
us sens alan simpson and malcolm wallop who jointly announced 
the armys decision friday said buffalo bill deserved the honor 
todays action by the army sets the record straight wallop 
said after extensive research and review of the facts the army 
has decided that buffalo bill clearly deserves our nations highest 
honor 
buffalo bill gained fame for his western show that toured the 
country and europe glamorizing the western frontier with real 
cowboys and indians reenacting battles 
paul fees senior curator of the buffalo bill historical center 
in cody wyo a town named for buffalo bill said the western 
show may have cost buffalo bill some credibility as a real hero 
fridays action restores that credibility said fees 
the fact that this medal was restored for cause people can 
believe that he was a true hero and earned his reputation rather 
than had it invented for him through press agents said fees 
buffalo bill known by his contemporaries as a pony express 
rider indian scout and buffalo hunter received the honor for valor 
after leading a cavalry charge against a raiding band of sioux 
indians he killed two recovered several horses and pursued the 
retreating band 
although buffalo bills name was stricken from the medal of honor 
roll in february 1917 one month after he died the medal itself was 
never recalled and remains in the historical center 
fees said only one of the other 910 persons to lose medals in the 
1917 purge of the rolls has since regained it a woman army surgeon 
during the civil war whose medal was restored in 1978 
he said he hoped that the families of the other four scouts 
affected by the 72yearold ruling would take the same steps the 
cody family did to get their relatives medals awarded again

if other states follow missouris lead and ban abortions in 
public hospitals it could undermine the nations system of 
providing legal abortions some medical and legal experts say 
although relatively few abortions are conducted in public 
hospitals advocates say they provide a vital link in the abortion 
chain by training physicians counseling patients and performing 
abortions for poor women and those who are considered high medical 
risks 
if you lose public hospitals you lose all abortions said 
alice kirkman a spokeswoman for the national abortion federation 
an association of abortion providers 
the supreme court last week upheld key provisions of missouris 
law limiting abortions including a ban on most abortions in public 
hospitals 
of the 16 million abortions performed in the united states in 
1985 87 percent took place in clinics or doctors offices while 
only 13 percent were in hospitals according to the 
proabortionrights alan guttmacher institute 
only 265 of the 1191 hospitals performing abortions were 
classified as public 
youre really not talking about a major proportion of all 
abortions said larry gage president of the national association 
of public hospitals but that doesnt mean that public hospitals 
arent an important part of the process 
the 85 members of his association train 20 percent of all medical 
residents in the country gage said the naph represents mostly 
large urban governmentrun hospitals 
these are enormously important training grounds for our 
obstetricians and gynecologists people who will be called upon to 
perform abortions if they remain legal he said 
missouris law bars public facilities and public employees from 
performing an abortion unless it is necessary to save a womans life 
advocates on both sides of the issue say lifethreatening 
pregnancies are rare and that the ruling will effectively halt 
abortions in missouris public hospitals 
the most drastic scenarios assume that the missouri law will 
sweep like wildfire through the other 49 state legislatures which 
few say seems likely some experts say last weeks ruling is mainly 
important as a precurser of more sweeping action by the supreme 
court next year 
in the short term the ruling wont change many lives missouri 
officials so far have applied the law to only two public hospitals 
which together accounted for only 90 of the states 17382 abortions 
in 1988 
in other places with more liberal abortion policies public 
hospitals take a more active role more than 8000 of new york 
citys 100000 abortions in 1985 were performed in cityrun 
facilities but new york is unlikely to outlaw such abortions 
the ultimate effect of the missouri law is difficult to gauge in 
part because the supreme court ruling raises a sticky question what 
is a public facility 
the short answer is that nobody seems quite sure 
is it a government owned and operated hospital yes is it a 
privately owned hospital that relies heavily on public funds 
probably is it a privately owned hospital that accepts only 
medicare payments who knows 
its confusing to me conceded mark roebuck a spokesman for 
the missouri department of health im trying to find answers to 
it myself 
its not surprising that theres confusion gage said 
there was confusion in the decision itself 
gage referred to a concurring opinion by justice sandra day 
oconnor in which she brushed aside an argument that the law could 
lead to abortion bans at private hospitals whose only public subsidy 
was public water and sewage lines 
whether such a ban would be constitutional need not be decided 
here she said 
james bopp general counsel for the national right to life 
committee laughed at the sewage argument i wouldnt go that 
far he said i dont think thats whats contemplated here 
yet bopp said he did think the missouri law could be applied to 
private hospitals that accept medicare payments a definition that 
would include virtually every hospital in the country 
he compared the abortion issue to civil rights cases in which 
courts have found that institutions that discriminate cannot receive 
federal funds 
theres an important public policy in prohibiting 
discrimination based on race bopp said and in our view theres 
an important public policy in choosing childbirth over abortion

a 63yearold woman who disappeared after 
she was accused of killing her lover 21 years ago only to be 
discovered earlier this year has pleaded guilty to a charge of 
manslaughter 
bernice van heise also known as gretta knickerbocker was 
accused in the jan 31 1968 shooting death of eugene douglas a 
48yearold glenview artist 
she had told police after the killing that the gun fired 
accidentally when she was handing it to douglas authorities said 
douglas was killed by a single gunshot to the back of the head 
a judge had initially rejected a murder charge ruling there was 
insufficient evidence a grand jury later indicted her for murder 
but she had disappeared the indictment was withdrawn in 1975 
ms van heise was reindicted in february after authorities 
received a tip and located her in the rural town of elburn about 40 
miles west of chicago where she went by the name gretta 
knickerbocker she and her husband of 20 years conrad 
knickerbocker had moved there in 1976 from the chicago suburb of 
hinsdale

advised his client against making the plea but considered her 
competent to do so

hartel that witnesses would testify that ms van heise and douglas 
had been having an affair for about a year and that she shot douglas 
when he told her he was ending it to return to his wife and children

three years after a trial a federal judge 
still has not ruled in a case that could change the way an estimated 
60000 newspaper reporters editors and photographers in this 
country are paid 
the trial of the us department of labor vs the concord monitor 
took just 10 days in june 1986 but court officials say there is no 
deadline for us district judge shane devine to act and no 
indication when he will 
the labor department charged that the monitor owed about 46000 
in overtime to 51 employees who worked at the 21500circulation 
newspaper from february 1978 until january 1980 
central to the case is the definition of a professional 
the monitor the first paper not to settle such a lawsuit out of 
court in 40 years argued that journalists are professionals and 
therefore exempt from overtime provisions of the 1934 fair labor 
standards act 
the act labels most reporters editors and photographers as 
nonprofessionals and eligible for overtime pay or compensatory time 
off for hours worked past a 40hour limit 
the regulations define editorial writers columnists critics and 
topflight writers of analytical and interpretive articles as 
professionals 
others considered professional include those with a knowledge of 
a particular field such as doctors lawyers and teachers and those 
whose work is original and creative in character in a recognized 
field of artistic endeavors such as dancers actors painters and 
shortstory writers 
journalists unions and other organizations in the awkward 
position of having to argue that their members are not 
professionals warned that if the monitor prevails it could mean 
long hours and low pay for the nations journalists 
barry lipton president of the newspaper guilds local 3 in new 
york said thursday that devines delay hurts journalists 
we would expect to prevail on the issue and the absence of a 
ruling has a tendency to make everything cloudy lipton said in a 
telephone interview i think the law in general responds too 
slowly to labor matters 
george wilson the monitors president and former publisher said 
thursday that pending a ruling his newspaper has been complying 
with the labor departments interpretation of federal law even if 
we disagree with the findings 
wilson speculated that devine has not issued an opinion yet 
because the concord court which has only two judges has been 
inundated by a dramatic increase in felony trials and other complex 
civil cases 
during the trial monitor officials argued that 40yearold 
interpretations of the federal overtime law used a nowoutdated 
notion of how journalists work 
then many reporters were legmen gathering facts and 
telephoning them into the newsroom for someone else to write they 
said 
media experts testifying for the monitor said contemporary 
reporters and editors regularly use creativity imagination and 
specialized knowledge 
on the one hand we have tried to encourage a bright 
intelligent staff to work on its own and on the other hand we had 
the labor departments timeclock mentality wilson said as the 
trial closed 
the department focused on whether monitor employees were 
discouraged from filing for overtime pay as several testified 
the government presented an expert witness ben bagdikian a 
45year journalism veteran pulitzer prizewinner and former 
washington post managing editor who scorned discussion of 
imagination and creativity in reporters 
if the work of the journalist is primarily invention and 
imagination then that reporter is usually fired he said 
in a similar labor department overtime lawsuit against the 
washington post us district judge gerhard gesell ruled in january 
1988 that 13 post editors and reporters were artistic professionals 
but gesell made the ruling on a motion for summary judgment 
before a trial and an appeals court since has thrown out his ruling 
and ordered him to hold a trial 
devine could rule on whether all journalists are or are not 
professionals or he could decide to rule on the narrow question of 
whether overtime pay is owed to the 51 reporters involved in the 
labor department action and limit the professionalism question to 
the monitor staff or to newspapers in new hampshire

president pw botha invited 
nelson mandela the imprisoned african national congress leader to 
his official residence this week for a conversation the government 
announced today 
it was the first time the two are known to have met and increased 
speculation that botha may free mandela before leaving office in the 
fall 
justice minister kobie coetsee said mandela who is serving a 
life prison term at the victor verster prison farm north of cape 
town paid a courtesy visit wednesday to tuynhuys bothas 
official residence in the city center 
coetsee said no policy matters were debated and no negotiations 
were conducted but that the two men availed themselves of the 
opportunity to confirm their support for peaceful development in 
south africa 
the minister said the 45minute conversation took place in a 
pleaseant spirt but the possibility of further steps or 
meetings was not discussed during the occasion coetsee said he 
was present during the visit 
normally such a major announcement would not have been made on a 
saturday night but a reporter for the independent south african 
press association heard about the visit and called a spokesman for 
coetsee who confirmed it 
the announcement was carried by the news agency and subsequently 
read on governmentrun television spokesmen for the justice 
minister would not say why the meeting had been kept secret 
mandela who will be 71 years old on july 18 has been in prison 
since 1962 he was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 after being 
convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow of the government 
he is the nations most respected black leader and other leaders 
of the black majority have refused to negotiate with the government 
until he is freed 
botha 73 is to retire after the september parliamentary 
elections and there has been widespread speculation he may free 
mandela before stepping down 
in the past botha refused to consider freeing the anc leader 
unless he renounced violence which mandela refused to do unless the 
government halted violence against blacks however during the past 
year botha has dropped the renunciation requirement and said he 
hopes it will be possible to free mandela 
the anc is a primarily black guerrilla group fighting the 
nations whiteled government the group based in lusaka zambia 
is banned in south africa 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs 
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services

environmentalists have won a preliminary round in 
their fight to block construction of a second hotel on the 
littledeveloped north rim of the grand canyon 
us district judge paul rosenblatt granted a preliminary 
injunction friday at the request of the sierra club legal defense 
fund which claims the park service failed to conduct a proper 
environmental impact study for the 200room project 
sierra club attorneys also argued the 5 million hotel would 
detract from the experience of visiting the grand canyon 
park service officials have said an environmental assessment they 
performed was sufficient because the hotel site is located at an 
already developed area near the existing 200room lodge the only 
lodging on the north rim 
the park service contended that it complied with legal 
requirements and that the new hotel is needed because current 
lodging doesnt meet demand 
the preliminary injunction will allow construction of employee 
housing by tw recreational services the company contracted to build 
the hotel 
were extremely pleased said fern shepard a lawyer for the 
sierra club we think that this is really an important decision 
for the grand canyon 
we hope the park service will now go back and prepare an 
environmental impact study and look to see if this project was 
really even necessary in the first place she said 
im very dissapointed said gene cohen the attorney 
representing tw services adding that the judge doesnt address 
the arguements that we made 
he was concerned in the opinion that the 1984 contract was 
executed before the environmental assesment was done that seems to 
have troubled the judge cohen said as we understand it there 
is nothing wrong with that 
jack davis superintendent of grand canyon national park said 
park service officials would meet this week to decide whether to 
appeal or go to trial on the sierra club suit 
cohen said the delay has already cost tw services valuable time 
because the north rim more than 7000 feet above sea level allows 
only a brief summer building season and the hotel will take two 
seasons to construct

us military action is decided by the president 
cisneros us army south is part of the us southern command 
and includes army forces charged with the defense of the panama 
canal under the torrijoscarter treaties of 1977 
cisneros was the southern commands chief of operations until two 
weeks ago in that job he had frequent contact with officers of the 
panamanian defense forces 
noriega sees me as a definite threat he said before i 
used to have some serious and frank discussions with some of the 
officers and would tell them how noriega was using them i would 
tell them you are next 
cisneros often criticizes noriega and the defense forces and he 
is in turn attacked by the government media which claim he has 
betrayed his mexicanamerican ancestry by becoming an army general 
and leading us forces in panama 
the removal of the panamanian general cisneros said would 
ensure democracy for this country from the beginning i always 
thought that panamanians should do it but if they do not if they 
do not have the desire then they deserve him 
if we acted militarily cisneros said from what we know 
the majority of the defense forces will not fight 
but we would act only if there is a threat to us interests 
he said 
time is on our side cisneros said things will continue to 
deteriorate 
the american general said he saw little chance of an internal 
coup by disenchanted panamanian officers 
some officers want us to act militarily but those are the same 
that probably tell noriega they are loyal to him they know their 
fate depends on noriegas survival i do not see anyone there with 
moral courage he said 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since a miami 
court last year indicted him on drug trafficking charges 
on may 7 noriega annulled presidential elections international 
observers say a slate led by the oppositions guillermo endara beat 
noriegas candidate carlos duque by at least a 31 margin 
noriega claims the us government financed the oppositions 
campaign and intervened to distort the results 
noriega also charges that the united states wants to renege on 
the panama canal treaties that specify us forces must leave panama 
on the last day of the year 1999 when panama takes over total 
administration of the canal 
under the treaties the united states maintains nearly 12000 
soldiers in military bases here

a black priest who is trying to establish a new 
catholic rite planned to hold services for the second week in a row 
sunday in open defiance of a ban by church authorities 
rev george a stallings jr 41 will say mass and perform 
sacraments despite his suspension by the roman catholic archdiocese 
of washington a spokesman for stallings said 
in the eyes of the catholic church its without the consent of 
the archbishop but its within the cultural needs of the 
individuals who would want to worship here stallings spokesman 
hayden blanc said in an interview saturday 
it is the intention of the congregation to stay within the 
catholic church blanc said the services of the imani temple 
named after the swahili word for faith will be held in a suburban 
washington high school auditorium 
but as in a service last week that drew an estimated 3000 people 
to the grounds of howard university stallings will include african 
religious rites and add readings from black authors to the standard 
scripture and sacraments blanc said 
stallings has said the new congregation is necessary because the 
catholic church has failed cultural and spiritual needs of its 
black parishioners stallings has also charged the church with 
racism 
he has said he wants to see formation of an africanamerican 
catholic rite which would still recognize the authority of the pope 
but have more control over its liturgy and other matters 
the church is not contemplating any further discipline for now a 
spokesman for the washington archdiocese said 
he is a suspended priest the church is not going to stand 
behind anything he does sacramentally said rev william lori 
secretary to washington cardinal james a hickey obviously a 
suspended priest is not supposed to say mass in public or in 
private 
hickey suspended stallings last week after the service at 
howard the church has since adopted a wait and see response 
lori said 
were not going to be rushed into anything and were asking 
him to reconcile he said 
lori said there are no meetings between stallings and church 
officials scheduled he has said there are no plans to excommunicate 
stallings now 
obviously imani temple is just an infant were not going 
to rush into any kind of rash judgement and we dont regard what 
father stallings says as the final word lori said 
stallings has said he cannot be excommunicated from god even 
if the church moves to strip him of his ordination 
lori said the church cannot guarantee mass and communion 
observed at imani temple would be recognized elsewhere in the 
catholic church but he said there will be no church action against 
practicing catholics who attend stallings services one service 
at imani temple does not erase a lifetime of catholicism lori 
said 
stallings spokesman blanc said he expected more than 1000 people 
at the 11 am service sunday he said response to the new chuch 
from black catholics has been positive 
from the papers you would think there has been so much 
opposition there really isnt as far as the phones are concerned 
once in a blue moon we may get someone who has a question blanc 
said 
priests from many of the areas 40 predominately black parishes 
have issued statements supporting hickey and the church 
lori said many of those churches offer socalled gospel masses 
like those stallings delivered during 12 years as pastor of a black 
church here 
the church has said racism is a sin father stallings is 
not the first one to make that charge and hes not making it to a 
church that isnt listening hickey spokesman lori said 
the church is not upset at father stallings because he points 
out the need for better ministry to black catholics the problem 
is that he is going about it in the wrong way lori said

four flat tires in one day didnt keep a 
bright red 1924 bentley from roaring across the finish line with 
just seconds to spare in a race from virginia to disneyland 
dick burdick drove the classic car from coast to coast to take 
first place and 50000 friday in the interstate batteries great 
american race 
the rosanky texas resident had finished second in the 12day 
3500mile road rally the previous two years 
we finally broke the spell and did it said burdick who has 
participated in the antique car race for seven consecutive years 
the most frustrating time was the day with all the flat 
tires he said its a rally and you cant rally if you dont 
have four wheels under you 
the flat tires were between santa fe nm and phoenix 
burdick and his navigator wayne bell of lake oswego ore 
nudged out alan travis who was last years winner 
travis from phoenix and his navigator wayne stanfield of 
tustin calif drove a 1916 egge machine co mitchell roadster 
in all the race featured 113 cars made before world war ii it 
began in norfolk va on june 26 
the competition which usually runs from west to east was a 
little tougher this year because it started in the east and headed 
west leaving the desert crossing for the final grueling days 
in previous years the desert was the first leg of the journey 
and once you get across the great divide its all downhill from 
there said sam cole one of the organizers of greatrace ltd

principal joe clark said saturday that his 
steelfisted reign over the innercity high school he ran for eight 
years apparently is over thanks to hostile town officials 
the school board suspended him for five days in march after 
scantily clad dancers performed at a school assembly while he was 
out of town he blamed the suspension on politicians who envied the 
spotlight he enjoyed a spotlight that has included the cover of 
time magazine and a hollywood movie 
he said saturday that he probably will formalize his departure 
after he uses up his vacation days 
the city council is questioning how i have 300 days of vacation 
coming to me clark said at a news conference i havent had a 
vacation for 12 years 
clark released saturday from newark beth israel medical center 
following heart surgery six weeks ago said his biggest 
accomplishment was showing that black and hispanic students in the 
inner city can behave 
educating them is another story he added because when a 
student comes to my school with a thirdgrade education i cant 
move him up to a 12thgrade level in a few years 
his nononsense approach to education was symbolized by a 
baseball bat and bullhorn he wielded during patrols of the halls at 
patersons eastside high school his efforts which included 
expelling and suspending dozens of students he said were 
troublemakers and drug dealers were depicted in the movie lean on 
me 
doctors will allow him to give a lecture tour beginning in 
september clark said he already has about 40 dates lined up at 
7000 a speech not bad for a ghetto boy

thirtyeight years ago charles tasnadi left 
his native hungary on his belly scrabbling a tortuous path to 
freedom through frozen minefields and waves of barbed wire he will 
return tuesday on air force one 
as george bush pays the first visit to budapest by an american 
president tasnadi 64 an associated press photographer will be 
with him to capture that moment on film he will record an even more 
special moment in his heart 
when the military band strikes up the star spangled banner 
during the arrival ceremonies at the kossuth statue a monument to 
the hungarian hero who fought the hapsburgs in budapest i will 
remember a small boy scout standing at that same statue he said 
and i will also remember that following world war ii my church 
choir was forbidden by the stalinist puppet regime to sing the 
us national anthem to thank america for its postwar help 
tasnadi was just shy of his 26th birthday when he and his 
sweetheart maria seized upon the first heavy snowfall of the 
195051 winter to seek a new life a championship skier he 
concocted a story about heading for the slopes sharing the truth 
only with his mother who by design would report him missing two 
days later 
joining a group of six other adults and two children one of 
whom tasnadi carried on his shoulders during the final nightlong 
leg across the border the couple slipped into austria eluded more 
soviet guards in the 50mile soviet zone of that nation and made it 
to salzburg several days later 
they nearly didnt the other child carried by another man had 
to be knocked unconscious to keep it from crying and alerting the 
guards and it was so miserably cold tasnadi recalls twice i 
fell through the ice up to my chest i couldnt even feel it when 
we got to a house on the austrian side i kicked off my brand new 
shoes so they would dry out when i woke up they were so shriveled 
up i couldnt use them 
he and maria were quickly married in salzburg but their dream of 
raising a family in the united states was at first stymied by 
immigration authorities so they moved to venezuela instead where 
tasnadis newspaper photography eventually drew the aps attention 
and an invitation to join the news service in the united states he 
was assigned to the washington bureau in 1964 and has worked there 
since 
twice over the years maria has returned to hungary but tasnadi 
torn by conflicting emotions kept postponing the trip his mother 
now deceased had long since emigrated to the united states i 
finally said ok this is the year i go he said then it 
wasnt two weeks before i got the assignment to go with the 
president of the united states maria will stay behind 
prior assignment have taken him to the soviet union cuba and 
other communist nations and the castro government has accorded him 
several unusual photo privileges out of respect for his work 
since i became an american citizens i try to be very polite to 
the soviet bloc he said i want to be sure of my objectivity 
ive never tried to make a bad picture of any communist leader 
the only time i talk politics is when i vote 
but tasnadis love of the united states is legion among 
washington circles an american flag adorns his mailbox and despite 
his courtly manners he will fight you if you say anything bad 
about his country or his flag says toby massey washington 
assistant chief of bureau for newsphotos 
massey recalled that when tasnadi was about to take his 
citizenship test in 1968 charlie was a nervous wreck he studied 
so hard and had everybody giving him spot quizzes another ap 
photographer henry burroughs accompanied tasnadi to the courtroom 
as his sponsor as it turned out said massey the judge was a 
college roommate of burroughs and didnt ask tasnadi a single 
question 
other anecdotes abound about the americanization of tasnadi when 
he was first assigned to cover a baseball game he quickly surmised 
that the best action occurred around second base so he promptly 
walked onto the field and took his position just feet from the bag 
at a professional football game a perplexed tasnadi kept 
glancing skyward as he paced the sidelines when a colleague asked 
him why tasnadi pointed to the ball on section of the 
scoreboard and said i cant find the balloon 
and during a national political convention tasnadis assignment 
editor ordered him to relieve a colleague ray stubblebine who had 
taken ill on one of the photo towers in the hall go over there 
and spell stubblebine the editor demanded tasnadi didnt move 
damn it charlie i said go over there and spell stubblebine 
the editor barked 
im sorry said tasnadi if i cant spell it here i cant 
spell it over there 
professionally tasnadi gets most things right he was won 
several white house press photographers awards and counts several 
presidents among his friends once in vail colo he got a knock 
on his door at 2 am mr tasnadi said his caller the 
president would be honored if you could ski with him tomorrow 
riding up the chairlift with gerald r ford tasnadi recalled 
i thought my god if anybody would have told me when i was 
waiting with that little boy in my arms to cross that minefield 
that one day i would be riding up a mountain with the president of 
the united states oh my god 
despite the trend toward more political tolerance in hungary 
tasnadi still confesses some apprehension about his emotional 
readiness for his first return to his homeland my worst fear 
he said tears welling in his eyes is an evening at an old 
restaurant in budapest with a glass of tokay served to the strains 
of violins that could prove to be disastrous 
asked what picture he would like to shoot most in hungary he 
replied there are so many but when i see that statue of lajos 
kossuth before the war i was chosen as one of two little boy 
scouts who would go there on weekends and stand at attention for two 
hours as honor guard and now the president will go there when i 
see that statue again 
his tears finished the sentence

in what once was her mothers living room 
doris stone jones supervises the business office of the magazine 
telephone co where customers using the 765 lines the town has 
799 residents are greeted by their first names 
three generations of stones have kept the telephone lines humming 
in this western arkansas community for half a century 
mrs jones remembers how as a child she could hear operators at 
the parlor switchboard and neighborly chatter on party lines 
her brother hank stone monitors the constantly clicking 
switches in the narrow redbrick technical building next door while 
his sons denny chris and vic take care of outside wiring 
chris wife cheryl punches billing information into the 
companys brandnew and only computer terminal 
the magazine telephone co is listed by the public service 
commission as the secondsmallest of the states 30 telephone 
companies 
in a small town you get a lot of personal service said mrs 
jones 61 whose parents henry and anna stone bought the company 
in august 1939 our family is so telephoneoriented our family 
reunion was a telephone convention in oklahoma city 
in 1939 the company had 10 customers two pay phones and 
haybaling wire for emergency repairs during world war ii students 
worked part time as operators a fulltime vacation relief operator 
earned a dime an hour 
on election nights anna stone now retired stayed up late to 
relay returns to the county seat at paris 15 miles away 
in the 1950s lines were run to nearby waveland blue mountain 
and sugar grove and the company went to dial service twentytwo 
customers once crowded a single party line to waveland by 1970 the 
company had two exchanges 947 and 969 
mrs jones said technical advances havent hampered the 
neighborly nature of the operation where basic service costs 831 
a month the family understood when one customer short on cash 
dropped her wedding ring into the night depository slot the ring 
was returned mrs jones said 
the business office replete with color portraits of 10 
grandchildren offers telephone directories published by the contel 
phone company where hank stone works during the day as a senior 
technician 
magazines listings are included in the contel book because its 
too expensive to publish a local directory mrs jones said the 
stones are frugal in other ways too including the avoidance of 
such modern business practices as taking out loans 
we dont borrow she said everything you see is ours 
hanks sons who all began fulltime at the job at the age of 18 
or so took a lunch break at the business office the other day 
after an early start to repair lines knocked out by storms during 
the night 
i was out till 1130 getting the phone back up at the ranger 
station in waveland said chris 29 
added denny 33 one came to my house last night and left a 
message about service being out theyre back up now 
its a living its a job said vic 31 we aint getting 
rich but we live comfortable 
all three sons learned their work from their dad helping out 
during summer vacations before they began full time the education 
came in handy when a chicken feed truck driver forgot to lower his 
boom and tore down a mile of cable on a fourth of july recalled 
chris 
yep we work holidays if we need to he said and we did 
get to shoot fireworks later that night 
don dickens chief of the magazine volunteer fire department 
praises the companys cooperation 
when theres a fire you dial 8400 and it rings 20 different 
telephones at 20 different firemens houses and everybody just 
picks up the phone and finds out the location dickens said 
its like a conference call and it works great 
the firemens phones also are rigged with a button that sets off 
a public siren dickens said 
now thats telephone service he said 
postmaster phyllis webster agrees 
its small yes but i dont have any complaints about the 
telephone company she said im comfortable with it and it 
suits the way we live here just really well

from san francisco and dallas from small towns in 
mississippi and michigan about 20000 naacp members are gathering 
for their annual convention to debate renew acquaintances and 
regain momentum 
the nations oldest and largest civil rights group opens its 
annual convention in detroit on sunday 
its the people from the various communities around the country 
who set the positions thats the beauty of this organization 
said the rev richard dockery of dallas southwest regional director 
of the naacp 
annual dues were 50 cents when dockery 65 joined the national 
association for the advancement of colored people in 1939 he lived 
in mobile ala deep in the heart of dixie where you had to have 
courage or a shotgun 
in the years since dues have grown to 10 a year but now as 
then dockery said the naacp is the most important voice for black 
americans 
its the organization for our people he said before leaving 
for detroit last week 
the naacp which claims 500000 members nationwide was founded 
in 1909 by web dubois and others 
over the years it has won many battles including desegregation 
of the military schools and public facilities voting and other 
civil rights some including the effort to overcome economic 
inequality between the races it has not other fights that appeared 
won now are in doubt said benjamin hooks naacp executive director 
since 1977 
a series of recent us supreme court decisions just emasculate 
the civil rights laws hooks said in fact its going to get a 
lot worse before it gets better 
its a sad fact that were still about the same thing we were 
when we were founded in 1909 eliminating all forms of racial 
discrimination racism sexism are alive and well 
despite the grim appraisal the spirits of hooks and other 
delegates appeared joyful on the eve of the 80th annual convention 
he said the supreme court decisions have boosted interest in the 
organization particularly among young black professionals 
for many members the gathering offers a chance to see old 
friends share experiences and regain a spirit of hope said lulann 
sapp mcgriff san francisco chapter president 
mcgriff a member for 13 years and former national staff member 
said she looked forward to seeing the 1300 young people 
participating in the naacps annual black olympics competition 
in science humanities and the arts 
the actso competition short for afroacademic cultural 
technological and scientific olympics will award 150000 in 
scholarships 
for me that is the highlight of the convention seeing the 
black young people showing their scholarship mcgriff said 
youve got poets writers musicians its a phenomenal thing to 
see 
in addition to debating resolutions on topics ranging from aids 
to urban decay the delegates will get a chance to hear from a 
parade of politicians as well as an assortment of entertainers 
vice president dan quayle speaks wednesday and 1988 democratic 
presidential hopeful jesse jackson on thursday also appearing are 
two members of president bushs cabinet housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp and health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan 
other speakers include united auto workers union president owen 
bieber national democratic chairman ron brown michigan gov james 
blanchard and detroit mayor coleman young one of the nations most 
powerful black leaders after 15 years at the helm of the nations 
sixthlargest city 
film maker spike lee whose movie do the right thing has 
sparked a debate over race relations and television talk show host 
oprah winfrey also will appear 
the displays of youthful talent and celebrity appearances along 
with the chance to swap stories with old friends help lift the 
spirits of naacp activists engaged in the long lonely battle for 
racial justice hooks said 
it gives them the renewed vigor to continue the fight he 
said

a picture book of catherine the greats 
lewd furniture a cold war expose on communist sexual practices and 
pristine copies of playboy can be found among the 102 million tomes 
at harvard university 
but to see them you need to find the man who holds the key to 
the xr collection 
down a steep stairway at harvards widener library and behind a 
heavy copper door that stays locked is the collection that makes 
edward doctoroff the man with the key practically blush 
but if hes red in the face its not because of the erotic 
contents of the xr books and magazines but because the whole idea 
the locked collection is so oldfashioned and because the 
collection stopped growing years ago 
its a dead collection said the succinct doctoroff head of 
circulation services at widener the chief repository of the written 
word at harvard 
xr does not stand for xrated the x means the books 
are one of 20 categories of unusual books miniature books are 
another such category and the r stands for restricted 
marion schoon chief of the librarys reference collection 
believes as doctoroff does that its just an oddity of history that 
the assortment of 1000 books that analyze philosophize wax poetic 
about and poke fun at sex are still housed separately under lock 
and key 
this is sort of a remnant she said 
the xr collection was only actively assembled and added to for 
less than 30 years but the prudishness that was still the norm 
three decades ago had nothing to do with its separate status 
librarians were concerned about the books getting lost 
it was before my time but apparently in the 50s early 60s 
there was a sociology professor who found a lot of the books for his 
course were not available said ms schoon the books on the 
reading list that concerned sex were missing from wideners shelves 
so a restricted collection was created 
playboy had to be in there she added because they tended 
to lose the centerfold 
but librarians quit labeling books xr sometime in the 70s she 
said there was simply no need copies of the same books are now 
found in the general stacks but no one bothers to steal them or cut 
out their favorite pictures just over the road in harvard square 
newsstands sell plenty of magazines to satisfy the salacious scholar 
and playboy is on microfiche 
not much traffic goes on in the xr nowadays a week can go by 
with fewer than five volumes checked out 
so why continue to lock up sexual behavior in the communist 
world an eyewitness report of life and love and the human condition 
behind the iron curtain with 5000 adult sex words amp phrases 
and the passions and lechery of catherine the great not to 
mention better known literary ventures in sex by dh lawrence 
lady chatterleys lover henry miller tropic of cancer and 
william s burroughs naked lunch 
its just lack of money ms schoon said the xr collection would 
vanish if there were resources to do all the work needed to disperse 
the books throughout harvards vast library and change all the 
records ms schoon said 
its sort of like a spiderweb cataloguing pulling all the 
cards its very labor intensive ms schoon said 
the library is plenty busy adding 50000 to 60000 new volumes 
every year reorganizing things for 1000 books could slow things 
down ms schoon said 
so the xr collection stays as it is a quaint memento of a time 
when sex needed to be kept under lock and key

burmas main opposition leader aung san 
suu kyi said saturday that despite veiled threats by the 
military government she will continue her speeches that have drawn 
large crowds in rangoon recently 
the charismatic suu kyi 44yearold daughter of assassinated 
independence hero aung san has garnered widespread popular support 
since emerging at the head of last years thwarted uprising for 
democracy her outspoken condemnations are unprecedented in a 
country cowed by years of authoritarian repression 
suu kyi said she planned to deliver more speeches in rangoon on 
monday in spite of the governments demand that the opposition 
leader end what officials decribe as her confrontational 
approach 
the main target in suu kyis repeated denunciations of military 
rule is strongman ne win who held burma in an iron grip for 26 
years until officially retiring a year ago 
suu kyi general secretary of the national league for democarcy 
charges ne win continues to manipulate the government of gen saw 
maung from the wings 
a spokeswoman for her party claimed up to 1000 members of the 
league have been arrested since the military took power last 
september 
speaking from rangoon in a telephone interview suu kyi accused 
saw maung of threatening opposition groups when he spoke at a rare 
press conference wednesday 
two things emerged during saw maungs speech suu kyi said 
the first is that he has shown that he does not believe in 
dialogue and the second was a veiled threat of force 
this is exactly the way ne win has always reacted when faced 
with any kind of opposition suu kyi said this is why we are 
convinced that ne win is still pulling the strings from behind saw 
maung 
ne win now 78 is held responsible for ordering the killings of 
protesters during protests for political change last year troops 
under saw maung killed at least hundreds when assuming power sept 18 
at his press conference saw maung insisted ne win took no part 
in national politics but said we are all here today because of 
him he taught us like a parent 
the pace of political dissent has quickened in burma in the past 
few weeks as large crowds have massed in rangoon in defiance of a 
10monthold martial law order forbidding more than five people to 
assemble 
the government however has allowed the formation of political 
parties and promised free elections next year 
on wednesday more than 10000 people rallied to hear suu kyi 
speak in what diplomats said was the largest political gathering 
since the army seized power diplomats said she addressed more large 
crowds thursday 
on saturday residents said large crowds attended the funeral in 
rangoon of mahn win maung the last president of a 
democraticallyelected government in burma he died monday at the 
age of 73 
mahn win maung was elected president of prime minister u nus 
government in 1957 the government was ousted by ne wins military 
coup in 1962

two airbus industrie a320 aircraft recently 
purchased by northwest airlines were grounded after engines stalled 
during preflight runway taxiing a spokesman said 
the hightechnology planes were voluntarily grounded friday by 
the minnesotabased northwest until the engines manufacturers and 
the airline can determine the cause of the problem and correct it 
said northwest spokesman kevin whalen 
northwest has orders and options for 100 of the planes and plans 
to make the aircraft the backbone of its domestic fleet the 
twinengine planes have a wide body allowing more cabin room for 
their 150 passengers 
northwest is the first airline in north america to receive an 
airbus a320 jetliner the airline has direct orders for 25 of the 
craft for 154 billion the aircraft are to be delivered over the 
next three years 
the airline took delivery of the europeanbuilt jets less than a 
month ago and placed them in regular passenger service july 1 
following two weeks of pilottraining flights and federal aviation 
administration evaluation the two a320s had been flying routes 
between the twin cities san diego and detroit 
the problem with the engines is called a compressor stall and 
occurs when the engine is taken from idle and placed into gear for 
the initial taxi down the runway whalen said an airflow imbalance 
can cause the engine to stutter or stall whalen said stalls have 
occurred three times with the two aircraft 
theres no problem in flying the planes whalen said we 
will continue to train crews with the planes while we try to fix the 
problem 
the stalls on the ground pose no threat to passengers but are 
timeconsuming because each time an engine stalls it must be 
inspected before being restarted whalen said we cant have that 
kind of customer service unreliability he said 
the engines are manufactured by cfm international a joint 
venture between snecma of france and the general electric co of the 
united states the joint venture has taken one of the engines to its 
us facility in cincinnati for testing northwest also is examining 
the engines at its maintenance facility in the twin cities

federal and drugindustry officials declared 
support saturday for testing of aids drugs by community research 
organizations in a meeting with representatives of such groups 
physicians and aids activists 
we recognize and really want to help foster that energy that 
you have said daniel hoth aids program director at the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
sandra lehrman head of the department of antimicrobial therapy 
of burroughswellcome co said she believes communitybased 
research offers a real venue of growth in ways to evaluate drugs 
meeting participants also raised questions about a recent federal 
proposal to give some aidsinfected people drugs that are not yet 
proven effective 
the threeday meeting which concludes sunday was sponsored by 
two community groups dedicated to research into acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome the community research initiative of new york 
and the county community consortium of san francisco 
noting the backgrounds of participants conference cochairman 
michael callen said the gathering marks a significant point in aids 
research 
after a lot of shouting at each other weve all decided we 
have more to gain from listening to each other he said were 
at a very important moment when everybody is willing to listen to 
creative solutions to the terrible problem of aids 
community research organizations are set up for the testing of 
aids drugs by physicians in the community rather than traditional 
institutional settings supporters hope to accelerate approval of 
new drugs and encourage testing in minorities and other groups 
the federal government has begun a program to promote 
communitybased research which we are excited and very 
delighted to encourage said hoth of niaid 
gordon nary of the physicians association for aids care 
announced that the procter amp gamble co has committed itself to 
using communitybased research it plans to test peridex a 
gumdisease medication that may help with aidsrelated mouth 
lesions he said 
john petricciani vice president for scientific and regulatory 
affairs of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association said he 
expects other companies to follow suit 
niaid director anthony fauci said friday that doctors in 
community programs may become involved in his proposed 
paralleltrack program under which some aidsinfected people 
could get drugs while effectiveness tests are still going on 
the drugs would become available after preliminary human tests 
indicate they are safe during other studies that focus on 
effectiveness the latter studies can include only certain 
categories of people and the paralleltrack idea would give others a 
chance to use the experimental therapy fauci said 
hoth said officials will take precautions against the possibility 
that such access might interfere with the effectiveness studies he 
also said if a drug is in limited supply the needs of research will 
take precedence 
ellen cooper director of the fdas division of antiviral drug 
products said program participants will have to agree on criteria 
for who should receive the drugs that includes defining standards 
for determining who cannot tolerate standard therapy and who is 
failing on standard therapy she said 
david barr an attorney with the lambda legal defense and 
education fund said another key question is whether fdas 
restrictions on the program such as who gets the drug will be so 
tight that few aidsinfected people will be helped 
drug companies may also need incentives to release drugs for 
paralleltrack use such as tax incentives and protection from 
lawsuits he said and a system should be established to assure that 
people without a private doctor will have someone who can obtain the 
drug for them he said 
fdas cooper also said that in trials of antivirus drugs the 
agency encourages studying results obtainable earlier than the 
traditional signals of death rates and appearance of aidsrelated 
infections 
using shorterterm results such as some blood tests could make 
drug trials briefer but cooper said it is not yet known what 
combination of shortterm results would demonstrate that a drug is 
effective

that the engines had been found and were in government hands 
if the engines were stolen he said they would have had to leave 
through one of three gates on the base that are manned 24 hours a 
day by guards 
earlier hill spokeswoman maj portia mccracken said 
investigators believed the engines were taken off the base sometime 
between noon july 1 and noon monday

us talks with the marxist government 
saturday on ending angolas 14yearold civil war appeared to stick 
on the future of usbacked rebel leader jonas savimbi 
herman cohen us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs said his meeting with president jose eduardo dos santos was 
very friendly and constructive 
i believe well be able to expand our dialogue in the future 
said cohen on his first tour of southern africa for the bush 
administration 
washington is calling for direct talks between savimbi and 
angolas government in return for diplomatic recognition withheld 
since the countrys independence from portugal in 1975 
we have always supported normalization of relations with the 
united states dos santos said and if it were possible to sign 
some kind of accord today wed be prepared to do so but we 
understand the united states is not yet ready 
the united states has been furnishing savimbis rebel national 
union for the total independence of angola unita with 15 million 
a year in military aid 
angola is insisting that savimbi agree to a temporary withdrawal 
or selfexile from the country while peace is worked out and unita 
members are incorporated into civilian life 
following a june 22 summit of african leaders in gbadolite 
zaire where dos santos and savimbi shook hands and agreed to a june 
24 ceasefire there were reports savimbi accepted such conditions 
but dos santos called an angolan delegation home from peace talks 
in kinshasa zaire last weekend on grounds unita violated the 
ceasefire 
savimbi had previously agreed to sit out of angolan politics for 
two years before returning to participate in democratic elections 
and zambian president kenneth kaunda said after gbadolite that 
savimbi had of his own decision agreed to go abroad temporarily 
but in a news conference last week in the ivory coast and in a 
subsequent interview with a portuguese newspaper savimbi denied he 
had ever made such a concession 
dos santos said saturday he told cohen that kaundas statement 
constitutes the key element for the solution of angolas internal 
problems 
cohen was also in luanda to attend the fourth meeting of the 
tripartite commission monitoring the usbrokered dec 22 agreement 
between angola cuba and south africa that is scheduled to lead to 
independence for namibia and set the stage for an end to angolas 
civil war 
both the united states and the soviet union angolas main 
financial backer are observers in the process that includes the 
phased withdrawal of some 50000 cuban troops from angola by 
mid1991 south africa agreed to cease aid to unita in return for 
the cuban withdrawal

the government said saturday 
that president p w botha met with nelson mandela last week 
increasing speculation the jailed black guerrilla leader will be 
freed before botha leaves office in september 
the 45minute meeting at bothas official residence in cape town 
on wednesday was the first time the two are known to have met 
governmentrun television reported that foreign minister pik 
botha saw this as an event of the utmost contemporary importance 
the television quoted pik botha as saying the meeting had 
positive implications which would benefit all people in south 
africa the foreign minister is not related to the president 
however mandelas lawyer ismail ayob said i dont think it 
would mean anything like that unless a statement was made to that 
effect i have no idea why the meeting took place it could be mr 
botha believes there is some benefit to him or the national party or 
he may have wanted to hear mr mandelas views 
justice minister kobie coetsee who attended the meeting said 
mandelas courtesy visit was conducted in a pleasant spirit 
coetsee said no policy matters were debated and no negotiations 
were conducted but that the two men availed themselves of the 
opportunity to confirm their support for peaceful development in 
south africa 
the minister said the possibility of further steps or meetings 
was not discussed during the occasion 
spokesmen for coetsee would not say why the meeting had been kept 
secret it was announced only after a reporter for the independent 
south african press association heard of the meeting and asked about 
it 
unheard and unseen by the public since his conviction in 1964 on 
charges of plotting to overthrow the government mandela 
nevertheless has come to be the most admired leader among south 
african blacks who consider him the embodiment of their quest for 
political freedom 
mandela who will be 71 on july 18 stays alone in a prison 
wardens house at the victor verster prison farm in paarl north of 
cape town he is serving a life sentence 
mandelas lawyer ismail ayob said mandela did not mention the 
meeting with botha when the attorney visited his client at the 
prison farm earlier saturday i assume he did not mention it 
because he may have been asked not to mention it ayob said 
on the possibility of mandela being freed ayob said i dont 
think it would mean anything like that unless a statement was made 
to that effect i have no idea why the meeting took place it could 
be mr botha believes there is some benefit to him or the national 
party or he may have wanted to hear mr mandelas views 
mandela has rejected the governments repeated offers to release 
him if he renounces violence he has said the government should 
renounce violence against blacks end apartheid and legalize the 
african national congress the largest guerrilla movement fighting 
the whitedominated government 
the anc was outlawed in 1960 and the next year mandela founded 
its guerrilla wing spear of the nation he was imprisoned in 1962 
for leaving the country illegally and organizing an illegal strike 
by black workers in 1964 he was convicted of sabotage and plotting 
the overthrow of the government and sentenced to life in prison he 
is regarded as the leader of the anc although the highest office he 
held before it was banned was deputy presidentgeneral 
botha 73 has headed the government for 11 years first as prime 
minister and as president since 1984 
during the past year botha has dropped his requirement that 
mandela renounce violence and has said he hopes it will be possible 
to free him botha is at odds with the governing national party 
whose leaders forced him to agree to retire from the presidency in 
favor of party head fw de klerk the change will occur after 
september parliamentary elections 
while many government leaders acknowledge the advantage of 
freeing mandela and beginning negotiations with south africas black 
majority they fear that such an action before an election could 
cause a black uprising and cost thousands of votes that would 
instead go to the rightwing there has been speculation that a new 
government under de klerk might free mandela after the election 
information minister stoffel van der merwe said in july 1988 that 
mandela had served enough time to pay for his crimes and that the 
only thing keeping him in prison was the governments uncertainty 
about the effect he would have on politics and national security 
denis worrall a coleader of the antiapartheid opposition 
democratic party said in london the fact that president botha 
talks to nelson mandela makes it so much easier for us to 
justify to the white electorate the talks which we are having with

canary or red herring thats the debate 
over a new study by the national wildlife federation claiming a 
greater cancer risk than previously thought in lake michigan fish 
the federation wants the hazards of toxic chemicals in the lakes 
fish to serve much the same role as the canary in a coal mine 
measuring the regions environmental health 
but critics say the federations report issued late last month 
amounted to a red herring that needlessly alarmed the public 
using a us environmental protection agency formula and more 
than 100 health studies the wildlife federation published a 17page 
booklet titled lake michigan sport fish should you eat your 
catch 
the booklet estimated at 1 in 100000 the lifetime cancer risk of 
eating 15 meals of coho salmon or walleyed pike tainted with 
chemicals from the lake to cite just one example 
experts are skeptical of such estimates 
risk estimates based on tests involving laboratory animals are 
purely guesswork said dr henry pitot director of the mcardle 
cancer research laboratory at the university of wisconsinmadison 
they are makebelieve numbers said dr sidney shindell 
chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the medical 
college of wisconsin in milwaukee 
its all based on basically bad science said biochemistry 
professor bruce ames of the university of california at berkeley 
the amount of sun a person soaks up catching a lake michigan fish 
probably poses a greater cancer risk than eating the fish and 
driving to the lake certainly is more lifethreatening than eating 
the fish ames said 
ames added that there is no comparison at all between the risk of 
cancer in the environment and the risk posed by smoking which is 
responsible for about onethird of all cancer 
nevertheless wisconsin officials received telephone calls from 
people as far away as fargo nd and omaha neb asking whether 
they should throw away the lake michigan fish they caught on a 
recent vacation or cancel a planned trip 
angry commercial fishermen in michigan called the wildlife 
federation suggesting the group buy their unsold lake trout 
mark van putten of the federations great lakes natural resources 
center in ann arbor mich responded by suggesting the fishermen 
market unsold fish to polluting industries 
sport fishing is an industry worth billions of dollars on the 
great lakes and charter boat operators and sportsmens clubs are 
anxiously watching the situation 
state officials in illinois indiana michigan and wisconsin are 
telling worried citizens that they are comfortable with health 
advice based on us food and drug administration standards for 
commercial fish 
the official advice says people should trim the fat and skin from 
smaller fish caught in lake michigan that women and children should 
not eat mediumsized fish and that no one should eat very large 
fish from the lake 
the longer and older a fish the more likely it is to have in its 
tissues toxic chemicals like pcbs and the pesticides ddt dieldrin 
and chordane the extra precaution on mediumsize fish is directed 
at women because of the danger pcbs pose to the reproductive system 
children because their relatively small body weight can magnify the 
effect of eating a toxic substance 
the official advisory does not attempt to rate cancer risk 
precisely because of the public confusion that creates lee 
liebenstein toxic chemicals specialist for the wisconsin department 
of natural resources said 
van putten who was in charge of the twoyear national wildlife 
federation project said the cancerrisk studies his group used are 
the best science available and are accepted by the epa and other 
government agencies 
the federations pamphlet recognizes that the risks are 
estimates but it provides citizens with valuable information they 
need to set pollution cleanup priorities and demand action van 
putten said 
dont get frustrated get mad and get active he advises 
some of these risks are small compared with other risks in 
society but theyre risks that ought to be reduced said jan 
beyea a senior scientist with the national audubon society in new 
york city 
and even critics of risk estimates based on tests using 
laboratory animals say people should not go hog wild about fish 
bearing traces of chemicals 
before you eat a fish out of lake michigan for dinner every 
evening you should think about it ames said 
van putten said fish caught in such places as santa monica bay 
calif quincy bay mass the ohio river the hudson river and 
puget sound also are contaminated with traces of industrial and 
agricultural chemicals 
but more information is available about lake michigan fish than 
about fish from other pollution hotspots he said

a dental hygienist and bornagain christian 
who was fired for preaching to patients cant expect to receive 
unemployment benefits the michigan court of appeals ruled 
dr jb mulder jr fired sharlyn vanderlaan of grand rapids in 
1986 after she ignored at least a dozen warnings to stop preaching 
while she worked 
a threejudge appeals court panel on friday upheld rulings by the 
michigan employment security commission and lower courts denying 
vanderlaan unemployment compensation 
a dentist has the right to expect his dental hygienist whose 
work is often painful and requires the patient to be verbally and 
physically submissive to behave in a manner which does not add more 
discomfort the court said in rejecting vanderlaans claim that 
she was exercising her first amendmentprotected right to free 
speech 
at least six of mulders patients changed dentists because of 
vanderlaans preaching according to court records 
vanderlaans attorney keith beauchemin said she was compelled 
by her faith to share it with just about anybody she had the 
opportunity to even if it meant losing her job 
vanderlaan found a parttime job with a dentist who lets her 
preach she currently is out of the country on a religious mission

the soviet union and its warsaw pact 
allies saturday praised president bushs nato proposal for deep cuts 
in conventional forces and said an accord on reductions could be 
reached next year 
but the twoday summit of the east bloc military alliance in the 
romanian capital ended with no concrete proposals on arms control or 
visible signs of healing in rifts that divide the bloc 
in remarks at a dinner friday soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev said the annual gathering would give a serious palpable 
answer to western proposals on cuts in conventional forces 
announced by bush may 29 at a nato summit in brussels belgium 
on behalf of the 16member north atlantic treaty organization 
bush called for military cutbacks that would fix a ceiling of 
275000 troops in europe for each superpower and make deep cuts in 
tanks combat aircraft and artillery 
in a joint declaration the warsaw pact countries said the bush 
plan converged with their proposals and that rapid progress in 
negotiating cuts was now possible 
during the meeting it was noted that the additional proposals 
regarding conventional armed forces in europe made at the recent 
nato council summit session met halfway the allied socialist 
countries stand the eastern alliance said 
member countries of the warsaw pact the soviet union poland 
east germany bulgaria romania czechoslovakia and hungary said 
they expected details of the nato proposals to be put forward in 
vienna austria where both sides are participating in conventional 
arms reduction talks 
even without knowing the fine print of bushs proposal which 
will be formally presented in september the warsaw pact said 
conditions are ripe for agreement 
the opinion was expressed that the situation of the 
negotiations is such that the first understandings may be achieved 
already in 1990 provided that a constructive approach is taken by 
all the declaration said 
the warsaw pact has proposed a limit of 135 million troops for 
each side in europe 
according to nato to comply with bushs plan the united states 
would have to remove 30000 troops from europe while the soviets 
would have to pull out more than 10 times that or 325000 
however the sovietled alliance cautioned that despite 
encouraging signs such as the superpower treaty eliminating 
intermediaterange missiles no radical turning point in 
disarmament questions has been recorded yet 
it accused nato of continuing a policy of force and said the 
western alliances nuclear deterrent strategy still causes worry 
the final document repeated kremlin demands that the united 
states drop plans to modernize shortrange nuclear weapons in 
europe and instead negotiate their elimination 
the pact also proposed creation of a center for lessening the 
military theat in europe to prevent surprise attacks by serving as 
a clearinghouse for information and consultation 
the 16page russianlanguage document repeated warsaw pact 
proposals for bans on all nuclear and chemical weapons and the 
liquidation of both military blocs to do away the division of europe 
bequeathed by the cold war 
the romanian deputy foreign minister constantin oancea told a 
news conference that the warsaw pacts decision showed it is 
seeking a dialogue with all european countries 
the summit declaration and a separate communique made no mention 
of quarrels in the bloc some of which are based on ideology and 
others on centuriesold rivalries 
we met here as equals without trying to divide said oancea 
secretary general of the pacts political consultative committee 
we did not come here to give grades or marks to one another 
in line with gorbachevs pledge that the kremlin would no longer 
interfere in the affairs of its allies the warsaw pact declared in 
a seperate communique that each member country has the right to 
make its own political lines strategy and tactics without any 
outside interference 
gorbachev in an interview with the soviet television news show 
vremya repeated predictions that the warsaw pact would be 
transformed from a military into a political alliance 
the time will come when the need for it will disappear he 
said and called for another warsaw pact meeting to chart economic 
cooperation 
we must not be too slow here we must act because the fact 
that we have fallen behind in a number of important directions is 
telling upon the level of well being and naturally on the living 
standards of our people 
gorbachev returned to moscow saturday at the head of a delegation 
that included foreign minister eduard shevardnadze defense minister 
dmitri yazov premier nikolai ryzhkov and politburo member alexander 
yakovlev 
the warsaw pact held its closeddoor summit in bucharests 
glittering former royal palace 
access granted reporters bore little sign of the greater openness 
now encouraged by gorbachev journalists were however allowed to 
be present for dinner remarks friday by gorbachev and his host 
romanian president nicolai ceausescu as well as the brief signing 
ceremony saturday 
gorbachev used a black fountain pen to put his signature with a 
bold flourish on the agreement bound in red leather and smiled at 
journalists gathered in the marblecolumned hall 
one veteran of many warsaw pact summits east german president 
erich honecker took ill and flew home saturday morning missing the

a state board created to reimburse clients for 
intentional dishonesty by their attorneys has paid out hundreds of 
thousands of dollars and its chairman says more money is needed for 
future scandals 
more than 500000 was paid to reimburse clients of two lawyers 
accused of stealing from their clients exattorney john flanagan 
served a prison term and former lawyer mark sampson vanished 
the twoyearold client security board created in response to 
the highly publicized sampson and flanagan cases reports that it 
has repaid all but one qualifying client of the two lawyers 
the board generally has received praise for prompt payment of 
claims 
the court feels it has been very successful said associate 
justice am keith the minnesota supreme courts liaison to the 
board his comments were echoed by ralph peterson head of the state 
bar association 
the boards chairman melvin orenstein a minneapolis attorney 
said friday that most of the 51 people reimbursed so far have been 
paid in full some received only partial payment if they received 
money from other sources 
orenstein said the board still has about half of the 14 million 
it collected from a onetime assessment of 100 per lawyer which 
the minnesota supreme court ordered after creating the board but he 
said the board soon will need more money and is likely to ask for an 
annual attorneys fee of about 20 
sampson a fridley attorney disappeared three years ago after 
allegedly taking about 450000 from clients reportedly to help pay 
for an elaborate house 
sampson is still missing but 19 of his former clients have 
received a total of 413000 from the board only one claim filed 
earlier this year is pending 
its too bad that lawyers have to have a board like that 
said richard brisbois who said his family received prompt service 
after submitting a claim on behalf of his grandmothers estate 
which sampson had handled 
flanagan of st paul disappeared also but was later found in 
utah he was convicted of stealing 415000 and was released from 
prison after serving onethird of a 10year term for theft 
flanagans former clients received 110000 from the board with 
the remainder of their claims collected from other sources such as 
banks which had honored forged checks written by flanagan

the wayne chicken show where barechested 
male chick n dale dancers marched in a parade saturday before 
the national cluckoff competition was something to crow about 
i dont know if its an honor to be a dumb cluck or not said 
john vavra 39 a hardboiled construction worker who won the 
cackling contest for the third consecutive year 
he reclaimed the title despite the efforts of bill patrick of 
vassar mich whose coworkers at a foundry raised 400 to give him 
a crack at the championship 
my finefeathered friends egged me on to come out here said 
patrick 37 who placed third in the adult rooster competition 
he began crowing because he didnt want his daughter to believe 
roosters said cockadoodledoo like the sound one of her toys 
made 
joelle patrick 11 apparently learned the correct cackle she 
won first place in the rooster imitation contest for children under 
13 
the chicken show began as an arts festival nine years ago in 
wayne a community of about 5200 people about 120 miles northwest 
of omaha 
we were trying to come up with a theme to show that art can be 
found in anything said jane oleary one of the organizers 
someone said chicken and we laughed so hard 
there is no one chairman of the show she said we have no 
pecking order 
the festival has grown into an event that attracts hundreds of 
people the milton waldbaum co an egg producer in nearby 
wakefield has been one of many business supporters for the show on 
saturday festival workers dished out 2000 omelettes during a free 
feed in the morning ms oleary said 
later hundreds of people lined the streets to watch the chicken 
show parade where about half a dozen legislative aides in paper 
chicken feet clucked as the legislative mutant ninja chickens 
its the outreach program of the capitol doug clark an aide 
for sen brad ashford of omaha said with a laugh 
they followed a barechested band of chick n dale male 
dancers wearing brown paper bags and orange beaks on the their heads 
the show also featured contests for egg dropping and having the 
most beautiful beak but the highlight was the annual hen and 
rooster cluckng contest 
vavra came from crete to cackle as the chicken flies its 125 
miles away he explained its within squawking distance 
besides patrick vavra outclucked john agler 34 of wayne who 
had strutted to the championship from 198286 
agler second in the adult rooster contest began crowing as a 
child growing up on a farm a clucking judge in 1987 agler decided 
its important to act as well as sound like a chicken 
he began his performance by spreading a bag of corn on the stage 
other contestants squatted flapped wings and jerked their beaks 
basically its just fun agler said

a hungry piranha nicknamed alice is 
wreaking havoc on the natural denizens of a city pond and has 
eluded capture by fishermen armed with hooks nets and electrical 
shock equipment 
two of the razortoothed south american fish were recently 
spotted in the pond at alice keck park a popular dumping ground for 
unwanted pet fish 
park visitors and workers began finding a number of partially 
eaten fish and turtles turned up missing legs frogs fled for safer 
ground 
one of the piranhas was caught friday on a hook baited with beef 
liver 
it was a good fight said city parks worker bob sloan who 
reeled in the piranha he came out of the water twice 
ken sasaki state department of fish and game biologist said the 
fish was 17 inches long and weighed 2 pounds it had been caught 
once before but was tossed back when it was misidentified as a 
pacu a harmless piranha lookalike 
park superintendent jeff cope said alice the remaining piranha 
seemed even more wary of people after its compatriot was bagged 
efforts to hook her saturday morning were not successful 
the shock equipment produced too small an electrical field and 
operators couldnt get close enough to the fish for the equipment to 
have any effect 
this fish is too fast and too smart for him to get close 
said cope 
he said the park departments next plan of attack may be to get 
an archer to skewer the fish with an arrow or perhaps use a baited 
trap 
in the meantime were gonna keep fishin cope said

carlos menem was sworn in saturday 
as argentinas 46th president and asked his countrymen to help 
rebuild a nation broken by inflation and divided by political 
dissent 
all of us together will cure argentina or argentina will die 
said the 59yearold son of syrian immigrants in a sober 
conciliatory acceptance speech broadcast nationwide from congress 
this is the cruel choice 
later outgoing president raul alfonsin draped the blueandwhite 
silk sash of office over menems shoulders completing this 
turbulent countrys first transition from one freely elected 
president to another in 61 years 
im happy alfonsin told reporters before flying to his 
hometown chascomus 75 miles south of the capitali leave the 
presidency without having known hatred or rancor i leave the 
presidency without having met a single enemy 
menem of the peronist party takes over a country ravaged by 
inflation and the worst recession in its 173year history 
alfonsins inability to stabilize the economy forced him to resign 
five months before his term officially ended 
as real wages fell by more than 40 percent and unemployment 
climbed to 10 percent this year food riots broke out in several 
cities looting and mass arrests occurred again last week in 
rosario the thirdlargest city 
by menems estimate nearly a third of argentinas 31 million 
citizens live in poverty or suffer from illiteracy malnutrition or 
untreated sickness 
after swearing in his eightman cabinet menem spoke from the 
balcony from which former populist juan domingo peron addressed 
similar crowds during his illfated presidencies from 194655 and 
197374 
argentina is passing through the worst crisis in its history 
the slightly built president said enough of this situation tough 
days are coming but within a prudent period we will harvest 
good fruit 
earlier in his acceptance speech the threetime provincial 
governor and former political prisoner focused on the need for his 
government to remedy the countrys ills 
atop these ruins all of us will build the home we deserve 
he said in the 52minute speech that was interrupted 32 times by 
applause from this broken country we will raise a new fatherland 
for ourselves and for our children 
conquering inflation that in june soared by 1145 percent will be 
his first and fundamental battle menem said 
he also pledged to resolve the military issue that sparked three 
barracks revolts against alfonsin the trials of officers charged 
with human rights abuses committed during the 197683 military 
dictatorship 
he received perhaps the most sustained applause when he pledged 
to continue efforts to recover the falkland islands in the south 
atlantic over which argentina and britain went to war in 1982 
argentina which calls the islands the malvinas disputes britains 
claim of ownership 
menem did not specify what antiinflation policies he would 
implement aides indicated last week his plan would be based on 
price controls a major devaluation of the austral strict monetary 
control and increased rates for public utilities and services 
economy minister miguel roig was expected to announce price 
guidelines and significant gas public transport and utility 
increases on sunday the price of milk bread and many other basic 
foods rose by 100 percent or more in the past two days 
menem said argentinas 64 billion foreign debt which includes 
outstanding interest of about 4 billion was imprudently 
contracted over more than a decade but was an obligation the 
country must repay 
menem hinted he might seek to call off the pending human rights 
trials of 15 generals and three admirals rather than allow the 
bitter emotional proceedings to continue 
were not going to lose time in making concrete the 
reconciliation of all argentines he said the time has come for 
each argentine to extend his hand to his brother to make a chain 
that is stronger than rancor or discord or resentment or pain 
at least 8960 alleged leftists were arrested never seen again 
and presumed executed during the military regimes crackdown on 
subversion according to a commission appointed by alfonsin 
menem at the time the governor of la rioja province was jailed 
for nearly five years following the overthrow of president isabel 
peron in march 1976 
tens of thousands of wellwishers in this city of 8 million 
cheered as menem slowly made his way on the onemile route from 
congress to government house 
menem the country needs you said one banner long live 
the fatherland many shouted a sign on a young boy dressed in a 
jacket and tie stated thank you president alfonsin thank you 
president menem for letting me grow up in democracy 
menems 1950sera cadillac convertible was flanked by police on 
motorcycles and sabercarrying grenadiers on horseback 
his victory in national elections may 14 marked the return of the 
peronist party to the presidency for the first time since 1976 and 
only the second time since 1955 both previous peronist presidencies 
were overthrown by military coup 
nevertheless there was little sense of jubilation like that on 
dec 10 1983 when alfonsin formally replaced the discredited 
dictatorship 
alfonsin and many argentines thought the return of democracy 
alone would spur economic growth argentines now hope menem can 
stave off disaster 
nobody expects menem to make the country opulent peronist 
gov jose octavio bordon said in an interview they just expect 
that every day will be a little better

into a rally for about 300 demonstrators for abortion rights who 
crowded sidewalks and the street near three abortion clinics while

a federal judge ordered a publishing company 
to put stickers on its 1990 calendars to warn consumers that the 
pictures were printed from copies of ansel adams photographs 
you cant pass off reconstituted photos as original and 
mislead knowingly or unwittingly the purchasing public us 
district judge william d keller told day dream publishing incs 
lawyers friday 
attorneys for adams estate and publisher filed suit against day 
dream after the santa barbara publisher announced plans to publish a 
book of adams photos obtained from the national archives 
the book and 1990 calendars by day dream bear the title the 
mural project and include photographs the late adams took for the 
us interior department to make muralsize prints to decorate 
department buildings 
day dream produced the book and calendars by rephotographing 
images adams had printed for the government in 19411942 day dream 
lawyers argued that the images existed in the public domain 
while prints of the mural project are easily available from 
the government adams kept the negatives 
kellers ruling did not affect distribution and promotion of the 
book because the attorneys agreed that all copies were sold or 
already on store shelves about half of the 122000 calendars 
printed also were already distributed

mayor edward i koch said saturday he will issue 
an executive order granting bereavement leave rights to homosexuals 
and unmarried heterosexuals whose domestic partners die 
the mayor told the associated press that the city also would 
consider extending health insurance benefits to the same city 
workers included in the bereavement order in the next collective 
bargaining session with unions 
koch said he would issue the order within several weeks city 
workers currently are granted four days leave to mourn the death of 
any relative living in the same house 
the daily news in its sunday editions said the executive order 
would set the stage for allowing unmarried and unrelated life 
partners the same health and insurance benefits as are granted to 
married couples 
but the mayor emphasized it will be up to the unions and 
pressure by union members to expand the health benefits im only 
talking about bereavement leave in my executive order 
the mayor noted that the pool of money available for city 
employees would not grow significantly union negotiators would have 
to choose if they wanted pay increases or the health benefits for 
their members koch said 
the mayor said the next union negotiations are not scheduled 
until next year after the mayoral elections 
the mayor said his executive order or the collective bargaining 
measure does not mean he recognizes gay marriages 
this has nothing to do with gay marriages he said im 
against that this is a different concept this is closer to what 
the court of appeals did 
the states highest court on thursday ruled that a partner in a 
longterm homosexual relationship can take over his or her partners 
rentcontrolled apartment when the leaseholder dies

federal agents recovered 1600 pounds of cocaine 
saturday from a speedboat observed earlier in cuban waters catching 
bales dropped from a suspected drugrunning plane authorities said 
us customs service surveillance planes watched the drop off the 
northern coast of cuba late friday night the same day cuba 
announced four military officers were sentenced to death for drug 
trafficking 
this shows the pattern is still continuing said patrick 
obrien us customs special agentincharge for south florida 
the crackdown in cuba has done little to stop the flow of drugs 
customs followed the suspected drug plane over cuban waters and 
watched it drop 18 bales to a waiting speedboat obrien said 
two mig fighters came on to the scene and protected the cuban 
airspace obrien said we had to get out of there but before 
we left we got a good look at the plane and the boat below 
saturday morning an abandoned 37foot speedboat with bales of 
cocaine floating nearby were found in biscayne bay 20 miles south 
of miami the 1584 pounds of cocaine was valued at about 10 
million obrien said 
obrien said the seizure is significant because it follows a 
cuban crackdown on drugs that has reached the highest levels of the 
communist island nations government 
cuban radio announced friday that former maj gen arnaldo ochoa 
and three other military officers were sentenced to death for a 
conspiracy to smuggle cocaine from colombias medellin cartel 
through cuban to the united states 
saturdays seizure followed one of the nations largest cocaine 
finds aboard a panamanian freighter intercepted off key west the 
freighter bound for the dominican republic and boarded by customs

thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke 
saturday in seven states in the west threatening homes in some 
places and firefighters contended with wind and high temperatures 
as the day heats up youll get these reburns going out and the 
trees dry out and theyll torch said forest service spokesman ed 
christian in wyoming 
we hope mother nature cooperates with us said mary plumb of 
the federal bureau of land management in utah

so far this fire season the agency has had 31000 fires 
reported which have burned 1117000 acres in the same period last 
year it had 54000 fires but 765000 acres burned 
the fact that there are more acres burned this year but fewer 
fires means this years fires are in very rugged inaccessible 
terrain which makes them hard to fight said hartigan also 
some of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for 
years and that means there is excellent fuel available 
the largest fire in the lower 48 states was the weekold diamond 
peak fire in utah which had burned 12200 acres of forest and brush 
in an area 20 miles west of the utahcolorado border just north of

around 100 degrees the national weather service predicted possible 
dry lightning storms and gusting wind 
elsewhere in utah the uinta canyon fire had burned 3850 acres 
20 miles north of roosevelt in the ashley national forest forest 
service spokeswoman cece stewart said three helicopters scattered 
incendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an 
unburned 200acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an 
effort to stop the fires advance 
high wind also was expected in northern california where a 
2500acre fire near janesville on the eastern slopes of the sierra 
nevada destroyed two mobile homes us 395 between milford and 
janesville was closed 
the wind was pretty brisk it just blew the fire and pushed it 
out said forest service spokesman dave reider 
relentless winds first pushed the fire north then south 
prompting sheriff ron jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely 
populated area about a mile south of the fire line reider said it 
was unknown how many people were affected 
spokesman larry lathrop said a helicopter battling the fire 
crashed saturday about four miles southeast of janesville 
lathrop said the pilot walked away from the crash but the 
helicopter was destroyed the chopper apparently was making a water 
drop when it crashed 
in the sierra foothills near oroville north of sacramento a

outbuildings and six vehicles and forcing about 150 residents to 
flee briefly friday night according to the california department of 
forestry

colorados droughtstricken mountains saturday but a new blaze of 
an estimated 3000 acres in grass and timber on the eastern plains

a group of 10 americans saturday toured a military 
laser research center previously considered central to the soviet 
version of the us antimissile star wars program according to 
reports published sunday 
the americans including two physicists three members of 
congress and two journalists were the first foreigners allowed 
inside the sharyshagan complex located in soviet central asia 
according to the new york times 
the associated press was not invited to participate 
the tour included a look at a military laser once described by 
the pentagon as an operable antisatellite weapon but the american 
visitors concluded the laser is probably too weak to damage us 
satellites 
it seems to me it pretty clearly is not a power laser and 
doesnt represent any threat as a weapon rep jim olin dva 
told the new york times olin is a former electrical engineer for 
general electric co 
if they wanted to have an antisatellite program this research 
locating and tracking objects in space is certainly 
applicable he said but it sure doesnt look like a beam 
weapon 
the tour of the complex was part of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness the soviet president 
has called for reduction in conventional and nuclear forces and 
doing away with the nato and warsaw pact military groups that divide 
europe 
saryshagan has been an object of us interest since 1984 when 
the pentagon published information about the compound based on 
satellite photographs and identified it as the heart of an 
ominous laser weapons research and development program the 
paper said 
it formed the heart of an aggressive campaign to justify 
president reagans strategic defense initiative known as star wars 
in 1985 
its incredible to think that the pentagon sdi folks 
probably got an extra 10 billion because of this place frank von 
hippel a princeton university physicist who was among those touring 
the facility told the new york times 
it looks like a tool thats been left out to dry for 25 years 
its got 19 countertopsized ruby laser a weldingsized laser 
1960s vintage computers and a couple of onemeter mirrors in an 
airconditioned building von hippel told the washington post 
on friday the visiting americans were the first to enter the 
kyshtym nuclear complex in the ural mountains where the soviet union 
has produced plutonium for its nuclear weapons since 1948 according 
to the new york times 
the washington post reported sunday that the soviet government 
has decided to shut down all five nuclear reactors producing 
plutonium for nuclear weapons at the topsecret military center 
gorbachev said three months ago that three reactors would be 
closed out of an estimated 13 throughout the country

vague laws have left underground 
pipelines a regulatory black hole a congressman said friday as 
hearings began in the gasoline pipeline explosion that killed two 
people injured 31 and destroyed 10 homes 
it appears that the end result is the companies are regulating 
themselves said rep george e brown jr as the house public 
works and transportation committees investigative subcommittee 
convened 
the may 25 gasoline pipeline explosion devastated the san 
bernardino neighborhood of muscoy 13 days after a runaway southern 
pacific train derailed on a curve and slammed into the same 
neighborhood 
the train wreck was blamed for the damaging the 14inch gasoline 
line of calnev pipe line co residents had been assured the 
neighborhood was safe although they insisted before the explosion 
that they could smell gasoline 
so haphazard is pipeline regulation the committee noted that 
the state fire marshals office had no record of the calnev line 
even though it supplies 90 percent of the gasoline to the city of 
las vegas nev and nearly all the jet fuel to george and edwards 
air force bases 
this scenario has presented us with a regulatory black hole 
said rep glenn m anderson chairman of the subcomittee 
the hearing began with dozens of residents of the devastated 
muscoy neighborhood looking on testimony was expected from several 
officials including city attorney james penman who fought in state 
and federal court to stop the line from being restored along the 
same course 
calnev agreed to numerous suggestions and complied with 
guidelines set up by federal officials to restore the pipeline but 
insisted on restoring the pipeline along its original course through 
the neighorhood 
state and federal judges told the city they could do nothing to 
change calnevs plans

rockets grenades and cartridges 
littered the samarkhiel garrison which moslem guerrillas captured 
in march and used as a base for the siege of jalalabad until the 
army drove them out this week 
journalists were taken on a tour friday of former guerrilla bases 
east of jalalabad where fierce battles between the army and 
insurgents were reported wednesday 
at one point an afghan officer shouted stop there may be 
land mines he tiptoed forward on a narrow road near a lumber mill 
government troops were in complete control of jalalabad and of 
samarkhiel seven miles to the southeast and other rebel bases 
nearby lt gen manoky mangal said soldiers were advancing to 
destroy guerrilla bases near the pakistani border 
jalalabad on the main route from kabul to the khyber pass and 
pakistan is 75 miles east of the afghan capital and 45 miles from 
the border 
once again they dreamed to occupy jalalabad but once again we 
have destroyed them mangal said he is military governor of 
nangarhar province of which jalalabad is the capital 
moslem insurgents who began fighting after a communist coup in 
april 1978 attacked jalalabad on march 7 it was their first major 
assault the withdrawal of soviet military forces from afghanistan 
was completed feb 15 ending nine years of involvement in the civil 
war 
journalists representing western media were flown to jalalabad in 
a sovietbuilt afghan air force helicopter 
amanullah nooro the 35yearold pilot fired rockets and dropped 
flares to frustrate any attempt by guerrillas to attack the chopper 
four helicopter gunships flew escort 
mangal said at least 2000 insurgents had been killed and 4000 
wounded in the operation around jalalabad and gave government 
casualties as 26 dead 
both sides customarily exaggerate enemy losses and minimize their 
own 
the government offensive began after reports that the usbacked 
guerrillas were preparing new attacks on jalalabad capturing the 
city afghanistans fifthlargest would have given them a seat for 
the interim government they formed in pakistan after the soviet 
withdrawal 
we had information that the enemy was regrouping and planning 
anoher attack on jalalabad said mangal a 41yearold former 
physician who joined the army after the coup in 1978 
we decided to strike first he said our strategy paid off 
and now we are heading toward the bases on the border with 
pakistan

seabrook nuclear power plant officials 
acknowledged friday they cant meet their goal of having the 61 
billion reactor running commercially by years end 
but they still hope to get their fullpower license by then and 
produce electricity a month into the new year 
plant officials reassessed their timetable after a nuclear 
regulatory commission licensing board in a report dated thursday 
and released friday said it wont be able to rule before nov 30 on 
evacuation plans for seabrook 
the commission had pressed the atomic safety and licensing board 
for a ruling by sept 30 
even though the board said in may it probably would not meet that 
target on friday a recorded telephone information line at seabrook 
still said commercial operation was expected later this year 
after the board rules the commission would decide whether to 
give seabrook the commercial license it hoped to have 10 years ago 
seabrook spokesman ron sher estimated friday the commission would 
take a month to decide 
seabrook foes vow to challenge any license in federal court 
there has been one precedent for staying a fullpower license a 
fourmonth delay for the diablo canyon plant in california though 
that reactor eventually was allowed to run commercially 
once seabrook gets final approval sher estimated it would take 
about one month to get the reactor to 10 percent power and start 
providing electricity to the region he said it would take several 
months to reach 100 percent power 
the licensing board is deciding the adequacy of seabrooks 
evacuation plans for six massachusetts communities within 10 miles 
of the plant that refuse to cooperate 
it also is to give a final grade on a june 1988 federal exercise 
of those plans and evacuation plans that new hampshire developed for 
its 17 communities in the 10mile zone 
hearings on those issues concluded last week after 57 days 
chairman ivan smith said the nov 30 target disregards 
massachusetts attorney general james shannons plans to call for 
hearings on a reactor shutdown last month during lowpower testing 
seabrook officials admit they wrongly delayed the shutdown and the 
nrc took the unusual step of suspending the lowpower tests 
steve jonas an assistant massachusetts attorney general said he 
was pleased by smiths report 
we think it also confirms what weve been saying for some time 
which is these matters are more complex than seabrook seems to 
recognize theyre not going to get the license as quickly as they 
think jonas said he said the plants past projections have 
proved whoppingly wrong

providence ri the captain and mate of a greek tanker that 
ran aground on a reef off newport spilling 420000 gallons of 
heating oil were not drinking or using drugs at the time according 
to test results released friday 
we have preliminary results that are negative said mike 
benson a spokesman for the national transportation safety board in 
washington dc were not going to comment beyond that 
benson said the tests performed at the university of utah would 
be run a second time for confirmation he did not know all the drugs 
for which the blood was screened 
the tests confirmed the observations of gov edward d diprete 
and coast guard officers who boarded the world prodigy after it 
slammed into brenton reef june 23 they said capt iakovos 
georgudis 43 did not appear impaired 
georgudis admitted he simply made a mistake and navigated the 
ship onto the reef at the mouth of narragansett bay diprete said a 
helmsman told a coast guardntsb investigating panel he saw the red 
warning buoy on the wrong side of the ship but did not tell the 
captain 
the world prodigy did not have a harbor pilot on board at the 
time pilots are required for commercial ships to navigate the bay 
the spill was cleaned up with little immediate environmental 
damage although scientists still are monitoring for longterm 
damage to fish and lobster larvae and the small plants and animals 
on which they feed the coast guard estimated the cleanup cost 
almost 2 million 
georgudis faces two misdemeanor charges of violating federal 
pollution laws but a grand jury is investigating to determine if 
there was gross negligence which could elevate the charges to 
felonies 
because of a mixup at the time usable blood samples were not 
taken until 19 hours after the accident but officials said they 
still could be used for screening 
a state grand jury investigating possible violations of state 
pollution or pilotage laws met again friday and heard testimony from 
the coast guard and a lobsterman who saw the grounding said lee 
baker an attorney generals spokeswoman 
it is not expected to hear any more witnesses when it reconvenes 
next week she said 
the world prodigy arrived monday at a new york city drydock for

an army of firefighters renewed its offensive friday against four 
wildfires that charred more than 16000 acres in utah but weekend 
forecasts for wind and lightning had some western authorities 
worried about the threat of new fires 
were just scared to death to tell you the truth said ray 
tate of the bureau of land managements vernal utah office 
forest and range fires have burned more than 25000 acres of land 
in arizona and 23 new fires began thursday and friday from 
lightning strikes in new mexico bringing the total number of blazes 
burning to at least 55 
in southcentral alaska the swinging dome fire about 200 miles 
west of anchorage grew to 11000 acres and was fought by three 
16person crews with another seven crews expected state foresters 
said 
fires also charred land in california colorado georgia wyoming 
and washington 
and though firefighters reported progress against some fires 
national weather service officials said they faced a weekend of 
continued heat and storms that could reignite blazes and cause new 
ones 
in utah the diamond peak fire 20 miles west of the colorado 
border and just north of interstate 70 had consumed 9500 acres 
four fresh 20member crews were fighting the blaze bringing to 400 
the number of people on the line 
three fires burned in ashley national forest in northeastern 
utah containment of the nearly 1400acre rough canyon fire just 
south of duchesne was expected saturday and major assaults were 
launched on the uinta canyon fire which has consumed 3600 acres

wyomings bridgerteton national forest fire containment lines had 
been dug around 25 percent of the blaze which began tuesday 
officials said containment wasnt expected before late next week 
the potential is for very high fire danger by the weekend 
said forest spokesman ed christian its going to be low humidity 
high temperatures and probably some moderate winds in there 
hopefully they can hold what theyve gained 
in arizona temperatures above 100 degrees low humidity and 
extended drought conditions were largely responsible for the 
increased dryness officials said 
coronado national forest supervisor jim abbott said the marijilda 
fire that consumed 2200 acres and the 3000acre chiva fire in the 
rincon mountains near redington pass east of tucson were being 
given top priority 
he said the marijilda fire was being fought with 260 
firefighters five air tankers and four helicopters and was of 
special concern because of fears it could spread upward from its 
present 7000foot level to the habitat of an endangered red 
squirrel 
officials said the 376000 acres closed to public recreational 
use will remain closed until dampened by rain 
none of the fires was in populated areas gov rose mofford took 
an aerial tour of some of the fires on friday and characterized the 
situation as serious but not disastrous

every three years is being criticized by the chairman of a house 
civil service subcommittee 
rep gary l ackerman dny chairman of a panel that oversees 
federal pay claims the plan would inject even more partisanship 
into the federal personnel structure than exists already 
it creates a system in which there will be a political litmus 
test people will have to snooker up to their supervisors and kiss 
their rings to keep their pay raises ackerman said thats not 
what government service is all about 
the bush proposal would raise salaries for senior government 
executives by 8 to 25 percent the evaluation every three years 
would certify they deserve the higher salary

in an move that many economists expect will 
make borrowing easier the federal reserve eased credit conditions 
for the second time in four weeks 
analysts predicted the development would send a variety of 
consumer and business interest rates lower in coming weeks 
including home mortgage rates and commercial banks primelending 
rate 
one analyst said a onehalf percentage point reduction in the 
prime rate the benchmark rate for many consumer loans could come 
as early as monday the prime rate stands at 11 percent 
the fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we have 
passed the peak on interest rates said david wyss an economist

the food and drug administration says people 
who turn to overthecounter potions to prevent baldness or improve 
their sex lives arent getting what they pay for 
to protect the public from fraudulent claims the fda is banning 
nonprescription antibaldness creams and lotions and aphrodisiac 
products 
though overthecounter hairgrowth products have dwindled in 
number since the fda indicated in 1985 that it wanted to remove the 
products from the market they have continued to be an area of 
considerable fraud 
the ban of all such products will provide a greater and more

bush administration officials said saturday 
that hardline positions adopted by israeli and palestinian leaders 
have dealt a potentially fatal setback to hopes that proposed 
elections in the occupied territories could be a step toward peace 
an official who flew to this arabian peninsula sultanate aboard

neither side had shown much restraint since the palestinian election 
proposal was set forth by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir in

not helpful a series of restrictions agreed to by israels likud 
party concerning terms for the proposed election in the west bank

only once before in the past halfcentury has the 
economy made a truly soft landing when it was headed toward 
recession that was in 1967 and it was made possible by war 
as the economy faded in that year thanks as usual to tight 
monetary policy by the federal reserve the military buildup 
provided enough thrust to keep things going but the price was 
steep and it is still being paid 
the price was budget deficits and those deficits led in the 
1970s to some of the worst inflation ever experienced by americans 
month after month of double digit rates accompanied by interest 
rates that exceeded 20 percent 
while causeeffect becomes tenuous at that point you can argue 
that the inflation and other evidence of disequilibrium in the 1970s 
provoked the big recession of the early 1980s that sent unemployment 
too into double digits 
in retrospect therefore the wonderfully soft landing of 1967 
may have done little more than spread the damage over a longer 
period of time than might have been the case some benefit might a 
crash have been better 
the soft landing concept nevertheless is back in the news and 
is in fact the subject of perhaps the most popular economic debate 
of the year the lines are drawn will it or will it not be a soft 
landing 
no military buildup can save the economy this time in fact the 
trend is toward lowering military expenditures consumers 
twothirds of the economy arent in a buying mood and that mood 
could grow gloomier if jobs are lost 
but there is support out there according to roger brinner and 
david wyss dri mcgrawhill economists 
high on their support list is the expectation that exports will 
remain strong partly because european and japanese economies are in 
a different stage of the business cycle their economies should 
continue to grow as ours fades 
they expect a healthy world economy will boost us export 
voluume 104 percent in 1989 less than the 18 percent growth of 
1988 but still affording strong support for the gross national 
product 
in fact they expect that exports will contribute 21 percentage 
points to real gnp growth in 1988 and 1989 just the same boost 
that military spending contributed in 1966 and 1967 
business investment continuing to show strength is likely to 
help buffer the landing brinner and wyss believe this segment of 
the economy might even be robust based on optimistic plans and a 
backlog of unfilled orders 
then theres housing much of the news in recent weeks has had a 
negative tone but thats because of a decline in housing 
production thats just one aspect of the picture in contrast 
sales may pick up as mortgage rates fall 
if they are correct the economy could glide to a soft landing 
instead of scraping and banging itself along the runway 
but those soft landings may tend to be dragged out fewer people 
may get hurt but the pain may be prolonged less damage may be done 
immediately but perhaps more over the following months 
on the other hand it may be possible to survive a crash and 
quickly get on with business so long as the fuselage isnt ruptured 
quick and damaging might not be worse than long and painful 
clearly the federal reserve has chosen to seek a soft landing 
but that doesnt mean it will get it it doesnt have as precise an 
instrument panel as it would like and it could make some serious 
errors 
it will have to be even luckier or more skillful than in 1967 
say brinner and wyss and who can forget the aftermath of that soft 
landing

the question of whether big is better is 
dominating the accounting industry where the big eight flock of 
firms threatens to dwindle to the even bigger big five 
the mergers recently announced or currently being contemplated by 
these huge firms are confounding some experts who question not only 
whether the combinations are necessary but how clients ultimately 
will fare 
i just dont understand what theyre after said abraham 
briloff professor emeritus of accounting at bernard m baruch 
college in manhattan how big does bigness have to be 
the answer is pretty big chicagobased arthur andersen amp co and 
new yorks price waterhouse confirmed this past week they had 
entered into formal talks about merging their worldwide operations 
if completed the combination would be the worlds largest accounting 
firm with annual worldwide revenue of 5 billion and domestic 
revenue of 27 billion 
together the two firms would audit almost 40 percent of the 
companies in the fortune 500 
experts in the hotly competitive field said they believed 
andersen and price waterhouse raced their announcement to the public 
to steal some thunder from deloitte haskins amp sells and touche ross 
amp co 
deloitte and touche ross which share the bottom rungs of the big 
eight ladder said they planned to join forces creating the 
thirdlargest accounting firm 
the merger wave within the admittedly staid industry began weeks 
ago when ernst amp whinney and arthur young amp co said they were 
teaming up in a merger that will create the worlds biggest firm 
but the glory of being no 1 may be fleeting as ernst amp young would 
be eclipsed by an andersenwaterhouse combination 
the firms say they are being driven by the increasing 
globalization of world economies accelerating technological changes 
and demand for new services and investments 
arthur bowman atlantabased publisher of bowmans accounting 
report said 1992 the year europe will meld into one economic 
market is spurring firms to position themselves to better win and 
serve foreign clients 
in addition the firms are seeking to blanket the united states 
with a cadre of highly qualified personnel a commodity sometimes 
difficult to come by 
but briloff argued that the firms can serve clients effectively 
without merging within each organization they have enough 
personnel scattered around the globe to take care of the largest 
multinational corporations and if they dont they can just go out 
and hire 
large corporations wont suffer from the mergers but 
middlemarket companies those with sales under 100 million or so 
could find themselves shunted aside experts say 
in recent years highly specialized consulting services have 
become a greater source of revenue for the big eight in 1984 for 
example the firms collectively drew 9355 million in revenue from 
consulting services last year that figure jumped to 21 billion 
according to bowman 
while each big eight firm serves small businesses experts say 
service to those companies sometimes is uneven 
are the major firms going to want to be price competitive for 
emerging companies or will they wait till these companies need a 
basket of services that they can more efficiently produce said 
gary previts professor of accountancy at case western reserve 
university in cleveland 
not all businesses need a large organization many corporations 
prefer firms that are still small enough to provide personal 
service said stuart kessler senior tax partner at goldstein 
golub kessler amp co in manhattan 
the cpa traditionally has been the consultant that does the 
handholding and i dont know how you do handholding when youve got 
thousands of offices he said 
indeed bowman contends that local accounting firms might find it 
easier to win small business clients because the the big firms 
are going to get so large they cant handle them 
while the consolidations are likely to result in the layoff of 
support staff and some professionals fees charged to clients are 
expected to remain unaffected 
there wont be any efficiencies in the audit and tax returns by 
becoming larger kessler said 
concern also swirls in the academic community where professors 
fear their students will have fewer job offers from which to choose 
but kessler says that could be a boon for secondtier accounting 
firms which also are on the lookout for new talent 
in other business news this past week 
the labor department said the nations unemployment rate rose 
01 percent to 53 percent in june another sign the economy is 
slowing 
latejune car and light truck sales plummeted 20 percent 
compared with strong sales in the same period last year 
the nations major general retailers reported their sales 
improved only modestly in june from mays disappointing results 
indicating consumer spending remains sluggish 
the british conglomerate hanson trust plc tentatively agreed to 
acquire consolidated gold fields plc which owns a 493 percent 
stake in us gold producer newmont mining corp for 553 billion

this is a time of year when farming can be more 
frustrating than usual when the weather gods and market forces seem 
to conspire for good or evil 
seeds have been planted plans have been made or at least 
tentatively drawn up now if only the right combination of sun and 
rain comes along if only consumer appetites hold just right for 
beef or pork or poultry 
except for winter wheat which already has shown its 
droughttattered profile the production of most other 1989 crops is 
still to be determined 
in just a month however when usda issues its monthly crop 
production report on aug 10 the pattern for corn soybeans and 
other major crops will be pretty well established 
from then on although there will be further revisions through 
the fall months farmers private analysts foreign buyers and usda 
economists will have a fairly accurate picture of us agricultural 
supply and demand for 198990 
meanwhile there are and will be hundreds of forecasts 
projections educated guesses computerized profiles and assorted 
dartboard analyses of how the us agricultural economy is shaping 
up for the year ahead 
the usda in the words of economist don seaborg says that 
cautious optimism marks the outlook for farmers and consumers 
unless the weather turns dry or becomes too wet over an 
extended area of the country later on this summer there will be 
large harvests of food crops seaborg says along with plentiful 
meat production the outlook points to continued abundant supplies 
of food 
a team of usda economists ken nelson fred white kevin bost 
lee christensen larry witucki sara short and jim miller said in 
a report in the july issue of agricultural outlook magazine that 
timely rains have improved crop prospects and that forage and feed 
costs are falling 
a surge in fed cattle supplies has weakened cattle prices 
which will remain under downward pressure through early summer 
the report said hog producers losses since last fall have sapped 
their financial strength so hog production decisions will depend 
critically upon what happens to feed prices this summer 
a large number of cattle in the marketing pipeline caused the 
slaughter market to decline since late march prompting feedlots to 
sell cattle earlier and at lighter weights the report said for 
example average slaughter weights declined by 10 pounds per head 
for steers and 12 pounds for heifers from march to may 
dry weather poor pasture conditions and low stocks of hay in 
early spring forced more cattle into feedlots 
although market prices of slaughter cattle dropped less than 1 
per 100 pounds in may to about 7450 per hundredweight analysts 
said prices may average in the range of 69 to 72 through early 
summer 
retail choice grade beef prices reached record levels in may 
but are expected to decline into summer partly because of the 
increased production and already lower cattle prices the report 
said 
hog farmers plans also will depend greatly on what happens to 
corn and soybean crops this summer 
breeding herds were scaled back last summer as rising feed costs 
cut into hog producers returns although analysts said the cutback 
was modest by historical standards when costprice squeezes 
developed 
one factor that may have buffered herd liquidation is that hog 
producers entered last years drought in a relatively strong 
financial position the report said net returns both in 1986 
and 1987 were the highest in recent history 
if normal crop conditions prevail and feed costs decline net 
returns to hog producers will improve as that happens inventories 
of breeding hogs should stabilize by the end of the year 
some other observations 
broiler producers continue to be encouraged by good prices net 
returns averaged 9 cents per pound in the first quarter compared 
with 6 cents in the fourth quarter of 1988 production is expected 
to increase about 5 percent this year to another record level 
turkey production is expected to increase about 3 percent this 
year wholesale prices may average in the range of 70 to 73 cents 
per pound up about 17 percent from 1988 
production of table eggs is expected to drop about 4 percent in 
1989 reflecting cutbacks in the laying flock because of last years 
low profit margins net returns to producers were about 11 cents per 
dozen in the first quarter and are expected to remain positive 
for the remainder of this year 
demand for dairy products has shown unusual strength for this 
time of year with prices rising during the heavy supply period of 
spring much of that was due to the demand for nonfat dry milk 
international prices of powdered milk is expected to remain strong 
in the second half of 1989 meaning that domestic prices probably 
will continue up cheese prices also can be expected to rise

when time inc and paramount communications inc 
bring their takeover battle before chancellor william t allen on 
tuesday they will face a jurist who is highly regarded by legal 
scholars including some who disagree with him 
hes really an extraordinary judge said james d cox a 
professor at duke university law school he brings the acuity of 
years of practice as well as a very outstanding academic bent 
which is something characteristic of the very best judges in 
american jurisprudence 
however cox said i find myself wincing more often than not 
with the results hes reached 
melvin a eisenberg a professor at the university of california 
at berkeley law school said of allen i disagree with a lot of 
his results but hes a very intelligent judge who has a very 
lively active mind 
such praise takes on even greater significance when considered in 
light of the role allens court plays in shaping us corporate law 
because nearly half of the fortune 500 companies are incorporated in 
delaware a decision in one case can have broad ramifications for 
other companies 
allen who heads delawares chancery court in wilmington on 
tuesday is to hear arguments on what could be the pivotal issue in 
the struggle for time paramount which has bid 122 billion for 
time contends the time board put the company up for sale in march 
when it agreed to a friendly merger with warner communications inc 
under the laws of delaware where all three companies are 
incorporated if a company has put itself on the block its board 
must consider whatever bids will give stockholders the maximum value 
for their shares if allen agrees with paramount it would be 
difficult for the time board to reject the 200 a share offer 
observers say it is hard to predict how allen might rule 
i dont think you can pigeonhole him said eisenberg 
michael bradley a university of michigan law professor said 
allen takes a middle of the ground conservative approach to 
takeovers 
bernard black a professor at the columbia university school of 
law called allen moderately proshareholder in the sense that 
hes shown some willingness at the end of the day to say 
ultimately the shareholders have the right to decide what they want 
to do 
however black said i would emphasize the words moderately 
and some 
allens past rulings give few clues as to how he might decide 
this case 
in march allen said the board of tw services inc which was 
fighting a hostile bid from the investor group coniston partners 
was not required to submit the unwanted offer to stockholders 
the judge acknowledged that corporate democracy is a pertinent 
concept but he added directors not shareholders have 
responsibilities to manage the business and affairs of the 
corporation subject however to a fiduciary obligation 
allen made the statement in a decision upholding tws poison 
pill takeover defense but in another case last year he struck 
down interco incs poison pill saying the companys board had 
tried to use the defense to prevent shareholders from deciding 
between the companys recapitalization plan and a hostile bid from 
investors steven and mitchell rales 
allen declined requests for an interview but he has acknowledged 
the significance of the timeparamount hearing 
late last month he refused to hold hearings on paramounts 
request to block times annual meeting the judge said it was more 
important to spend his time preparing for tuesdays session 
cox the duke professor said allen is aware of delawares 
influential role in us corporate law 
delaware court decisions have determined the outcome of many big 
takeover battles in recent years including grand metropolitan plcs 
successful pursuit of pillsbury co last year and shamrock holdings 
incs failed hostile bid for polaroid corp earlier this year 
but these decisions affect more than just the parties involved in 
a particular takeover fight they serve as precedents that can 
affect future confrontations and companies contemplating their 
strategies are mindful of past decisions 
allens decision in time which undoubtedly will be appealed by 
the losing side could affect friendly mergers planned by other 
companies 
allen 44 a graduate of new york university and the university 
of texas law school in austin practiced for 11 years with a 
wilmington firm before joining the chancery court 
he is an active participant in hearings questioning attorneys as 
they make their arguments and exhibiting a dry sense of humor like 
other judges on the chancery court he sometimes adds an air of 
informality to his courtroom presiding in a business suit rather 
than a judges trademark black robe 
allen joined the chancery court in 1985 the court which has 
five judges has a crowded calendar and at times has had to recruit 
retired judges to help with the caseload 
late last year retired judge william duffy was called back to 
the bench to preside over suits involving one of 1988s megadeals 
grand metropolitans buyout of pillsbury duffys ruling 
invalidating pillsburys poison pill was seen as a key factor in 
getting the company eventually to end months of resistance and agree 
to a 568 billion buyout

however else they may diverge nearly all wall 
street forecasts share one common viewpoint right now interest 
rates are down and headed still lower in the weeks ahead 
all the signs point analysts agree to further moves soon by the 
federal reserve to relax its credit policy 
after a year of tightening credit from the beginning of 1988 
through early this year in a campaign against inflation the fed 
lately has signaled its evident switch to a more stimulative 
approach in an effort to cushion the impact of a slowing economy 
we expect a move toward lower shortterm interest rates said 
erich heinemann economist at ladenburg thalmann amp co the fed 
should follow by cutting the discount rate before labor day 
in the unlikely event that fed policy stays tight many observers 
contend traders in the bond and shortterm money markets would 
probably do some de facto crediteasing on their own 
the longer the fed waits to loosen the reins the reasoning goes 
the more talk will spread of a possible recession that would 
encourage investors to buy securities like treasury bonds in 
expectations that rates would fall on the basis of slackening demand 
for credit 
as investors have learned to expect over the past decade or two 
falling rates can be a powerful plus for stock prices 
they tend to work with a lag as a stimulus to business activity 
and corporate profits at the same time they diminish the future 
appeal of interestbearing securities the main alternative to 
stocks that is available to money managers at investing institutions 
but as they study the current situation some stockmarket 
analysts confess to a few worries 
first of all experienced marketwatchers naturally grow 
suspicious any time some purported positive for stocks becomes 
universally accepted dogma 
by the time everybody agrees on an issue like this stock prices 
often have already taken the prospective news into account besides 
the market has a demonstrated penchant for proving the majority 
wrong 
secondly falling rates might not be so helpful to the stock 
market if they evolve into a symptom of serious weakness in the 
economy 
investors put such misgivings aside in the past week the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials rose 4780 points to 248786 
rebounding from a 9181point slide in the last week of june that 
stood as its worst weekly showing in more than 15 months 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 366 to 
18156 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
climbed 713 to 44242 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 478 at 36375 
volume on the big board averaged 12686 million shares a day 
down from 16215 million the week before 
whether the economy has a soft or hard landing the stock 
market could ultimately benefit argues michael sherman at shearson 
lehman brothers inc 
obviously the outlook for bonds and interestsensitive and 
recessionresistant stocks could be very good if interest rates 
tumbled he said 
more important however the entire equity market while not 
immune to the disappointment of declining profits and financial 
problems would ultimately respond vigorously to the further sharp 
fall in interest rates that would attend a hard landing 
the worst economic development for stocks sherman maintains 
would be no landing at all but persistent strength in the 
economy accompanied by renewed upward pressure on inflation and 
interest rates 
sherman rates such a script as no more than a 10 percent 
probability but if things should work out that way he says the 
markets would be faced with trouble 
this is the real bear scenario he concludes if it comes 
true bond prices would decline sharply and equities would do the 
same as the fed reverses policy and resumes tightening
