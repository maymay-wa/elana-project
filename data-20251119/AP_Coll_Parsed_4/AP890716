most union miners in appalachia decided to 
return to work with their midwestern and southern colleagues sunday 
but many stayed out of the west virginia coal fields where wildcat 
strikes began last month 
many united mine workers locals met sunday and voted to heed 
union president richard trumkas request that the miners return to 
work in southern west virginia however union officials said there 
were enough disgruntled miners to disrupt the coal fields again 
man theyre upset said danny wells a district board 
representative in umw district 17 the nations largest with 6000 
miners they are just upset with trumkas call they feel thats 
nothing been won yet 
angry miners began setting up wildcat pickets about 11 pm at 
mine sites throughout logan county 
wildcat walkouts by as many as 46000 miners supporting 1900 
striking pittston coal group workers have idled much of the nations 
coal production since june 12 the number of wildcat strikers fell 
to 37000 by the start of a unionsanctioned work stoppage last week 
umw president richard trumka on friday called an end to the 
fiveday contractsanctioned stoppage and asked the miners to 
return to work 
about 16000 miners all the miners in alabama illinois and 
indiana and some in kentucky were expected to return for their 
next scheduled shifts 
union leaders in pennsylvania said sunday they believed the 7500 
miners in their state would return by monday 
that put pressure on miners in west virginia ohio and tennessee 
because the protest had become a nationwide action wells said 
sunday it would have to be nationwide to be successful he said 
with the loss of support elsewhere it would not be wise to adopt 
a strategy different from that at the umws national headquarters in 
washington wells said 
youve got to have a leader and everybody cant lead he 
said 
in southeast ohio at least 700 striking coal miners planned to 
return to work monday and tuesday then resume observing a 
contractsanctioned stoppage wednesday thursday and friday said 
charles greer president of a umw local in new lexington 
trumka ordered us back and were going back greer said after 
a meeting in reinersville of about 600 miners sunday night 
in umw district 19 in southeastern kentucky and northeastern 
tennessee about 950 miners were expected to return to work early 
monday said district board member cecil michael partin 
some of the miners in that district returned to work sunday to 
inspect mines in preparation for a return to work partin said he 
said that was a good indication that other miners in the district 
would report monday 
in district 30 in eastern kentucky umw local spokesman terry 
varney who attended a meeting saturday of district and local 
officials said sunday he was fairly confident miners would return 
to work 
in madison about 25 miles south of charleston umw district 17 
officials met saturday with more than 400 local presidents and 
members but were unable to persuade everyone to cease the wildcat 
strikes which began in west virginia a federal judge has ordered 
the union to put an end to wildcat strike activities 
the miners were protesting pittstons failure to sign a contract 
that prohibits sunday work and mandatory overtime and guarantees 
full medical benefits for pensioners the 1900 pittston miners all 
work in kentucky virginia or west virginia 
wildcat strikers also have been upset that umw members and 
supporters have been arrested jailed and fined for civil 
disobedience in the coal fields 
on friday us district judge glen williams asked trumka and 
pittston president paul douglas to meet with him many of the miners 
saw this as a break for the union and williams request seemed to 
ease hostility on the lines 
meanwhile several coal companies said they cant meet orders due 
to the strike 
westmoreland coal co of philadelphia says it has told 11 foreign 
customers that it will not be able to make coal shipments totaling 
474041 tons at a price of about 40 a ton 
island creek corp of lexington ky said it also is having 
trouble filling orders the company said that it may fail to meet 
obligations ranging from 500000 to 2 million tons if the strikes 
continue

with more of its thin steel skin peeling away 
the exxon valdez moved into calmer seas off southern california on 
sunday as scientists puzzled over a gooey substance oozing from the 
damaged tanker 
battered by heavy swells seven steel plates have wrenched off 
the vessels hull and dangled below the valdez which was towed 
2500 miles to southern california waters from alaska the tanker 
caused an 11 milliongallon oil spill in march when it struck a reef 
in prince william sound 
because of the rough water and the hanging plates at least one 
of which hung 70 feet below the water surface divers could not 
enter the vessels tanks to collect oil samples assess damage and 
clean 
the danger is that the swells are creating surges of water 
through the open holes in the hull and the divers can get sucked 
through and across jagged steel said coast guard lt larry 
solberg 
authorities want to cut off the plates so that the valdez can get 
to its final destination san diego harbor for nine months of 
repairs at the national steel and shipbuilding co but to do it 
requires a protected inlet or cove 
the harbors depth is about 40 feet solberg said 
authorities towed the valdez about 30 to 40 miles to calmer seas 
sunday to relieve ocean stress on the ships increasingly exposed 
steel framework 
meanwhile a team of scientists was on the valdez trying to 
determine the composition of a substance that has oozed from the 
ship 
more tests were planned this week to determine whether the 
substance is toxic solberg said 
the tests assumed increased urgency after state attorney general 
john van de kamp filed suit to ensure the tanker remains outside 
california waters until officials are satisfied it is free of toxic 
materials 
van de kamp said he filed the lawsuit friday in san diego 
superior court to ensure the existence of an enforcement mechanism 
for whatever agreement we are able to reach with the exxon 
shipping co 
coast guard and other agency officials met over the weekend to 
discuss contingency planning in case the valdez breaks up in the 
open ocean solberg said stressing the ship was in no immediate 
danger 
theres a lot of things we cant see at present so we do have 
a little bit of concern solberg said 
the top choice for a temporary anchorage is pyramid cove on the 
southern side of san clemente island which has a depth of 110 feet 
solberg said a decision would be made within 10 days he said

two hundred volunteers reported 1100 
dolphin sightings this weekend during the first of 40 surveys by the 
dolphin project 
today we had reports of dolphins coming up to boats so close 
people could touch them said beau cutts president of the 
mariettabased conservation group 
the reason for the project is that a still unidentified disease 
killed about half the atlantic bottlenose population in 1987 and 
1988 the dolphin project designed to make four surveys each year 
is designed to try to provide scientists information on if and how 
that population recovers from the disaster 
a major part of the project is to photograph and identify 
individual dolphins by coloration and markings on their dorsal fins 
i dont i dont know of any other program of this type in the 
world especially when its conducted by lay citizens under the 
supervision of scientists cutts said 
the first survey with fivemember teams in 28 boats covered the 
coast in a band 13 miles wide from st catherines sound north to the 
south carolina line the survey was from 5 miles offshore to 8 miles 
inland up creeks and in marshes 
despite rain sunday 90 percent of the volunteers said they would 
be back for the second survey oct 13 through 15 from st 
catherines sound to the darien area

wildcat strikes waned in the southern 
appalachian and midwestern coal fields saturday as a 
unionsanctioned work stoppage expired but some coal officials 
worried that a union backtowork order wasnt genuine 
united mine workers president richard trumka on friday called an 
end to a fiveday nonpaid holiday and asked 37000 union coal 
miners to end wildcat strikes that have idled much of the nations 
coal production since june 12 
miners in alabama illinois and indiana immediately heeded the 
call and some returned for light work in the coal fields saturday 
most arent scheduled to return to work until monday 
illinois had 8500 miners returning alabama had 5000 and 
indiana 1750 
officials of the largest umw district in pennsylvania on saturday 
asked 3500 striking members to return to work at 1201 am monday 
said district 2 president nick molnar who met with most of the 54 
union local presidents at the districts headquarters in edensburg 
some of the strikers in kentucky have agreed to go back to work 
and the remainder are undecided it wasnt certain on saturday how 
many of the remaining wildcatters in west virginia ohio and 
tennesee would go back to work meetings were scheduled in those 
states through the weekend 
the wildcat strikes began june 12 in support of 1900 miners in 
west virigina virginia and kentucky on strike against the 
virginiabased pittston coal group inc the strike against pittston 
began april 5 in a contract dispute 
pittston wants a contract separate from the national pact so it 
can require sunday work and mandatory overtime and cut medical 
benefits for pensioners from 100 percent to 80 percent 
at a rally saturday attended by about 400 miners in colcord 40 
miles south of charleston some members said they didnt want to go 
back to work 
if we stop now without accomplishing anything we might as well 
say heres our jobs take em said miner joe james 
in madison about 25 miles south of charleston umw district 17 
officials met saturday with more than 400 local presidents and 
members but were unable to persuade everyone to cease the wildcat 
strikes a federal judge has ordered the union to put an end to 
wildcat strike activities 
it was about 5050 but some of them met again after they left 
our place said a union official speaking on a condition of 
anonymity some will start back and as they see how things are 
going others might go back 
the indecision fueled speculation by coal industry officials that 
trumkas plea for an end to the wildcat strike wasnt sincere 
i think the whole situation is very suspect as to whether their 
true intention is to return to work said mark polen a spokesman 
for the west virginia coal association whose members have lost 
15000 workers to the strike 
polen said he suspected trumkas call was not genuine because it 
included a continued unpaid holiday in some places for no apparent 
reason 
the union did not say why it extended the holiday period in 
places but in the past some districts have been kept out longer in 
attempts to even out the amount of time that workers were out this 
year district 17 workers in southern west virginia started the 
wildcat strikes but those in northern west virginias district 31 
didnt leave until the third day 
only time and the sunday midnight shift will tell polen said 
a spokesman for the bituminous coal operators association which 
includes most major coal companies except for pittston and holds a 
nostrike contract with the union said he wouldnt comment at least 
until monday 
the unions international executive board meets july 26 and 
trumkas backtowork request said the miners should return to the 
coal mines at least until then 
the unions contract allows it to call 10 holidays or memorial 
days a year the union used five last week in what was to have 
been a coolingoff period but sporadic violence still disrupted the 
coal fields 
the miners apparently were encouraged that a federal judge in 
virginia invited both trumka and pittston president paul douglas to 
meet with him tuesday to discuss why negotiators reached an impasse 
in early june 
trumka accepted judge glen williams offer pittston coal group 
president michael odom said the company would have no comment

citys center police and witnesses said 
nine people initially were reported killed in the blast and 11 
people subsequently died while hospitalized during the night

deep in the road officials said fragments from the bomb flew about 
400 yards and windows in buildings 300 yards away were smashed

died said officer mohammad naim 
after the blast new checkpoints manned by police and soldiers 
were put up around the city and all vehicles were stopped and 
searched 
the explosion is the work of our opponents and foreign agents 
who support them said foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi 
amani

government has long accused pakistan of interfering in afghanistans 
internal affairs a charge the government in islamabad denies 
pakistan along with the united states supports the moslem

leaders of the worlds seven largest industrialized 
democracies wrapped up their abbreviated summit sunday saying 
decisive action is urgently needed to protect the environment 
for the first time in 15 years an extensive portion of the final 
communique was devoted to environmental problems the summit leaders 
endorsed the bush administrations strategy for solving the problem 
of third world debt and touted their efforts in improving the world 
economy 
the leaders citing the harmony of the summit were adjourning 
earlier than planned that too was unprecedented in the era of 
economic summitry 
french president francois mitterrand the host of the threeday 
gathering read the final communique and indicated that the summit 
had concluded 
in his closing remarks mitterand said that the leaders of the 
seven nations do not pretend to substitute ourselves for others 
we are women and men of good will we want to put ourselves at the 
service of all humanity that is the significance of our work 
president bush expressed his gratitude to the french president 
and the host country saying we thank him for the way in which he 
conducted the meeting and we thank his fellow citizens 
in a final communique the leaders said there is growing 
awareness throughout the world of the necessity to preserve better 
the global ecological balance 
the leaders of france west germany britain japan canada 
italy and the united states were caught offguard saturday by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs request that the soviet economy be 
linked to that of the west 
our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward 
full and entire participation in the world economy gorbachev 
wrote to mitterrand it is obvious that the rest of the world can 
only gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such as 
that of the soviet union 
the letter was the main topic of discussion among the leaders 
saturday night 
they put the finishing touches on their final communique at a 
morning plenary session sunday 
in the draft the leaders said there is a serious threat to the 
atmosphere which could lead to future climate changes 
the leaders also expressed concern about the growing pollution 
of air lakes rivers oceans and seas 
protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted 
international response and for the early adoption worldwide of 
policies based on sustainable development 
on economic issues the summit nations also endorsed the us 
debt reduction strategy unveiled by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady on march 10 us officials had hoped that mexico the plans 
test case would come to agreement with its creditors before the 
conclusion of the summit 
while the socalled brady plan was not mentioned by name the 
communique clearly endorsed it urging commercial bankers to 
increasingly focus on reducing debt service costs to compliment 
new loans to those countries 
our approach to the debt problems has produced significant 
results but serious challenges remain they said 
the leaders found much to boast about in the performance of the 
economy this year but they did call for continued vigilance 
against the problem of rising inflation 
inflation where it has increased will continue to receive a 
firm policy response so that it will be put on a downward path 
the communique said 
it singled out the united states canada and italy as countries 
in which further reductions in budget deficits are needed 
action will be taken to bring them down the statement said 
this may help reduce the savingsinvestment gap and external 
imbalances contribute to countering inflation and encourage greater 
exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing interest rates 
the communique also addressed the growing drug problem with the 
leaders saying the situation has reached devastating proportions 
and requires speedy action 
we urge all countries especially those where drug production 
trading and consumption are large to join our efforts to counter 
drug production to reduce demand and to carry forward the fight 
against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its 
proceeds the declaration said 
the leaders ended their 27page statement with a reference to the 
international ethics committee on the deadly aids virus which met in 
paris in may the communique made no recommendations or suggestions 
but as promised the focus of the declaration was on the 
environment a subject in which president bush has sought to take 
the lead 
bush began his final full day in france by attending church 
services at the 104yearold american cathedral of paris he joined 
the congregation in praying for the economic summit a better 
dialogue between rich and poor nations and for the hostages being 
held in lebanon 
until the arrival of the gorbachev letter the debt problems of 
poland and of the third world were the focus of the 15th summit 
being held amid a series of extravaganzas marking the bicentennial 
of the french revolution 
in gorbachevs letter the soviet leader said his policy of 
economic restructuring known as perestroika means that the soviet 
union wants full and entire participation in the world economy 
gorbachev suggested cooperation in easing the third worlds 13 
trillion debt saying 
we see points of convergence and complementarity in the 
approaches to global problems in particular the solution to third 
world debt 
it doesnt matter who gets credit for the best initiative the 
essential thing is that there is a real possibility to contribute 
together to the efficiency of practical measures in the domain of 
debt 
the letter was the primary subject of discussion at saturdays 
working dinner under the gleaming glass pyramid in the louvre 
museums napoleon courtyard 
if there was a common element of reaction to the letter 
mitterrand spokesman hubert vedrine told reporters afterward it 
was that if gorbachevs initiative was inspired by the desire to 
insert the soviet union progressively into the world economy that 
is a good thing 
us officials were intrigued by the overture and white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the summit leaders found it 
positive and supportive 
but the officials also saw the idea as impractical and one said 
its going to be tough until he has a convertible ruble in a 
joking reference to the weak soviet currency 
on saturday the summit leaders issued declarations on china 
eastwest relations terrorism and human rights 
the eastwest declaration stated their willingness to give aid to 
poland and hungary in support of moves toward democracy and a free 
market economy the summit partners noted the food scarcity in 
poland and a european official said shipments of surplus food from 
european common market stocks could begin within two weeks 
the summit leaders denounced beijing authorities for crushing the 
prodemocracy movement and urged the world bank to deny new loans 
to china 
they also pledged to guard against human rights violations and 
condemned terrorism 
apparently referring to iran and its surrogates in lebanon and 
syria the leaders called for those with influence over 
hostagetakers to bring about the release of the captives fifteen 
foreigners are being held in lebanon including the citizens of 
three summit nations the united states italy and britain 
the leaders also agreed to set up an international task force to 
trace laundered money as a way of fighting the international trade 
in illicit drugs

here is the text of the communique issued sunday by 
the leaders of the seven largest industrialized democracies at the 
15th world economic summit 
1 we the heads of state or government of seven major industrial 
nations and the president of the commission of the european 
communities have met in paris for the 15th annual economic summit 
the summit of the arch initiates a new round of summits to succeed 
those begun at rambouillet in 1975 and at versailles in 1982 the 
round beginning in 1982 has seen one of the longest periods of 
sustained growth since the second world war these summits have 
permitted effective consultations offered the opportunity to launch 
initiatives and to strengthen international cooperation 
2 this years world economic situation presents three main 
challenges 
the choice and the implementation of measures needed to maintain 
balanced and sustained growth counter inflation create jobs and 
promote social justice these measures should also facilitate the 
adjustment of external imbalances promote international trade and 
investment and improve the economic situation of developing 
countries 
the development and the further integration of developing 
countries into the world economy whilst there has been substantial 
progress in many developing countries particularly those 
implementing sound economic policies the debt burden and the 
persistence of poverty often made worse by natural disasters 
affecting hundreds of millions of people are problems of deep 
concern which we must continue to face in a spirit of solidarity 
the urgent need to safeguard the environment for future 
generations scientific studies have revealed the existence of 
serious threats to our environment such as the depletion of the 
stratospheric ozone layer excessive emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases which could lead to future climate changes 
protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted 
international response and for the early adoption worldwide of 
policies based on sustainable development 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
3 growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving 
the efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening 
our cooperative efforts and the coordination process in the medium 
term the current buoyant investment seen during this period should 
pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help 
reduce the dangers of inflation the outlook is not however 
without risks 
4 until now the threat of inflation in many countries has been 
contained thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and 
monetary authorities but continued vigilance is required and 
inflation where it has increased will continue to receive a firm 
policy response so that it will be put on a downward path 
5 while some progress has been made in reducing external 
imbalances the momentum of adjustment has recently weakened 
markedly there needs to be further progress in adjusting external 
imbalances through cooperation 
6 in countries with fiscal and current account deficits 
including the united states of america canada and italy further 
reductions in budget deficits are needed action will be taken to 
bring them down this may help reduce the savingsinvestment gap and 
external imbalances contribute to countering inflation and 
encourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing 
interest rates 
7 countries with external surpluses including japan and 
germany should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomic 
policies and structural reforms that will encourage noninflationary 
growth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment 
8 all our countries share the responsibility for the sound 
development of the world economy over the medium term deficit 
countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their 
external adjustment and increased exports surplus countries have to 
contribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providing 
favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports 
9 the emergence of the newly industrializing economies and the 
initiation of a dialogue with them are welcome we call on those 
with substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment of 
external imbalances and the open trade and payments system to that 
end they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitive 
position implement gatt commitments and reduce trade barriers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
10 under the plaza and louvre agreements our countries agreed 
to pursue in a mutually reinforcing way policies of surveillance 
and coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals and 
at fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with those 
economic fundamentals 
there has been progress in the multilateral surveillance and 
coordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internal 
consistency of domestic policies and their international 
compatibility the procedures to be used have been more clearly 
defined and improved in cooperation with the international monetary 
fund 
11 the coordination process has made a positive contribution to 
world economic development and it has also contributed greatly to 
improving the functioning of the international monetary system 
there has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets 
it is important to continue and where appropriate to develop 
this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning 
and the stability of the international monetary system in a manner 
consistent with economic fundamentals we therefore ask the finance 
ministers to continue to keep under review possible steps that could 
be taken to improve the coordination process exchange market 
cooperation and the functioning of the international monetary 
system 
12 we welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninth 
review of the international monetary fund quotas with a view to a 
decision on this matter before the end of the years 
we note that the question of a resumption of sdr allocation 
remains under consideration in the executive board of the 
international monetary fund 
13 within the european community the european monetary system 
has contributed to a significant degree of economic policy 
convergence and monetary stability

14 we will continue to promote measures in order to remove 
inefficiencies in our economies these inefficiencies affect many 
aspects of economic activity reduce potential growth rates and the 
prospects for job creation diminish the effectiveness of 
macroeconomic policies and impede the external adjustment process 
in this context tax reforms modernization of financial markets 
strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in all 
sectors including energy industry and agriculture are necessary so 
are the improvement of education and vocational training 
transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimed 
at giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market and 
reducing unemployment 
within the european community the steady progress toward 
completion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the single 
act has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency 
15 the decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade

28 we welcome the increasing grant element in the development 
assistance as well as the steps taken to convert loans into grants 
and we urge further steps to this end flexibility in development 
aid as much as in debt rescheduling is required

30 our approach to the debt problems has produced signficant 
results but serious challenges remain in many countries the ratio 
of debt service to exports remains high financing for growth 
promoting investment is scarce and capital flight is a key problem 
an improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part of 
efforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessive 
levels of debt these improvements of the current situation depend 
above all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in the 
debtor countries 
31 to address these challenges we are strongly committed to the 
strengthened debt strategy this will rely on a casebycase basis 
on the following actions 
borrowing countries should implement with the assistance of the 
fund and the bank sound economic policies particularly designed to 
mobilize savings stimulate investment and reverse capital flight 
banks should increasingly focus on voluntary marketbased debt 
and debt service reduction operations as a complement to new 
lending 
the international monetary fund and world bank will support 
significant debt reduction by setting aside a portion of 
policybased loans 
limited interest support will be provided through additional 
financing by the international monetary fund and the world bank for 
transactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction 
for that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed 
continued paris club rescheduling and flexibility of 
exportcredit agencies 
strengthening of the international financial institutions 
capability for supporting mediumterm macroeconomic and structural 
adjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects of 
export shortfalls and external shocks 
32 in the framework of this strategy 
we welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions to 
encourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequate 
resources for these purposes 
we urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to develop 
strong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debt 
service reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by the 
two bretton woods institutions 
we urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in 
their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to 
conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction 
debt service reduction and new money we stress that official 
creditors should not substitute for private lenders our governments 
are prepared to consider as appropriate tax regulatory and 
accounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessary 
obstacles to debt and debt service reductions

33 there is growing awareness throughout the world of the 
necessity to preserve better the global ecological balance this 
includes serious threats to the atmosphere which could lead to 
future climate changes we note with great concern the growing 
pollution of air lakes rivers oceans and seas acid rain 
dangerous substances and the rapid desertification and 
deforestation such environmental degradation endangers species and 
undermines the wellbeing of individuals and societies 
decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the 
earths ecological balance we will work together to achieve the 
common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment 
in order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carry 
out obligations to future generations 
34 we urge all countries to give further impetus to scientific 
research on environmental issues to develop necessary technologies 
and to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits of 
environmental policies 
the persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should not 
unduly delay our action 
in this connection we ask all countries to combine their efforts 
in order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale 
35 we believe that international cooperation also needs to be 
enhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in order 
to reduce pollution or provide alternative solutions 
36 we believe that industry has a crucial role in preventing 
pollution at source in waste minimization in energy conservation 
and in the design and marketing of costeffective clean 
technologies the agricultural sector must also contribute to 
tackling problems such as water pollution soil erosion and 
desertification 
37 environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade 
development energy transport agriculture and economic planning 
therefore environmental considerations must be taken into account 
into economic decisionmaking in fact good economic policies and 
good environmental policies are mutually reinforcing 
in order to achieve sustainable development we shall ensure the 
compatibility of economic growth and development with the protection 
of the environment environmental protection and related investment 
should contribute to economic growth in this respect intensified 
efforts for technological breakthrough are important to reconcile 
economic growth and environmental policies

rockets and shells rained down on beirut 
on sunday leaving buildings and cars in flames as syrian and 
christian gunners fought one of their heaviest duels in nearly two 
months police said one person died and 27 were wounded 
the bombardment began at dusk saturday and raged through sunday 
in the streets of beiruts moslem and christian sectors 
tens of thousands of residents spent the night in basements and 
bomb shelters as about 1500 shells and rockets hit the city which 
has been without electricity and water for two days 
there was a twohour lull at daybreak allowing people to venture 
out to supermarkets to stock up on supplies the shelling resumed at 
midmorning 
the new casualties raised the overall toll to 418 dead and 1673 
injured since the current round of fighting broke out march 8 
between syrian troops and the mainly christian troops of army gen 
michel aoun 
its almost two months since we were pounded with such 
intensity said a resident of the christian district of sin elfil 
in east beirut refusing to be named he said 40 rockets hit his 
neighborhood in one minute 
the duels began with a syrian barrage on the coastline of the 
christian enclave the syrians have been shelling the coast in an 
effort to prevent shipments of food fuel and arms from reaching the 
christians 
a spokeman for aouns command speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the syrian shelling targeted two ships that were 
trying to enter the port of byblos 19 miles north of beirut 
one fuel tanker managed to slip through the syrian barrage 
while the other ship that carried food supplies veered back toward 
international waters the spokesman said 
he would not give the ships identities or say who owned them 
police said aouns gunners struck back with 155mm howitzers 
targeting syrian batteries along west beiruts seaside districts of 
ein mreisseh raouche and ramlet albaida 
the shelling then steadily escalated into random bombardment of 
residential neighborhoods said a police spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing regulations 
the syrians insist on maintaining their blockade of the 
310squaremile christian enclave despite repeated pleas from the 
arab league for a ceasefire 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a moslem cabinet 
vying for legitimacy with a christian military cabinet led by aoun 
said he was deeply worried by the spiraling escalation of 
hostilities 
he appealed to the arab league to intensify its efforts to stop 
the fighting 
the syrians maintain about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
arab league mandate to end lebanons civil war now in its 15th year 
the latest round of violence broke out when aoun blockaded moslem 
ports he said were depriving his government of 100 million in taxes 
annually the syrians in turn blockaded christian ports and aoun 
vowed a war of liberation to drive the syrian army out 
druse and shiite moslem militias allied with syria are demanding 
aouns removal as a precondition for any peace with the christians

clear assessments of the costs benefits and resource 
implications of environmental protection should help governments to 
take the necessary decisions on the mix of price signals eg taxes 
or expenditures and regulatory actions reflecting where possible 
the full value of natural resources 
we encourage the world bank and regional development banks to 
integrate environmental considerations into their activities 
international organizations such as the oecd and the united nations 
and its affiliated organizations will be asked to develop further 
techniques of analysis which would help governments assess 
appropriate economic measures to promote the quality of the 
environment we ask the oecd within the context of its work on 
integrating environment and economic decisionmaking to examine 
selected environmental indicators that could be developed we expect 
the 1992 un conference on environment and development to give 
additional momentum to the protection of the global environment 
38 to help developing countries deal with past damage and to 
encourage them to take environmentally desirable action economic 
incentives may include the use of aid mechanisms and specific 
transfer of technology in special cases oda debt forgiveness and 
debtfornature swaps can play a useful role in environmental 
protection 
we also emphasize the necessity to take into account the 
interests and needs of developing countries in sustaining the growth 
of their economies and the financial and technological requirements 
to meet environmental challenges 
39 the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming 
and calls for prompt action 
we welcome the helsinki conclusions related among other issues 
to the complete abandonment of the production and consumption of 
chlorofluorocarbons covered by the montreal protocol as soon as 
possible and not later than the end of the century specific 
attention must also be given to those ozonedepleting substances not 
covered by the montreal protocol we shall promote the development 
and use of suitable substitute substances and technologies more 
emphasis should be placed on projects that provide alternatives to 
chlorofluorocarbons 
40 we strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which threaten to induce 
climate change endangering the environment and ultimately the 
economy we strongly suppport the work undertaken by the 
intergovernmental panel on climate change on this issue 
we need to strengthen the worldwide network of observatories for 
greenhouse gases and supoport the world meteorological organization 
initiative to establish a global climatological reference network to 
detect climate changes 
41 we agree that increasing energy efficiency could make a 
substantial contribution to these goals we urge international 
organizations concerned to encourage measures including economic 
measures to improve energy conservation and more broadly 
efficiency in the use of energy of all kinds and to promote relevant 
techniques and technologies 
we are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards for 
nuclear power plants and to strengthening international cooperation 
in safe operation of power plants and waste management and we 
recognize that nuclear power also plays an inmportant role in 
limiting output of greenhouse gases 
42 deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be 
reversed we call for the adoption of sustainable forest management 
practices with a view to preserving the scale of world forests the 
relevant international organizations will be asked to complete 
reports on the state of the worlds forests by 1990 
43 preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the 
world as a whole while recognizing the sovereign rights of 
developing countries to make use of their natural resources we 
encourage through a sustainable use of tropical forests the 
protection of all the species therein and the traditional rights to 
land and other resources of local communities we welcome the german 
initiative in this field as a basis for progress 
to this end we give strong support to rapid implementation of 
the tropical forest action plan which was adopted in 1986 in the 
framework of the food and agricultural organization we appeal to 
both consumer and producer countries which are united in the 
international tropical timber organization to join their efforts to 
ensure better conservation of the forests we express our readiness 
to assist the efforts of nations with tropical forests through 
financial and technical cooperation and in international 
organizations 
44 temperate forests lakes and rivers must be protected against 
the effects of acid pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides it is necessary to pursue actively the bilateral and 
multilateral efforts to this end 
45 the increasing complexity of the issues related to the 
protection of the atmosphere calls for innovative solutions new 
instruments may be contemplated we believe that the conclusion of a 
framework or umbrella convention on climate change to set out 
general principles or guidelines is urgently required to mobilize 
and rationalize the efforts made by the international community 
we welcome the work under way by the united nations environment 
program in cooperation with the world meteorological organization 
drawing on the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change 
and the results of other international meetings specific protocols 
containing concrete commitments could be fitted into the framework 
as scientific evidence requires and permits

we must not allow the lecture platforms of socialist 
universities to be used for the wanton dissemination of 
bourgeoisliberal views li said referring to western ideas he 
said colleges wrongly had put intellectual education before 
ideological and moral teaching 
since crushing studentled protests for a freer society six weeks

up those involved in the protests but to root out what they see as 
the causes especially western ideas 
they have jammed radio signals from the us governmentrun voice 
of america turned off local hotels reception of foreign television 
broadcasts and banned sales of foreign newspapers and magazines in 
beijing

municipal waste treatment officials across the 
nation fear proposed government standards for sewage sludge disposal 
are so restrictive they will kill what many regard as the best way 
to get rid of the waste turn it into fertilizer and compost 
the new regulations make it just about impossible to do 
anything with sludge except burn it or dump it in landfills said 
paul f levy executive director of the massachusetts water 
resources authority 
the environmental protection agency facing a law suit from 
environmentalists to meet a congressional mandate issued proposed 
rules early this year to regulate the amounts of toxic materials in 
sludge 
but waste treatment officials have attacked the regulations 
saying they are based on flawed information and overly pessimistic 
scenarios 
the draft regulations have gone much further than is needed to 
protect the public health and by doing so the epa will set back the 
whole effort of beneficial use said robert r perry deputy 
director of the water pollution control federation an association 
of municipal waste officials and engineers it will force more and 
more communities into incineration or simply landfilling sludge 
john m walker a scientist in the epas office of municipal 
pollution control agreed that the draft rules are excessive and 
predicted the regulations will be changed before they are finalized 
the epa officials who drafted the regulations erred at being 
too conservative using worstcase scenarios that really couldnt 
occur walker said 
perry called the draft regulations among the most complex and 
controversial ever developed by epa 
levy said the regulations as written would force his agency to 
scrap plans to transform boston area sludge now being dumped into 
boston harbor at a rate of 70 tons a day into fertilizer that 
would be sold to citrus growers in florida 
we must be permitted to successfully recycle sludge and we must 
have regulations permitting its use in a variety of beneficial 
manners he said without that ability there will be no 
environmentally safe and effective manner to dispose of sludge 
without creating problems elsewhere 
the regulations also would kill programs already in place such 
as the sale of a sludgetocompost product produced by the 
washington suburban sanitary commission the marylandmade compost 
which has been used on the white house lawn has a waiting list of 
potential customers 
its not that were opposed to the concept of sludge 
regulation we support it said charles murray head of the 
commissions sludge operations the problem is epas regulations 
have some fundamental flaws in the way they are developed which 
resulted in regulations which really discourage beneficial reuse 
and thats contrary to epas own stated policy 
in designing its theoretical models the epa created a 
megaeater who is simultaneously a teenager a man a woman and 
a senior citizen levy said this person is expected to consume 
eight different vegetables every day for 70 years 
levy said restrictions on copper and zinc would reduce the use of 
a sludgetocompost product to a maximum of 004 inches thick less 
than the thickness of a sheet of paper 
thats just not reasonable said perry you would have to 
put it on in such small quantities that the farmers wouldnt be 
interested in doing it 
the department of agriculture recommends onehalf inch to six 
inches of compost 
levy also complained that requiring compost and fertilizer labels 
to include the names and quantities of 22 pollutants would be 
meaningless and confusing and even could be intimidating to the 
average user he said a statement saying the product is in 
compliance with epa regulations should be sufficient 
municipal waste officials are optimistic epa will change the 
rules in the wake of the intense criticism 
were confident the agency will recognize those flaws and make 
the appropriate changes murray said 
environmentalists at the natural resources defense council which 
has filed suit to push for sewer sludge regulations said they had 
not sufficiently analyzed the controversial draft rules for the land 
use of sludge but they quickly attacked as too weak proposed 
regulations of sludge disposal in landfills and incinerators 
we are quite concerned about the levels of risk the epa appears 
to consider acceptable for incineration and landfills said 
jessica landman senior attorney at the environmental group

the san francisco zoos youngest koala has 
been officially named after an aborigine goodluck stone after a 
former zoo administrators entry was chosen from a field of 15000 
contestants 
called tjuringa the stone also signifies creation zoo 
officials said 
for the first seven months of his life the koala was known as 
baby schnooks but the new name was chosen from thousands of entries 
from as far away as germany in a name the koala competition held by 
the zoo 
the winner was ola kupka who left her job as associate director 
of development for the zoo in december zoo officials said the name 
was picked on its merits however not because of who thought of it 
the baby koala snuggled in his mothers pouch saturday smelling 
sort of like cough drops from the steady diet of eucalyptus 
kupka who came up with the name by looking through an 
encyclopedia said in her entry letter that if she won the offered 
sixday trip to brisbane australia she would take along several 
disabled people from the recreation center for the handicapped 
where she now works 
entries arrived from mexico canada germany and throughout the 
united states said kathleen harper who sifted through the 
thousands of entries to narrow the field 
people whod seen it voted to name it fuzzy or cuddles or 
schnuckems harper said others took the australian approach and 
offered names like sydney melbourne brisbane or crocodile dundee 
she said 
harper narrowed the entries to five finalists and took them to 19 
judges she said

broadcasting and salespitch taboos may be falling 
in response to rising public tolerance but a florida legal panel is 
considering imposing the nations most comprehensive restrictions on 
lawyers advertising 
the proposal expected to be presented to the florida bar board 
of governors wednesday is touted by supporters as necessary to 
return integrity to the profession 
but others claim its an obvious constitutional violation that 
ultimately would be rejected by the us supreme court which opened 
up broadcast and mail advertising to lawyers 12 years ago 
its really all a matter of their pocketbooks said harry 
jacobs a personalinjury attorney in the orlando area who has 
advertised on television for two years many of the established 
attorneys just dont like the idea of a younger attorney building up 
the kind of practice in five or six years it took them 10 or 12 
years to make 
several other states have restricted lawyers advertising but 
the florida proposal has attracted national attention because of the 
nearly 65 million the states lawyers spent on commercials last 
year and the widespread use by smaller practitioners of directmail 
solicitations to accident victims 
lawyer advertising in florida is bigger than in most states 
said bill wagner a tampa attorney and president of the association 
of trial lawyers of america there is a lot of concern about this 
issue right now and what happens in florida could set the tone for 
similar action in other states 
the proposal would prohibit background music and theatrics such 
as the reenactment of accidents also banned would be endorsements 
from celebrities or others not in the law firm 
all that would be left would be to show a business card on the 
screen no motion no jingles no slogans said david w singer 
a personalinjury lawyer in southern florida who is widely known for 
his television commercials these kind of restrictions are 
unprecedented in this day and age 
in one of singers ads a barber tells a squirming little boy 
that if he doesnt sit still ill cut off your ear the boy 
spins the chair around and says that if the barber does hell call 
singer the commercial then cuts away to singer who says no case 
is too small 
the restrictions also would outlaw using addresses from police 
accident reports for directmail solicitation the legislature this 
year passed a bill banning the use of police reports for commercial 
purposes 
stephen zack president of the 44000member state bar said the 
present system cannot adequately control misleading and fraudulent 
claims and he said it causes a high rate of juror disqualifications 
because of peoples negative perceptions of the ads 
weve had people who see the ads and say they no longer have 
any respect for our system said zack 
but others claim that advertising benefits all attorneys by 
disseminating information about legal rights and making lawyers 
appear more accessible 
weve had many people come in saying that they would have had 
no idea how to contact a lawyer until they saw our ads said 
singer this is what they are trying to control they are playing 
with the first amendment 
even if passed by the 50member board of governors the 
restrictions would still need approval from the state supreme court 
which must take note of earlier rulings by the us supreme court 
against strict limitations on attorney ads 
in the latest challenge the us supreme court ruled last year 
in a kentucky case that a lawyer could engage in directmail 
solicitations but it said states could enact reasonable 
restrictions 
i would say the florida situation would be on its way to the 
supreme court said jerome bogutz a philadelphia attorney and 
president of the advertising commission of the american bar 
association floridas rules go further than anyone elses its 
like they are testing the court to see how far can they go

just when it seemed safe to 
ride the rails again irish republican army bombs have made train 
service between dublin and belfast a daytoday proposition 
service between the two capitals was disrupted again over the 
weekend as the british army gingerly removed a van abandoned beneath 
a bridge at meigh about four miles north of the border of northern 
ireland and the irish republic 
it was just a hoax a spokesman for the royal ulster 
constabulary said sunday afternoon but it was one that took two 
days to clear 
ira bombs often arrive in stolen vans and the railroad has been 
a prime target since the first explosion at the kilnasaggart bridge 
on dec 16 
explosions and threats along the northern ireland side of the 
border disrupted service for 53 days between dec 16 and midapril 
and passenger traffic dropped 30 percent according to northern 
ireland railways 
two months of peace ended june 17 when a bomb exploded near the 
station at garriaghy in suburban belfast there was another 
explosion june 20 at another commuter station and a flurry of false 
reports that briefly closed the line 
no one has been killed or injured in these incidents though 
there was a close call march 2 when a bomb exploded without warning 
on a bridge four minutes before a passenger train was due 
the recent problems have dented the railroads hopes of 
rebuilding traffic on the dublinbelfast line a joint venture with 
irish rail that normally carries 1300 passengers a day on the 
onehour 55minute express journey there is no scheduled bus or 
air service between the cities 
we always get passengers to their destinations an executive 
of northern ireland railways said though often that includes a bus 
ride part of the way 
southbound trains from belfast were stopped over the weekend at 
newry and passengers were put aboard buses for a 12mile ride to 
dundalk in the irish republic to resume their rail journey 
the ira in a statement reported march 11 in the belfast 
telegraph said the bombings were part of a military strategy 
aimed at forcing the british army out of fixed positions and border 
bunkers 
the mostly roman catholic ira outlawed both by the british and 
irish governments has waged a 20year guerrilla campaign to drive 
the british out of the protestantdominated province of northern 
ireland and unite it with the irish republic 
an explosion is often the bait to lure british soldiers near 
other boobytrapped devices one such trap involving four explosive 
devices was planted in february at the kilnasaggart bridge which 
is within 1000 yards of the border 
the area is known as bandit country where narrow roads twist 
and turn through pastures and thickets of trees past walls 
emblazoned with proira graffiti 
the british army operates from hilltop forts watching the 
countryside from steel towers 
on march 20 the ira ambushed and killed two highranking 
officers of the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police 
force about three miles from kilnasaggart 
on april 12 explosives packed into a stolen van exploded without 
warning in warrenpoint six miles to the northeast killing a 
19yearold catholic woman and causing extensive damage to property 
though little more than a wide place in the road kilnasaggart 
has a rich deposit of history reflecting its strategic position 
astride the slighe miodhluacdhra the ancient route between southern 
ireland and the northern lands of ulster 
in a pasture below the bridge stands the kilnasaggart pillar 
stone the 8thcentury christian carving on what appears to be a 
prehistoric monolith 
above the bridge rises the ruined tower of moyry castle built by 
the british in 1601 during the suppression of a gaelic rebellion led 
by hugh oneill 
the bombings are sheer economic madness says jl mccart a 
district council member for the social democratic and labor party 
the largest predominantly catholic party in northern ireland 
in his home in warrenpoint mccart proudly displays a silver 
plate commemorating the reopening of newry station in 1984 
i would hate to have happen to the railways what happened to 
the crossborder electricity line said mccart recalling the ira 
bombing campaign that severed the energy link

the smithsonian institution was prepared to say 
two university of pennsylvania researchers invented the computer 
until an iowa congressman who helps hold the museums purse strings 
said iowa state university should get the credit 
the solution honor many early developments 
university of pennsylvania researchers john w mauchly and j 
presper eckert completed building their eniac machine in 1945 
utilizing thousands of vacuum tubes and taking up an entire 
basement it is often cited as the first electronic digital computer 
but was it really 
rep neal smith the no 3 democrat on the house appropriations 
committee insists the credit should go to physicist john v 
atanasoff and graduate student clifford berry who developed a 
smaller machine at iowa state university from 1937 to 1941 
in an attempt to assuage smiths wounded pride the national 
museum of american history preparing a major exhibition on 
information technology has decided to spread the credit among 
several computer pioneers 
we will not be presenting the eniac as the original or 
first computer said the museums director roger m kennedy in 
a letter to smith 
he wrote that our presentation will rather show that there were 
many early developments that led to the emergence of the computer 
industry including of course the work of john atanasoff and the 
development of the eniac at the university of pennsylvania 
the exhibition also will recognize the pioneering work of howard 
aiken at harvard and george stibitz at bell laboratories kennedy 
said 
what touched off the computerinventor tiff was a newsletter 
issued by the smithsonian institution which runs the museum saying 
that the exhibition would include a walk through the eniac the 
first electronic digital computer 
smith fired off a letter to kennedy saying he was gravely 
concerned that the exhibition would jeopardize the museums 
unrivaled reputation for historical accuracy 
the congressman cited a 1973 federal court decision that 
invalidated patents obtained by mauchly and eckert for eniac 
electronic numerical integrator and computer the court held that 
eckert and mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic 
electronic digital computer but instead derived their machine from 
the work done earlier at iowa state 
i strongly urge you to review the documented facts of record 
relating to dr atanasoffs invention in the interests of avoiding 
what would be both a historical inaccuracy and a monumental 
injustice to a great american inventor smith wrote 
in his reply kennedy said the museum was negotiating with iowa 
state for loan of the last remaining piece of the original 
atanasoffberry computer the memory drum and also a 
reconstructed breadboard model of the central unit 
these will be prominently displayed with appropriate 
photographs and information about atanasoffs role he wrote 
that was not enough for smith he still isnt satisfied 
mr kennedys letter was welcome but it offered no new 
information and failed to allay the concerns i had expressed the 
congressman said friday in a statement 
the central question is not whether dr atanasoffs work will 
be included in some minor way in the exhibition the question is 
will he be recognized as the inventor of the first electronic 
digital computer in accordance with the historical fact 
smith suggested that the atanasoffberry machine be exhibited as 
the first electronic digital computer and the eniac as the first 
programmable computer 
the interests of both justice and history would be served and 
the reputation of the smithsonian for historical accuracy would not 
be tarnished smith said 
the corporate descendent of the eniac meanwhile is continuing 
to side with mauchly and eckert the university of pennsylvania 
researchers founded a company that was taken over by sperry rand in 
1950 and sperry subsequently merged with burroughs to form unisys 
corp 
complex inventions like the computer rarely have just one 
parent said john b wise chief technology officer for unisys 
encyclopedias generally start the history of the computer with the 
invention of the abacus and list dozens of major contributors to 
what is generally accepted as the first electronic digital computer 
the eniac

japanese women angered by a new sales tax and a 
series of scandals ensnaring the government are suddenly tapping 
their dormant political might and presenting a serious challenge to 
japans maledominated system 
record numbers of women are running in elections july 23 for 
parliaments upper house many of them responding to the seaminess 
in japanese politics are portraying themselves as ordinary 
homemakers immune to corruption 
their potential clout is enormous among eligible voters women 
outnumber men by 27 million and they are more likely to actually 
cast ballots 
women are the only mobilizable political group in japan 
today said kuniko inoguchi a political scientist at sophia 
university its very dynamic a silent revolution 
ironically the prosperity and social conservatism maintained by 
the liberal democratic party japans governing party for 34 years 
is undermining its position welleducated women deprived of 
professions have plenty of time to think about politics men are 
too busy with work said ms inoguchi 
kinuko ofuchi 44yearold mother of two defeated a liberal 
democrat in a recent byelection in northern niigata prefecture by 
campaigning in pink suits as an ordinary wife and mother 
in elections july 2 for the tokyo city legislature analysts 
attributed liberal democratic setbacks to an unusually large female 
voter turnout 
the disenchantment that has thrust so many women into the 
political process has been linked in part to a new 3 percent sales 
tax that hits many homemakers at the supermarket 
the governing party also has been weakened by noboru takeshitas 
resignation as prime minister last month because of allegations the 
recruit co an information services conglomerate sought to 
influence politicians with campaign contributions and lowcost stock 
deals 
further takeshitas successor sousuke uno has been forced to 
fend off calls for his resignation because of reports he paid for 
mistresses 
uno continues to deny rumors he will resign over what the 
japanese press calls his woman problem 
the opposition socialist party headed by a woman takako doi 
seeks to tap the female protest vote as a way of ending the 
conservative majority in the upper house and perhaps challenging it 
in subsequent elections for the more powerful lower house 
we are giving financial affirmative action to women 
candidates said yumiko torii of the socialists womens bureau 
all parties except the liberal democrats have entered a record 
number of female candidates the 146 women running more than a 
fifth of the total compare with 82 in the last upper house election 
in 1986 
currently only 10 percent of upper house members are women and 
the lower house has only seven women to 505 men 
the sixyear terms of 69 liberal democrats in the upper house 
have expired to keep its majority the party must win back 54 of 
those seats a feat that analysts and pollsters dont expect 
polls show that like the republican party in the united states 
the liberal democrats suffer from a gender gap and get 
significantly weaker support from women than men 
the governing party is seen as representing big business and 
traditionally male spheres of influence the socialist and communist 
parties often are associated with consumers and womens concerns 
women found even more reason to attack the governing party a week 
ago when agriculture minister hisao horinouchi stumping for liberal 
democratic candidates asserted women are useless in the world of 
politics 
frontpage stories quoted him as saying in the end womens 
task is to stay home and take care of their families it added 
that ms doi was unqualified to head the government because she was 
single and has no children 
horinouchi later apologized and was admonished by uno for harming 
public trust in politics 
but ms doi told kyodo news service he still doesnt seem to 
realize that liberal democrat politics are so rotten women cant 
keep quiet any more 
a few years ago statements such as horinouchis or alleged 
affairs such as unos might not have caused much fuss in a 1969 
interview the wife of thenprime minister eisaku sato said he used 
to beat her and regularly cavorted with a geisha the japanese 
public didnt seem to blink an eye 
now uno is besieged with protests from antiprostitution groups 
his own staff has urged the government to appoint more women to 
policy advisory councils and thousands of women are demanding that 
horinouchi resign

bush said neither he nor his summit partners interpreted 
gorbachevs weekend letter as a request to join next years summit 
it was saying lets do something in a common way about solving 
problems around the world 
in his letter gorbachev said it is obvious that the rest of 
the world can only gain by the opening to the world economy of a 
market such as that of the soviet union 
bush attending his first summit as president hailed the 
sessions as a clear success the summit focused not only on 
economic growth improved trading procedures and plans for an effort 
to safeguard the environment as well as a denunciation of chinas 
repression of a democratic movement 
bush said he was touched by what i saw and heard in his two 
stops in eastern europe and said people yearning for freedom and 
democracy deserve our support and its because of the community of 
values shared by these summit countries that we were able to agree 
to meet soon to discuss concerted action that will help poland and 
hungary 
bush grappled several times with questions concerning gorbachevs 
letter conceding at one point that some unnamed western leaders 
briefly considered the possibility that it was mischiefmaking he 
said that was dismissed however 
people concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the 
changing world we are living in he said 
they are moving towards our system he said

brothers david and james taggart will get 
to tell their side of the story this week in their trial on charges 
of evading taxes on money diverted from the ptl ministry to finance 
their lavish lifestyle 
after more than a week of compelling prosecution testimony in the 
brothers federal trial on taxevasion and conspiracy charges 
defense attorney ben cotten will begin his case sometime monday 
i think there will be some surprises just as there have been 
some surprises on the prosecution side cotten said during a break 
thursday 
he said in his opening statement that the case was not about 
taxes but was a case about authorization intent and doubt he 
said witnesses and documents would show his clients had 
authorization to use ptl credit cards and take out cash advances 
from the highest levels at ptl 
us district judge robert potter gave the jury the day off 
friday the prosecution was expected to rest its case after about 
two hours of additional testimony monday 
its been more than two years since the taggarts were fired by 
ptl following the resignation of jim bakker the founder of the 
television ministry which once took in more than 175 million in 
annual donations 
bakker and richard dortch his former top deputy at the 
nowbankrupt television ministry are scheduled to go on trial aug 
28 in charlotte on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy 
the taggart brothers joined ptl in the late 1970s as piano

lew lutz was convinced they were drug 
dealers the two men who had rented his building for two years and 
were operating a military surplus store that never did any 
business 
the windows of the store were covered with canvas but the men 
always paid their rent on time and in cash sometimes with crisp 
100 bills 
i watch miami vice i know whats going on in the world 
lutz said 
but on the day the authorities came to close down the shop they 
greeted the two with handshakes not handcuffs 
lutz tenants were federal agents who had been operating a sting 
operation from the store to nab traffickers in stolen military 
equipment 
the twoyear operation near hill air force base about 20 miles 
north of salt lake city ended with the july 10 arrest of two 
military policemen one of their wives and sealed indictments 
against 12 other people 
the two enlisted men allegedly tried to sell three stolen f16 
fighter engines to agents posing as operators of a military surplus 
store that promised cash for surplus 
lutz who also owns a bar next door to the shop had rented it in 
1987 to a man he knew as jim palmer bounced checks and late 
payments had been the legacy of earlier tenants but palmer was 
different said lutz who knew the second man only as tom 
at first i thought they were mormons because theyd come in and 
order a meal but never any beer said lutz 
months passed and lutz could see business next door was terrible 
when hed send bar patrons interested in camping equipment to the 
surplus store theyd come back saying it was closed 
i even offered one of them a parttime job because i could see 
they werent doing any business lutz said he said no im 
looking for another kind of job 
these guys put this thing together real good he said if i 
was looking for somewhere to sell something that was stolen that 
would be it 
lutz decided his tenants were running a drug operation but he 
said he did nothing about his suspicion believing it wouldnt do 
any good drug dealers never get caught lutz said 
in retrospect scott lewis also thought the shops tenants were 
suspecious from his nearby jewelry store he saw jim palmer come 
and go in his fourwheeldrive vehicle but rarely a customer 
he was undercover very well he looked the part he was 
bearded he looked like he was from the vietnam era lewis said 
operation punchout as it was dubbed by the fbi turned up more 
than 100 suspects at 15 military bases helmets military clothing 
computers radios bulletproof vests and nightvision devices were 
among the items being stolen and sold to the wholesalers that were 
the agencys prime target 
its strictly money you have people who have access to very 
sensitive and marketable equipment equipment basically its a greed 
issue said robert bryant special agent in charge of the fbis 
salt lake office 
bryant believes pilferage of military hardware could run into the 
billions of dollars undercover operations may act as a deterrent 
he said 
bryant said five agents worked in the operation including an 
undisclosed number who were not fbi he would not say what other 
agency or agencies were involved 
the stores legally obtained inventory was mere windowdressing 
but legitimate customers had to be dealt with bryant said the 
salesemen tried to quote inflated prices but that didnt always 
work 
if people came in and insisted on buying something they the 
agents won salesman of the month not an honor they wanted 
bryant said

the us steel industry has returned to 
normal levels of profitability and ending import quotas in place 
the past five years would have little overall impact according to a 
congressional research agency 
the effect of the quotas has declined substantially and the 
vast majority of them are now going unfilled the general 
accounting office said in a report released sunday while 
expiration of the quotas might effect the market for a few 
individual steel products it would likely have little impact on 
the market as a whole 
twenty separate quota agreements covering steel imports from 29 
countries are due to expire sept 30 president bush is expected to 
announce a new steel policy soon after he returns from the paris 
economic summit 
senators from states with agricultural and other major exports 
have been campaigning against the quotas while those from 
steelproducing states have been urging a fiveyear extension there 
have been reports that the white house is weighing proposed two and 
fouryear extensions 
the main effect of extending the quotas would be to protect the 
steel industry from possible future adverse exchangerate changes or 
wage increases the gao report said 
it said the major cause of the industrys plight when the quotas 
were adopted in 1985 was the recession earlier in the decade a 
situation made worse by a surge in imports and the soaring value of 
the dollar 
american producer shipments declined from 1974 to 1985 by 44 
million tons of the decline 545 percent stemmed from reduced us 
consumption 182 percent from increased imports 159 percent from 
minimill competition and 114 percent from reduced exports 
the quotas were designed to limit steel imports to a us market 
share of no more than 202 percent annually according to the 
american iron and steel institute import penetration was 264 
percent at its height in 1984 falling to 252 percent in 1985 23 
percent in 1986 209 percent in 1987 and 203 percent in 1988 
since 1985 the gao said the industry has regained 
competitiveness principally as a result of the substantial decline 
in the value of the dollar improvements in labor productivity and 
reductions and slower growth in wages and benefits 
industry analysts acknowledge that the surge in imports has died 
down and that american steelmakers are back in competitive form but 
stress that a downturn in the world market could be near 
in the event of a downturn the analysts said the united states 
could again become a target for dumping a reason for keeping the 
quotas in place 
however the gao report said existing trade laws provide remedies 
in cases where the steel industry needs protection from subsidized 
or imports dumped in the united states at prices below those in 
the home market 
sen pete wilson rcalif who requested the gao study said it 
flatly rejects the steel industrys big lie that it is sick and 
needs import protection to survive 
we now have a report that tells us that the steel industrys 
problems stemmed from its own inefficiencies an overvalued dollar 
and an economywide recession wilson said

the jury remains out on agent orange even 
though a decade has passed since congress told government scientists 
to determine whether a link exists between the herbicide and 
ailments among vietnam veterans 
hearings last week on capitol hill showed that while veterans 
demand compensation for ills including cancer birth defects and 
miscarriages they maintain are linked to exposure to the 
dioxincontaining substance scientists are disputing how to go 
about a study 
there were charges of political concerns eclipsing scientific 
ones and pleas for science to yield to human concerns critics of 
the centers for disease control where most research is done say 
results and action are long overdue 
its just terribly frustrating said paul s egan 
legislative director of the vietnam veterans of america he said 
veterans were literally drenched with agent orange and nothing 
has happened yet were alarmed if there seems to be dioxin in 
coffee filters 
action is possible in the next year or two due in part to a 
decision by edward j derwinski secretary of the new veterans 
affairs department 
the former congressman was put on the spot when us district 
judge thelton e henderson in san francisco ordered the va 
department to revise how it determines the possible health effects 
of exposure to agent orange 
henderson said the va had imposed an impermissibly demanding 
test for connecting agent orange with health problems 
derwinski decided against an appeal meaning there will be new 
rules in october 
the new rules would affect the claims by nearly 35000 veterans 
who say they have disorders caused by agent orange only five claims 
have been allowed and those were all for a skin ailment known as 
chloracne 
the senate may pass legislation that would provide interim 
temporary payment of va benefits to vietnam veterans suffering from 
nonhodgkins lymphoma and soft tissue carcinoma both cancers linked 
to agent orange 
already because of legislation passed in 1981 lowerincome 
veterans who believe their health problems are caused by agent 
orange may receive va care the va says 
the senate had passed an interim payment measure last fall but 
it was opposed by the reagan administration and died in the house 
the senate veterans affairs committee approved a new bill last week 
the sponsors sens john f kerry dmass and thomas daschle 
dsd take derwinksis decision on the appeal as a good sign 
on the house side the outlook is questionable tim sechrist an 
aide to rep douglas applegate says applegate wants to look at the 
vas new regulations the ohio democrat is chairman of the veterans 
affairs subcommittee on compensation pension and insurance 
va committee chairman gv sonny montgomery of mississippi 
told his hospitals and health care subcommittee monday i am 
concerned that too many times the emotion surrounding this topic is 
the result of apparent mismatches between hopedfor results and the 
actual scientific results of studies of agent orange 
in the other body there is legislation pending that deals with 
compensation for certain diseases on the basis of feared exposure to 
agent orange we should not act until exposure is known and the link 
between exposure and disease is assessed we know we cannot simply 
rely on service in vietnam as an indicator of exposure 
those were the issues government scientists were supposed to 
start addressing 10 years ago hearings monday and tuesday showed 
what has happened 
cdc scientist dr vernon n houk said a study is impossible 
because its results cant be validated the result was cancellation 
in 1986 of a massive epidemiological study undertaken in 1983 with 
19 million of its cost unspent 
va was given some 3 million of that last year to conduct blood 
tests on air force veterans of ranch hand the agent orange spraying 
operation in which 1200 people participated the air force in an 
ongoing study criticized by outsiders says so far the death rate 
among ranch handers is no different from that of the general 
population and there is no proof of a link to cancer 
houk said there was no way to prove where a soldier was when 12 
million gallons of agent orange were sprayed over vietnam between 
1965 and 1970 to destroy the dense foliage that provided cover to 
the enemy 
witnesses including former government scientists challenged the 
cdc in a hearing tuesday of an oversight subcommittee of the 
government operations committee they said cdc ignored detailed 
records of spraying and troop movements available in washington and 
elsewhere and tried to water down both the agent orange study and a 
separate vietnam experience study 
government scientists in turn criticized a study done by 
columbia university scientists jeanne and steven stellman for the 
american legion 
the study matching a mail survey of 6810 veterans with 
government records on troop movements and herbicide spraying found 
a correlation between agent orange and various health complaints 
reported by the veterans there were no results on cancer 
congress office of technology assessment said the american 
legion selfreporting study suffered from inaccurate recollections 
by veterans 20 years after service imprecise depiction of 
locations and spray paths that are too wide to be useful 
governments officials say more will be known next spring when cdc 
releases a study of the incidence of selected cancers in vietnam 
veterans they also say scientists are better able to test blood for 
dioxin and they have a better idea how long dioxin remains in the 
body 
whatever those results one scientist says an open mind is the 
answer as long as there are millions of veterans and family 
members who have a legitimate health concern regarding this issue 
it is incumbent upon us to consider any and all possibilities and 
certainly to consider new technology and lateral approaches in this 
area said dr michael e kafrissen former visiting scientist at 
cdc

smashing antique chinese urns and breaking down doors before he was 
arrested swedish media reported 
king carl xvi gustaf queen silvia and their three children were 
in southeastern sweden on vacation at the time

the castle even into the apartment of the royal family police 
spokesman ulf magnetorp told the national news agency tt 
the intruder was not identified 
swedish radio and tt said the 36yearold man was incoherent when 
arrested at the 17th century drottningholm royal palace about 10 
miles west of stockholm 
the reports said he had been released from a mental institution 
six months ago tt said police took him to the institution following 
his arrest 
following standing orders guards at the palace called police 
instead of intervening when the intruder burst in a main entrance 
magnetorp said he said those orders should be changed 
the guards would have acted differently had the royal family 
been in the castle curt johansson acting head of the royal 
guards told tt 
earlier in the morning the man was seen near the castle feeding 
ducks it was later discovered he had fed them bank notes

its almost like having a baby i feel like a grandmother with 
a new child said the delighted mrs bush as she sniffed her 
eponymous bouquet of carmine and creamcolored roses

a smile thank you i adore them i love the color combination 
the rose has already won an award for its creators the george 
delbard company frances premiere rosebush specialists with 35 
million bushes a year 
horticulturist henri delbard who crossbred the flowers said 
it takes ten years to create a new rose 
obviously we didnt know mrs bush would be the presidents 
wife ten years ago delbard confessed but we found the colors 
of this rose particularly fitting and fashionable for patriotic 
reasons red and white 
the garden in the bois de boulogne is a favorite tourist stop 
and mrs bush made her visit there on a sunny day while her husband 
and other world leaders wound up their economic summit 
in addition to the thick bouquet of cut roses mrs bush was also 
promised bushes of the newly christened rose 
the first lady who has a worldfamous rose garden back home at

a trial begins monday in which surviving family 
members claim korean air lines is liable for damages stemming from 
the 1983 incident in which one of its planes strayed into soviet 
territory and was shot down killing all 269 aboard 
families of the passengers killed in the shootdown of flight 007 
say the planes crew engaged in willful misconduct that makes the 
airline liable for damages in excess of the 75000perpassenger 
limit normally permitted under international agreement 
the international civil aviation organization concluded flight 
007 had been off course for nearly 5 hours before it was destroyed 
the jumbo jet was flying from new york to seoul south korea when 
a soviet military jet tracking the boeing 747 attacked it over 
sakhalin island a site of soviet military installations 
there were 61 us citizens among the passengers 
the us government said the plane was lost due to a navigational 
mistake and that its pilot did not know he was over soviet 
territory the soviet union contends the plane intentionally flew 
its course to photograph sensitive military installations 
the civil jury trial will take place before us district court 
judge aubrey robinson 
lawyers for the families will present expert witnesses including 
airline pilots who fly the north pacific route take by flight 007 
the families suggest in court papers that 
crew members aboard flight 007 should have known shortly after 
leaving anchorage alaska on the last leg of their journey that 
because of an error they made before takeoff they were operating 
without a reliable inertia navigation system the three computerized 
devices aboard the aircraft were the primary means of navigating the 
flight 
instead of temporarily aborting the flight to reprogram the 
system the crew may have decided to navigate the flight without it 
in clear violation of proper piloting procedure 
flight 007s crew members may have been motivated by a desire to 
conceal their initial error that caused the system to be 
misprogrammed or misaligned if they had had to correct their error 
they would have had to dump much of their fuel over the north 
pacific a procedure for which other kal pilots had been disciplined 
kal says the only inference that can be drawn from the assumed 
deviation from a normal flight path is that the crew was negligent 
in failing to notice it had gone off course the judge said in a 
ruling last november that negligence may not be the only explanation 
a failure to notice that the flight was offcourse at point a 
or point b or point c might be evidence only of negligence 
said robinson but a failure to notice that the flight was 
offcourse at point a and point b and point c is susceptible to 
a different interpretation 
that different interpretation is that the crew was aware of 
its deviation but elected not to report it and take corrective 
action suggested the judge 
robinson found sufficient evidence for a conclusion that the crew 
of flight 007 knew the navigation system aboard the plane was 
unreliable 
kal said there was no evidence to indicate whether the system was 
functioning properly and no evidence the alleged misprogramming or 
improper alignment of the system was deliberate 
the first claim is clearly erroneous said robinson the 
second misses the mark the law does not require that the 
crew must have intentionally misprogrammed or misaligned the ins 
system

with a letter outlining the kremlins hopes for 
closer economic ties with the west soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev stole the limelight at the summit of the worlds seven 
wealthiest democracies 
the moscow missive captured the attention of the kingpins of 
capitalism at the 15th world economic summit prompting both 
promises of western support for perestroika and skepticism that the 
soviet economy will ever mesh with free markets 
we talked about it a great deal president bush told a 
postsummit news conference sunday people concluded it was just 
one more manifestation of the changing world were living in 
bush seemed impressed that gorbachev brought his concerns to the 
summit in a letter appealing for eventual integration of eastern and 
western economies 
but summit leaders suggested it will be a long time before the 
soviet economy has enough in common with the west to pull up a chair 
at the seven richest nations annual conference on the financial 
health of the world 
we welcome the interest shown in the letter bush said but 
this was not an application for admission to the g7 
any talk of inviting gorbachev to next years summit in the 
united states is a little premature said bush 
asked if the kremlin leaders message might have been intended to 
drum up publicity for perestroika or upstage the summit the 
president replied i cant say that that never occurred to us 
but he emphasized that the summit partners decided the letter had 
good intentions and engendered hope for a continued warming trend 
between east and west 
gorbachev has long contended that the success of his reform 
movement known as perestroika or restructuring depends in part on 
the willingness of western nations to cooperate with credits joint 
ventures and other projects that could earn the soviets hard 
currency 
our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward 
full and entire participation in the world economy gorbachev 
wrote french president francois mitterrand the summit chairman 
the kremlin chief deemed it obvious that the rest of the world 
can only gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such 
as that of the soviet union 
gorbachevs letter caused a stir among the democratic leaders 
but it broke no new ground in soviet policy and some doubts were 
expressed over the chances for closer economic ties 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said she wished the 
soviets every success in their reforms but i dont see the time 
she the soviet union will join us because of her having become a 
great freemarket economic success 
gorbachev often addresses international gatherings to wish them 
well in their undertakings and to offer his own views of how global 
relations can be improved 
he has said repeatedly that creating economic links between 
socialist and capitalist countries would make the two political 
blocs more interdependent thereby enhancing predictability and 
stability 
reflecting the wests riveting interest in every hint that the 
kremlin could be creeping toward capitalism the seven summit 
leaders made gorbachevs letter the hot topic of conversation at 
their gala dinner on saturday most remarked on it in their 
valedictory news conferences 
this marks the first time that the leader of a country that 
contests the economic systems of the seven shows himself as an 
interlocutor not as an opponent italian prime minister ciriaco 
de mita told reporters sunday 
we wish success to the process of democratization in the soviet 
union mitterrand commented we salute the courage of this 
enterprise and even though its not up to us to implement it we 
will contribute to its success in any way we can 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said he was pleased that 
gorbachev recognized the responsibility of the soviet union in 
resolving world economic problems 
gorbachev wrote that he saw points of convergence on how to 
resolve the third world debt crisis but he offered no specifics 
the soviet economy has been slow to recover from years of 
stagnation imposed by overcentralization corruption and a 
sprawling bureaucracy 
since taking power in march 1985 gorbachev has introduced an 
array of reforms but they have produced more social successes than 
financial improvements 
national income productivity and industrial output remain 
relatively low and the average skilled worker earns only the 
equivalent of about 300 per month 
it was an invitation to dialogue and in that regard i view it 
positively canadian prime minister brian mulroney said 
he described gorbachevs letter as a constructive and 
innovative gesture of a political nature but noted that the 
economic systems of east and west are so different that tightening 
cooperation will prove difficult 
its going to be tough until he has a convertible ruble said 
one us official who insisted on anonymity

lighting the paris sky with an explosion of color 
france wrapped up a threeday 50 million celebration of the 200th 
anniversary of the french revolution and disproved critics 
predictions the fest would fall flat 
president bush in paris for bicentennial festivities and a 
meeting of the leaders of the worlds seven richest democracies 
told the congregation at the american cathedral on sunday that both 
events reaffirmed the right of all men and women to be free 
the night before bouquets of color from 170000 rockets washed 
the sky over the eiffel tower in a 45minute display that culminated 
in a 200footwide tableau of the ship of paris the citys symbol 
in the blue white and red colors of france 
police said 400000 to 500000 people viewed the fireworks 
display one day after a 1 million people mobbed the champselysees 
to see a whimsical avantgarde parade that was the centerpiece of 
the festival 
critics had predicted the economic summit would detract from the 
revolutions message of liberty equality and fraternity or even 
insult more than two dozen leaders of developing nations in town for 
the bicentennial 
there also were fears the parade created by advertising star 
jeanpaul goude and broadcast to hundreds of millions of tv viewers 
worldwide would be an embarrassment 
but the consensus was that it was a hit even the staunchly 
conservative daily le figaro usually hostile to any initiative of 
the socialist government ran a banner headline reading the 
triumph of the revolution but with a cartoon showing a housewife 
grumbling over the cost 
premier michel rocard sent a message to the president of the 
bicentennial mission jeannoel jeanneney congratulating him for 
the exceptional success 
culture minister jack lang said the french gave a frank and 
giant yes to the bicentennial 
we offered modernity at the risk of derision jeanneney 
acknowledged but the commemoration became national and 
planetary 
goudes parade called the marseillaise after the national 
anthem featured african drummers dancing soviet bears 
cheerleaders and an american marching band that moonwalked down the 
avenue 
american opera star jessye norman sang the french national anthem 
midway through the evening 
the gamble was without doubt a little crazy but it was won 
le monde wrote calling the parade surprising and original it 
did not give the idea to say the least of a chauvinistic and 
xenophobic france 
mitterrand asked sunday at a news conference what he thought of 
the criticism replied what counts is the result

five years after an unemployed security 
guard killed 21 people at a mcdonalds restaurant local residents 
have agreed on a memorial to the victims of the massacre one of the 
nations worst 
the site at the heart of san ysidros business district has 
changed from the day james oliver huberty turned it into a 
slaughterhouse before a police sniper killed him 
the fastfood restaurant has been replaced by a temporary 
building for a junior college satellite campus with a patch of bare 
ground set aside for the memorial once the 50000 needed to erect 
it has been raised 
a sign nearly impossible to read from the street marks the spot 
where the restaurant once stood it reads 
this site reserved for a memorial to honor victims of the 
tragedy of july 18 1984 
it was the singleday worst massacre by a single gunman in the 
nations history 
the 41yearold huberty armed with a shotgun a semiautomatic 
rifle and a semiautomatic pistol shot at anything that moved 
inside or outside the crowded restaurant which was a few blocks 
from his apartment 
he fired 245 rounds during a 77minute rampage that ended the 
lives of people as young as 8 months and as old as 74 
in the intervening years there has been a string of seemingly 
senseless mass killings by gunmen in different parts of the country 
the latest when gunman patrick purdy opened fire jan 5 in a 
schoolyard in stockton calif killing five people and injuring 
about 30 before ending his own life spurred a rash of legislation 
to limit private use of automatic weapons 
mcdonalds corp razed the san ysidro site almost immediately and 
donated it to the city of san diego which governs this 
predominantly hispanic border community mcdonalds opened another 
restaurant about a halfmile north 
when the city council voted to sell the lot in june 1987 a 
200squarefoot area was reserved for a victims memorial 
eight months later council members approved the sale for 
136000 to the southwestern community college district which last 
year opened san ysidros first college building 
among the schools first projects was a contest among 
architecture students for a massacre memorial the winning entry was 
designed by roberto valdes jr who now attends an architecture 
school in mexico city 
the proposed memorial consists of 21 tall marblecovered 
hexagons that resemble obelisks the hexagons lean toward one in the 
center that points skyward 
we hope the memorial will be in place by the end of the 
calendar year said district spokeswoman susan herney the 
design has been approved the plan specifications have been 
engineered and were pursuing the funding 
sale of the property followed months of emotional public debate 
and left some bitterness with several people who lost family members 
and wanted the entire parcel turned into a memorial park 
others opposed any type of monument arguing that it would 
memorialize the killer but the satellite campus dean serafin 
zasueta said such sentiments arent heard much anymore 
there was a great deal of dissension among the community about 
a college coming here he said ive seen a great deal of change

gov buddy roemer elected as a reform 
candidate who pledged to end the days of gov huey longs 
depressionstyle populism is getting nowhere in his 18month 
attempt to overhaul louisianas tax system 
by now roemer had hoped to be touting a new louisiana with 
jobs created by businesses attracted by lower taxes instead he is 
dealing with political acrimony from legislators as the 1991 
election begins to loom closer 
youve got politicians drawing lines in the dirt and this 
states going to hell state sen don kelly said as the 
legislature ended a sixday special session last monday 
this years regular legislative session and the special extension 
were marked by battles over a temporary sales tax budget cuts and a 
state lottery the lottery and most of the budget cuts failed but 
the temporary sales tax went through 
roemer campaigned in 1987 on the theme of reforming 
louisianas tax system including a lower homestead exemption more 
reliance on local governments to pay for some programs and reduced 
business taxes 
louisiana businesses pay 96 percent of the states property taxes 
and the state handles many programs that other states leave up to 
local governments 
the homestead exemption thought up by long during the 
depression so people wouldnt lose their homes exempts the first 
75000 of the value of a house in which the owners live above 
that houses are assessed at only 10 percent of their fair market 
value for a house valued at 76000 the local tax rate would be 
applied to 100 10 percent of 1000 
in 1982 the average tax in louisiana on homes valued at 100000 
with fha mortgages was 150 in louisiana 1260 nationwide 
not only are property taxes for homeowners low to start with 
property values are depressed now and on top of all of that 
assessors are elected 
the downturn in the oil and gas industry left the state with an 
800 million accumulated deficit that was paid off through a bond 
issue last year louisiana has ranked near the top of the nations 
unemployment list for months and had the highest rate in the nation 
94 percent in may 
the legislature rejected roemers first tax plan during a special 
session in october another special session in march did produce a 
plan but voters rejected it 55 percent to 45 percent 
that plans defeat left the state with a projected budget deficit 
this year of 700 million 
the roemer administration responded with a balanced budget 
proposal calling for closing many state schools and hospitals 
what the legislature produced instead was a 341 million sales 
tax imposed for a year the rest of the deficit was overcome mostly 
through higher projected oil prices a 101 million surplus from 
last year and a requirement that state agencies cover cost increases 
associated with inflation 
the temporary sales tax actually is an exemption removed food 
utilities and gasoline normally are exempt from the states 4cent 
sales tax but 3 cents of the exemption was removed 
roemer points to accomplishments during his 18monthold 
administration including a teacher pay raise plan a tough clean 
air act laws designed to reduce workers compensation costs and 
antidrug legislation the state also has a balanced budget for the 
second straight year 
but next year when the temporary sales taxes expire the state 
will fall more than 800 million short according to a legislative 
fiscal office report 
were going to have to get together and try to figure out some 
permanent solution and try to figure out a plan that can pass this 
legislature whether that can be put together i dont know said 
sen bb sixty rayburn a legislator since 1948 
on the outskirts of the tax fight is a long debate on a state 
lottery which threeterm former gov edwin edwards who says he 
will run again in 1991 advocated during his last campaign polls 
have shown widespread support for a lottery 
although he has opposed the idea roemer allowed the lottery to 
be debated during the special session the house and senate both 
rejected the measure 
roemer believes a lottery would take the most money from people 
who cant afford it and says the notion that its a cureall for 
the states money troubles is an illusion

defense secretary dick cheney faces pressure 
this week from a delegation of top south korean military leaders 
determined to counter congressional moves to cut us troops in that 
key allied nation 
at the same time the secretary has to deal with demands from 
some in congress that the pentagon sharply reduce its military 
commitment in the economically prosperous asian country 
cheney who has repeatedly said the pentagon has no plans at 
present to reduce forces in south korea is not expected to make any 
formal commitment during his meetings with south korean defense 
minister lee sanghoon 
the minister has told south koreas national assembly defense 
committee he wants to get the united states to sign a joint 
communique promising to maintain its troops at current levels which 
costs the united states 26 billion a year 
but given the atmosphere of reduced superpower tensions and 
evertightening budgets and increasing pressure from capitol hill 
the pentagon has begun to think about how to plan for a reduction 
in the more than 43000 us troops on the korean peninsula 
officials say 
theres been some discussion in the building of looking down 
the road said a senior defense official who spoke on condition 
he not be identified by name its still fairly nebulous and 
early in the game its conceptual and still a small cloud on 
the horizon 
the official hastened to add that there is no thought about 
withdrawing totally from the area in which there were more than 
500000 us troops during the height of the korean war in the 1950s 
any reduction probably would be couched in a wideangle look 
and restructuring of us forces in the entire pacific region that 
could be years if not decades away the official said 
that would mark a significant change in the way past 
administrations have been able to deal with the question 
a proposal for troop reductions put forward by president carter 
was quickly scuttled after it met fierce opposition on capitol hill 
sen carl levin dmich a member of the senate armed services 
committee called last month for steep cuts in south koreabased 
forces to 10000 troops 
sens bennett johnston dla and three other democrats dale 
bumpers of arkansas jim sasser of tennessee and patrick leahy of 
vermont wrote to cheney last month that his upcoming meeting with 
his south korean counterpart would be an ideal opportunity to 
begin discussions on reducing our military presence in korea 
bumpers told a hearing of the senate appropriations defense 
subcommittee that reductions were justified because south koreas 
gross national product is seven times that of its rival north korea 
its population is twice that of north korea and it only spends 5 
percent of its gnp on defense 
i have become increasingly convinced that debate ought to begin 
about our presence in korea he said 
cheney in his appearance before the committee did not rule out 
consideration of the problem noting president bushs proposed 
withdrawal of us troops in europe and saying a similar assessment 
of us forces in asia could occur 
and secretary of state james a baker iii asked about possible 
cuts in south korea during an appearance sunday on abctvs this 
week with david brinkley also noted that bush has proposed 
reductions in europe and said to the extent that we can see some 
correlative moves with respect to the status of forces in the 
pacific maybe those kind of things can be considered in the future 
but right now the united states policy remains what it has been

with barely concealed relief the leaders of the 
worlds seven richest democracies ended their economic summit early 
skipping a gastronomic gala sunday night at the discreet suggestion 
of west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the leaders issued their final 22page communique at lunchtime 
sunday and scrapped a 90minute plenary session scheduled for the 
afternoon as well as their farewell dinner at the palais delysee 
the official explanation was that the leaders completed their 
work faster than expected because they got on so well together 
despite the harmony no one seemed to want to linger on 
theyd set forth their views on the world economy drugs and the 
environment and apparently that was all they had to say 
we were kind of running out of gas said president bush who 
came to paris on the heels of a fourday swing through poland and 
hungary 
i tell you its been a vigorous experience in physical fitness 
for me i wasnt about to argue we needed more time and nor was 
anyone else bush told a postsummit news conference 
privately aides said there were smiles all round after host 
french president francois mitterrand mentioned to kohl during an 
informal gathering saturday that he would not be offended if his 
guests took a rain check on the dinner 
kohl sounded out the rest 
according to official sources britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher looked incredulous for a moment and then sent fast word to 
ready her official aircraft for sunday afternoon bush clasped his 
hands and smiled broadly 
while the others hastened to get out of town bush got a free 
afternoon and evening in paris before heading to the netherlands on 
monday 
things are going faster than foreseen there have been no 
obstacles i repeat there is no other explanation french 
government spokesman hubert vedrine said late saturday in announcing 
the first word of the early ending 
it had been a long weekend 
a string of parades ceremonies lunches and dinners started 
thursday as mitterrand dovetailed the summit with the spectacular 
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the french revolution 
by the time they finished saturday nights dinner at the louvre 
museum the leaders of the united states japan france britain 
west germany canada and italy had eaten six extravagant meals 
together in elegant venues 
the french organizers said no food would go to waste from the 
cancellation of sunday nights repast 
we made all the arrangements three months ago but we didnt 
have to throw anything away because we realized saturday that they 
wouldnt have the sunday dinner said muriel de pierrebourg a 
spokeswoman for the organizers 
british officials were particularly anxious to quash rumors that 
mrs thatcher precipitated the early exit 
shed made a controversial entry declaring that the french 
revolution was the beginning of a bloody reign of terror rather than 
the foundation of human rights as mitterrand sees it 
with british newspapers suggesting mrs thatcher had offended the 
french londons sunday times called her the john mcenroe of 
diplomacy and been snubbed in return she didnt want to look 
like the spoiler at the end of the party 
thatcher aides said shed planned on staying through the dinner 
and flying out at midnight on sunday 
the seven leaders 1987 summit in venice was curtailed in advance 
and with less harmony the final dinner was canceled because mrs 
thatcher said she had to leave early for an election campaign and 
mitterrand wanted to catch the finals of frances national soccer 
cup

congress tackles a full slate of business this 
week from foreign policy to the hud scandal while also laboring to 
complete major money bills before taking its annual august recess 
a house government operations subcommittee continues its 
investigation of the scandal at the department of housing and urban 
development with former hud secretary carla hills now the us 
trade representative scheduled to testify 
hills was named in sworn testimony last week as among those who 
intervened to ease department restrictions on drg funding corp a 
private lender whose participation in hud programs had been 
restricted over its violation of department rules 
the restrictions on drg which is now under federal criminal 
investigation were lifted in 1985 after hills intervened directly 
with hud secretary samuel pierce 
the house is scheduled on wednesday to take up the annual 
appropriations bill that puts money into hud programs as well as 
the department of veterans affairs for the 1990 fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
in addition to a likely discussion of the hud scandal amendments 
are expected on evicting drug dealers and their families from 
federally subsidized public housing projects 
thirteen appropriations bills have to be passed each year to 
provide money for the full range of government operations so far 
two of them for energy and water and for interior department 
programs have been approved by the house and await senate action 
agriculture and foreign aid appropriations also are likely to 
come up in the house this week in addition to the hudveterans 
measure 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has said he hopes to 
complete all or nearly all of the money bills before lawmakers 
leave washington aug 5 for a monthlong recess 
the senate is likely to devote most of the week to completing a 
state department authorization bill the routine measure is often 
used by lawmakers as a vehicle to express their feelings about world 
events 
at least two hot issues are likely to arise 
whether the united states should continue its talks in tunis 
with officials of the palestine liberation organization who have 
past links to terrorism 
whether to impose strong prohibitions on enlisting other 
countries to advance foreign policy aims that the us government is 
barred from doing itself as the reagan administration did during 
the irancontra scandal 
the senate also is expected to take up rural development 
legislation that would create loans for rural businesses and provide 
up to 315 million over five years for upgrading rural water and 
sewer systems other aid would be provided to rural schools and 
hospitals 
a house subcommittee meanwhile will continue hearings on the 
supreme courts ruling protecting the burning of the american flag 
as a form of political speech and another panel will receive the 
bush administrations latest economic forecast from budget director 
richard darman 
in other action 
the house ethics committee will meet probably on thursday to 
take up the case of rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 ranking 
house gop leadership official gingrich has been accused in a 
complaint by rep bill alexander dark of violating house rules 
that prohibit receiving gifts from indidviduals with a direct 
interest in legislation 
the complaint stems from investments in a partnership formed to 
promote a book gingrich coauthored window of opportunity the 
complaint strongly parallels the ethics complaint gingrich brought 
against former house speaker jim wright dtexas and gingrich has 
dismissed it as politically motivated retaliation 
house and senate negotitators continue meeting in an effort to 
resolve differences in separate savings and loan industry bailout 
bills after breaking a procedural deadlock last week the conferees 
tentatively agreed to adopt the most stringent features of each bill 
intended to prevent a recurrence of the sampl crisis but they 
remained divided on a new regulatory structure for the industry and 
are in a virtual stalemate on how to finance the rescue package

townsfolk are tiring of the publicity 
surrounding their community where paula sims claimed a masked 
gunman had abducted her firstborn infant daughter in 1986 
but they hope a charge in a neighboring county that she murdered 
her second daughter who she claimed was abducted this spring under 
similar circumstances finally will answer some questions 
mini gray refused to open her front door to talk to a reporter 
about the case 
im too close to it explained a tearful mrs gray it was to 
her that mrs sims ran on june 17 1986 to report that a masked 
gunman had abducted her 13dayold daughter loralei marie while 
her husband was at work 
i hope they find out the truth mrs gray said through a 
window and if theyre guilty i hope theyre severely punished 
skeletal remains thought to be loraleis were found only 150 
yards from the sims home a few days after the baby disappeared in 
1986 sims and her husband robert moved to alton in neighboring 
madison county not long afterward 
then 3 months ago mrs sims repeated the masked gunman story 
to police investigating the disappearance of 6weekold heather lee 
the babys body was found may 3 in a trash can across the river in 
west alton mo an autopsy found she had been frozen after being 
suffocated 
witnesses have said mrs sims wanted sons and was unhappy with 
daughters the simses 1yearold son randy was taken into state 
custody in may 
mrs sims 30 has been charged with obstructing justice in both 
deaths accused of concealing the homicides and lying to 
investigators 
but murder charges have been brought at least so far only in 
heathers death a grand jury in madison county indicted mrs sims 
last week on two counts of murder charges that could mean the death 
penalty if mrs sims is convicted she was jailed without bail 
robert sims 37 faces no charges but the madison county grand 
jury left open the possibility of bringing charges against him 
mrs sims has pleaded innocent to all charges her attorney 
donald groshong refuses to comment at a hearing friday in the case 
of heathers death he filed motions asking that the trial be moved 
from madison county because of news coverage hes also seeking to 
have police and prosecutors barred from publicly discussing the case 
two months ago townspeople in brighton talked freely of the sims 
case reticent now some wish the story and reporters would go away 
but not before they learn what happened 
even jersey county sheriff frank yocom who swore he would never 
close the file on loralei is quiet these days 
i could say a lot of things but i need to hold my emotions 
together i dont want to hurt the case any he says 
this thing about paula sims its created so much publicity 
after a while you get tired of it says former sims neighbor gene 
trail of alton who reluctantly joined his wife bonnie in talking 
to a reporter 
the trails are relieved someone finally has been charged with 
murder 
and while they are not sure of mrs sims guilt they wonder if 
she is covering up for her husband others have no doubt 
no trial just hang her says robert groves who lives down 
the road from the former sims home in brighton if they give her 
the death penalty ill be satisfied 
some brighton residents like emil watts worry that the 
publicity surrounding the case gives the town a bad name 
id just like to see it come to a conclusion he said i 
think its in the best interest of everybody

obscured perhaps by an unexpected overture from 
moscow and the fireworks from frances 50 million birthday party 
were two promising achievements that emerged from the weekends 
smooth and abbreviated western economic summit 
the democracies freed for the moment from pressing economic 
concerns of their own pledged to address the environmental problems 
that threaten the planet and focused on aiding the faltering 
economies of the communist bloc and the third world 
the seven leaders endorsed a significant strategic switch in the 
way rich countries should wrestle to resolve the third worlds 
staggering 13 trillion debt 
they pledged economic and food assistance to eastern europe and 
gave a distant embrace to the unsolicited call by mikhail gorbachev 
for a greater soviet role in the global economies 
the environmental discussions prompted president bush to describe 
the meetings as a watershed event 
for the first time the administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency william reilly participated symoblizing bushs 
interest in a worldwide campaign to protect the ozone layer save 
forests and combat global warming 
bush said the summit generalities would be backed up by specific 
recommendations when he hosts next years summit in the united 
states 
still the cautious approach taken here raised some questions 
whether the good intentions might go for naught 
skeptical environmental activists may have in mind the conflict 
of rhetoric and action among summit partners on the subject of 
terrorism over the years 
in london in 1984 the summiteers first went on record against 
terrorism it was a strongly worded declaration but a general one 
three years ago in tokyo the campaign led by the united states 
picked up steam and got specific 
the leaders were nudged into shaking off their resistance to 
naming names and branded libya a supporter of terrorism they 
proposed such maximum efforts as an arms embargo against such 
nations as well as improved extradition procedures 
and yet france recently delivered to libya spare parts for 
mirage jet fighters paid for long ago and west german firms 
assisted libya in developing a plant near tripoli to produce 
chemical weapons 
such contradictions notwithstanding one western official 
attending his sixth summit rejected a suggestion that summits 
produce only words this veteran diplomat insisted diplomacy is 
language and you keep jacking up the language gradually and 
progressively 
as it turned out except for what secretary of state james a 
baker iii termed a little debate over an international 
conference on poland and hungary to be held later this summer there 
was no evidence of discord 
that sped the summit to an early conclusion 
baker who has been to nine such sessions called this years 
the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that i 
have attended 
bush at his postsummit news conference sunday said it went 
smoothly he was not sorry to have the summit end early 
acknowledging that after a fourday visit to hungary and poland 
before participating in french bicentennial festivities and the 
summit meetings he was running out of gas 
are these annual summits worthwhile 
most of those who participate are inclined to believe their time 
was wellspent 
taizo watanabe the japanese spokesman stressed the unstructured 
nature of summit meetings as helpful in coordinating policy among 
the seven nations 
this is something we could not find anywhere else he said 
helmut haussmann the west german economics minister was more 
philosophical those who attend summits think they are very 
important as long as they are active participants he said when 
they no longer participate they no longer think they are important

former gov john n dempsey an irish 
immigrant who became one of the states most beloved politicians and 
championed the mentally retarded died at home sunday he was 74 
dempseys son ed dempsey said his father was surrounded by 
family members when he died about 4 am sunday 
dempsey had entered a hospital which bears his name in 
farmington outside hartford on june 16 at the request of his 
family the hospital never released the nature of his illness but 
it was widely reported that he was diagnosed with lung cancer he 
returned friday to his home in northeastern connecticut 
dempsey served as governor from 1961 to 1971 only the second 
person in connecticut history to serve a full decade in office 
throughout his political career which began in the 1940s dempsey 
said he lived by a simple credo youve got to help people i 
love people 
with the passing of john dempsey connecticut has lost one of 
its great public figures and i have lost a great friend gov 
william a oneill said in a statement my association with john 
began more than 25 years ago but my admiration for him began much 
earlier 
dempsey was dubbed manowar by the late state and national 
democratic chairman john m bailey because of his ease at winning 
elections 
dempsey emerged a winner in his first foray into local politics 
when he convinced the putnam town fathers that his street needed a 
street light in the 1940s that little victory prompted townsfolk to 
persuade the young democrat to run for the city council when he was 
21 he later served as mayor for 12 years and also served three 
terms in the state house of representatives 
in 1954 he ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket headed by 
abraham a ribicoff ribicoff won but dempsey lost in separate 
balloting but ribicoff made dempsey his executive aide 
in 1958 he and ribicoff ran together and this time both of them 
won 
dempsey remained mayor of putnam while serving as lieutenant 
governor but left that post when he took over as governor when 
ribicoff headed to washington in 1961 to join the new kennedy 
administration 
he was twice elected to a full fourterms in 1962 and 1966 
i had hoped to give all the people in connecticut the 
opportunity that connecticut gave me dempsey once said i came 
here in short pants as an immigrant at the age of 10 and i saw what 
this country did for me 
born in cahir county tipperary ireland on jan 3 1915 dempsey 
arrived in the united states in 1925 and settled with his parents in 
putnam 
he insisted that his decision not to seek a third term as 
governor in 1970 had nothing to do with the states budget crisis at 
the time a 400 million deficit rather he said he thought it was 
time to open things up to younger democrats and i was going to 
set the example 
besides his son he is survived by his wife mary two other 
sons a daughter and nine grandchildren

the worlds seven richest industrial nations called 
for decisive action to fight global pollution on sunday as they 
completed a harmonious economic summit that will be remembered more 
for bicentennial fireworks than concrete achievements 
there was so little disagreement that the leaders had time to 
discuss an unexpected letter from soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
and still wrap up ahead of time 
president bush labeled his first economic summit a clear 
success 
the closing communique addressed a number of bush initiatives 
including aid to the communist east bloc endorsement of the 
administrations third world debt plan and a call for greater 
efforts to clean up the environment 
it also called for concerted efforts to fight narcotics a 
problem it said had reached devastating proportions 
the leaders of the other summit countries britain france west 
germany japan italy and canada also praised the outcome of the 
three days of meetings which took place amidst the pageantry of the 
200th anniversary of the french revolution 
prime minister margaret thatcher dismissed reports that she was 
slighted by the host french president francois mitterrand because 
of remarks she made disputing the importance of the french 
revolution 
contending that she got along well with mitterrand mrs thatcher 
said i have not had anything that could even remotely be termed a 
slight 
mitterrand who lost in a bid to get agreement for a northsouth 
summit between rich and poor nations said in a final statement that 
the leaders of the summit countries were women and men of good 
will we want to put ourselves at the service of all of humanity 
the summit gave all the leaders not just bush a chance to take 
some victories back to the voters 
japanese prime minister sousuke uno under fire for alleged 
flings with geisha girls and badly in need of a political uplift 
termed the meetings splendid and said they had given him the 
opportunity to explain a 35 billion new aid program for developing 
countries 
during the traditional reading of the final communique bush gave 
west german chancellor helmut kohl a thumbs up signal as the section 
on the environment was read mrs thatcher and canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney nodded approvingly 
a third of the 22page final document addressed environmental 
problems the first time in the 15year history of the summits that 
a noneconomic issue figured so prominently in the joint statement 
decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect 
the earths ecological balance the leaders declared we will 
work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy 
and balanced global economy 
the communique called for concerted action to deal with the 
depletion of the ozone layer global warming loss of forests and 
ocean pollution but it offered few specific proposals on how to 
accomplish these goals 
environmental groups said they were pleased with the high profile 
the summit gave these issues but disappointed that nothing more 
concrete was offered 
the heads of state have failed to propose the decisive actions 
necessary to confront the deteriorating trends said rafe 
pomerance senior associate at the world resources institute a 
washington policy group 
but bush took issue with that view calling the environmental 
language in the summit document a watershed event 
in the document the summit leaders urged an acceleration of 
research into antipollution technologies and said the organization 
for economic cooperation and development made up of the major 
industrial countries should be asked to pursue the development of 
objective measurements of environmental pollution 
bush at an outdoors news conference at the us ambassadors 
residence said the summit leaders were intrigued by gorbachevs 
letter addressed to the summit gathering requesting closer links 
between the western countries economies and that of his country 
we would welcome any movement by the soviet union towards 
marketoriented western economies there is no question about 
that bush said he said gorbachev would receive a very 
courteous and thoughtful reply from mitterrand 
the communique also called for creation of a task force to study 
ways to halt money laundering by drug kingpins 
on economic issues the summit nations endorsed the 
administrations strategy to reduce the 13 trillion debt burden 
being carried by third world nations by offering incentives for 
commercial banks to forgive a portion of the debt the new approach 
was unveiled by treasury secretary nicholas brady on march 10 
while the socalled brady plan was not mentioned by name the 
communique left no doubt that it was endorsing the concept the 
president quipped that if it works we may call it the bush plan 
the united states along with italy and canada came in for some 
mild criticism for their large budget deficits the summit document 
exhorted them to do more to balance their books 
japan and west germany on the other hand were urged to do more 
to boost domestic economic growth as a way of providing a market for 
foreign goods and thus slimming their huge trade surpluses 
the document also had a veiled criticism of us trade policies 
attacking moves to what it called unilateralism efforts by one 
country to go outside recognized international forums for resolving 
trade disputes 
while the united states was not mentioned by name the language 
was an obvious reference to the administrations targeting of japan 
brazil and india for alleged unfair trade practices and threatening 
sanctions against those nations unless they removed trade barriers 
to us goods 
despite the small hints of disagreement the leaders were able to 
agree on the final language of the communique in quick order the 
leaders who began their formal meetings friday dispensed with 
sundays final plenary session the first time any of these annual 
gatherings has ended early 
bush welcomed the break after touring poland and hungary and 
taking in the festivities of the bicentennial of the french 
revolution as well as the summit bush allowed that he was kind of 
running out of gas 
the united states will host next years summit and bush who 
hails from the lone star state said it was a distinct 
possibility that san antonio or some other city in texas would be 
the site for the gathering

leaders of the worlds seven largest democracies 
declaring that the drug problem has reached devastating 
proportions called on sunday for an intensified war on narcotics 
including creation of a financial task force to fight money 
laundering 
the final communique of the seven summit nations reflected the 
widening sense of alarm among the western nations about the menace 
that drugs pose to their societies 
the summit nations the united states france west germany 
britain canada italy and japan urged all countries especially 
those where drug production trading and consumption are large to 
join our efforts to counter drug production to reduce demand and 
to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the 
laundering of its proceeds 
there is a new sense of urgency in our determination to tackle 
this evil british prime minister margaret thatcher told 
reporters it can only be solved by cooperation 
she noted that the summit endorsed britains plan to hold an 
international summit next year on dampening the demand for drugs 
mainly through education 
the new task force will examine the effectiveness of existing 
international efforts aimed at preventing traffickers from using 
banks and other financial institutions to launder the money from 
their drug sales 
the task force will also consider additional preventive efforts 
in this field including new laws and regulations to block money 
laundering 
a summit source said the leaders decided that it probably easier 
to trace drug money than the drugs themselves 
the first meeting of the new task force will be at an unspecified 
date in france and its report is due by the end of next april 
the summit nations indicated they plan to increase support for 
efforts of countries who request help to fight the illicit 
production and trafficking inside their borders 
the communique emphasized a bigger role for the united nations in 
the drug war through an increase in its resources and through 
reinforced effectiveness of its operation 
the communique did not specify what shape the new financial task 
force would take but british sources said earlier that it probably 
would operate under the aegis of the international monetary fund 
the bank of international settlements and the 24nation organization 
for economic cooperation and development

franklin township nj ann flannery hudak doesnt believe in 
wasting anything not even excess skin so far she has shed 150 
pounds and when she loses 110 more pounds she plans to donate her 
excess skin to burn victims 
mrs hudak 41 began a highprotein diet in april when she 
weighed 386 pounds sh has slimmed her 5foot3 frame from a size 52 
to a 40 
im so glad ive finally taken control of my life mrs hudak 
said in a recent interview i was fat the first half of my life 
im going to be thin the second half 
she remains a long way from her goal of 125 pounds but intends 
at that point to undergo skin reduction surgery to remove excess 
skin from her stomach chin legs and arms 
she plans to donate the skin to st agnes burn center in 
philadelphia 
i think its very laudable that people want to donate these 
things said dr fredrick declement director of the burn center 
every little bit helps 
she initially couldnt find a skin bank willing to take her skin 
but persevered when she heard of a similar donation by a chicago 
man who had excess skin removed after he dieted and lost 170 pounds 
id like to see burn victims able to have healthy skin from 
people mrs hudak said 
mrs hudak hopes to donate at least 4 square feet of skin 
doctors use donated skin as a temporary treatment while burn 
patients regenerate their own skin the borrowed skin then sloughs 
off 
its a temporary dressing declement said the ultimate 
cover has to be the patients own skin 
declement said tissue removed from cadavers is typically used as 
temporary skin for burn victims he said it is not costeffective 
for the center which treated more than 600 patients last year to 
accept everybodys donated skin 
a commitment to helping others is nothing new for mrs hudak 
a decade ago the former systems analyst signed a donor card 
pledging to donate her body for scientific research when she dies 
she also donates blood every 56 days i do as much as i can she

here at a glance is what the participants in the 
paris summit had to say about the outcome of the 15th annual 
meeting which ended sunday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush attending his first economic summit said the meetings were 
intensive and productive and in his view a clear success 
i am the new boy the new kid in school but the point i found 
most interesting was the unstructured part he said the part 
where you sit with the world leaders and tell them what you think 
listen to what they think the more emphasis we place on that kind 
of interaction the better it would be 
bush noted with satisfaction that the summit leaders agreed to 
follow the us lead in supporting the reform process in poland and 
hungary democracy and economic growth go hand in hand he said 
he also said the summit marked a watershed on the 
environment and that he was pleased that his colleagues shared 
his sense of urgency in the war against drugs 
bush said it was very interesting that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev wrote to the summit but that it was premature 
to welcome the soviets into the club of economic summitry 
as to why the summit ended early bush said we were kind of 
running out of gas

it was a very friendly and worthwhile summit all the hopes 
that we brought to this summit have been fulfilled mrs thatcher 
said 
all in all an excellent summit with a tremendous willingness to 
work together on the problems of the world economy the environment 
and drugs 
she said she was particularly pleased that the summit endorsed 
britains call for a framework convention on global climate 
change and its call for existing international bodies to be 
strengthened rather than for the creation of new bodies 
mrs thatcher said the leaders were able to come to rapid 
agreement on environmental concerns because they have become much 
more imperative 
there was no question of people being in difficulties at home 
whoever is in charge of politics must deal with the environment 
asked about her treatment by the french in the wake of her 
remarks playing down the importance of the french revolution mrs 
thatcher said i have not had anything that could even remotely be 
termed a slight indeed i have received every attention 
she added there is an excellent relationship between president 
mitterrand and myself

mitterrand the host of the summit was clearly pleased with the 
outcome of the summit which he scheduled to coincide with the 
bicentennial of the french revolution 
to describe the work the climate was excellent the french 
president said 
mitterrand said it was easier for the seven leaders to reach 
agreement than in the past and that there was a great resolution 
to coordinate policies 
he said that in this the 15th year of these sessions the 
leaders had entered a new era and a new turning 
we have come to a different period the precedent summits more 
or less yielded the desired results today we see the achievements 
and also a certain number of menaces 
he said this is a period of consolidation of achievements from 
the past which has allowed the seven to widen their interests to 
things such as the environment or drugs

it was a splendid summit uno said it was my first summit 
and i was able to talk to all leaders gathered here we were able to 
trade views satisfactorily 
uno noted that the final political declaration of the seven 
followed the lines of japans views on the subject by condemning the 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators but avoiding the isolation 
of china 
uno said his biggest contribution to the summit was japans 
decision to expand by 35 billion its program to assist developing 
countries 
he said the leaders were very appreciative of the untied 
aspect of the aid 
the program began in 1987 to distribute 30 billion in three 
years and unos extension brings the total to 65 billion over five 
years

kohl deemed the paris gathering a success because the leaders 
addressed in their final communique a number of environmental issues 
championed by the bonn government 
seldom have i had such intensive discussions about 
environmental protection as in the last days kohl told reporters 
referring to the summits statements on curbing pollution kohl 
said i welcome this as i have attempted during all of the summits 
in which i have participated to bring these important and urgent 
themes into broader discussion 
kohl also applauded the summits moves to consolidate aid to east 
european countries that have embarked on a reform course 
we do not want to interfere in these processes but the nations 
that are for political and social reform and have decided for more 
market economics should know that they can count on our 
solidarity kohl said 
kohl restated his concern about inflationary tendencies in some 
countries all seven summit nations have witnessed varying degrees 
of inflation over the past decade including more than doubling of 
prices in italy 
good economic policy in this situation means to head off 
inflation in good time kohl said

mulroney said canadas goals for the summit have been achieved 
in substantial measure i am particularly gratified that the 
environment was discussed at such considerable length 
he said he was struck by the urgency with which leaders from 
around the world insisted that these environmental matters be 
dealt with 
he said a part of the prescription for the us and canadian 
economies was to reduce their budget deficits in canada we will 
resolutely persevere in our policy to bring the deficit down 
mulroney said that of the five summits he has attended this 
years was the one that achieved the largest degree of consensus 
some leaders interests were more directed toward environmental 
matters than economic ones he said that indicates a major 
change in attitude from the first time i went to a summit when the 
environment wasnt mentioned 
he said he was concerned that the leaders would not have enough 
time to discuss key issues because of the side events of the french 
bicentennial 
but he said it was an extremely productive summit 
wellorganized

de mita viewed the summit a success because of its approach to 
the problem of third world debt which totals some 13 trillion 
the most significant thing in economic terms are the 
conclusions about debt he said 
the problem has been addressed more completely he said we 
have injected a discipline that is not just cosmetic 
as for soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs letter seeking a 
link between his countrys economy and that of the west de mita 
said this marks the first time that the leader of a country that 
contests the economic systems of the seven shows himself has an 
interlocutor not as an opponent 
we have in fact already responded to mr gorbachev in our 
eastwest statement of yesterday he said it was a response in 
favor of a dialogue

here is the text of president bushs news conference 
sunday at the conclusion of the economic summit 
well weve just concluded 2 days of intensive and productive 
meetings with the summit counterparts on economic and political 
issues and let me take this opportunity first of all to thank 
president mitterrand for his most gracious hospitality 
the summit in my view was a clear success we met in a time of 
sustained economic growth and agreed that the prospects are good 
for the continued expansion without inflation of that growth it was 
against this backdrop that we conducted a wideranging discussion on 
critical global issues from eastwest relations to the growing 
environmental challenge that we face 
we came to paris at a truly remarkable moment the winds of 
change are bringing hope to people all around the world and who 
would have thought just a few short years ago that we would be 
witness to a newly elected senate in poland or political pluralism 
in hungary i was really touched by what i saw and heard in those 
two countries people determined to keep their dreams alive people 
determined to see a europe whole and free and thats why america 
brought to this summit our determination to support the reform 
movement in hungary and poland 
people yearning for freedom and democracy deserve our support 
and its because of the community of values shared by these summit 
countries that we were able to agree to meet soon to discuss 
concerted action that will help poland and ngary 
democracy and economic growth go hand in hand whether in eastern 
europe the summit 7 or the developing world and therefore much 
of our discussion here in paris centered on economics we reaffirmed 
our international economic cooperation and our whole policy 
coordination process our strengthened debt strategy was firmly 
supported we reaffirmed our determination to maintain and improve 
the multilateral trading system calling for the completion of the 
uruguay round by the end of 1990 and extending the gatt to new 
areas including agriculture 
this summit marked a watershed in the environment and we agreed 
that decisive action is urgently needed to preserve the earth we 
committed to work together as well as with the developing world to 
meet our responsibility of global stewardship the measures weve 
agreed to in paris are timely and they lay the groundwork for 
further specific steps when we meet again next year in the united 
states 
and finally i was especially pleased to find that my colleagues 
share our sense of urgency and sense of the importance of the 
worldwide fight against drugs among other steps we agreed to 
establish a financial action task force to find new ways to track 
and prevent the laundering of drug money 
i look forward to meeting my summit colleagues in the united 
states next year as we continue working on these and other priority 
issues build on the progress that we made genuine progress that i 
think was made here in paris and i might say that i was very 
pleased that this meeting coincided with the bicentennial here it 
was a very moving experience for all of us now i will be glad to 
take any questions 
q mr gorbachev wants to play a part in the world economic 
discussions would he be welcomed at the next economic summit table 
a well i think thats a little premature but it was very 
interesting i found that a leader of the soviet union would 
address a letter to the french president as head of this years 
summit we talked about that letter a great deal theres an awful 
lot that has to transpire in the soviet union it seems to me 
before anything of that nature would be considered were talking 
about free market economies here and but i hought i found 
fascinating the very fact of the letter but there was no theres 
certainly i dont think any indication that the next that he will 
be attending the next summit hell get a very courteous and very 
thoughtful reply from mr mitterrand 
q how about the poor countries bangladesh would they ever be 
welcome 
a well this is an economic summit of countries whose economies 
are drawn together by the free economies of the west and so i dont 
think theres a question at this point of expanding the summit 
there is concern about the economies in the world that arent doing 
so well bangladesh is a country that does need aid and indeed the 
communique addressed itself to trying to help bangladesh 
q mr president you consulted with the nato allies for military 
matters in brussels and then you had an economic summit here in 
paris whats left before you sit down with mr gorbachev for a 
superpower summit 
a a little more time i think 
q but isnt there anything that you were any dont you have 
anything to discuss with him now that youve gotten all this 
groundwork laid 
a oh sure let me explain to those who arent familiar with the 
policy that secretary baker has met a couple of times with mr 
shevardnadze there will be another such meeting of that nature and 
at an appropriate time i will have a meeting with mr gorbachev but 
i dont think anything at the summit influenced the bilateral that 
bilateral meeting 
q mr president the summit calls for decisive action on the 
environment but various environmental groups are saying that you did 
not take decisive action could you respond to that 
a well i did see some one or two groups they didnt think i 
took decisive action when i sent or took proper action when i 
sent a very farreaching clean air proposal up to the congress and 
so some have been critical many have been supportive on the broad 
the very fact ill tell you where we got a lot of support is the 
very fact that the communique addressed itself with some specificity 
to various environmental oals the whole concept of cooperation on 
research technology and transfer to the ldcs the prevention of 
pollution the idea of setting up monitoring stations so we can 
better predict and thus avoid environmental disaster 
there were there was a lot of common ground in fact i would 
say that on that and perhaps antinarcotics there was most fervor 
and so i think many environmental groups see the very fact that 
this matter was on the front burner as being as being very 
positive and the summit did take make strong enough statements to 
commit all of our members and hopefully others around the world to 
sound environmental practice so i dont you get criticized but i 
think generally speaking its been very very forwardlooking

sudans new military leader has asked the soviet 
union to equip his armed forces with sophisticated weapons a 
newspaper said sunday 
the leader lt gen omar hassan ahmed elbashir was quoted as 
saying he asked the soviet charge daffairs in khartoum to relay 
our request to the soviet leadership for modernizing the sudanese 
armys weaponry 
we also expressed our desire to return our relationship with 
the soviet union to its pre1970 level he told the kuwait daily 
alseyassah 
in that year a promoscow military officer maj hashem atta 
staged an abortive coup against thenpresident gaafar nimeiri the 
attempt caused lasting sudanese hostility toward the soviet union 
we asked moscow to overhaul all soviet projects in sudan and 
build new projects we also have soviet arms and military equipment 
which need maintenance elbashir told the newspapers reporters 
in khartoum 
elbashir toppled premier sadek elmahdis civilian government 
june 30 and formed a 15member military junta to rule the country 
the newspaper quoted elbashir as saying that better relations 
with moscow also would eventually help resolve the rebellion issue 
in the south 
rebels in southern sudan who are supported by ethiopias 
communist government have been fighting since 1983 for greater 
autonomy and for economic and administrative reforms 
elbashir was quoted as saying the new military regime has 
received economic aid from arab countries in the form of fuel flour 
and medicines but that it is looking for military aid as well 
we believe that arab states are interested in enabling sudan to 
have strong armed forces and effective police therefore we expect 
to receive arms from them the newspaper quoted him as saying

q mr president you promised in poland and hungary that you 
would seek concerted action on the part of the countries meeting 
here to help those countries and there seems to have been a pledge 
that there would be concerted consideration of action no dollar 
figure attached and no specified action promised and a meeting 
apparently planned do you feel you got what you wanted sir 
a i think so and youll notice that in both poland and 
hungary i stopped well short of setting dollar figures or 
challenging others to meet dollar figures but on this one let 
there be no doubt there was unanimity that we should address 
ourselves to the problems of poland and hungary and so i was not 
disappointed i didnt go in there with a specific package of with 
dollar figures on it and i think an early meeting to do just that 
is good it calls for food aid to poland thats specific doesnt 
have a figure on it but no i think we got what we sought and 
there was no rancor on that question and no division on the 
question but there was unanimity that we have to move on it 
q can you tell us since you said that you spent a lot of time 
last night talking about mr gorbachevs letter can you tell us a 
little bit about those discussions and can you tell us what your 
view is what is an ppropriate response from the west to such an 
extraordinary request by mr gorbachev to become part of the economy 
of the western democracies 
a we would welcome any movement by the soviet union towards 
marketoriented or western economies there is no question about 
that and theres nothing begrudging about our saying that i 
dont expect mr gorbachev to sit as a member of the at next 
years summit but the discussion was started off by what do you 
think he means by this and a lot of discussion well get the 
experts to analyze it and all of that took place and people 
concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the changing 
world were living in and that i think was the main message 
and then where we go from here his some of that has been 
addressed in the communique because we talked in there about help 
for the third world and some of his letter as you know was on 
that very subject so it was when it came in mr mitterrand read 
it off to the group there and then said well what will we do 
and my suggestion was which he had intended to adopt anyway that 
he as the man to whom the letter was addressed would reply to it 
so thats the way it was 
and the fact that its happening taking place the president of 
the united states can go to eastern europe and witness the very kind 
of change were talking about ill tell you but the most 
almost the most dramatic for me was when mr nemeth the prime 
minister of hungary handed me that piece of barbed wire tearing 
down the iron curtain between hungary and austria now who would 
have thought that possible and this letter just one more 
manifestation of the exciting times were in of change theyre 
moving towards our open system our free system our system of free 
elections and thats the way i would look at the letter in that 
context 
q mr president in connection with next years summit theres 
been some talk among some of your people about possibly having it in 
your home state of texas possibly in san antonio and i wondered 
whether youd like to see that 
a well id have to run that by the dallas morning news and see 
how they felt about it but thats a distinct possibility however 
its too early no decision has been made the fact that jim bakers 
from houston and im from houston and bob mosbachers from texas 
should have nothing to do with where the next summits going to be 
and there has been no decision 
q that wouldnt mean some discrimination against dallas because 
of your roots 
a no none whatsoever you get that down the fall elections 
are up in 1990 
q let me follow on the question about summits these things have 
gotten a lot bigger than they were originally planned to be 
hundreds of your people thousands of us its your first summit 
but youve got to host the next one have you given any thought to 
how you want to do it in terms of style 
president bush no but ill tell you the part and im the new 
boy the new kid in school but the part i found most interesting 
was the unstructured part the part where you sit with these other 
leaders tell them what you think listen carefully to what they 
think and that happens sometimes in the corridors or sometimes 
before a structured seminar sometimes at a meal and i would like 
to think that the more emphasis we placed on that kind of 
interaction the better it would be but there was no discussion by 
the soviet by the summit interlocutors on how to restructure it 
indeed it went smoothly and it i will again say that mr 
mitterrand handled the formal part very well but for me id like 
to see more just plain unstructured interaction between the leaders 
where you dont just have to talk on the agenda items 
q it will be 20 years ago next thursday that man first landed on 
the moon there are some people in your administration that would 
like for you to announce on thursday that were going to go back to 
the moon possibly even to mars can you and dick darman find that 
kind of money in the budget 
a well you put your finger on some of the real problems 
the major problem on setting major goals for space space 
exploration and whether we will be ready by next week andor later 
this week to make any momentous announcements im not sure i have 
not made a decision on what we will say on that historic day 
q with the soviets on it though 
a well that has been suggested but and some as you know 
some discussions have gone on not i dont think recently between 
us on the soviets on this but certainly the concept of 
international is not offensive to me but well have to wait and 
see because no decision were going to go right across and then 
work our way back down here

q mr president fridays economic indicator showed some 
weakening of the us economy apparently some of your summit 
partners expressed some concern about that what assurances did you 
give them and can you give us that were not headed for a recession 
a well you know ironically none did express to me their 
concern about the us economy stalling out we really didnt get into 
that discussion i must say that from time to time it is a matter 
of concern to me and thus ive tried to think through with our 
secretary of the treasury and others the concept of how the interest 
rate structure should be but ive had no indication from home nor 
have we picked up any here that they felt that the us economy was 
going to move towards a recession and thats the thing of course 
that youd want to guard against 
our growth has not been as robust as the growth in some other 
countries but it were still moving and when you have a several 
trillion dollar gross national product you take a small percentage 
of growth and it makes for enormous dollar figures in growth 
q mr president how much change would the soviet union have to 
make before they could earn an invitation to next years economic 
summit if you cant answer that specifically at least could you 
give us some sense of scale 
a well one as you know i welcome the reforms that are taking 
place in the soviet union but i dont this concept of the soviets 
coming to a g7 summit has never been to my knowledge thought much 
about until this letter appeared so theres no standards for 
entrance into he g7 the soviet economy needs a lot of work and i 
say that not to be critical but certainly thats an objective 
judgment the economy is in bad bad shape far worse shape than the 
western economies 
and so i think what we ought to do is to encourage the kinds of 
economic changes in eastern europe and to the degree the soviets 
would not consider that an intervention into their internal affairs 
in the soviet union and that those should be the next steps 
welcome the interest that was shown by this letter this wasnt an 
application for admission to the g7 it was saying lets do 
something in a common way about solving problems around the world 
and so i wouldnt set a standard right now id simply say let 
each of us try to get our economies in order and as soon as that 
happens and as soon as we see the manifestations of freedom break 
out there in terms of demonstrably free elections all over you 
know then we start talking about democratic change and then they 
approach us but i dont think i think its very premature to 
start laying down guidelines from here as to what we need to do on 
that 
q mr president youve talked about a whole and united europe 
and mr gorbachev has talked about a common european home are they 
the same concept or what is the difference is does there the 
difference between the role of the us in those two statements 
a europe whole and free is our concept his common european home 
is fine so long as i said earlier you can move from room to 
room and that means a coming along further on human rights that 
means much more openness it means support him when you see them 
move towards perestroika and glasnost but it means an evolution in 
the soviet union and it means an evolution in eastern europe and 
weve begun to see it 
a europe whole and free does not visualize a europe where you 
still have barbed wire separating some people or you still have 
human rights abuses in one or two of the countries that are 
egregious and so it it is whole and free and the common 
home theme is a good one i mean thats a very good theme and we 
should encourage it but we want to see these countries continue to 
move towards what works and what works is freedom democracy 
market economy things of that nature 
q in the meeting of the g7 is there room or does did you 
sense the countries want us leadership or they want the us to 
be a coequal partner 
a you mean with the soviets no i sense that they that those 
colleagues feel that we have disproportionate responsibility i 
think theres a keen interest in how i will work with the soviets 
theres no question about that i felt that very clearly 
q at the risk of seeming fixated by mr gorbachev when you 
discussed his letter was there a suggestion from anybody that it 
might have been a bit of mischief or an attempt to get some 
publicity out of the western summit 
a i cant say that that never occurred but i dont think that 
after people thought about it rationally that anyone was prepared 
to say that and that alone was what motivated this letter there is 
change taking place and i think for some time people really 
wondered whether i was a little begrudging in recognizing that 
change and encouraging that change but i think now that has been 
laid to rest so when you see something of this nature you take a 
look at it and you assess it and then you but you dont discount 
it in a cynical fashion 
but i think there was the timing this summit has been planned 
for a long time and this letter might have come in earlier on for 
more serious sherpa consideration as every other issue was 
subjected to marvelous work by the sherpas who incidentally did 
a superb job and this one didnt so i i think people would 
excuse a reasonable degree of cynicism but i dont think the 
conclusion was cynical

q mr president going back to the other day in poland an 
elderly man said that when people who talk to you boast about 
change just remember that the communists still have the bayonets 
so my question to you is do you believe that countries like poland 
and hungary are really going to have serious and permanent change 
or is there a line that their leaders and moscow just wont go past 
a well no i think that youve already seen serious change i 
think you see the political situation in hungary for example is 
absolutely amazing compared to the way we used to view view 
hungary and if the soviet union instead of taking their troops out 
of hungary had tried to tighten down i dont expect wed see the 
kind of change in hungary that were seeing today and so id say 
that were a long way from what gorbachev has spelled out as a 
common european home but its moving so lets encourage the 
progress i hink maybe i missed the nuance of your question 
q that there ought to that there is a course thats going to 
lead to a permanent change or again the question is are the 
soviets going to step in and pull the rug out from under it 
a well i would quote mr gorbachevs words back to him on that 
what he told me in new york and what jim baker has heard from 
shevardnadze and what everybody who interacts with the soviets here 
and that is that perestroika is for real you cannot set the clock 
back it is going to go forward and so i would see that as what 
guides now however i have said as long as there are enormous 
imbalances in conventional forces and in certain categories of 
strategic forces the west should keeps its eyes wide open and 
indeed there was some reference to that in this communique here was 
unanimity on the part of the nato allies that we ought to be 
cautious and that we and so to answer your question its not 
its not a done deal and thats i think what was being reflected 
there in poland 
q mr president i wonder as you put all of this together 
what you said about poland and hungary and gorbachev asking to join 
the world economy as a matter of policy do you see the cold war 
over and do you think the west has won it 
a i dont like to use quote cold war unquote that that 
has a connotation of worse days in terms of eastwest relationship 
i think things have move forward so that the connotation that those 
two words conjure up is entirely different now and yet i dont 
want to stand here and seem euphoric that everything is hunkydorey 
between the east and the west on arms or on differences in economy 
or on how we look at regional problems we have some big differences 
still but lets encourage the change and then i can answer your 
question in a few more maybe a few more years more definitively 
 
q mr president the summit 7 leaders are celebrating a 
gathering that was so successful it went 2 days instead of three 
could you not find another half days worth of problems to discuss 
and maybe resolve sir 
a we were kind of running out of gas ill tell you its been a 
vigorous experience in physical fitness for me and i try to stay in 
pretty good shape but this one when you couple the summit with the 
bicentennial and then tack on poland and hungary i wasnt about to 
argue we needed more time and nor was anyone else i think the fact 
that this rather complex agenda was completed in harmony is the fact 
that ought to really carry the spotlight not the fact that we 
finished in advance 
theres going to be plenty of opportunities to discuss a lot more 
problems that exist around the world but we had an agenda we 
addressed it we finished it on time and it was done harmoniously 
so i think thats why it worked out and that is exactly what 
happened we did complete it and we had a lot more opportunity 
because of the bicentennial to have interaction with the other 
eaders more so than at any other summit 
q do you feel sir you accomplished all you could 
a we accomplished what we set out to accomplish 
q mr president the stealth bomber had a couple of setbacks 
this week and senator nunn as i understand it indicated hes not 
going to pay for a plane that just taxis do you have faith in this 
project or are you alarmed by the recent developments 
a well its senator nunn and 250 million other americans that 
pick up the bill for it but hes not going to pay for it i mean 
its a its a decision that the congress is going to have to take 
collectively if senator nunn decides that it isnt a good idea 
its going to be a whale of a fight but i think that legitimate 
questions have been raised about the bomber and secretary cheney 
has addressed them very forcefully giving the administrations 
position 
being gone i dont have quite as sensitive a feel as i would if 
i were back home of the nuances of the battle but we have gone 
forward with our proposal and now its up to the congress to decide 
what theyre going to do and when i saw dick cheney in essence 
saying make up you minds i think he was doing the right thing 
when i saw senator nunn expressing his reservations we have to 
understand hes doing what he is obligated to do as chairman of that 
committee but itll be sorted out i think

q mr president youre giving away money to poland and hungary 
and youre talking about spending more money on the environment and 
there are a lot of needs at home and now youre in a new budget 
cycle is this the time and you promised today to reduce the 
deficit the us budget deficit is this the time to announce that 
its necessary to raise taxes in the united states 
a no 
q but how are you going to do it then how are you going to 
a well weve already got a proposal up on the hill and look at 
it very carefully and our director of the omb has done a very good 
job in sorting out priorities hes worked and our cabinet has 
given him full cooperation and the proposals that i have made can 
be and are included in our budget thinking not just for this year 
but beyond 
but you put your finger on something that does trouble me when i 
come to countries like poland and hungary i wish we did have more 
more funds with which to help others encourage private investment 
and publicprivate partnerships and privatization i wish we had 
much more to do there or if speedily applied to environmental 
concerns or antinarcotics cooperation 
so i dont want to sound like we have it all made at all weve 
had to sort through priorities in a very complicated way but to 
answer your question you have to go up to the question that was 
earlier asked about the economy itself and i do not want to risk 
screeching growth modest though it may be to a halt by raising 
revenues in the way that some have suggested 
q mr president in eastern europe you talked about two big 
concept links one encouraging democracy and moves toward a market 
economy and two that you werent there to try to raise tensions 
with the soviet union or challenge them in any way but my question 
is if what you want is carried out moves to democracy and a market 
economy arent you really talking about the dissolution of the 
soviet empire and is that what you mean when you call for a europe 
that is whole and free 
a the soviet empire if you mean the imposition of a marxist 
system or socialism in their definition system on others yes 
id like to see europe whole and free and but with the soviets 
moving towards market and theyre not there towards more 
freedom towards more openness they themselves have recognized that 
their system doesnt work so you dont run the risks or have the 
same tension that we might have had 10 years ago talking about the 
very same themes i talked about in poland in hungary i went to 
some of you were on this trip went to vienna several years ago 
and gave a speech and a man the speech was on differentiation 
and and i will spare him identification but a hungarian official 
told me that he personally befriended us and we talked carefully 
had gotten a lot of grief over the fact that we had singled out 
hungary as a country that was moving even then even those short 
years ago moving in a way that their changes could be accommodated 
by closer relationships with the west and that conversation i had 
on this trip showed me how clear how dynamic the change so were 
i dont think theres a risk of if were right in our assessment 
that change is going forward i ont think there is this risk 
q is mr mitterrand free to reply to the gorbachev letter 
himself or will it be circulated or would you like to see the 
letter how would you like that to go forward 
a no i think that he should reply to it himself he has a good 
relationship with mr gorbachev gorbachev was here theyve had 
some follow up i believe and the letter was addressed to him 
albeit as president of the summit and so i think that i think 
its fitting that he simply use his good judgment and reply to it in 
any way he wants and thats exactly what he is going to do 
incidentally that was discussed 
q mr president did you well in this summit did you achieve 
all your goals do you have the feeling of being the winner no 1 
of this summit 
a well ive pointed out before we came over here that something 
of this nature ought not to be judged in terms of winners and 
losers your question sounds very much like some that we engage in 
at home whos up whos down whos ahead whos winning whos 
more popular whos ahead in the poll bush or gorbachev in eastern 
europe or connecticut and it doesnt really have much to do with 
that what 
q but are you satisfied if you are very satisfied did you 
meet your goals 
a i am very satisfied i am very satisfied that the summit 
achieved its goals every other summit leader tells me that it was 
the best summit they have attended and i again would salute the 
president of the french republic for the way in which he conducted 
the meetings but yes i am very very satisfied and there arent 
any winners or losers or whos up or whos down 
we got were together is how we approached the east were 
together is how we approached the environmental questions i didnt 
take a question here on third world debt but theres a strong 
endorsement for the brady plan and there was no dissension on that 
approach so it came together very very well mr brady and i 
shouldnt say this i know this is going to get me in real trouble 
but if the brady plan looks like its going to be successful we may 
call it the bush plan 
thank you all very very much

the largest black labor 
federation sunday threatened a week of protests prior to 
parliamentary elections in september and demanded the government 
repeal restrictions on trade union activity 
the congress of south african trade unions completed a fourday 
conference with a call to intensify our campaign of resistance 
aimed at dismantling apartheid and capitalism 
the congress said that unless the government repeals the 
controversial labor relations act by sept 1 member unions will 
take sustained action against parliamentary elections set for 
sept 6 
jay naidoo general secretary of the 921000member congress did 
not say what tactics the group would use similar calls in the past 
have resulted in mass strikes 
whites asians and people of mixed race will vote for the three 
separate houses of parliament in segregated elections under 
apartheid the countrys 28 illion blacks have no voice in national 
affairs 
naidoo said a workers summit would be convened in august to 
develop campaigns against the elections and the labor relations act 
the yearold legislation has strengthened managements ability to 
end strikes through court action and allows companies to sue unions 
for losses incurred during a strike 
naidoo also said the congress banned from political activity 
wants to play a leading role in creating a huge antiapartheid 
coalition 
the congress will seek to arrange a conference no later than 
october naidoo said the conference was suggested by the national 
union of mineworkers which has about 300000 members and is the 
largest affiliate of the congress 
antiapartheid groups have been attempting to form unified 
strategies since the july 5 meeting between president pw botha and 
jailed black nationalist nelson mandela leader of the african 
national congress 
some organizations have called the meeting a positive 
development while others maintain it is merely government 
propaganda 
there has to be a clear signal from the apartheid regime that 
it is interested in genuine negotiations naidoo told a news 
conference this has not happened 
local newspapers have said that naidoo and the president of the 
congress elijah barayi are among several dozen people that mandela 
has requested to see at victor verster prison on tuesday his 71st 
birthday 
naidoo and barayi said they would welcome the opportunity to meet 
mandela but have not received permission from prison officials 
the congress supports the anc the main guerrilla group 
attempting to undermine the whiteled government however the 
organizations disagree on some issues for example the anc says it 
will accept a mixed economy in south africa while the labor 
federation says it is committed to socialism 
the meeting attended by almost 2000 delegates reaffirmed its 
support for comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against south 
africa it also called for foreign companies operating in south 
africa to divest and turn over their property and equipment to the 
local community

folks in the neighborhood call dan levin the 
signlanguage policeman and he may be the only one in the nation 
his interest in communicating with the deaf has helped levin nab 
suspects and even a wife a deaf woman he met while investigating 
house vandalism 
i never caught the offender he says i just caught the 
victim 
that meeting 12 years ago launched levins career as a 
signlanguage police officer working with deaf victims and 
defendants in a city with an estimated 26000 deaf people 
dan is invaluable said diana thorpe president of the 
illinois registry of interpreters for the deaf can i underline 
that fourteen zillion times anything from a parking ticket to 
murder all you have to say is go see dan levin 
representatives of deaf organizations in chicago new york los 
angeles and washington dc say they know of no other certified 
sign interpreter in the country who also works as a police officer 
like many police officers levin once worked a beat car but he 
now works out of police headquarters where he uses a specially 
equipped telephone with a typewriter keyboard to take calls from 
deaf crime victims 
his abilities helped solve the murder of deaf woman linda 
sanborn whose body was found in her apartment her special 
telephone for the deaf a video game and household items were 
missing 
investigators later learned that four deaf people had discussed 
the womans death days before her body was found in november 1987 
officers called in levin to interpret for a deaf witness who 
could remember only the first name danny of one of those who 
discussed the womans death 
levin had had contact several times with a danny lord and two of 
the incidents involved burglaries police found lord who later 
confessed to the killing 
because levin was able to advise lord of his rights in sign 
lords attorney was unable to attack the confession in later in 
court lord could get the death penalty when he is sentenced 
wednesday 
i thought id be able to attack the credibility of the 
interpreter said assistant public defender james mullenix but 
after talking to two certified court interpreters and a private guy 
they all said the same thing dan levin is an excellent 
interpreter it was unfortunate for us 
by night levin has interpreted a class for a hearingimpaired 
medical student related the bedside chats of doctors to deaf 
patients served as courtroom interpreter for deaf witnesses and 
translated therapy sessions for adolescent psychiatric patients 
the extra money is helpful levin and his wife have two children 
ages 2 and 4 the children are not deaf but they are learning sign 
i feel i have the best of both worlds he said its very 
broadening to me individually its rewarding i feel im lucky to 
be in this position sometimes i can hardly believe it myself 
it all began in 1977 when levin volunteered to help a deaf woman 
whose home was being pelted repeatedly by rocks 
levin had remembered some fingerspelling from his boyhood when 
he watched his best friend converse in sign language with his deaf 
parents so he agreed to put the home of janice roberts on special 
patrol 
on his second visit to the house he asked ms roberts for a book 
on sign language 
after a couple of months i thought i learned enough sign 
language to aske her out levin said about three years later 
they were married 
i was intrigued levin said she seemed to have a nice 
quality about her i dont know how else to describe it something

iran has no intention of exporting its 
fundamentalist revolution parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani was 
quoted sunday as saying 
we do not want to strain relations with the countries which 
would like to have healthy ties with us rafsanjani said in an 
interview with the jomhuri islami daily 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said 
rafsanjani told the newspaper iran will continue to promote islam 
but this doesnt mean interference in the affairs of others 
rafsanjanis remarks indicated iran is eager to allay fears it is 
committed to establishing islamic regimes in other moslem nations 
both saudi arabia and kuwait have distanced themselves from iran 
on grounds that islamic extremists were seeking to undermine their 
prowestern governments 
rafsanjani considered a moderate in comparison to irans 
hardliners is the overwhelming favorite in a presidential election 
to be held july 28 
he is a close political ally of president ayatollah ali khamenei 
another reputed pragmatist who was elected irans spiritual leader 
after the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on june 3 
rafsanjani reiterated earlier statements that iran would steer a 
political course that was neither east nor west 
rafsanjani said iran was committed to making peace with iraq 
after the gulf war halted by a united nationsmediated ceasefire 
last aug 20 but had set no date for resuming peace talks because 
the talks are still immature 
the negotations are stalled over various issues 
rafsanjani also admitted that iran is in critical need of 
technical experts and managers to develop the economy thousands of 
skilled iranians left the country and educational standards declined 
during the years of revolutionary fervor and the eightyear war with 
iraq 
we particularly suffer from an acute shortage of researchers 
he said 
he noted that industries were running at 30 percent to 40 percent 
of capacity because of severe shortages of materials energy or 
parts 
rafsanjani said he plans to focus the countrys economic future 
on developing its vast natural gas reserves as the best and 
richest sources of energy 
building up gas as a major export and energy source will involve 
major foreign assistance 
rafsanjanis moves to end irans isolation suffered a setback in 
february when khomeini sentenced british author salman rushdie to 
death for his novel the satanic verses some said the book 
insulted islam the death order led to a break in relations between 
iran and britain

a man identified by police as a viable suspect 
in the green river serial murder case says in a statement from jail 
that authorities made me out to be a very bad person and i am 
not 
the green river killings apparently ended in 1984 but public 
attention was focused on the case last week with the release of an 
affidavit used to obtain a search warrant in the case 
william jay stevens ii is a colorful character but hes no 
murderer his lawyer said after authorities labeled stevens a 
suspect in the nations worst serial slaying case and seized his 
travel receipts 1800 videotapes and police paraphernalia 
the killer named for the stream south of seattle where the first 
victims were found has been blamed by police for the deaths of 40 
young women and the disappearances of eight others many of them 
prostitutes from 1982 to 1984 
stevens 38 jailed in seattle on other offenses since january 
has not been charged in any of the deaths and disappearances 
but the affidavit signed by al mathews a king county deputy 
prosecutor described the former gonzaga university law student as 
a viable suspect in the green river homicides and possibly 17 
others in the pacific northwest 
stevens lawyer craig beles accused the task force of 
grasping at straws and said his client is concerned hes being 
singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation 
in a statement issued by beles late saturday stevens denied any 
connection to the case 
i am not the green river killer the green river task force has 
not treated me or my family fairly the statement said they 
have made me out to be a very bad person and i am not people 
should know the fact that i have never hurt anyone in my life 
i will discuss this matter in an orderly and honorable fashion 
in a court of law 
when asked if stevens was considering legal action against king 
county beles told the seattle times i think he is contemplating 
that 
beles said his client is a character and hes got friends and 
hes got enemies 
king county police capt robert c evans commander of the green 
river task force said it would take a month to examine the material 
taken under search warrant last week from two spokane homes used by 
stevens the 55 bags and boxes seized did not however include any 
clothing jewelry or other effects from green river victims evans 
said 
stevens is jailed in seattle serving a oneyear term for a 1979 
burglary and additional time for walking away from a workrelease 
center in 1981 he was rearrested in january on the old charges 
after a telephone tip was received when a television program on the 
green river case was broadcast 
stevens who served two years as president of the student bar 
association at gonzaga university in spokane was described in the 
affidavit as a former army military police officer and unsuccessful 
police job applicant 
police seized seattle and portland ore police uniforms law 
enforcement badges and 1800 videotapes of thusfar undisclosed 
subjects investigators had long suggested the killer might have 
been someone posing as a police officer 
in the lengthy affidavit friends of stevens are quoted as saying 
he believed prostitutes were spreading aids wanted to make films of 
hookers being dismembered and told others the killing of green river 
victims had been filmed

peace talks aimed at ending the 14year 
civil war in angola resumed sunday with negotiators seeking a way to 
stabilize a ceasefire between the marxist government and 
usbacked rebels 
foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem led the angolan 
delegation which pulled out of the talks two weeks ago claiming 
guerrilla leader jonas savimbis forces were violating the 
ceasefire the guerrillas also have accused the government of truce 
violations 
savimbi leader of the national union for the total independence 
of angola arrived in the zairean capital sunday morning for a 
meeting with president mobutu sese seko said zairean government 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
savimbi has excluded himself from direct participation in the 
peace negotiations 
savimbi and angolan president jose eduardo dos santos agreed to 
the ceasefire and negotiations june 22 at a meeting in mobutus 
ancestral village of gbadolite 
under the agreement sealed with a handshake by savimbi and dos 
santos the ceasefire was to begin june 24 and a commission was to 
be established to discuss peace terms 
since the direct talks broke down however both sides have 
disagreed over exactly what they agreed to at gbadolite 
the government insists on zambian president kenneth kaundas 
version that savimbi agreed to leave angola during a transitional 
period leading to national reconciliation guerrilla officials in 
lisbon portugal denied that savimbi made any such pledge and 
called proposals for the rebel leaders exile an insult 
the guerrillas have been fighting to share control with the 
government since the marxists took power and declared a oneparty 
state shortly after the countrys independence from portugal in 1975 
under the terms of usmediated peace accords signed in december 
by angola south africa and cuba south africa pledged to halt aid 
to the guerrillas and grant independence to angolas southern 
neighbor namibia 
in return about 50000 cuban troops supporting the angolan

from margaret thatcher to francois mitterrand it 
was the best of times it was the worst of times 
or at least thats the opening of the celebrated book charles 
dickens a tale of two cities that the british prime minister 
left as a farewell present for her french host as she departed the 
economic summit sunday 
thatcher who ruffled her hosts with derogatory comments about 
the french revolution when she arrived for the paris summit gave 
mitterrand a copy of the novel that contrasts revolutionary paris in 
1789 with the tranquility of london 
mrs thatcher insisted before returning to london that her 
relationship with mitterrand was excellent 
but she stuck to her view that the french revolution which 
sparked a reign of terror was not the origin of the concept of 
human rights 
i cant change history neither can you she said at a press 
conference 
she dded that perhaps the original concept belonged to neither 
britains magna carta of 1215 nor the french revolution 
i pointed out that the first one was the ten commandments and 
the sermon the mount she said

a playful president bush said sunday there was a 
distinct possibility that he might choose his adopted state of 
texas as site of next years economic summit 
no decision has yet been made said bush adding the fact that 
secretary of state jim bakers from houston and im from houston 
and secretary of commerce bob mosbachers from texas should have 
nothing to do with where the next summits going to be 
the question was raised by a reporter for the dallas morning news 
at bushs news conference following completion of the 15th annual 
economic summit of the worlds seven largest industrialized 
democracies 
asked if he might bring the world leaders to texas possibly to 
san antonio the president remarked thats a distinct 
possibility however its too early no decision has been made 
in 1983 during the united states last turn to host the event 
former president ronald reagan chose colonial williamsburg va as 
the site of the meetings which annually draw thousands of 
reporters diplomats and financial leaders from around the world 
meanwhile back in the lone star state texas officials said it 
sounds good to them 
i think thats a great idea said state house speaker gib 
lewis who recommended his hometown of forth worth as a super 
city for a summit 
mike toomey chief of staff to gov bill clements said texas 
would love to host such a summit 
the hospitality of texans is universally and internationally 
known we certainly could take care of everybody who joins the 
summit toomey said 
although born and raised in new england bush moved to texas as a 
young man after world war ii and college to enter the oil business 
he still maintains houston as his voting residence although he 
stays in a hotel room when he visits the only home bush owns is his 
oceanfront retreat in kennebunkport maine

an american rabbi and four students 
wearing concentration camp uniforms protested sunday on the grounds 
of a roman catholic convent near the auschwitz death camp and 
demanded that the nuns leave 
it was the second such protest by the group in three days on 
friday convent workers dragged the demonstrators off the grounds 
jews have a right to walk anywhere in auschwitz shouted 
rabbi avraham weiss of the hebrew institute of new york get out 
of auschwitz the blood of our brothers and sisters cries out for 
justice 
the fourhour protest ended peacefully when the group climbed 
back over the 7foothigh fence they had scaled to enter the 
grounds about 50 poles looking on clapped and cheered 
when we return it will be in the tens hundreds thousands we 
want christianjewish dialogue but it cant be fostered as long as 
the convent is here weiss said 
earlier sunday the men delivered a protest letter to the 
residence of cardinal franciszek macharski in nearby krakow they 
also protested peacefully outside a krakow church donning prayer 
shawls and singing in hebrew as mass was conducted inside 
under an agreement signed by 18 international catholic and jewish 
leaders macharski was to have moved the nuns from their living 
quarters a former nazi warehouse a few feet from the barbed wire 
fence of auschwitz an estimated 4 million people including 25 
million jews died at the concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 
but a feb 22 deadline for moving the convent passed and jewish 
leaders have continued to protest the convent saying it is deeply 
offensive to them 
on friday weiss and six students spent five hours on the convent 
grounds before workers dragged them out 
weiss said his group planned to go to warsaw to deliver a letter 
to polish primate jozef glemp he also said they would march on 
parliament on monday and return to the convent with more supporters 
this weekend 
several dozen jewish tourists from canada joined the protest from 
outside the gates sunday singing in hebrew with the men on the 
convent veranda 
the holocaust is uniquely jewish said one who identified 
himself only as rabbi zeitz we consider the convent on this 
ground as an abomination a desecration 
five people who had been let into the convent by the nuns shortly 
before the protest began could be seen laughing from a secondfloor 
window 
a police car passed by and plainclothes police watched from 
across the street an earlier smaller gathering of about a dozen 
poles also stood by among them an elderly woman who yelled juden 
raus or jews get out in german

the convent 
poland is a predominantly roman catholic country

fence and guard towers of the death camp the convent lawn with a 
23foot wooden cross in the middle is a former gravel pit where 
prisoners were gunned down by nazi executioners in 1940 and 1941 
reports in the staterun polish press have made no mention of the 
protesters being dragged out friday 
the government newspaper rzeczpospolita described the protest as 
denominational fanaticism said the nuns were terrified and 
implied they were trapped inside 
macharski reportedly was on vacation telephone calls to his 
residence and office were not answered 
the protesters unfurled american and israeli flags on the convent 
veranda and put on concentration camp shirts with the yellow stars 
that jews were forced to wear while targets of hitlers final 
solution 
we have returned to this place just 48 hours after being beaten 
as a statement that the jews will never bow to the church auschwitz 
is ours weiss said 
he knocked on the convent door but no one came out

japan made a fervant pitch to escape being cast as 
the villain of the environment sunday as it joined the worlds seven 
richest nations in urging action to save the threatened earth 
leaders ending a threeday summit called for stronger steps to 
save rainforests the atmosphere and the seas lakes and rivers 
saying species were endangered and societies threatened by damage 
the environment must win a higher place on the agenda of economic 
decisionmakers they said at the conclusion of the first summit 
that gave such priority to environmental issues 
defending japan spokesman taizo watanabe angrily attacked 
criticism of his countrys record on the environment telling 
reporters that japan was not guiltless but was trying to change 
while credited with cleaning up its own pollution japan has been 
viewed as a black sheep among nations environmentally for its 
reluctance to give up whale hunting and its prodigious use of 
tropical rainforest products and chlorofluorocarbons that destroy 
the earths protective ozone layer 
recently however japan has begun making changes including 
sharp increases in spending to protect the environment 
the fact that japanese officials devoted a news conference solely 
to environmental issues spoke of the countrys new emphasis 
another sign was the 225 billion in environmentalrelated aid 
to developing nations that japanese prime minister sousuke uno 
unveiled before the meeting 
i resent very much this kind of perception that japan must be 
the villain in destroying the precious environment watanabe said 
japan is behind no nation in its concern for the environment 
watanabe acknowledged that japan is the largest importer of wood 
from the threatened rainforests but said that is something we 
would like to cope with by extending cooperation with the 
international tropical timber organization which is concerned with 
preserving forests and planting new trees 
in their final statement the seven summit nations targeted the 
depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer global warming 
deforestation and acid rain 
decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect 
the earths ecological balance they said pledging to work 
together to preserve the environment 
environmental considerations must be taken into account in 
economic decisionmaking said the statement urging the world 
bank and development banks to integrate environmental 
considerations into their activities 
the summit nations called for 
more scientific research on environmental issues and improved 
technology to reduce pollution 
development of substitutes for chloroflurocarbons and joint 
efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions 
promotion of energy efficiency and tougher safety standards for 
nuclear power plants

israel said sunday it will allow nearly half the 
1200 schools closed for most of the 19month palestinian uprising 
to reopen this week but hinted they would be closed again if 
students join protests 
prime minister yitzhak shamir failed in an effort to hold a 
cabinet vote that he had hoped would bolster the credibility of his 
peace initiative 
in the occupied gaza strip palestinian assailants beat and 
stabbed to death an arab man apparently for collaborating with 
israeli authorities arab reports said 
his death raised to 565 the number of palestinians killed in the 
uprising against israeli occupation of the gaza strip and the west 
bank most died of army gunfire but at least 70 were killed by 
palestinians who suspected them of cooperating with israel in 
addition 36 israelis have been killed 
in the occupied territories four arabs were wounded by army 
gunfire sunday arab hospital officials said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said elementary schools and 
12thgrade classes in the gaza strip and west bank will be allowed 
to reopen saturday 
twelfthgrade was included to help high school students graduate 
grades seven to 11 are to reopen in coming weeks colleges remain 
closed 
israel radio said however that security officials were worried 
that activists of the fundamentalist group hamas may force children 
to boycott classes 
israeli officials said they closed schools because they consider 
them hotbeds of nationalist violence 
israel radio said authorities were under strong pressure from the 
united states and european countries to reopen them the un relief 
and works association said west bank schools have been open only 40 
days in the current academic year 
we hope these schools stay open so that palestinian 
children do not suffer any further harm from the suspension of the 
learning process the agencys commissionergeneral giorgio 
giacomelli said in a statement issued earlier this week from his 
headquarters in vienna 
brig gen shaike erez head of the west banks military 
administration told palestinian students not to demonstrate when 
the schools open remove studies from the cycle of violence and 
take every opportunity to learn he said 
we will not agree in any way to violence we will not agree in 
any way to anything but studies erez said speaking on israel 
televisions arabic language news service this is a onetime 
opportunity 
he met sunday with principals of west bank schools and urged them 
to warn students not to hold political demonstrations in or near 
schools 
erez said almost half the west banks 220000 students will begin 
studies saturday 
its our right to have an education said mustafa natche 
former mayor of the west bank town of hebron it was a violation 
of our human rights to close the schools so we are happy they are 
to reopen 
at israels weekly cabinet meeting shimon peres leader of the 
leftofcenter labor party and vice prime minister blocked efforts 
to end a crisis that began earlier this month when shamirs 
rightwing likud block set conditions for a government peace plan 
shamir tried to call a cabinet vote to stipulate that the partys 
conditions did not change the initial peace plan but peres and 
other labor party members blocked the vote and the meeting ended 
with no decision 
peres wants a clear statement from the government that the likud 
conditions are not part of the plan but he said a compromise may 
still be reached that would cancel his partys threat to pull out of 
the coalition and topple the government 
shamirs plan calls for palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip to elect representatives to negotiate peace with israel 
likuds hardline conditions say however that the uprising must 
end before any elections are held and israeliannexed arab east 
jerusalem will be excluded from voting 
in comments sunday on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
secretary of state james a baker said the bush administration 
believes the shamir plan stands as originally announced despite 
shamirs separate agreement with his partys hardliners 
we are now convinced by having talked to representatives of 
the israeli government that they are fully supportive of their 
original elections proposal and initiative as they originally 
announced it and we are going to continue to work very hard to 
make it happen baker said 
in jerusalem the directorgeneral of the prime ministry yossi 
ben aharon said the united states must decide between its support 
for the peace initiative and the dialogue it began with the plo last 
december 
the two are mutually incompatible ben aharon told the 
associated press 
in another development the haaretz newspaper said the army plans 
to build new prison camps and enlarge existing ones to house 
palestinians detained arrested or convicted of nationalist crimes 
such as belonging to the palestine liberation organization or 
attacking israelis 
haaretz said the army plans to have camps to house up to 20000 
prisoners by 1990 
a military spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity would 
not confirm the report but said the army now houses 8633 
palestinian prisoners

the rev george stallings jr on sunday 
rejected a unity appeal by black roman catholic bishops and went 
ahead with services for what he says is a brand of catholicism that 
better serves blacks 
stallings who is black held a pair of celebrations for his 
imani temple and about 2500 persons attended imani is swahili for 
faith 
after the first such services on july 2 stallings was suspended 
by the roman catholic archdiocese of washington that means that 
stallings is not sanctioned by the church to say mass in either 
public or private and no longer has church authority to perform 
sacraments 
stallings accuses the church of being racist and of failing its 
black parishioners he wants to form an africanamerican catholic 
rite which he says would still be part of the catholic church 
last week 13 black bishops asked stallings to abandon his 
movement in a statement they said we sincerely hope stallings 
followers are not commingling personal disappointment individually 
felt frustrations and personal anger under the banner of racism 
racism is a sin which the church must address it is too serious an 
issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns 
but stallings rejected that appeal telling his audience i 
dont have anything against white folks but one thing about white 
folks is they stick together you wouldnt have 13 of them coming 
out and writing a letter 
stallings said he is following gods direction and god didnt 
tell me what bishop i should be listening to 
the clapping congregation joined stallings as he chanted 
enough is enough is enough

jacques marsal who discovered the famed 
prehistoric paintings of the lascaux cave with three young friends 
in 1940 and became the caves guardian for life has died he was 63 
marsal died saturday in a bordeaux hospital after a long illness 
his family said the cause of death was not disclosed 
on sept 12 1940 the 14yearold marsal was playing in an oak 
forest outside the village of lascaux along with a neighbor and two 
12yearold parisians who had fled to the region 300 miles south of 
paris at the outbreak of world war ii 
their dog disappeared into a hole and began barking furiously 
and the boys attached marsals neighbor to a rope and lowered him 
down when they lifted him out he was filthy and shaken and 
claimed to have seen ghosts 
the other boys were skeptical and they returned the next day to 
explore they found a vast cave whose walls were decorated with 
colorful paintings of leaping stags buffalo and prehistoric horses 
archaeologists determined the paintings dated from about 14000 
bc the artwork drew visitors from around the world until 1963 
when it was determined that carbon dioxide in their breath was 
harming the paintings 
marsal was a guide at the cave when it was open to the public 
and he became its guardian after it closed he lived at the site and 
escorted chiefs of state and other distinguished visitors on special 
tours 
a replica of the cave built nearby opened in 1983 
funeral services were planned for monday in nearby montignac the 
family did not release details of survivors

supply of arms to resistance fighters in afghanistan as a response 
to an increase in soviet military shipments to the kabul government 
the washington post reported sunday 
the new weapons will give the guerrillas the ability to destroy 
government airfields and aircraft the newspaper said quoting 
unnamed administration officials

shipments following the final withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan on feb 15 the post said 
fifteen months ago both superpowers agreed to end outside 
interference in afghanistan 
since the soviet withdrawal the soviets are sending 200 million 
to 300 million worth of arms monthly to kabul the post quoted us 
officials as saying 
some sovietafghan aerial tactics have changed and now involve 
the use of highflying planes to attack rebel positions the higher

the states attempt to collect sales tax on 
drinks sold on aircraft flying over the state is more than one 
airline wants to swallow 
northwest airlines which merged with republic airlines in 1986 
is fighting an assessment against republic for drink taxes between 
1981 and 1984 
in a case in dane county circuit court the wisconsin revenue 
department contends that airlines must pay the states 5 percent 
sale tax on items sold aboard planes flying over the state or the 
western half of lake michigan wisconsins boundary extends to the 
middle of the lake the state argues 
at stake is the states claim that northwest owes almost 69000 
in sales and use taxes on liquor soda and peanuts sold or given 
away on flights that passed over but did not land in wisconsin 
the figure was computed by applying the percentage of the 
airlines passenger miles in wisconsin to its systemwide liquor 
sales in addition the state is claiming more than 21000 in 
interest 
northwest is not contesting the states right to tax airborne 
liquor sales on planes that land in wisconsin but is contesting 
wisconsins assessment of the tax on flights that merely pass over 
wisconsin said attorney frederic j brouner who is representing 
northwest 
if wisconsin wins the state presumably could impose the tax on 
sales aboard transcontinental flights of airlines that didnt even 
serve wisconsin said james l greenwald a revenue department 
lawyer 
the wisconsin case may be the first in the nation testing a 
states attempt to tax liquor sales in the air said brouner 
weve looked pretty carefully and this is the only case of its 
type were aware of in the united states brouner said 
a spokesman for the air transport association the national trade 
organization of major airlines agreed 
state taxation of sales on overflights is not a widespread 
phenomenon i can tell you that said an official in the 
associations washington office who asked not to be identified 
the state won a preliminary victory earlier this year when the 
wisconsin tax appeals commission upheld the highflying tax 
northwest appealed the decision in circuit court 
however the commission denied the states claim to a 5 percent 
use tax on peanuts given away to passengers peanuts are food and 
thus are exempt from the tax the commission ruled the revenue 
department is appealing that part of the decision

september 1961 federal officials said its selection over 20 other 
cities rested on such factors as availability of scientists at local 
and state universities houstons industrial base and skilled work 
force and an ideal site on 1023 acres donated by rice university 
but local and state officials acknowledged the key factor was the 
political clout of former us rep albert thomas backed by vice 
president lyndon johnson both texans 
sociologist stephen klineberg of rice university said the space 
program gives houston a sense of the future and puts it at the 
center of the breakout into space the great human adventure of the 
21st century 
being at the forefront of space technology provides one key to 
houstons emergence at the end of the old era of an oilbased 
economy and easy economic growth into the global economy of the 
information age klineberg said 
walt cunningham an apollo astronaut describes the effect of the 
moon landing if the whole world sees it as an accomplishment for 
mankind if americans see it as a national accomplishment think how 
focused it becomes down here where its in our back yard 
economist robert hodgin of the university of houstonclear lake 
an expert on the space stations impact on the houston areas 
economy says benefits have gone well beyond identity and pride 
for the past three years he said the johnson space center has 
annually generated 850 million to 950 million in business 
expenditures in the area including the space center the 65 local 
aerospace contractors and ancillary businesses 
the space program is producing about 27400 jobs in the houston 
area hodgin said including about 3400 jobs at the space center

despite angry protests by black and 
innercity leaders the city council voted to restore a public cable 
channel that will allow the ku klux klan to broadcast on the channel 
the council had eliminated the channel in june 1988 as a way of 
keeping the klan off the public access channel of american 
cablevision they backed down in light of a first amendment lawsuit 
filed against the city by the american civil liberties union 
the council voted 73 in favor of the measure thursday night 
three members were absent before the vote the citys lawyers said 
they thought the city would lose the case which was scheduled to go 
to trial in september 
if there is a victory today it is a victory for the first 
amendment said dick kurtenbach executive director of the aclu of 
kansas and western missouri 
the aclu lawsuit filed in us district court asked that the 
public access channel be reestablished so that the klan could 
broadcast a white supremacist program called klansas city 
local governments typically require cable companies to have 
public access channels before before granting them operating 
licenses 
for nearly half an hour during the meeting more than a dozen 
innercity leaders and residents filled the council chambers with 
civil rights songs interrupting the proceedings 
the rev mac charles jones told the council that allowing the 
klan on cable television would represent a grave setback for race 
relations in kansas city 
whatever trust has been built up will have been lost jones 
said dont betray us as people as a community as a city

government officials said a soviet nuclear 
submarine apparently caught fire off norways coast sunday and was 
under tow but soviet authorities reportedly said the incident was 
just an exercise 
a norwegian research vessel reported that smoke was coming from 
the subs observation tower about 5 pm and that a soviet tugboat 
had been dispatched to help the vessel said a norwegian defense 
ministry spokesman erik senstad 
other soviet naval vessels were in the area in international 
waters 75 miles off norways coast and the submarine did not appear 
to be in serious danger the norwegian supreme command said 
the command did not say whether it believed any sailors had been 
injured 
the norwegian state television station nrk showed the submarine 
sailing under its own power and reported no outward signs of an 
accident 
soviet rescue officials said the submarine was only engaged in an 
exercise and that the ship had never been in trouble according to 
nrk 
however norwegian foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg said at 
a news conference we have heard nothing official to indicate that 
this was an exercise and exercise or not it would have made sense 
to warn us 
the soviet foreign ministry responded to a norwegian request for 
information by saying there had been no problems on sunday aboard 
any soviet submarines off norway said foreign ministry spokesman 
oeyind nordsletten 
it was the third time in less than four months that a soviet 
nuclearpowered submarine has been involved in an incident off 
norways coast 
norwegian authorities said that as in the previous cases the 
soviets did not alert them sunday 
norwegian officials said nothing about whether they believed the 
submarines nuclear reactors were damaged or whether the ship 
carried nuclear weapons 
the submarine was identified as an alfaclass submarine which is 
powered by two nuclear reactors and capable of carrying 
nucleartipped torpedoes and antisubmarine missiles 
a foreign ministry spokesman said the soviet embassy was 
contacted to find out if there was any danger of radiation 
the ship was spotted in the barents sea about 75 miles east of 
the norwegian town of vardoe and north of the kola peninsula the 
ship was in international waters 30 miles north of soviet 
territorial waters 
senstad said it was regrettable the soviets had not issued a 
warning to norwegian authorities i hope this is the last time 
something like this happens without us being warned he said in a 
television interview 
the norwegian government said last week it was drafting a treaty 
that would require the soviet union to inform norway of military 
accidents the soviets have similar agreements with the united 
states britain west germany and france 
stoltenberg summoned the soviet ambassador for a meeting late 
sunday the national ntb news agency reported 
on june 26 a fire broke out aboard a soviet echo ii class vessel 
that was sailing 70 miles off norways coast in the norwegian sea 
norwegian scientists later said small amounts of radiation leaked 
from the sub and that its reactor may have come close to a meltdown 
the soviet news agency tass first said four sailors from that sub 
were hospitalized and were being examined for possible radiation 
poisoning but the news agency later said the four were healthy 
and have no excess radiation 
another accident involving a soviet sub occurred april 7 when a 
mike class nuclear sub sank in the norwegian sea killing 42 soviet 
sailors 
the accidents led to criticism within the soviet union about the 
condition of the nations submarine fleet and the training of its 
officers 
ilya b kolton a 30year veteran aboard soviet subs blamed the 
april and june accidents on construction deficiencies imperfect 
crew rescue equipment plus the startling slowness and inertia of 
the naval agencies in introducing new ideas his remarks appeared 
in the communist party youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
the supreme command said the ship involved sunday was an 
alfaclass sub which has two reactors cooled by liquid metal 
five such ships are known to be assigned to the northern fleet 
they usually are armed with torpedoes and antisubmarine missiles of 
the type ssn15 the command said 
both types of weapons can carry nuclear warheads in the west 
this 2900ton type of sub is considered to be very fast and can 
move at great depths it is assumed that the hull is made of 
titanium the command said

musicians and fans around the world 
mourned the death sunday of conductor herbert von karajan and even 
a critic who denounced the maestros membership in the nazi party 
had some kind words 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky said the music world had lost 
one of its very greatest 
american singer jessye norman in paris for bicentennial 
celebrations said in a statement herbert von karajan always 
rolled out a magic carpet for us the singers it was enough for us 
to take our place and with him our musical work took on another 
dimension 
in west berlin where karajan led the berlin philharmonic for 34 
years mayor walter momper said his death sunday left behind 
sadness and the wish to be able hear him make music again 
he said the celebrated conductor had been berlins musical 
ambassador around the world 
greek virtuoso pianist dimitris sgouros said i express my 
sincere sorrow for the loss of one of the greatest maestros and 
musical geniuses of our century 
we first worked together on brahms second concerto in 1982 and 
cooperated almost annually since in concert and on records he was 
indeed a great maestro 
american conductor erich leinsdorf referring to karajans career 
conducting the berlin philharmonic and his departure in april said 
im very very sorry i think he must have died from the 
frustration of his recent experiences he died a psychological 
death 
karajan died three months after leaving the berlin philharmonic 
amid differences over his contract 
he cited health reasons when he resigned karajan had long been 
ill and serious back pain made it difficult for him to walk unaided 
to the podium 
leinsdorf who first met karajan in 1930 when he took a class 
taught by the conductor in salzburg austria recalled karajan as a 
man who was very proud of his years with the berlin orchestra 
horst koepke a music writer for the frankfurter rundschau 
newspaper in frankfurt praised karajan for his ability to prepare 
an orchestral work so that it pleases not just a small circle of 
knowledgeable people 
but koepke often a critic of the conductor pointed to what he 
said was a darker side of karajan 
he suggested karajan joined the nazi party during hitlers reign 
in germany to further his career 
karajan was aware of his capabilities very early and was 
determined to make a career koepke wrote in a monday newspaper 
commentary sent by facsimile machine in advance to the ap 
karajan himself once acknowledged he joined the nazi party to 
avoid jeopardizing his career but he said he had no political 
sympathy for the nazis 
koepke also criticized karajan for his choice of music saying he 
usually offered a very limited concert program 
always beethoven brahms bruckner and richard strauss and 
also sometimes johann strauss koepke said 
west german music critics have long been sharply divided in their 
views of karajan 
many say he deserved his worldwide fame but others have been 
disturbed by his membership in the nazi party and his thirst for 
publicity 
he was a great musician and a great music teacher wolf von 
lewinski a respected music critic who knew karajan told the 
associated press from his home in ludwigshafen 
he was a brilliant conductor with a special sense for tone 
lewinski said

a memorial was unveiled sunday to more 
than 300 people killed nearly 45 years ago when huge explosions 
rocked a navy ammunition depot in one of world war iis worst 
stateside disasters 
the servicemen and civilians who died in the july 17 1944 blast 
at the port chicago naval magazine were remembered with a halfhour 
service and the dedication of a simple marker containing a piece of 
twisted metal from the disaster 
im sorry for the men who died and their families but im 
pleased with the memorial because they didnt die exactly 
forgotten said 73yearold gordon koller who was a chief bosuns 
mate at the base in 1944 
koller and two of the other four remaining survivors were among 
200 people who took part in the service at the base now called 
concord naval weapons station about 30 miles northeast of san 
francisco 
the dead were honored with a color guard a military band and a 
wreath laid before the marker which is part of a larger planned 
memorial 
the marker stands on the shore of suisun bay where 10000 tons 
of ammunition exploded killing 320 people and injuring another 390 
up to 15 miles away it consists of concrete slab bearing a granite 
plaque a yardarm and the piece of metal from a ship that was blown 
apart in the disaster 
the three blasts occurred as men loaded two cargo ships at the 
magazines pier 1 destroying the pier and both the ss ea bryan 
and the ss quinalt victory and sinking a coast guard fire barge 
the blast lit the sky for miles around and rattled windows as far 
away as san jose 35 miles to the south

marine navy and marine corps as well as civil service employees 
and civilians 
the navy armed guard veterans west coast division held the first 
memorial service at port chicago last year and has since led a

they visited the site and saw there was no marker other than the 
stubs of the destroyed pier said capt lonnie f cagle commanding 
officer of the weapons station 
the marker is in memory of port chicago as well as the 320 who 
died cagle said if ever a town deserved a purple heart port 
chicago did he said 
the town which was two miles away from the pier suffered 
extensive damage from the blast 
port chicago was wounded in action in 1944 and killed in 
action during the vietnam war when the navy bought the town and 
razed it to create a safety zone cagle said

said sunday that regional stability lies in friendship not military 
strength and called for an end to the longstanding conflict between 
his nation and pakistan 
it falls upon us to silence the guns that have given no peace 
and to seek the enduring solutions that only peaceful coexistence 
can ensure gandhi said at a banquet held for his visit by prime 
minister benazir bhutto 
since the predominately moslem pakistan was carved from 
hindudominated india in 1947 the two nations have gone to war 
three times 
ms bhutto told a news conference earlier in the day that 
gandhis visit was the first step in a long process toward 
reconciliation 
you know for a long journey you have to take a first little 
step and only then can you reach your destination she said 
at the banquet ms bhutto said we should ensure that south 
asia remains free of nuclear weapons 
tensions between the nations have been exacerbated in recent 
years with reports that both countries have programs to make nuclear 
weapons 
pakistan and india which has successfully tested a nuclear 
device deny they are making nuclear arms but refuse to open their 
facilities to international inspection 
gandhi who was given a 19gun salute upon his arrival earlier in 
the day met with president ghulam ishaq khan and later with ms 
bhutto

a minor mechanical problem that stalled 
the maiden flight of the b2 stealth bomber was repaired by sunday 
and air force officials were preparing the craft for another 
attempted takeoff monday morning 
an air force spokesman said only that the problem was located in 
a device called the heat exchanger in the fuel system of the bomber 
i had our technical people try to explain it to me and it went 
right over my head said air force col doug kennett 
officials at northrop corp builder of the controversial plane 
were unavailable for comment 
a low fuel pressure reading aborted the scheduled saturday 
morning flight as the radarevading bomber revved its engines 
awaiting clearance for takeoff from air force plant 42 
after the flight was called off workers began checking out the 
batwinged aircraft which is already 18 months behind schedule and 
at a budgeted price of 500 million each the most expensive plane 
in history 
the fuel problem was fixed and officials were preparing the 
radarevading bomber for a monday morning takeoff from plant 42 
with a landing at nearby edwards air force base said air force lt 
col jerry fergeson 
plant 42 in the mojave desert 40 miles north of downtown los 
angeles is the air forces primary research and development 
facility 
the senate armed services committee approving president bushs 
3055 billion defensespending request for fiscal 1990 stipulated 
friday that no new money be spent on the b2 until it flies the 
pentagon is seeking 8 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal 
year 
if that plane doesnt fly the debate is over armed services 
committee chairman sam nunn said friday it is far too expensive 
to be a stealth taxi 
the government has invested about 224 billion in the bomber so 
far 
the aircraft northrop and air force officials say is the most 
thoroughly tested in history without having been flown it has 
undergone years of hangar testing in computer flight simulations 
however it is not unusual for problems to materialize when an 
airplane is ready for flight 
the cost of each of the 132 bombers sought by the air force is 
more than 500 million over the life of the program 
the air force and northrop estimate that the production cost of 
the stealth bomber in 1989 dollars not adjusted for future 
inflation to be about 274 million apiece 
socalled stealth technology combines advanced materials and a 
special shape to create a plane that will not show up on enemy 
radar though the bomber is still in the development stage stealth 
fighters have been in operation for several years

abortion rights advocates gain a platform on 
national television this week when their friend and supporter ted 
turner broadcasts their prochoice video on his superstation tbs 
turner is not shy about his prochoice agenda last week he 
called abortion foes idiots and bozos predictably raising 
the ire of prolifers and drawing attention to the coming broadcast 
abortion for survival produced for the fund for the 
feminist majority is a halfhour program that frames abortion as an 
issue of public health family planning population control and 
womens rights it focuses on the effect of us abortion policies 
not just on american women but on women in other countries as well 
the program will be aired on turners tbs channel thursday night 
again next saturday afternoon and on sunday morning it will be 
followed by a onehour studio debate moderated by journalist martin 
agronsky on the panel will be two prochoice activists and two 
abortion foes 
jennifer cole a spokeswoman for the national right to life 
committee called turners decision to air the prochoice program 
but not a prolife film very irresponsible journalism 
righttolife groups want turner to balance his broadcast by 
showing eclipse of reason a film showing the results of a 
24week abortion 
that film and its precursor the better known silent scream 
which uses a sonogram to show a fetus being abbrted have been aired 
by local and regional cable tv systems in various parts of the 
country 
in september 1985 silent scream had a national audience as 
part of a threehour public broadcasting service program that 
included a trilogy of advocacy films for and against abortion 
abortion for survival was unveiled in april in time for a 
prochoice march that brought several hundred thousand demonstrators 
to the nations capitol to protest bush administration efforts to 
overturn roe vs wade the supreme courts 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
the courts ruling earlier this month giving states broad powers 
to restrict abortions has mobilized forces on both sides of the 
issue and kept the issue on front pages of newspapers across the 
country 
the prochoice film takes a straightforward look at abortion as a 
medical procedure beginning with the taping of an actual abortion 
the woman is 6 weeks pregnant and the abortion takes oneminute 24 
seconds 
to lawmakers i would like to say that there are hundreds of 
thousands of women whose lives are being affected its not a 
political thing its not a philosophical thing its womens 
lives the woman says when the procedure is completed 
the video hosted by actress christina pickles attempts to 
debunk the myth she says is perpetuated by prolifers that many 
abortions are performed late in term she says 91 percent of 
abortions on american women are performed before the 12th week 8 
percent in the second trimester and 1 percent in the third 
in one segment the contents of a uterus emptied of an 8week old 
fetus are displayed an unrecognizable mass of red tissue 
the video also depicts the effects of us abortion policy 
overseas where governments fearful of losing us family planning 
funds wont offer women information on birth control or abortion 
by reducing contraception opportunities these women are risking 
illegal abortions and many are dying according to the medical and 
public health experts on the program 
they espouse a common theme without access to legal abortions 
women will die from illegal abortions in one sequence physicians 
recall women they treated for infections incurred from botched 
illegal abortions before the 1973 supreme court decision 
the lesson is very simple if you legalize abortion the 
nations health improves if you restrict abortion the nations 
health suffers david grimes a professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the university of southern california

a retired kgb colonel said in a memoir published 
sunday that he regretted taking part in his agencys suppression of 
dissidents and urged security workers to abandon such practices 
in an article in the weekly ogonyok col ya karpovich said he 
sought to fill what he called the black holes in the history of 
the kgb the soviet secret police and intelligence agency 
these black holes are connected with the tragedy of our 
people karpovich wrote 
the most important thing is to be united in the struggle to 
cleanse the organs of government security and it is important 
for all the workers of the organs of state security to realize that 
they must say a definitive no to the past he said 
the list of scientists poets and writers karpovich said the kgb 
unjustly suppressed read like a whos who of the 1970s dissident 
movement alexander solzhenitsyn andrei sakharov yevgenia 
ginzburg vasily aksyonov giorgi vladimov pyotr grigorenko josef 
brodsky mikhail chemyakine vladimir voinovich dmitri dudko gleb 
yakunov and ernst neizvestny 
many have been rehabilitated under gorbachev and several who were 
exiled abroad have returned to the soviet union on visits 
was this really a job for soviet organs of state security 
asked karpovich 
sakharovs thoughts appeared in the west this deserved 
an effort by the authorities to engage in a wellmeaning dialogue 
no exile karpovich wrote referring to sakharovs exile without 
trial to the closed city of gorky in january 1980 
and theres one more international disgrace the psychiatric 
internment of normal people he wrote in detailing the case of a 
retired general who was placed in a psychiatric hospital because of 
his dissident views 
publication of the article followed an extraordinary session of 
the soviet legislature on friday at which lawmakers questioned kgb 
chairman vladimir a kryuchkov he was subsequently confirmed in the 
post he has held since last fall 
it was the first time a kgb chief faced a public accounting 
the ogonyok article and a lengthy report sunday in the newspaper 
sovietskaya rossiya that detailed the legislative session were steps 
toward opening one of the soviet unions most secretive areas 
until now little has been disclosed about the kgb despite the 
political and economic reforms of president mikhail s gorbachev 
karpovich said that after working as an investigator in a 
prosecutors office for five years he joined the kgb in 1955 three 
years after the death of dictator josef stalin 
he spent the next three years reviewing the 193752 period 
apparently helping to reverse the convictions of millions of soviets 
imprisoned under stalin and released after his death 
karpovich said he then began to investigate what he called 
current cases

security forces had rounded up people in 
the somali capital of mogadishu following clashes with moslem 
worshipers that left 23 dead and 59 wounded residents of the city 
said sunday 
the residents who spoke on condition of anonymity said they did 
not know how many people were picked up who they were or why they 
were detained 
the clashes broke out friday a day after security forces 
arrested moslem leaders the residents said occasional gunfire had 
continued into early sunday but subsided later in the day 
somali president mohamed siad barre sunday offered his 
condolences to the relatives of those who died and said things are 
back to normal

and said somalis should cooperate with the security forces in 
maintaining stability 
the clashes occurred near a mosque in a neighborhood of western 
mogadishu according to somali state radio casualties included 
troublemakers and members of the security forces according to a 
state radio broadcast monitored in nairobi somalias western 
neighbor 
a resident said it appeared troops opened fire as moslem 
worshipers left the mosque islam is the state religion in the 
impoverished east african nation of about 9 million 
security forces apparently were outside the mosque to forestall 
any protests of thursdays arrests of the moslem religious leaders 
it was unclear why the religious leaders were detained or whether 
there was any connection between their arrests the weekend violence 
and the july 9 assassination of mogadishus roman catholic bishop 
salvatore pietro colombo the residents said 
the italian government saturday provided transportation out of 
mogadishu for 40 italians visiting relatives working on italian aid 
projects in somalia according to the italian news agency ansa

will steger and a team of international 
explorers left aboard a soviet transport plane sunday night for the 
first transantarctica trek by dogsled 
after hugging relatives waving goodbye to a several dozen 
wellwishers and gathering for a team photo the sixmember crew 
boarded the plane at 830 pm 
the plane carrying 42 dogs and about 13000 pounds of equipment 
departed from minneapolisst paul international airport one hour 
later 
the grizzled minnesota adventurer and five companions from five 
countries are probably as prepared as humans can be for the 
continents perils 
i consider driving in minneapolis rushhour traffic much more 
dangerous than antarctica he said in an interview friday in 
antarctica things are in your control 
after several stops in latin america their sevenmonth 
4000mile trip across the bottom of the world was due to begin aug 
1 weather permitting the team hopes the grueling journey from west 
to east will rivet attention on international cooperation as well 
as the continents stark fragility 
at the same time steger 44 wants to pursue a dream he says has 
lurked inside him for years to conquer the worlds last untamed 
frontier 
ive traveled north for so many years now and ive been drawn 
to these areas said steger its the frontier its the white 
spots on the maps the adventure and the exhilaration of traveling 
in those unknown places that draws me 
others have crossed antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow 
tractors but this will be the first unmechanized attempt 
the venture has also drawn lots of publicity and money with 
corporations in the united states and france contributing nearly 10 
million a 35 million aluminum boat will serve as a floating 
embassy and communications base 
the team has been plucked from all corners of the earth through a 
combination of nationalities and outdoor skills the members are 
steger coleader jeanlouis etienne of france soviet scientist 
victor boyarsky englishman geoff somers keizo funatsu of japan 
and qin dahe of china 
the trip south is to includes stops in havana lima peru and 
buenos aires argentina 
finally from the tiny argentine city of rio grande the crew 
will wait for the proper weather to fly to king george island near 
the tip of the antarctic peninsula where the chinese will be 
hosting the treks launch at the great wall research base the 
arbitrary point of seal nunataks was chosen as the treks launching 
pad 
but even the best plans cant completely shield the crew from 
antarcticas temperatures hovering at 50 degrees below zero or 
its blinding winds that reach gusts of 100 mph 
the challenge is going to be the constant wind that may blow 10 
to 15 miles an hour against you in your face and the storms that 
literally rip apart your tent steger said 
the hazards dont stop there crevasses up to 150 feet deep await 
the crew avoidable only by painstaking attention to dips in the 
snow or changes in color that signal light coming through 
while money and letters from wellwishers have poured in the 
expedition has also drawn its share of criticism 
jack talmadge head of polar coordination and information at the 
national science foundation worries that stegers wellpublicized 
efforts on the continent would bring in more people 
we think the expression by will steger of a basic human need to 
explore is admirable he said but if tourism to the antarctic 
developed further he said wildlife could be disrupted 
such concerns are pointless said expedition spokeswoman jennifer 
gasperini were not trying to promote tourism we need to 
generate an awareness of antarctica to make people understand the 
pristine nature of its environment and therefore preserve it 
this wont be stegers final expedition but it will be the last 
of its magnitude the adventurer said 
it will be a pinnacle of major arctic expeditions theres 
really nowhere you can go to top this one

while paramount communications inc appeals a 
judges decision allowing time inc to proceed with a 14 billion 
tender offer for warner communications inc lawyers and corporate 
executives have begun studying the opinion to see how it might 
affect transactions between other firms 
fridays decision by delaware chancery court judge william t 
allen disputed the claim by paramount which is trying to buy time 
in a 122 billion hostile tender offer that time directors put 
the company up for sale when they agreed to a friendly stockswap 
merger with warner last march 
after paramount announced its bid for time on june 6 time and 
warner amended their earlier stockforstock transaction to provide 
for the 70ashare tender offer 
paramount and some of time shareholders who also sought to stop 
times offer for warner are appealing allens ruling to the delaware 
supreme court which could affirm modify or overturn his decision 
the states highest court will hear arguments from both sides on 
july 24 
but while it is not yet known if allens 79page opinion will 
stand corporate lawyers and executives are nonetheless interested 
in what it says many of the nations biggest companies are 
incorporated in delaware and are subject to its laws and court 
decisions delaware laws also have been used as models for statutes 
in other states 
allens opinion dealt with several issues raised by paramount as 
it attempted to prove that time management and directors acted in 
bad faith 
for example in arguments before allen during a hearing last 
week paramount contended that time executives including chairman 
j richard munro and president nj nicholas jr used a merger with 
warner as a way to protect their own jobs 
time executives and directors testified that they sought to have 
nicholas ultimately serve as chief executive of the merged company 
time warner inc rather than a warner executive because they were 
concerned about preserving the journalistic integrity of 
publications such as time and people magazines 
paramount claimed these concerns were actually a disguise for 
management entrenchment but allen took a broader view of the 
situation 
there may be at work here a force more subtle than a desire to 
maintain a title or office in order to assure continued salary or 
prerequisites the judge wrote 
the mission of the firm is not seen by those involved with it 
as wholly economic nor the continued existence of its distinctive 
identity as a matter of indifference he said 
his ruling gives other executives more leeway to consider their 
own roles when they structure a transaction 
another issue raised by paramount was whether time put itself up 
for sale because after the proposed created of time warner inc 
the former warner stockholders would own more than 60 percent of the 
company while former time shareholders would own 40 percent time 
was transferring control of itself to warner paramount argued 
allen called the unequal stock positions irrelevant control of 
both companies remained in a large fluid changeable and changing 
market effectuation of the merger would not have subjected time 
shareholders to the risks and consequences of minority share 
if allens ruling stands companies contemplating similar 
stockforstock mergers can rely on this statement as support for 
the way they set up their own deals 
allen acknowledged that the outcome of the timeparamount fight 
has implications that go beyond this case and that mergers under 
different circumstances could run into trouble 
paramount had argued that time management by undertaking a 
series of defensive steps had opened the company up to other bids 
including the paramount offer 
allen agreed that time management and its board had at all 
times one eye on the takeover market considered that market in all 
they did and took steps to afford themselves the conventional 
defenses but he added i do not regard that fact as darkly as 
do the plaintiffs 
but the judge referring to the fact that takeover defenses can 
make a company vulnerable included a warning in his opinon 
it is inevitable today for businessmen to be mindful of this 
factor

plans by strikebound eastern airlines to boost its 
schedule in august have meant aroundtheclock training sessions and 
some of the industrys longest flying hours and quickest advancement 
for pilots a newspaper reported sunday 
miamibaesd eastern wants to put enough planes in the air in 
august to prove to us bankruptcy judge burton lifland that it 
should be given a chance to revive the airline 
fewer than 300 of easterns 3800 union pilots have come back to 
work since the march 4 walkout by the machinists union members 
pilots and flight attendants 
meanwhile eastern has hired 835 pilots 559 of whom still are in 
training the company said 215 are flying and 61 have flunked out 
or left the program for other reasons 
the palm beach post reported in sundays editions that the 
accelerated program to prepare for the expanded august schedule 
means 
pilots will have to fly nearly 30 percent a month more than 
easterns chief competitors delta air lines and american airlines 
and more than any other major airline 
about 25 percent of easterns pilot recruits are being promoted 
to captain within a few months at other airlines it takes more than 
10 years to reach such status eastern downplays the significance 
saying its just providing advancement opporunities to qualified 
pilots 
easterns schedule could become rife with canceled flights 
because of its pilots inexperience the national transportation 
safety board has recommended that airlines avoid pairing pilots with 
little experience together eastern is using such crews and has said 
it will have to cancel flights in certain kinds of bad weather 
the issue of pilots and safety has exacerbated the hostile 
relations between eastern and the strikers the airline says the 
pilots union has hired pilots to infiltrate the program and 
encourage other trainees to drop out the union says its main goal 
is to protect the public and to expose easterns rebuilding plan as 
unworkable 
eastern which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
five days after its unions walked out wants its creditors to 
approve a rebuilding plan that would leave it twothirds it 
prestrike size 
many of the union members have sworn never to work for the 
airline as long as it is owned by texas air corp and its chairman 
frank lorenzo the union also threatens to blacklist the 
strikebreakers from ever working for any of the 40 airlines with air 
line pilots association labor contracts 
using its national network of union members and aviation sources 
the pilots union says it has established its own intelligence 
agency to hunt down any recruits with what it calls questionable 
records 
the rush to hire pilots has opened the doors to candidates that 
the union has called unqualified eastern disagrees 
eastern which once flew to 102 cities plans to rebuild its 
schedule to 65 cities by aug 1 and 77 cities by the end of the 
year the august schedule requires 580 pilots for 390 daily flights 
the original plan submitted to the judge called for 850 pilots to 
be onboard by august but last month eastern president phil bakes 
conceded in congressional hearings that the airline would be lucky 
to have 550 to 600 pilots by august in testimony june 30 before the 
house subcommittee on aviation bakes said the company will make up 
the difference by requiring pilots to fly more hours 
eastern has since revised the figures to 90 to 92 flying hours 
per month the faa limits pilots to flying no more than 100 hours a 
month or 1000 hours a year 
based on easterns roster of captains and first and second 
officers and its focus on developing an atlanta hub the union 
estimates that captains would have to fly 105 hours per month and 
first officers would have to fly 111 hours both above the faa 
limit 
but the two sides differ on how successful the training program 
will be the union estimates the company will train 245 pilots by 
aug 1 and field a total of 540 the company expects to train 300

when the first greyhounds begin circling 
racetracks in wisconsin next year they will be chasing an estimated 
600 million a year into the states economy officials say 
the five tracks approved by the state racing board among initial 
applicants for dogtrack licenses would represent a total investment 
of 1216 million thousands of construction jobs and nearly 2700 
permanent track jobs according to documents submitted to the board 
but economists track developers and state officials say the 
total impact would be far greater as dollars spent at race tracks 
spread in the economy like ripples across a pond 
the 600 million economic splash calculated from figures 
projected by track licensees does not include the construction of 
new hotels or other developments the tracks are expected to spawn 
within a few years the total economic impact could be in 
excess of 1 billion said terence m dunleavy executive director 
of the racing board 
the overall impact of racing could be greater than that of many 
comparable investments because much of the business will come from 
out of state and it does not compete directly with 
alreadyestablished enterprises dunleavy said 
track developers say they expect their operations to complement 
rather than compete with other tourismrelated businesses 
kenosha has no existing attraction that draws 8000 visitors a 
day to town and dairyland greyhound park outside of the city will 
give the community the advantage of a major attraction without 
traffic problems and other disadvantages sad john serpe the 
assistant track manager 
because dairyland croixland and two of the other three tracks 
expect to cater heavily to outofstate tourists and attract people 
who otherwise might have visited tracks in iowa the economic ripple 
effect in wisconsin will be greater said william a strang 
associate dean of the university of wisconsinmadison school of 
business 
the effect could be the same as a new 600 millionayear 
company coming to wisconsin strang said
