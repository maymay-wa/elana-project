the state of nevada has filed suit 
against us energy secretary james watkins over watkins continued 
efforts to locate a highlevel nuclear waste dump at yucca mountain 
brian mckay the states attorney general said wednesday he 
filed the lawsuit in the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san 
francisco seeking the courts endorsement of the 1989 
legislatures formal rejection to congress of the yucca mountain 
site 
despite our notice to congress and congress silent 
acceptance of that fact secretary watkins continues to pursue the 
project mckay said adding that the doe is violating terms of 
the federal nuclear waste policy act 
the state contends that watkins has made it clear to congress 
that he is pushing for the yucca mountain site in excess of his 
statutory jurisdiction and authority and contrary to constitutional 
right 
the lawsuit asks for an order that the site is unsuitable for a 
dump and that watkins stop all site studies and related activity 
the suit was filed a day after gov bob miller said he had 
rejected four permit requests by the doe to study the suitability 
of the proposed nevada site for the nations first highlevel 
radioactive waste dump 
the legislature has passed and i have signed bills that make 
the dump illegal here he said we cannot issue permits 
allowing the doe to begin testing a site we have outlawed they 
cant proceed without these permits 
carl gertz project manager for the energy department at the 
proposed yucca mountain site agreed that millers action made a 
court battle inevitible he said a lawsuit would be filed early 
next year to obtain the permits 
it seems strange to us that state officials say yucca mountain 
is not suitable for the repository yet the state will not grant us 
the permits needed to make that determination scientifically 
gertz said 
energy department officials maintain the state cannot ban the 
repository until the president recommends a site to congress 
miller said nevadas position and that of the energy department 
will have to be resolved in court 
current plans call for a waste site to be established by the 
year 2010 to store 70000 metric tons of radioactive wastes for 
10000 years yucca mountain is the only location in the country 
that currently is under consideration

nasa has started testing sensors aboard 
galileo five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its 
thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to venus 
and jupiter 
were testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they 
are ready to observe venus when galileo whizzes past the 
cloudshrouded planet feb 9 said jim wilson spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
on friday galileo fired its thrusters during a 2hour period 
so that it will fly about 6200 miles above the venusian cloudtops 
wilson said 
the maneuver went off exactly as planned galileo mission 
director neal ausman said 
wilson said another maneuver may be needed in late january to 
finetune the spacecrafts trajectory the first trajectory 
maneuver was performed in november 
galileo was launched from the space shuttle atlantis on oct 18 
it will swoop by venus once and earth twice so those planets can 
act as gravity slingshots to propel galileo toward its 1995 
encounter with jupiter the solar systems largest planet 
on wednesday the spacecraft was 12 million miles from earth 
but had traveled almost 105 million miles along its looping 
185millionmile path to venus wilson said 
the spacecraft still has 23 billion miles left out of its 
24billionmile trip to jupiter 
after flying past earth in december 1990 and december 1992 
galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe in july 1995 
the orbiter will circle the giant gas planet for 22 months 
starting in december 1995 the same month the probe will parachute 
into the jovian atmosphere collecting information for 75 minutes 
until it is crushed by overwhelming atmospheric pressure 
scientific information that galileo collects during februarys 
venus flyby wont be transmitted back to earth until late october 
after the spacecraft unfurls its umbrellashaped highgain 
antenna wilson said 
the antenna would be damaged by heat if it were as deployed near 
venus the second planet from the sun he added

a glut of unsold condominiums around 
connecticut could provide instant housing for families with low 
or moderate incomes state housing commissioner john f papandrea 
said wednesday 
he proposed that his agency help nonprofit corporations and 
housing authorities acquire the units using grants or loans from 
his department he said entire developments parts of developments 
and even individual condos would be considered for inclusion in the 
program 
the nonprofit sponsors then would sell or rent the units to 
families with incomes at or below 100 percent of the area median 
for rental housing and at or below 135 percent of the area median 
for ownership 
papandrea said the goal is to get as many as 500 condos sold 
under the program 
he called it a unique opportunity for his department to help 
low and moderateincome residents 
its not a bailout of developers or of banks holding 
construction mortgages in default we will openly consider prices 
that are below market rate he said 
were looking for the most favorable deals to benefit the 
greatest number of people while using the least amount of state 
funds the commissioner said at a news conference connecticut 
is faced with a severe shortage of affordable housing there are 
thousands of illhoused families throughout the state 
jude d brennan president of the 17000member connecticut 
association of realtors said he hoped the program would not 
compete with other state housing programs that have proven 
beneficial to connecticut families 
but he said we simply do not know enough of the details of 
the new program to make an informed judgment 
department officials said the program is intended to help meet a 
goal of providing 3000 new units by the end of next year for 
families now unable to afford the rental or homebuying markets 
the officials said there are thousands of vacant condominiums for 
sale in the state 
the criteria for selecting the condominiums in addition to 
price and local housing needs would be to provide affordable units 
in suburbs and small towns 
the connecticut housing finance authority would provide 
lowinterest mortgages to some of the families who buy the units 
from the housing authorities or nonprofit agencies 
the state treasurers office is expected to coordinate the 
involvemet of banks or other lenders in providing either mortgage 
or downpayment assistance the lenders also would provide loans to 
nonprofit agencies to finance the purchase of the vacant 
condominiums

south koreans watched romanias 
revolution stirred by the hope that communist north korea will see 
itself in the mirror and decide to change its rigid totalitarian 
ways 
romanias executed president nicolae ceausescu was the last 
hardline communist leader in the warsaw pact his repressive rule 
in isolated romania often was compared to that of north koreas kim 
il sung 
newspapers and tv stations here exhaustively covered the 
collapse and a flood of editorials cautioned that north korea risks 
similar bloodshed if it fails to change 
the north korean leadership may well realize that its days are 
numbered said a korea times editorial romania it added will 
hopefully serve as a grave warning to the pyongyang leadership 
north korea recognized the new bucharest government on 
wednesday saying it regards recent events as an internal romanian 
matter and expects to keep its ties with the romanian people 
longtime observers saw the norths move as predictable and a 
stall for time while it prepared a scenario to explain the new view 
of the world to a citizenry used to accepting as dangerous any but 
hardline communist ideology 
one western diplomat speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said hope for change is premature north korea feels change in 
east europe is the result of a bungled bureaucracy and since it has 
no bureaucracy it feels it needs no reform and has no problem 
in addition north korea is an asian nation not a european one 
a nation bordered on the north and west by the soviet union and 
china and on the east by the sea of japan capitalist south korea 
inaccessible to north koreans is portrayed as a beggar country a 
stooge of american imperialists 
north koreans are isolated they have no access to western tv 
publications or merchandise symbols diplomats call singing 
commercials for capitalism citizens cannot leave the country 
without permission 
us and south korean observers see little possibility of a 
popular uprising in the north any hint of dissent is crushed there 
and the only news is that dictated by the government over 
governmentcontrolled radio stations 
president roh taewoo of south korea said in a christmas address 
that north korea is a tyranny which continues to hold sway 
seemingly uninfluenced by the winds of change blowing across so 
many other communist states 
still romania is bad news for the communist regime in the 
north which has portrayed romania as a brother state said kim 
changsoon president of the seoul governmentfunded north korean 
affairs research institute 
a news blockade may be the only choice they can make ge 
saud 
many south koreans hope the north will see romanias collapse as 
a signal to be more receptive to capitalism and eventual 
reunification of the two koreas 
the korean peninsula was split into communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 a 155mile demilitarized zone dividing 
them the dmz is site of one of the worlds greatest military 
concentrations with 15 million heavily armed troops patrolling the 
border 
to help ease tensions seoul has worked to establish ties with 
communist and east bloc nations a spate of northsouth talks has 
been held this year with little progress the two countries remain 
enemies 
north korea kept ties with communist and east bloc allies 
undergoing change but it shared a special kinship with romania 
only last month north korea sent a congratulatory message to 
the 14th romanian communist party congress in which it stressed a 
joint struggle against capitalism north koreas foreign minister 
kim yong nam reportedly visited bucharest just weeks ago to 
reaffirm relations between the two countries 
north korea remains a totalitarian inflexible regime under 
77yearold kim il sung who has dominated it with a personality 
cult since the late 1940s kim designated his son as his political 
heir in what would be the worlds first communist dynasty 
most south korean and us observers reckon as almost nil the 
prospect of change in north korea while kim il sung remains in 
control they say his son kim jong il appears bent on continuing 
the system 
there are many similarities in the way romania and communist 
north korea have held onto clannish despotism said a korea 
herald editorial few expected ceausescu could be toppled 
so quickly and easily the pyongyang regime must realize that 
change will be the only option it will have in the very near 
future

a librarian stood in the ashes of a 
half million books inside the scorched shellpocked walls of the 
once prestigious university library and wondered aloud if romania 
can ever return to normal 
things are not returning to normal because we dont know what 
normality is said librarian ion visoiu 
we have to learn how to live as decent normal beings we know 
about civilized life only from books from our traditions and from 
our parents nobody here knows it personally 
the burnedout library near the center of palace square was 
destroyed by the fierce weekend fighting that followed the ouster 
of nicolae ceausescu the communist dictator whose 24year reign of 
terror still frightens and mystifies 
probably in each of us there is a little of ceausescu said 
visoiu he wasnt so special he was rather common but he was 
shrewd enough to get enough power to become a monster 
tanks and armored cars still filled the square on wednesday 
afternoon but the mood was light and jubilant old men embraced 
young soldiers groups of women handed up pastries and hot coffee 
to tank crewmen lounging beside their machine guns some of which 
have bouquets of flowers taped to the barrels 
smiling children posed in front of massive tanks for their 
parents cameras thousands of people strolled through the square 
gawking at the royal palace battered by machine guns at the ruins 
of the library and at other buildings shattered and burned by the 
fighting 
there was still some scattered shooting after dark isolated 
bursts of automatic weapons fire crackled in the distance 
but there is no fighting here shrugged a smiling soldier in 
palace square ceausescus dreaded security police had put up a 
fierce fight but were reported surrendering by the hundreds after 
learning of his execution 
glazers were already at work wednesday replacing some of the 
windows shot out along victoria street which leads into the square 
apartment dwellers cleared the debris from their balconies 
overhead and boarded up bulletshattered windows 
romanians are digging out preparing to go on with their lives 
a few blocks south of palace square three barbers calmly clipped 
hair in their small shop a line of about 35 people stretched out 
in front of a store where cheese and sausage could be bought 
this is just the beginning said sorin serb maybe after a 
year we can talk about our political destiny 
he looked at the ruins and shellscarred buildings and shook his 
head as he thought about what had happend 
all this in just one day he said there was this 
wonderful eruption of the people in bucharest exactly one week 
ago 
a few blocks north of palace square scores of people lined up to 
buy canned vegetables bottled juice cheese and some bags of dry 
pasta 
it is the kind of food we had before the revolution but now 
you dont need a ration card the goverment has stopped the exports 
of food said one student who asked not to be identified 
it is a commonly heard complaint in romania that ceausescu 
exported food for profit while his people went hungry 
across the street from the food store about 200 people stood in 
line in temperatures just above freezing outside a shop where an 
18wheel truck had just unloaded a huge shipment of frozen beef 
there was nothing like this before this was for export 
said the student suggesting the new government has redirected food 
formerly for export to the state stores 
it is a good idea the first step is to build confidence in 
the government he said 
others agreed saying their lives had already changed 
dramatically 
i feel completely transformed things that did not happen in 
30 years happened in a few days we are not the same men we were on 
dec 21 said marin ghezu a furniture maker in line outside the 
meat store 
that was the day before ceausescu was overthrown in the revolt 
on monday both he and his wife and secondincommand elena were 
summarily tried and executed 
life will be more beautiful than it was before these changes 
will last they will last for eternity said ghezu 
we cannot speak any more about the comunist party we cannot 
say those words we must wipe them from our mind said ghezu 
about what party are you talking a middleaged woman asked 
ghezu there is no party any more she scolded do not talk 
nonsense

gen manuel antonio noriega was 
rocked by a special hit list as armed forces radio played through 
loudspeakers pointed at his refuge the vatican embassy 
baby youre no good by linda ronstadt voodoo child by 
jimi hendrix and bobby fullers i fought the law and the law 
won were some of tunes that appeared on the radio playlist 
wednesday afternoon 
the olivegreen loudspeakers were set up by some of the 100 
soldiers who ringed the embassy compound to keep noriega from 
getting away 
standing by their armored cars the soldiers first heard david 
bowies modern love played so loudly it easily reached the top 
of the nearby holiday inn where reporters kept a vigil on the 
embassy 
the radio then played a string of rap songs which shook the 
building before switching to the news 
if noriega wasnt wearing earplugs he heard that the united 
states is trying to freeze millions in his alleged cocaine earnings 
in foreign countries 
he also heard newly installed president guillermo endara call 
him a common criminal of the worst kind accused of homicides 
and narcotraffic and very very horrendous crimes 
later in the day the troops moved up a tank with a 152mm cannon 
next to the embassys west wall although the cannon was not 
pointed at the embassy 
the cuban embassy in downtown panama city was surrounded by 
coils of barbed wire and along the street leading to the cuban 
ambassadors residence in the plush san francisco district 
american troops manned roadblocks and allowed only people who live 
in the street to go in 
the embassies of nicaragua spain and libya were also surrounded 
to prevent noriega henchmen from seeking refuge there 
american diplomats have declined comment on the legality of the 
actions in a swift little war in which the rules seemed to have 
vanished with the first puff of gunsmoke 
on tuesday the vatican ambassador monsignor sebastian laboa 
was frisked and his car searched by american troops as he left the 
embassy a rare if not unheard of occurrence because accredited 
diplomats carry immunity rights that are especially valued in latin 
america 
noriegas ouster and capture were among the top goals of the 
us invasion the vatican embassy which endara once used for 
sanctuary when he was in the opposition and noriega ran the 
country was one of the likely places of refuge the americans 
didnt stake out 
but now that he is in there it is vigilantly guarded 
a few troops in sandbagged positions remain around the cuban 
embassy which is close to that of spain nobody answers the 
embassy doorbell 
at the residence cuban ambassador lazaro mora was apparently 
inside with a considerable number of other people but polite us 
soldiers told inquiring reporters you cant come here 
neighbors said that in the days immediately after the american 
troops invaded there was a flurry of activity outside the home 
cars were going in and out three and five at a time and they 
looked like they were full of food said a woman who lives nearby 
a man in that house over there can see into the courtyard and 
he said he saw 14 cars there is never that much activity there 
she said 
speculation about who may be inside varies a call went out for 
a pediatrician a couple of nights ago on wednesday one resident 
said she saw a man crawl over the compound wall and run 
we told him the americans would shoot him if he ran he told 
us the americans will shoot me if they catch me she said

the government will stop reimbursing operators 
of nuclear weapons plants for their own criminal fines 
environmental penalties fraudulent losses and other questionable 
costs officials say 
the decision spurred by growing congressional criticism of the 
weapons program marks the most fundamental change in the energy 
departments weapons contracting system since companies were 
recruited to build the first atomic bombs in the 1940s 
the companies traditionally have been allowed to recover 
virtually all their costs even those resulting from their own 
negligence the logic was that weapons production was so 
specialized and vital to national security that the government 
could not afford to risk losing a plant operator over money matters 
the new thinking under energy secretary james d watkins is 
that the weapons contractors will perform better if they are held 
accountable for their mistakes 
under the new system the government will continue paying 
contractors normal operating expenses but for the first time all 
costs resulting from negligence will be borne by the companies 
instead of the taxpayers stephen a wakefield the energy 
departments general counsel said in an interview 
wakefield said a formal proposal to amend the departments 
regulations to end the practice of reimbursing all contractor costs 
will be announced in january and it could become official policy 
by late spring detailed application would be made in the annual 
negotiations with each contractor that normally set the terms under 
which bonuses are awarded in the coming year 
private companies run all 17 major facilities in the nuclear 
weapons complex the energy department spends about 11 billion a 
year on the arms program 
the issue of liability is important because the plants have 
billions of dollars in environmental problems and some continue to 
violate environmental laws the rocky flats plutonium processing 
plant in colorado is under fbi investigation for possible criminal 
violations of federal hazardous waste laws 
in exchange for assuming a bigger share of the financial risk of 
operating the weapons plants the contractors will be offered 
bigger bonus payments for excellent work wakefield said 
wakefield declined to say how much extra bonus money would be 
made available but he said it would not be unreasonable to 
think current fees might be doubled 
the companies typically can earn several million dollars a year 
for operating the plants for example westinghouse electric corp 
which holds contracts to run several of the plants earned 39 
million in bonus fees from april through september for operating 
the savannah river nuclear facility near aiken sc 
wakefield said there are varying levels of concern among the 
companies which have been briefed on the outlines of the contract 
changes 
a couple of them have said well this is one more thing we 
have to consider in deciding do we want to be in this 
business wakefield said adding that none so far has indicated 
it would withdraw as a result of the changes 
wakefield cited several examples of circumstances under which 
the department no longer would reimburse the contractors 
environmental fines and related legal costs stemming from 
actions by the contractor that could reasonably have been avoided 
last month the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress reported that the department had reimbursed two plant 
contracts for 295000 in fines levied for violations of hazardous 
waste laws plus 529000 in the companies legal costs 
damage to government property as a result of negligence 
wakefield said that if the new contract provision had been in place 
in january ei du pont de nemours amp co which then was operator 
at savannah river would have been liable for damage to several 
nuclear reactor valves caused by improper testing procedures the 
department has estimated the valve damage at 20000 
damage to third parties including people and property outside 
the plant due to negligence by the contractor wakefield said this 
could under some circumstances mean the contractor instead of the 
government would have to pay for environmental or health damage 
resulting from the spread of radioactive contamination

the nation will need 15 percent more classroom 
teachers by the year 2000 to cope with a dramatic increase in the 
number of pupils the department of education says 
the teachers are expected to be better paid than today said a 
department study released wednesday 
total elementary and secondary school enrollment is expected to 
reach 495 million by the end of the century a gain of about 9 
percent said the study titled projections of education 
statistics to 2000 
enrollment has declined 4 percent in the past 11 years the 
expected turnaround is attributed to an increase in births that 
began in 1977 and has continued in most years since then 
its impact will be felt most strongly at the secondary school 
level which has lower studentteacher ratios and a greater range 
of subjects enrollment in secondary schools is expected to climb 
to 148 million an increase of 18 percent 
the pupilteacher ratio will continue to drop although not as 
steeply as in the 1980s the study said by the year 2000 the 
ratio for elementary and secondary schools both public and 
private is expected to be 161 students per teacher it is now 
169 and in 1978 it was 192 
the average public school teacher is expected to earn 14 percent 
more in real purchasing power after adjusting for inflation in 
the year 2000 than now the study said the national average today 
is 31200 
this publication will be a useful planning tool for our 
nations governors federal state and local leaders and members of 
the business community education secretary lauro cavazos said in 
a statement 
college and university enrollments are expected to increase from 
128 million to 134 million a gain of 4 percent faculty also 
will increase by 4 percent from 741000 in 1988 to 771000 in 2000 
in 1999 for the first time more doctoral degrees are expected 
to be awarded to women than to men women have led men in 
associate bachelors and masters degrees for several years men 
are expected to continue to dominate first professional degrees in 
such fields as medicine and law

angry homeowners besieged oil delivery 
companies and governors across the northeast are calling on federal 
officials to find out why home heating oil prices skyrocketed this 
month to their highest levels ever 
the price jump from about 85 cents a gallon two weeks ago to as 
high as 162 per gallon now has led officials from gov mario 
cuomo of new york to gov judd gregg in new hampshire to call for 
federal investigations of possible gouging and pricefixing 
whether oil companies are in collusion or not public officials 
and industry experts agree that an unusual confluence of events has 
led to the highest prices ever for home heating oil 
events ranging from low water levels on the rhine river in 
germany to a refinery explosion in louisiana have contributed to 
the upsurge officials say above all though is the record cold 
spell that has gripped much of the nation this month for the 
northeast forecasters are calling for more chill temperatures this 
weekend after a brief respite 
its pretty grim said sam livieri jr vice president of 
apple oil co in branford conn no its very grim were 
telling people 129 a gallon and they cant afford it i dont 
blame them for being upset 
j wallace malley chief of the public protection division of 
vermonts attorney generals office said its what some people 
might call a gouge but he added that as yet there is no evidence 
of unlawful pricefixing 
cuomo on wednesday called on the justice department to 
investigate the heating oil price increases home heating oil is 
a necessity not a luxury cuomo said massachusetts gov michael 
s dukakis was the first to call for a probe writing to the 
department of energy last week along with rep richard neal a 
massachusetts democrat whose office has been deluged with calls 
from angry homeowners 
new hampshires gregg ordered his energy chief to call federal 
energy officials rhode island gov edward d diprete sent a 
telegram wednesday to the head of the federal trade commission 
requesting an investigation into the price hikes 
im outraged by whats happened here and its not a factor and 
force of the market place neal said supplies could well have 
been kept low in anticipation of a cold winter in an effort to jack 
the prices 
about twothirds of the homes in new england use truckdelivered 
heating oil according to the new england fuel institute which 
represents 1300 companies unlike electricity and natural gas 
home heating fuel is unregulated and therefore subject to market 
fluctuations 
institute spokesman bernard smith rejected the charge of price 
manipulation 
if you take one word its demand and the second word is 
weather said smith the low water level of the rhine river in 
germany is slowing deliveries to europe and thus tying up supplies 
he said 
in addition cold weather in southern states has caused about a 
halfdozen refineries to shut down or limit production because the 
temperatures hamper the refining process he said and an 
explosion over the weekend at an exxon refinery in baton rouge 
la caused the heating oil futures market to soar 
prices this week topped the previous peak of 135 per gallon in 
1981 at the end of the arab oil embargo according to smith the 
lowest level of the past decade came when prices dipped to about 55 
cents per gallon during the summer of 1986 according to smith 
one supplier jumped 12 cents from yesterday and our retail 
price is now 123 per gallon with a small discount for people who 
pay on delivery joe bosse of bosse fuel in waterbury conn said 
wednesday that reflects the 12cent jump in wholesale prices in 
new haven yesterday 
energy department spokeswoman mary kayne heinze said the 
department was aware of the concern in the northeast and was 
collecting information to assess the situation but had reached no 
conclusions 
in maine prices are running about 10 cents per gallon behind 
the rest of the region 
the port of portland is probably in the best shape in terms of 
supply of any port on the east coast said eugene a gilford 
president of the maine oil dealers association nevertheless 
gilford said even oil delivery companies in maine are calling for 
an investigation into the skyrocketing wholesale prices

mixing the predictable with the 
unusual the nominations for the 47th annual golden globes honored 
pop hits like when harry met sally but ignored acclaimed 
movies such as henry v 
the golden globes announced by the hollywood foreign press 
association on wednesday often serve as a bellwether for the 
academy awards but some of this years selections were so unusual 
it seems unlikely the oscars will follow suit 
the foreign press unlike the academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences divides films and star performances into two categories 
drama and musical or comedy 
among the stranger nominations jack nicholson picked for best 
actor in a musical or comedy for batman which almost everyone 
considers a drama and bruce willis named for best supporting 
actor for in country the movie in which willis is the most 
prominent player

murder rates soared to new highs in some of the nations largest 
cities in 1989 but at least eight cities saw a surprising drop in 
homicides 
police were quick to blame crack for homicide records that were 
set in at least seven cities but they were less certain about why 
there was less killing elsewhere 
one official suggested that violence may have ebbed in cities 
where drug dealers have already won their turf wars by killing off 
rivals and dividing up territory 
final 1989 statistics in most cities wont be prepared for at 
least several weeks but a preliminary survey by the associated 
press of police departments in more than 30 cities shows that the 
number of homicides rose in most of them 
a large amount of the increase has to do with the violence 
associated with the drug trade said hubert williams executive 
director of the police foundation 
police officials across the nation echoed his statement 
more homicides were committed this year than ever before in 
washington philadelphia new orleans kansas city milwaukee 
charlotte nc and new haven conn 
several other cities including new york city are likely to 
have set records when final 1989 statistics are compiled 
in some big cities chicago los angeles and baltimore among 
them the number of killings is up from last year but nowhere near 
the alltime high 
at least eight cities including miami dallas and denver 
expect to end the year with a slight decline in homicides the 
other cities minneapolis indianapolis portland ore virginia 
beach va and newark nj 
police offered no explanations for the decline but williams of 
the police foundation said those cities might just be ahead of 
others in the sophistication of their drug kingpins 
its my sense at least that the homicides related to drug 
trafficking begin to peak as the turf battles begin to break out 
and diminish as someone gains control he said 
in new york which always has the largest number of homicides in 
the nation killings totaled 1773 as of nov 24 that is 19 more 
than were committed in the same period of 1988 
in september alone 197 people were killed making it one of the 
bloodiest months in the citys history 
assistant police chief raymond kelly attributed the rise to 
crack the smokeable form of cocaine he noted that in 1978 there 
were 1504 homicides in new york 
whats different now than in the late 70s and early 80s the 
answer is crack kelly said 
although new york claims the largest number of violent deaths 
washington is the most murderous big city on a per capita basis 
a police spokesman there lt reginald smith estimated that 60 
percent of this years homicides were drugrelated 
through dec 21 419 people had been killed in the district of 
columbia in 1989 compared with the previous alltime high of 369 
set last year 
in philadelphia there were 481 killings by dec 21 well above 
the 15yearold record of 444 police blamed not just drugs but the 
fact that todays drug dealers are far better armed than their 
counterparts in the past 
before they had zip guns and homemade weapons now they have 
automatic weapons uzis said sgt robert snyder a 32year 
police veteran

an agriculture department scientist has 
duplicated a quackgrass chemical that is deadly to slugs those 
slimy things that nibble at backyard gardens and farm crops 
the slugkilling chemical is emitted into the soil by quackgrass 
after it is killed thus the department said wednesday when 
farmers destroy quackgrass they also kill some slugs 
the poison is highly specific to slugs said weed scientist 
roger d hagin it has been tested with no ill effects on three 
species of freshwater snails as well as mammals in general 
hagin who works at the agencys plant protection research unit 
in ithaca ny has successfully isolated and synthesized the 
quackgrass compound a patent on the material is in the works 
which could clear the way for commercial development of a new 
lethal bait for slugs 
commercial poisons are available now to kill slugs but those 
also are toxic to birds and animals he said the quackgrass 
treatment could be applied at much lower rates and at less cost 
hagin fieldtested the compound for two years in snapbeans 
alfalfa and other crops he said the snapbean yields were nearly 
doubled as a result of reduced slug damage 
quackgrass is widespread and competes strongly for fertilizer 
and water in crops such as corn soybeans and forages hagin said 
most of the crops that grow in temperate regions have problems 
with quackgrass he said cattle will graze it fairly well but 
there are other things youd rather have them eat 
slugs are especially troublesome in humid areas and have taken a 
heavy toll of west coast strawberry fields and citrus orchards 
hagin said they also interfere with corn production on the east 
coast 
further slugs are a serious problem in notill or 
minimumtillage farming where the soil is not cultivated heavily 
were currently looking at the possibility of using the slug 
poison compound as a seed treatment in minimumtillage 
situations hagin said we might be able to get the crop plants 
to take this material up as a defense against slug attacks 
hagin accidentally discovered the quackgrass connection in 1981 
after he had used herbicides to get rid of weeds before he planted 
notill corn on land where red clover had been raised 
when the corn was about six inches tall i noticed that slugs 
were attacking it heavily he said but there were little 
islands in the field where quackgrass had been growing with the 
clover and in those areas the slugs werent attacking the corn at 
all 
quackgrass is known to leave two allelopathic chemical 
compounds behind in the soil that inhibit the growth of certain 
other plants but those are different from the compound that kills 
the slugs hagin said

snow cover helped protect winter wheat from 
the arctic blasts that ripped across the great plains into the 
fruit and vegetable areas of florida and texas says the 
governments joint agricultural weather facility 
cold temperatures and lack of moisture stressed winter wheat 
in oklahoma and texas the facility said wednesday in its report 
the extent of the freeze damage was still unknown 
the report covered the week of dec 1824 and noted that a 
brutal blast of arctic air tumbled temperatures to record lows in 
many areas 
belownormal readings in major citrus and vegetable areas of 
florida and texas caused widespread damage although losses have 
not been fully determined the report said 
the facility is operated jointly by the departments of 
agriculture and commerce weekly reports cover general crop 
conditions but do not include production forecasts 
besides destroying undetermined quantities of citrus and 
vegetables the subnormal readings slowed the peanut harvest in 
south texas although 97 percent had been completed by the end of 
the week 
in the rio grande valley freeze damage to sugar cane was 
expected to be light to moderate the report said in florida 
sugar cane suffered some freeze damage but the extent was unknown 
in louisiana sugar cane harvest was slowed by cold temperatures 
the severe cold put stress on cattle and other livestock 
throughout the great plains corn belt delta and the southeast

belgium may develop as a potential market for 
us frozen yogurt exporters says an agriculture department report 
john m beshoar us agricultural counselor in brussels said 
belgian consumers are beginning to develop a taste for yogurt 
one company introduced the frozen product in early 1989 with four 
flavors exotic fruits strawberry raspberry and vanilla 
because many consumers are unfamiliar with the new dessert 
the company is developing a new product a mixture of ice cream 
and yogurt to encourage more consumers to try it he said if 
this product is successful it could pave the way for similar 
frozen dairy treats

the south lebanon army created by israel 
to help guard its border has honed its fighting skills and 
expanded in size but there is no sign israel is ready to withdraw 
from southern lebanon and leave the fighting to its allies 
on tuesday israeli ground and air attacks wiped out two 
guerrilla bases of the communist party in central and southern 
lebanon in the largest such action in a year thirteen people were 
reported killed 
with israeli advisers and reporters watching the sla recently 
showed off its gunnery prowess in a livefire exercise with a dozen 
soviet t55 tanks captured by the israelis from the palestine 
liberation organization 
gun barrels flashed and the aging tanks painted gray knocked 
out rusty trucks on a hillside nearly a halfmile away 
the lebanese crews silhouetted on a ridgeline could be seen 
jumping and waving their arms with delight 
the exercise israeli advisers stressed marked a significant 
improvement in the military capabilities of the militia that helps 
israeli troops patrol a security zone that is 25 to 12 miles deep 
just north of israels border 
however some observers see a major problem with the militias 
reliability and discipline 
the sla has caused israel political embarrassment by getting 
involved in shooting incidents with the ninenation 5700member 
united nations peackeeping force that patrols north of the security 
zone 
it also has stirred up antiisraeli sentiment with 
indiscriminate shellings of shiite moslem villages 
the sla commander antoine lahad 62 a retired lebanese army 
general told reporters his force made a lot of improvement 
since israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from lebanon in 1985 
the sla was more like a militia now it has developed into a 
small regular army he said adding the force numbered 3000 men 
up from 2000 a year ago and may expand further 
lahad who survived a communistinspired assassination attempt 
in november 1988 said an israeli presence was needed until syria 
withdrew its 40000 troops from lebanon 
the day we face lebanese opponents only we can do without the 
backing of the israeli army said lahad a christian whose 
militia controls an area with a predominantly shiite moslem 
population of 200000 
israel has stationed troops in lebanon since shortly after 
lebanons civil war began in 1975 
col renaan gissin deputy spokesman for the israeli army said 
israel had no plans to leave but also had no interest in lebanon 
beyond protecting its 60mile border 
he added that the zone had proved a success because life in 
northern israel was normal and no israeli civilian had died in an 
attack from lebanon since 1985 
the slas reliability remains a major question mark however 
in recent years the christianled force was riddled with 
defections by shiites had its positions overrun by iranianbacked 
hezbollah guerrillas and proved unable to stop palestinian 
infiltrations into the security zone 
the sla has also borne the brunt of shiite and palestinian 
attacks suffering 188 killed and 600 wounded in the past four 
years so far this year the sla came under 350 guerrilla attacks 
about half the level of the previous year 
despite the improvements some experts are less confident of the 
slas ability to restrain its militiamen from exacting revenge and 
say the force is incapable of standing up to guerrilla attacks 
without israeli troops estimated by foreign reports to number at 
least 1000 
the sla will hold on as long as israeli army is the backbone 
discipline is good as long as israeli officers are there said 
yoram hamizrachi a retired colonel who was in charge of training 
the sla from 1977 to 1980 
they are improving in military skills they can read maps and 
coordinate their actions but they have a tendency to lose their 
tempers i wouldnt trust them in anything major 
in early december for example sla gunners retaliated for the 
ambush killing of three sla militiamen by firing sporadic barrages 
at civilian areas north of the security zone lebanese reports said 
nine civilians were killed in the shiite town of nabatiyeh 
the shiite leader nabih berri responded with a warning that 
his amal militiamen would shell israeli settlements if the sla 
attacks persisted 
maj gen yossi peled israels northern front commander 
conceded in a recent interview that he had frequent arguments with 
sla commanders about the use of force 
he said that it was normal for lebanese militias to fire 100 to 
300 shells into a small village 
peled said it was quite difficult to get the sla to 
understand israels objections but during the past two or three 
years we succeeded to change their behavior i dont know if it 
will go back the way it was but there has been a tremendous 
change

a factory propane tank exploded 
wednesday shooting a huge plume of smoke and fire into the sky and 
forcing fire and emergency crews to retreat from the blaze after 
evacuating about 3500 people 
no injuries were reported at whiterodgers co when the tank 
exploded shortly before 4 pm workers were evacuated and people 
who live within a 1 miles were ordered from their homes said dale 
rust of the independence county office of emergency services 
it is the most thickly populated area of the city said rust 
independence county sheriff david hunter said there had been 
some reports of burglaries in the evacuated area rust said 10 
state troopers were being sent to the city to help control looting 
were having people ripping us off out here hunter said 
two hours after the blast firefighters were pumping water on 
the burning tank and about a halfdozen others that are mostly 
surrounded by a fire wall in an area separate from the main plant 
building rust said 
the evacuation area was expanded to a radius of 1 miles from 
the fire after 7 pm police placed road blocks around the area 
said faye england a dispatcher at the batesville police department 
it should burn itself out if it doesnt rupture and 
explode before then rust said were trying to keep the tanks 
cool to keep them from rupturing 
at 9 pm officials withdrew emergency workers and eight 
firefighters from the fire scene after gas was detected in the air 
around the fire the firefighters left untended nozzles playing 
streams of water onto the fire 
there was no immediate word on when the emergency workers would 
be allowed back into the fire scene 
the plant a division of emerson electric manufactures water 
heater and gas controls and employs about 1000 people 
county judge david wyatt said about 3500 people were removed 
from the area around the plant 
about 12000 gallons of propane is contained in 14 
interconnected tanks at the plant which could cause damage within 
a mile if it all exploded rust said 
rust estimated that the fire was burning up about 500 gallons of 
propane an hour 
in addition the tank is burning from both a safety valve at its 
top and a leak at its base adding to the risk of an explosion 
rust said the lower fire could boost temperatures and pressure in 
the tank he said 
ambulances were used to evacuate residents of the 121bed 
woodlawn nursing home and emergency officials drove through some 
neighborhoods using loudspeakers to urge residents to leave their 
homes 
the nursing home patients were evacuated to a methodist church 
and other churches opened to accommodate people forced from their 
homes rust said 
ross jones who was at a nearby store when the blast occurred at 
midafternoon said he witnessed both vibrations and something we 
heard then saw smoke rising into the air 
jones said he heard a second blast about 10 minutes later and 
saw a second plume of smoke he said he drove by the plant and saw 
the blaze and heard a roar like jet engines apparently the 
noise of pressurized propane gas escaping from the tank 
rust said officials had no idea what caused the tank to rupture 
and explosion an investigation would begin when the fire was 
brought under control but were not worrying about that right 
now

as a new decade begins president bush and 
congress must find a way to raise taxes and cut spending to solve 
the countrys most pressing economic problem the huge federal 
budget deficit a congressional study concluded today 
efforts to attack the deficit thus far have relied heavily on 
budgetary gimmicks according to the study by the staff of the 
congressional joint economic committee 
the economic policies of the 1980s have not prepared us for a 
brighter future said committee chairman rep lee hamilton who 
directed preparation of the new report we need new polices for 
the 1990s 
the study offered a somewhat bleak assessment of us economic 
prospects contending the united states must do more to boost 
savings increase investment and spur gains in productivity if it 
intends to compete internationally in the 1990s 
eliminating the budget deficit which totaled 1521 billion in 
the fiscal year that ended in september is the countrys top 
economic priority hamilton said 
the study said it would be impossible to reduce the budget 
deficit without tax increases to accompany spending cuts a 
conclusion bush has repeatedly rejected 
his administration is putting the finishing touches on a 123 
trillion budget proposal for next year which will meet the 
grammrudman target of reducing the deficit to 64 billion without 
raising income taxes 
but the study said bushs efforts to rely on rosy economic 
forecasts and squeezing savings out of already strapped government 
programs would prove as unsuccessful for him as it did for 
president reagan 
a tax increase alone would not be politically acceptable and 
therefore it should be part of a package deal including cuts in 
spending and a moderate increase in taxes the report said it said 
the needed revenue could be raised without increasing income tax 
rates which are currently at 15 percent 28 percent and 33 percent 
for individuals the study however did not offer suggestions on 
where taxes should be raised 
among other findings in the report 
shortterm economic growth prospects are weak with the economy 
expected to grow at a sluggish pace even if it manages to avoid a 
recession in 1990 
attempts to boost americas trade performance have stalled with 
the trade deficit expected to remain at more than 100 billion per 
year this unacceptably high level will unleash renewed calls for 
the erection of protectionist trade barriers 
the problems plaguing the united states in the 1990s are a 
direct result of an imbalance between fiscal and monetary policies 
throughout most of the past decade the reagan administration 
pursued a stimulative fiscal policy through tax cuts and big 
deficits while the federal reserve was keeping monetary policy 
tight with high interest rates the study called this combination 
of large budget deficits and high interest rates the worst 
preparation the country could have made for trying to compete 
internationally 
the report devoted an entire chapter to suggestions on how the 
country can reduce its huge trade imbalance but it warned 
reaching trade balance will be difficult and painful we must 
change not only our own practices but also those of other nations 
and of the international trade and financial systems 
it said efforts to boost the savings rate were essential as a 
way of reducing americans appetite for foreign goods and providing 
a larger investment pool needed to modernize us industry 
it called for international organizations such as the 
international monetary fund and the world bank to devote more 
efforts to resolving the third word debt crisis which has severely 
limited us export opportunities in latin america

repairs are being made at a jewish 
secondary school in this washington suburb which was ransacked by 
vandals in a hateviolence incident while it was closed for 
hanukkah officials say 
police said the 12room school yeshiva of greater washington 
apparently was invaded late tuesday the fifth night of the jewish 
festival of hanukkah 
lockers were ransacked ceiling panels ripped out windows and 
doors smashed and books strewn all over the floors 
the school which has 85 students in grades 7 through 12 was 
closed this week and officials said they were not sure they could 
make repairs in time to reopen on tuesday 
driving here i was prepared for the worst said rabbi zev 
katz assistant principal but this goes beyond anything i could 
prepare myself for 
the vandalism was classified as a hateviolence incident

attorney general dick thornburgh says a 
restructuring of the justice departments organized crime strike 
forces will enhance efforts against both traditional organized 
crime families and new organized crime elements 
starting jan 1 the justice departments 14 strike forces will 
be folded into 23 us attorneys offices across the country 
thornburgh said wednesday in announcing plans to proceed with the 
reorganization despite some congressional claims the move is 
unwarranted 
he defended the reorganization which had been revealed 
previously on the grounds that traditional organized crime run by 
mafia families has changed with the mob often working in tandem 
with colombian drug cartels and others 
moreover organized crime is also operated by elements in the 
asian community and gangs such as the crips and bloods and the 
jamaican posses he said

mexican officials are denying us allegations 
that its territory has been used by cuba to transport weapons to 
leftist rebels in el salvador 
an official mexican source on wednesday rejected the allegation 
categorically because mexico has built up a surveillance 
infrastructure to avoid use of its territory for such purchases 
us officials have said that there are strong indications that 
cubansupplied weaponry is being sent to the salvadoran rebels via 
a remote route that begins in the yucatan peninsula 
the mexican source asking not to be identified called the 
statements by the us officials irresponsible lacking in

hunting deaths in maine arent unusual 
two generations ago the state recorded 15plus a year but the lone 
death last season has ignited a debate greater than all the rest 
combined 
the accidental shooting of karen wood in the trees behind her 
home struck a raw nerve in a state where tens of thousands pour 
into the woods when deer season opens each autumn 
more than a year later the death of the 37yearold mother of 
yearold twin daughters remains a focus of wrangling between 
hunters and nonhunters 
the case sparked arguments over the adequacy of the states 
hunting regulations and raised questions about the criminal justice 
system after the grand jury that first heard the evidence declined 
to hand up an indictment 
a second grand jury this month returned a manslaughter 
indictment against donald rogerson the bangor man who admitted 
shooting mrs wood when he mistook her for a deer while hunting in 
woods in the bangor suburb of hermon 
the 45yearold rogerson a supermarket produce manager has 
pleaded innocent and remains free on his own recognizance while 
awaiting trial if convicted he faces up to 20 years in prison 
the case prompted some people to call for tighter restrictions 
on hunting near homes the current law forbids shooting within 300 
feet of an occupied residence 
but others suggested mrs wood should have worn bright clothing 
like the fluorescent orange garb required of hunters before 
venturing into the woods during deer season some faulted her for 
wearing white mittens that could have been mistaken for the 
underside of a deers tail 
the head of the state inland fisheries and wildlife department 
notes the uproar comes at a time when state safety programs have 
reduced hunting deaths to their lowest level in history even 
though more hunters are in the woods than ever 
the public has been somewhat tolerant over the years of 
hunters shooting other hunters said commissioner william j 
vail noting that hunters assume some risk whenever they go into 
the field this particular case involved a nonparticipant 
someone who was not hunting and i think that was at the root of 
the outrage 
mrs wood who had just moved to the area from iowa that summer 
was shot in the chest the afternoon of nov 15 1988 while she 
stood amid some hardwoods behind her home in a new residential 
subdivision 
rogerson was arrested that evening and charged with 
manslaughter but the charge was dropped the following month after 
the grand jury concluded that his actions were neither criminally 
negligent nor criminally reckless 
vail bristles at the suggestion mrs wood may unknowingly have 
contributed to her death 
that sort of criticism is outrageous he said hunters are 
required to wear fluorescent orange nonhunters are not and there 
are literally thousands of people who live and work in the maine 
woods in november who do not wear it 
while anyone in maine during that time of year should be aware 
that deer season is on vail said the responsibility is clearly 
with the hunter to make sure of his target before firing 
stephen duren executive director of the sportsmans alliance of 
maine said he believes rogerson bore some blame for the killing 
there must have been some violation of the hunter safety code 
that you be certain of your target duren said the hunter 
knows very plainly what don rogerson should have done and failed to 
do 
a year after mrs wood was shot the legislature rejected an 
attempt to increase the 300foot restriction on firearms 
discharges fish and game officials opposed the change saying the 
current law was adequate 
a wrongful death lawsuit by mrs woods husband against rogerson 
was settled for 122000 most of it covered by rogersons 
homeowners insurance rogerson also agreed he wouldnt seek a new 
hunting license according to his lawyer lewis vafiades who said 
his client doesnt want to resume the sport 
rogerson has declined to talk to reporters 
mrs woods husband kevin a pediatric psychologist who has 
since moved back to iowa with his daughters said he was encouraged 
by the indictment and believes that the grand jury had reached 
the only decision logic and reason would allow

ranged between 14199 yen and 14217 yen 
currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range in 
thin trading normal for a holiday season 
a dealer with the bank of tokyo who spoke anonymously said the

further decline in us interest rates which have been speculated 
about in recent weeks 
lower interest rates tend to erode the value of a nations 
currency

lysa biffle was nine months pregnant and hoping 
for a boy ebony williams was looking forward to college 
their fates became linked in the final moments of christmas 
night when both women were shot and mortally wounded by random 
shots apparently fired by drug dealers in a turf battle over a 
housing projects cocaine trade 
these people happened to be in the wrong spot said police 
lt eugene dunbar 
but the randomness of the shootings has shocked residents of the 
queens housing project they now must fear being the target of drug 
dealers who dunbar believes had no other purpose than flexing 
their muscles in the neighborhood 
thats the horror of the whole thing said state 
assemblywoman barbara clark whose district includes the south 
jamaica houses project im ready to call out the national guard 
to stand around the project and defend people against these 
driveby shootings 
miss williams 18 who planned to attend nearby york college 
next fall lived with her mother in another section of the 
neighborhood she had eaten christmas dinner at her grandmothers 
house and was meeting friends who lived at the project the friends 
had planned to see a movie 
the teenager and a friend were making a call at a corner pay 
phone when the bullets struck her twice in the head at 1150 pm 
monday killing her instantly 
witnesses told police three or four men in a toyota camry then 
coasted about 200 feet and pulled up next to mrs biffle her 
husband dwayne 25 and his brother vincent as they were getting 
into their car after visiting a relative 
the gunmen fired several shots into the biffles car before 
speeding off 
mrs biffle 26 was shot once in the back with the bullet 
striking her aorta spleen pancreas and colon but missing the 
fetus her husband was shot once in the left foot police and 
hospital officials said 
the biffles were taken to a hospital where doctors delivered a 
healthy 6pound 7ounce son by caesarean section 
mrs biffle died tuesday her husband and son were reported in 
good condition at the hospital 
this is a tragedy compounded to an infinite degree said 
benjamin suckewer a partner at the manhattan law firm of dreyer amp 
traub where mrs biffle worked as his secretary along with her 
love of her family there always shined through an incredible 
faith 
he said that when she had a spare moment she would study 
scriptures at her desk 
her coworkers who gave the expectant mother a baby shower last 
week were waiting for her funeral plans to be announced the law 
firm is helping coworkers set up a fund for her son 
the south jamaica neighborhood that surrounds the 
1047apartment project has been the scene of violent clashes by 
gangs fighting to gain control of the drug turf left by the 1988 
arrests of howard pappy mason and lorenzo fat cat nichols 
mason was convicted of racketeering as well as ordering the 
february 1988 murder of police officer edward byrne the rookie 
officer was fatally shot as he sat in a marked patrol car guarding 
the home of a witness in a drug case nichols also is imprisoned on 
murder and drug charges 
dunbar said it is not unusual for drug dealers in the area to 
fire at people to get a message across to other drug dealers that 
someone else is moving in he said during the past year there 
have been three other similar shootings in the south jamaica area 
in the last couple of months there have been at least six 
murders in and around the project ms clark said its just 
become unreal 
the assemblywoman said she met with mayorelect david dinkins on 
wednesday to demand the same kind of response we had when officer 
byrne was killed because so far nothing has happened

many women can opt for the homey surroundings of 
birth centers instead of hospital obstetrical wards without undue 
risk to themselves or their babies said a study published today 
normal birth ought not be considered a sickness requiring 
hospitalization said dr allan rosenfield a coauthor of the 
study 
the study found that women who were at low risk of complications 
do just as well in birth centers that are located outside hospitals 
as they do having babies in hospitals and they are far less likely 
to have caesarean sections 
rosenfield an obstetrician who is dean of columbia universitys 
school of public health said that properly screened this is a 
reasonable alternative to a hospital delivery for women who prefer 
it 
the study based on nearly 12000 childbirths was intended to 
answer lingering doubts about the safety of birth centers 
despite the positive findings however some physicians remained 
skeptical 
in an editorial published with the findings in todays new 
england journal of medicine drs ellice lieberman and kenneth j 
ryan of brigham and womens hospital in boston said that more 
research will be necessary to evaluate fully the safety of 
delivery in freestanding facilities 
the boston doctors criticized the study because it failed to 
include all the birth centers in the united states or to enroll a 
comparison group of women who gave birth in hospitals 
they said that birth centers should be located inside hospitals 
which have the emergency equipment needed to deal with rare 
unexpected complications 
hospitalbased birth centers combine the best of both 
facilities by offering the atmosphere of a birth center without 
sacrificing the safety of a hospital they wrote 
presently 132 freestanding birth centers operate in the united 
states and deliver about 20000 babies annually typically women 
are assisted by midwives rather than physicians 
the study was organized by the national association of 
childbearing centers and directed by judith p rooks a 
nursemidwife at columbia 
the whole idea is to make it like womens homes and to give 
them the control they want over their childbirth experience said 
eunice km ernst the associations director we take the 
position that birth is a family event and for the majority of 
women its a normal event in their lives 
its true that it can become complicated and require medical 
intervention but women have the right to consider it normal until 
proven otherwise 
ernst noted that birth centers cost onethird to onehalf less 
than hospital deliveries 
the study was based on the experiences of all 11814 women who 
used 84 of these centers over a 2year period they were typically 
white middleclass and well educated 
among the findings 
71 percent had only minor or no complications during childbirth 
8 percent had serious emergency complications and 1 in 6 had 
to be transferred to hospitals 
no women died the newborn death rate was 13 per 1000 births 
the rate of infant deaths and abnormalities was similar to that 
seen in large studies of lowrisk hospital births 
4 percent of the women had caesarean sections nationally 
about 25 percent of women deliver their babies surgically 
99 percent of those who gave birth in the birth centers said 
they would recommend the the centers to friends as would 97 
percent of those who were transferred to hospitals 
safety has been the primary concern about birth centers the 
american academy of pediatrics and the american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists have discouraged their use until 
better data are available 
questions were also raised by an institute of medicine review in 
1982 the latest research was intended to answer these concerns 
we did the study because we really wanted to know if birth 
centers were safe said rooks we looked very carefully and 
hard we did not find an excessive incidence of poor outcomes from 
these birth centers

a suspected burglar was killed after setting 
off a booby trap rigged by a homeowner who complained of frequent 
breakins 
police said wednesday that 37yearold leroy or lee roy 
woodard of mobile was shot in the neck and killed about 1130 pm 
tuesday when he stepped into a trap laid by the homeowner 
police spokesman tom jennings said the booby trap included two 
hunting rifles in separate locations one pointing down a 
staircase he said one rifle fired when woodard stepped on a wire 
rigged to the rifle trigger 
the homeowner 29yearold mark mcclammy was questioned and 
released but jennings said the case would be presented to a county 
grand jury 
joy patterson a spokeswoman for the state attorney general 
said its illegal to take a life to protect property but it 
could be legal where someone is defending their own life or someone 
elses life 
mcclammy told police he lived alone in the house that was under 
renovation he said he was in mississippi when the shooting 
occurred 
a neighbor called mcclammy and told him he had heard a shot from 
inside the house mcclammy and the neighbor went inside and found 
the man on the floor at the foot of the stairwell 
woodard had three prior arrests jennings said 
james miller who has lived in the downtown neighorhood for 26 
years said he has a burglar alarm but would not rig a booby trap 
that sounds like a cruel thing to do miller said 
but a woman who owns a store near the house said the 
neighborhood has a problem with burglaries 
im glad it happened said the woman who spoke on condition 
of anonymity people break into places out here all the time

felicidad pena de navarros 
supermarket cart overflowed with canned goods rice sugar and 
other nonperishables as she shopped for the first time following 
the us invasion 
but the housewife was not only concerned with serving her family 
dinner wednesday night she was shopping ahead in case of more 
turmoil which in recent years has engulfed panama often and with 
little warning 
were going to put this away and not touch it put it away for 
the next time mrs pena de navarro said 
she and others lined up outside the gago supermarket one of the 
few that reopened because it hadnt been looted following the us 
invasion that toppled gen manuel antonio noriega 
this time it hit us at night mrs pena de navarro said of 
the dec 1920 military assault 
i was going to go shopping the next day and my husband said i 
was an idiot why didnt i think ahead well look now im thinking 
ahead said mrs pena 
a battalion of stock clerks raced to pile foods on shelves 
faster than shoppers could pull them off trucks rolled up with 
fresh vegetables and milk unseen here in recent days 
a group of us soldiers in combat gear mingled with the 
shoppers to buy cartons of juice or soft drinks and to pose with 
shoppers who wanted their pictures taken 
store employees gleefully waved them to the head of the long 
checkout lines where they deposited hefty tips on the bewildered 
bagboy who sacked up their orders 
hundreds of stores hit by looters were left bare of items from 
food to furniture and even cars were stolen from dealerships 
looters tended to favor jewelry shops camera stores and 
electronics such as stereos and television sets bookstores were 
not bothered 
while most panamanians live fairly well by regional standards 
it still is a country where aspirin tablets and cigarettes often 
are sold one at a time 
the small openair markets that sell everything from soup to 
soap are concentrated in the poorer areas of the capital where the 
fighting was heaviest and are just beginning to reopen with scant 
merchandise 
produce is starting to arrive from the countryside but shipments 
are being slowed by a gasoline shortage 
earlier this week large piles of produce reportedly were 
rotting in rural areas because there was no way to get the food to 
market or to refrigerated storage

a man dubbed the vampire rapist and 
now serving a 25year prison sentence may be released by 1992 
unless police succeed in linking him to six unsolved slayings a 
prosecutor says 
we will continue to work these cases as hard as we can in 
hopes of bringing murder charges against prison inmate john 
crutchley said state attorney norm wolfinger 
crutchley pleaded guilty in 1986 to kidnapping and raping a 
19yearold woman who said her assailant called himself a vampire 
and drained blood from her arms and legs through needles drinking 
some of it 
in exchange for his guilty plea prosecutors dropped several 
charges including the unusual count of robbery for taking nearly 
half the womans blood 
doctors said the woman would have died if she hadnt escaped 
through a window in a locked bathroom while crutchley a former 
harris corp engineer was at work 
wolfinger commented on the six unsolved murder cases this week 
after crutchleys former lawyer joe mitchell disclosed that he 
tried to begin plea negotiations on the deaths in 1986 
crutchley would have admitted to some of the 1985 slayings and 
taken investigators the victims burial sites mitchell said but 
the negotiations fell through because prosecutors lacked evidence 
linking him to any of the killings 
he was going to admit to from three to six murders but the 
negotiations never got off the ground mitchell said 
crutchley who blamed pornography for his obsession with bizarre 
sexual rituals refused through prison officials to be interviewed 
wolfinger said tuesday that very informal negotiations never 
reached a point at which crutchley would have pleaded guilty to 
murder 
there comes a point in the negotiations when the state has to 
show something the prosecutor said if we had had anything to 
tie a charge to we would have done it but we had nothing 
police said they have long suspected crutchley in the unsolved 
deaths in brevard county although he is serving a long sentence 
he may be eligible for early release within three years because of 
time earned behind bars officials said 
investigators are looking for evidence in the deaths of five 
victims whose bodies were discovered in 1985 and the disappearance 
of another woman

russell oberman doesnt much care for you 
cant get there from here jokes ever since a squabble over a 
railroad crossing began threatening the only access he and five 
other homeowners have to their homes 
we are legally landlocked oberman a village police 
officer said wednesday i can put my truck into fourwheel drive 
and drive across some guys field but my wife doesnt have a 
fourwheel drive 
oberman and others who live nearby get to their homes by driving 
down a narrow gravel road across a set of railroad tracks but 
theres the rub 
detroitbased grand trunk western railroad co has always asked 
the roads residents to sign an agreement stating they will not 
hold the railroad liable for any accident at the unmarked crossing 
residents have done so 
the railroad also has asked that residents maintain a private 
insurance policy to cover any claims filed because of accidents at 
the crossing theyve done that too 
but after a 1986 accident at the crossing that left three people 
dead and resulted in several lawsuits one of them against the 
insurer the insurance company canceled its coverage 
residents called a number of insurers but were unable to secure 
new coverage 
to complicate matters some residents have decided because of 
the lawsuits that they will no longer sign the agreement with the 
railroad 
oberman said the railroad has threatened to erect barricades to 
keep residents from crossing the tracks but a spokesman for the 
railroad said wednesday that grand trunk would like to avoid that 
thats an option they would prefer not to use spokesman 
chuck ragains said theyre not ruling it out but they prefer 
not to use it 
another possible solution converting the road to a public 
thoroughfare thus shifting liability from the residents but that 
too is problematic 
village officials say to upgrade the road to make it public 
they must charge residents for at least 40 percent of the 
improvements at a cost of between 15000 and 20000 per 
household 
the railroad is behind it but residents say they cant afford 
it 
the issue is expected to come up again at next months village 
board meeting

the interfax news agency said 
voters in ramenki a town near moscow nominated him said 
interfax which is affiliated with staterun radio moscow

fledgling opposition to communist party leaders and has continued

state lotteries may create millionaires overnight 
but the newfound wealth brings with it stresses that can make or 
break even family ties 
in two contrasting cases in the past week a disabled new 
hampshire man gave his brother a lottery ticket worth millions 
while a hospitalized massachusetts man and his wife lost their 
legal battle over winnings they say his sister promised to share 
even in the most stable families theres lots of things that 
have to be renegotiated when someone gets a lot of money but 
chances are the problems did exist before said dr lyn 
styczynski who works at a family counseling center in boston 
its not all a godsend 
its very stressful and its a strange stress not one we get 
a lot of preparation for 
the case of earl and elwood havlock was extraordinary however 
said david r ellis a spokesman for the massachusetts state 
lottery commission 
thats very unusual very very unusual and very nice he 
said 
earl havlock who is disabled and unable to work was buying his 
brother a series of lottery tickets for christmas when he hit a 
894 million jackpot 
the 42yearold man lives alone in the central new hampshire 
town of ashland on his social security checks and his brothers 
generosity he said he never considered holding the ticket for 
himself and he handed over the multimilliondollar present to his 
brother without qualms 
why not earl havlock said aint goin back on my word 
earl bought the winning tristate lottery ticket for northern 
new england on saturday a few minutes before the drawing 
elwood who makes about 31000 a year working for the plymouth 
highway department said he plans to quit his job in three weeks 
as for earl elwood said he would continue to help care for him 
anything he needs or wants i get him elwood said 
in contrast the gift of money served to rend the bonds between 
toni ann lydon and her sisterinlaw catherine beauregard the 
pair ran a beauty salon together until beauregard and her husband 
francis bought a winning ticket in 1985 
last week a middlesex county superior court jury refused to 
award lydon and her husband thomas half of a 28 million 
megabucks jackpot the beauregards won the jury found that previous 
agreements the couples used to split ticket winnings were 
unenforceable 
lydon and her husband who is catherine beauregards brother 
said the couples had plans to share the earnings as they had done 
before 
the day before the jury verdict thomas lydon was admitted to 
the hospital his son bobby said wednesday 
thats our main concern said bobby lydon who would not 
comment on whether the family was seeking an appeal of the 
decision he would not comment on his fathers illness 
the lydons suit said that after the beauregards bought their 
winning ticket they told the lydons they would pick them up to 
drive to get their checks together the beauregards never showed 
up according to court papers 
edward sokoloff the lydons attorney said the beauregards 
thereafter began denying there had ever been an agreement he said 
they claimed the splitting of previous smaller winnings with the 
lydons was simply a nice gesture on their part 
ellis said the massachusetts state lottery commission does not 
get involved in such disputes which are rare 
we cannot be involved in this how could we get involved he 
said we try to give them guidance but its up to them to 
protect themselves these are legal votingage adults

the japanese government said today it was dropping 
its inquiry into the us hydrogen bomb lost at sea 24 years ago 
off the coast of japan 
the us defense department had said further queries on the 
accident could endanger us military policy 
the japanese government understands the us position and has 
no intention of making further requests of it kyodo news service 
quoted an unidentified foreign ministry official as saying today 
the case embarrassed both governments japan because it bans 
nuclear arms but appeared to have turned a blind eye to passage of 
such weapons through its waters and the united states because its 
policy of not commenting on the location of such weapons came under 
new scrutiny 
in 1965 a us navy a4 skyhawk accidentally rolled off the 
carrier ticonderoga bearing a onemegaton hbomb the pilot died 
and the bomb sank in waters 16000 feet deep 
the incident was kept secret until 1981 when the navy said it 
had occurred 500 miles from land 
but in may it was disclosed that the bomb had sunk about 80 
miles from a japanese island in the okinawa group 
under pressure from the opposition socialist party and other 
antinuclear groups the japanese government insisted that 
washington explain what had happened scientists tested the waters 
near the site for signs of radioactive pollution from the bombs 33 
pounds of plutonium no radiation was found the government said 
the pentagon has assured japan that scientists had conducted 
experiments and determined that the bomb had been crushed by water 
pressure and its nuclear material would have dissolved it was not 
armed when it went into the sea the pentagon said and it could 
not explode 
japan is the only country ever attacked with nuclear bombs and 
the public is strongly against having them in the country japan 
bans the introduction of nuclear weapons as a matter of policy but 
has not passed a law to that effect 
the socialists who oppose the usjapan defense treaty say 
the ban should be enforced strictly and accuse the conservative 
government of giving tacit approval to the transit of us nuclear 
weapons aboard navy warships that dock in japan 
the japanese queried the united states about the 1965 accident 
and the foreign affairs committee of the oppositiondominated upper 
house of parliament said on dec 13 the government should ask again 
for a us report 
pentagon officials met with japanese diplomats in washington 
tuesday and said the united states understands japans special 
concerns about nuclear weapons but cannot disclose anymore about 
the accident a foreign ministry official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
kyodo news service quoted washington as having said the us 
government feels any further discussion on this matter could 
compromise our operational policies and have an adverse effect on 
our national security interests 
under the usjapan security treaty the united states is 
obliged to consult with japan about bringing nuclear weapons into 
japanese territory japanese officials say that since there has 
been no consultation japan trusts the united states has not 
violated the treaty

shreveportbossier area it tells me that black people and people 
of color are nonexistent

students who once turned to the boob tube to 
avoid homework may now seek help from the small screen 
in a new twist on the tv callin talk show cablevision of 
boston offers youngsters a place to call after school with their 
homework questions 
begun this fall with boston teachers who take queries at all 
levels of mathematics as well as a preparatory course for the 
scholastic aptitude test extra help will be expanded early 
next year with a callin show for english as a second language and 
reading 
its not a novel idea said lisa mcnulty education producer 
for cablevision she pointed out that similar callin homework help 
has been offered since 1976 on long island ny and elsewhere 
what is unique about the boston program is that its tied to the 
curriculum used throughout the boston system she said 
the program is available as part of the basic package offered 
the systems 100000 subscribers in boston and brookline 
the size of the audience isnt known mcnulty said but a 
90minute installment of the program aired live twice a week 
typically gets 20 to 25 calls 
one regular viewer is billy marsden a 17yearold senior at 
muriel snowden high school 
marsden said wednesday the program has helped him climb out of 
the depths of a flunking grade in algebra last year to become an a 
student 
when youre at home and have no one to turn to now you have 
someone there live to help with your homework said marsden 
whose parents both work 
one thing i like about it the teachers are very personable 
they thank you for calling up the line they dont have this air 
like you should know this i know of some teachers that have 
acted like that 
the tv teachers start with a three to fiveminute lesson and 
then take phone calls from students who ask questions the tv 
teacher helps by guiding the student callers through the problems 
nicholas rubino program director of citywide mathematics for 
the boston public schools said extra help is one tool boston 
schools are using to improve education 
a lot of the students in high school dont go home and study 
two to three hours at night rubino said thats all over 
theyre going to work or to play sports 
this causes particular problems in subjects such as science and 
mathematics that require repetition and review he said extra 
help which is broadcast on sundays as well as during the week 
is an effort to get around this he said 
its too soon to tell if the program will improve performance 
rubino said 
but the program might also be useful to teachers rubino said 
educators tune in to watch their most imaginative and enthusiastic 
colleagues in action 
one of the biggest things were trying to do is retrain 
teachers rubino said what were trying to do is make teachers 
more sensitive

for ben colon vietnam was the beginning of a 
downward spiral that led him to the nations first homeless shelter 
for veterans and now a liquid diet to protest conditions there 
he said he and other veterans have been fighting for their 
dignity since returning to the united states and a public which 
viewed them as part of a problem 
they were protesting us calling us baby killers throwing 
eggs at us he said of protesters who met his plane when it 
returned from vietnam in the early 1970s 
he went home to brooklyn broke up with his girlfriend jumped 
from job to job and ended up homeless a year ago shortly after 
overcoming a drug dependency 
now 36 colon stood wednesday outside the salvation armys 
shelter in the new york borough of queens with earl beddoe 41 
the two of them have had nothing but juice since dec 17 
the shelters administrator al peck said the 400 veterans are 
free to go elsewhere if they dislike the rules and conditions 
they know beforehand what the rules and regulations are there 
are 2000 other guys who want to come in peck said 
about 15 veterans joined beddoe and colon in 15degree weather 
outside the shelter to push demands for better conditions and a say 
in running the shelter which is run by the salvation army 
specifically for veterans 
homeless veteran fred tyus read a statement describing the 
salvation armys treatment of the veterans as arrogant 
dictatorial unresponsive and ironfisted 
the management of this residence uses the homeless veterans as 
a superb public relations tool and an excellent conduit for 
charitable contributions he said 
the veterans called for posting of job openings at the shelter 
where two of the 40 workers are homeless veterans better efforts 
to find employment and housing for residents improved medical 
care observance of religious dietary rules and modification of 
curfew policies 
they also want an end to frisking by security officers 
restoration of laundry service improved ventilation a 
modification of the system in which three infractions of the rules 
are grounds for expulsion and a change in staff attitude 
this is a veterans residence not a jail or a concentration 
camp homeless veteran richard catalano said to applause from the 
veterans around him we served our country and should not be 
treated as undesirable outcasts or children 
we need compassion sensitivity and support not disrespect 
and hostility 
colon said the last straw came when veterans were told that if 
they went to stay with family during christmas and missed curfew 
they would lose their beds 
peck acknowledged the curfew rule hadnt been altered for the 
holidays and said he didnt expect rules and regulations to change 
they can choose to come here or not to come here there are 25 
other shelters in the city system he said its a difference 
in philosophy they basically want to run their own shelter 
peck planned to meet with homeless veterans american civil 
liberties union executive director norman siegel and a 
representative of mayorelect david dinkins about the dispute 
siegel said he hoped the 1990s would end treatment of the 
homeless especially the veterans as undesirable outcasts or 
children or crazies or criminals 
beddoe and colon both said they were willing to die of 
starvation which peck called an effective tool to get attention 
from the press

the national bureau of investigation 
recommended today that sen juan ponce enrile be charged with 
rebellion for an alleged role in this months attempt to topple 
president corazon aquino an official said 
enrile denied involvement and said the accusations were meant to 
harass the opposition 
fernando de leon the chief state prosecutor said witnesses 
claimed to have seen enrile with mutiny leaders on dec 1 when 
thousands of troops launched the sixth and strongest attempt to 
topple mrs aquino 
de leon said the recommendation would be referred to a panel of 
prosecutors to decide whether charges would be filed enrile was 
fired as defense minister in november 1986 after a failed coup by 
his followers 
the statement of the witnesses points to the fact that at the 
height of the coup on dec 1 many soldiers with white patches on 
their shoulders were seen at the residence of sen enrile and some 
guests there inside the house were conferring with him said de 
leon 
de leon said those reportedly seen with enrile included former 
lt col gregorio gringo honasan believed to have been a key 
leader in the failed putsch 
de leon said the witnesses were hotel waiters who were catering 
a meal at enriles makati residence on the first day of the 
nineday coup attempt which claimed the lives of 113 people and 
left more than 500 wounded 
enrile said there were no soldiers at his residence he said 
not more than 20 bodyguards in civilian clothes were present 
that day along with some guests who attended a mass traditionally 
held every first friday of the month at his house 
i welcome the opportunity to face them in the courts 
enrile said i know that i have not done anything that is 
criminal under our laws i am not part of the rebellion 
they want to seal the lips of the opposition in the country 
and to threaten them but i will tell them now that they cannot 
silence me he said this government is like a wounded tiger 
flailing its paws 
early today panicselling swept the countrys major stock 
exchange after a senior general warned of a possible new coup 
attempt government institutions bought stocks to ease selling 
pressure 
dealers blamed the decline on a statement wednesday by maj gen 
ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary that a new 
coup may be launched after jan 17 
montano warned the new attempt could be launched by renegade 
leaders of this months coup attempt many of the key ringleaders 
including honasan remain at large 
our intelligence data tell us that the next possible timetable 
for a coup could be between jan 17 and 30 montano told 
reporters 
in a related development the newspaper malaya today published 
what it said was a secret government watchlist of 55 people 
allegedly linked to the failed coup the list included vice 
president salvador laurel and enrile 
laurel a longtime political rival of mrs aquino demanded that 
the government confirm whether the report was true and if so 
explain the basis for the allegations there was no immediate 
comment from the presidential staff

southerners just beginning to thaw out after four days of record 
cold struggled to patch water systems reckoned their losses from 
crop damage and missed tourism in a normally busy resort week 
consumers in the east and midwest will soon be feeling the 
effects of the souths christmas chill as the devastation on 
floridas vegetable farms drives up prices in the grocery stores 
agriculture experts said 
meanwhile the early winter cold wave continued to make itself 
felt farther north today with barge traffic on pittsburghs three 
rivers slowed to a near standstill by ice 
the long cold weekend gave way to mostly clear skies and 
temperatures in the 40s 50s even 60s in much of the deep south on 
wednesday and most of the region will get highs in the 60s today 
forecasters said 
highs in the teens and 20s were forecast from the northeast to 
the rockies today with milder temperatures elsewhere 
more than 100 deaths nationwide have been blamed on the cold 
since dec 15 
in communities from houston to james island sc plumbers 
worked overtime wednesday to repair water pipes that split in the 
freeze and homeowners faced another day of dry faucets or low 
water pressure 
governments hoping to restore water pressure begged people to 
conserve and to shut taps they left trickling to prevent freezing 
in central louisiana residents of boyce were without water for 
two hours wednesday afternoon and again for five hours overnight as 
the towns wells were shut off to allow water levels to rise in 
pollock residents will have only limited water service at least 
until the weekend because the towns three wells failed on 
christmas day 
in new orleans firefighters pumped water from a bayou to fight 
an eightalarm fire at an abandoned cannery after leaks in pipes 
reduced water pressure throughout the city and the same problem 
loomed elsewhere 
if we have a fire were in trouble said mayor george sides 
of dora ala where volunteers helped look for broken pipes you 
can only put so many bricks on the wagon before it breaks 
shortages were reported in five alabama counties and in mobile 
pressure wasnt expected to return to normal for 93000 customers 
for two more days 
wilmington nc declared two days of emergency conservation 
cutting off water to nonessential businesses leaks were forcing 
the city to pump more than 18 million gallons of water a day 
almost double the normal 10 million gallons 
thousands of acres of produce froze in the fields of florida 
over the long weekend and experts said wholesale prices began 
climbing wednesday because of the short supply of tomatoes bell 
peppers lettuce cucumbers and other vegetables 
everything has just tripled in price green cabbage was doing 
about 875 a box and theyre asking over 20 for it now said 
paul graff manager of the len strom brokerage in miami zucchini 
is way up in the 25 range which was between 11 and 12 before 
and so it goes 
prices will begin climbing in the markets of the midwest and 
northeast within a week said reggie brown spokesman for the 
florida fruit and vegetable association in orlando 
production in california and mexico should ease the shortages 
somewhat he said but prices are likely to remain high for three 
months until florida farmers can replant 
the weather put a damper on tourism around orlando fla in 
what is normally one of the busiest weeks of the year but resort 
operators around walt disney world and elsewhere hoped the return 
of 60 and 70degree sunshine would turn that around by years end 
hotel occupancy and attendance at attractions began picking up 
rapidly wednesday 
between christmas and new years its usually a bonanza but 
this year no said ron caimano general manager of the embassy 
suites hotel in orlando where occupancy tuesday was just 75 
percent 
the big chill wasnt all bad news though 
while it was bringing the rare thrill of a white christmas to 
some it may have been killing off millions of fleas ticks gnats 
mosquitoes and flies said frank funderburk an extension agent in 
bibb county ga 
its hard to say what nature is going to do funderburk 
said but the insects that bother man should be less in number 
early in the summer 
unfortunately household pests like cockroaches probably 
survived he said

marin ceausescu the older brother of 
executed romanian leader nicolae ceausescu was found dead at the 
romanian embassy in vienna today after apparently committing 
suicide police said 
a police spokesman who refused to be identified said the 
74yearold diplomat who reportedly headed western european 
operations of the dreaded romanian secret police was found hanged 
in the basement of the embassy trade mission 
the spokesman said it appeared to be suicide and there were no 
indications that anyone else was involved in his death 
authorities ordered an autopsy the austria press agency 
reported 
little was known about marin ceausescus career until he was 
listed as the director of the romanian presentation at the 14th 
international engineering fair in brno czechoslovakia in 1972 
in april 1974 he moved to vienna as chief of the romanian trade 
agency 
a man who answered the telephone at the romanian embassy said he 
was not authorized to answer any questions about ceausescu and 
added that no one else was available for comment 
the austria press agency said the embassy in the last few days 
had repeatedly said ceausescu was not there 
in its edition today the vienna daily kurier reported that a 
spokesman for the trade mission had claimed ceausescu had traveled 
to bucharest out of concern for his family particularly his 
daughters gabriela and mihaela 
kurier referring to unspecified sources in the new romanian 
government alleged ceausescu managed the romanian secret service 
headquarters for western europe in vienna 
there was no additional information to corroborate the claim 
and the report could not be independently verified 
nicolae ceausescu was executed with his wife elena on monday 
after he was found guilty of grave crimes during his harsh 
24year rule the communist dictator was toppled friday after a 
popular uprising that began dec 15

steel security gates built across downing street 
to block the entry to the official residence of prime minister 
margaret thatcher do not fit photographs published today suggest 
a chain and padlock holding the gates together was published in 
the guardian newspaper 
but a spokesman for the property services agency the body which 
deals with government property said work hasnt finished on the 
10foot tall gates 
these gates have been put into position but final adjustments 
will not be made until next week which was always the timetable 
for this job he said speaking anonymously in keeping with 
british custom 
you get so far with the job and then you send your technicians 
in to finish it off they will come next week it is not therefore 
true to say that the gates dont fit it is much ado about 
nothing 
the gates are backed up by a steel screen designed to spring up 
from the road in the path of any attacker 
downing street used to be open to anyone to wander along for a 
look at the modest building housing the head of government crowds 
would collect at times of comings and goings for government changes 
and over many years a man turned up every day to kneel in the 
street to pray for the prime minister 
all that is now over 
the street was first closed off by a waisthigh wooden barrier 
and police guards eight years ago when the irish republican army 
was conducting a bombing campaign in britain to back its struggle 
to end british rule in northern ireland 
the iron gates which have now replaced the wooden barrier were 
designed by architect steve pashnam and have been criticized by 
other architects and by conservationists for their size they also 
have been the butt of jokes by political opponents of mrs thatcher 
who say she wants the barrier to protect her from public opposition 
to her policies 
the guardian said completion of the gates marks the final 
abolition of what was a public right of way for 200 years 
the street is named after sir george downing who built the 
culdesac of brick row houses in 1680

a food store chain is hoping that the unblinking 
stares of three police officers will deter shoplifting even if the 
cops are only 6foot cardboard cutouts 
the police officers stationed in kroger stores this week are 
lifesize and look pretty real but theyre scarecrooks operating 
on the same principle as scarecrows 
police in london noticed a decrease in shoplifting after they 
put up cardboard bobbies in stores dallas police lt aj 
dalessandro said wednesday 
kroger put officer cutouts made from photos of three dallas 
police officers in three stores in dallas and move them around 
each month after three months kroger plans to review the campaign 
to see whether it has been as successful as its british inspiration 
im pretty sure well have some success dalessandro said 
this campaign can be a limitedtime success but well move the 
officers around to other stores the people will be faced with a 
different officer and theyll be startled again 
the cutouts portray officers in uniform in natural poses a sign 
at the cutouts feet reads shoplifting is a crime 
police cpl chip bulin appeared satisfied with the lifesize 
cardboard photograph of himself also pictured are cpls robert 
garcia and rodney woods 
the cutouts are placed in areas conducive to theft tyner said 
bulins likeness was in the cosmetics department woods guarded 
cigarette cartons batteries and the automated teller machine 
garcias cutout was placed near soda machines 
the photos at dalessandros request were shot straight on 
to make it appear that wherever you move they are looking at 
you 
charlie tyner security supervisor for kroger said the store is 
not trying to fool anyone with the cardboard cops 
but its a startling way to say the same old message that 
shoplifting is a crime he said

the gun collection program set up by 
us armed forces to sweep panama city clean of illegal weapons has 
been a huge success maybe too much so 
one person turned in a beautiful antique flintlock musket at 
least 150 years old with brass handle handcarved wooden stock 
and loading tools including what looked like a wooden mallet 
all of it fit snugly in special compartments of a soft leather 
case lined with red velvet 
i tell them that this kind of stuff is worth far more than the 
100 we give them for a pistol said army sgt tim harper of the 
193rd brigade stationed at fort clayton on the outskirts of panama 
city near the canal 
but apparently the people would rather have the cash than an 
old oddlooking musket that shoots lead balls which in any case 
may just have been acquired in the looting that destroyed the 
citys main shopping avenue 
most panamanians however have been bringing in regular stuff 
soviet designed ak47 automatic rifles belgianmade fal assault 
rifles the snipers weapon harper said hand and 
rocketpropelled grenades as well as light antitank weapons 
dynamite and even teargas grenades 
that doesnt include the exotic guns that harper said he 
wasnt actually expecting to get uzi submachine guns 
americanmade m60 machine guns and lots and lots of 
ammunition 
its a gun lovers paradise said harper of allen park 
mich as he surveyed hundreds of weapons in small piles lying on 
exercise mats covering the entire floor of ancon gym 
by paying cash for weapons brought in to four special collection 
points the us military is trying to lessen the chances that they 
could fall into the hands of diehards from gen manuel antonio 
noriegas disbanded defense forces 
authorities pay 25 for each hand grenade brought in 100 for 
pistols 125 for shotguns 150 for automatic rifles 150 for 
mines on items not outlined in the payoff schedule harper 
bargains 
bazookas for example go for about the same as an automatic 
rifle teargas grenades are negotiable but closer to the price 
for regular hand grenades 
an army official said today that 150000 had been paid for 
2208 weapons turned in by 721 people 
harper said the weapons would eventually probably be returned to 
panamas new government which was sworn in dec 20 when the united 
states invaded to oust noriega members of the defense forces who 
surrender are screened and incorporated into a new armed force that 
includes police and security 
already some are performing tasks alongside us troops and 
taking over police duties such as directing traffic 
armed with their regular weapons the panamanian forces also are 
patrolling streets and guarding government buildings looking for 
looters and the occassional sniper 
at ancon gym about 100 panamanians lined up late wednesday 
afternoon to collect their money some said they had been there 
since morning when they turned in weapons 
most people interviewed said they had found them in the

angry officials say inspectors have found 
safety violations in half the highrise construction cranes 
operating in the city a month after a crane collapse killed five 
people 
inspectors ordered two more cranes shut down wednesday bringing 
to five the number of cranes ordered to stop work by the california 
occupational safety and health administration in most cases the 
cranes were allowed to go back into operation after violations were 
corrected 
two other construction cranes were found to be in proper order 
while the other three cranes in use at highrise construction sites 
around the city have not yet been inspected officials said 
mayor art agnos who requested calosha to do the inspections 
after the nov 28 disaster promised to seek stricter supervision 
of the machines warning careless operators that were coming 
after you 
he said he would tell other mayors throughout the state of the 
result of the inspections and hoped that together they could 
pressure the state legislature for stricted regulation 
calosha inspectors on wednesday shut down a skyscraper crane at 
a construction site because the operator lacked equipment to test 
for unsafe loads they shut down another crane because of 
improperly set safety devices said calosha spokesman rick rice 
our feeling is one of being upset and very surprised rice 
said 
on tuesday calosha shut down a crane because it lacked a 
required warning light and bell to tell workers of dangerously 
heavy loads inspectors citing similar problems earlier shut down 
two other cranes 
a huge tower crane was being raised from the 16th to the 20th 
floor of a financial district skyscraper on nov 28 when it fell to 
the pavement killing the operator and four other people the 
accident is still under investigation 
state inspectors do not regularly examine tower cranes 
generally relying on the owners and operators of the equipment to 
certify them as safe 
agnos at a news conference criciticized the practice as 
unacceptable and comparing it to a system that allows the fox 
to guard the chickens 
both the state legislature and the san francisco city government 
are considering measures to tighten regulation of crane operators

us sen dave durenberger signed backdated 
real estate partnership documents to justify collecting living 
expense reimbursements from the senate in 1983 according to a 
published report today 
the star tribune of minneapolis said the backdating made it 
appear that the minnesota republicans partnership with a local 
businessman was operating as the official owner of his minneapolis 
condominium in mid1983 when in fact legal documents were not 
drawn up until months later apparently in the spring of 1984 
durenbergers chief of staff bert mckasy said an oral 
partnership agreement between durenberger and roger scherer had 
been reached in 1983 and that backdating official documents is 
done in that kind of circumstance 
what in fact happened was that in july of 1983 mr scherer 
and the senator agreed to form a business partnership and their 
lawyers did not reduce the partnership to writing until sometime in 
december of that year mckasy said 
the backdating was disclosed in documents durenberger filed 
voluntarily with the senate rules committee last week 
durenberger sold his downtown minneapolis condominium to a 
partnership in which he was a member and later to a company owned 
by his former campaign manager in both instances he continued to 
live there but used senate expense account funds to pay his rent 
according to previous reports durenberger collected at least 
9947 in living expense payments from the senate for time spent in 
minneapolis from july 1983 to june 1987 
durenberger has asked the senate rules committee to review the 
propriety of using his senate expense account to pay rent for his 
condominium and has said he will repay any improper expenditures 
the rules committee staff believes that the senator apparently 
did not violate senate rules with his deal but tentatively 
determined that questions about the matter should be referred to 
the senate ethics committee 
the ethics committee already is investigating a book deal in 
which durenberger made 100000 between 1984 and 1986 and trips to 
boston in 1987 paid for by lobbyists 
durenberger apologized to minnesotans at a news conference last 
week saying he did nothing illegal but acknowledging mistakes and 
lapses of judgment 
state sen bill luther announced wednesday that he and other 
democrats will ask the senate ethics committee to investigate the 
condo arrangement including the backdating of documents 
it appears that the deed has actually been backdated in order 
to justify payments that were made out of the public treasury 
luther said 
according to the star tribune deeds turning over the 
durenberger condo to the partnership are dated july 28 1983 they 
were notarized by hennepin county commissioner randall johnson 
then a legal adviser to durenbergers campaign 
however documents durenberger turned over to the rules 
committee indicate that as of march 1984 durenberger had not 
signed documents setting up the partnership he signed them 
sometime in mid1984 and dated them july 1983 to reflect an oral 
agreement made in 1983 with scherer the newspaper said 
senate records show durenberger began filing for reimbursement 
for rent in august 1983 
in a dec 28 1983 letter to durenberger which he gave to the 
rules panel johnson told him it is important that you conclude 
the condominium transaction in order to justify the perdiem 
perday reimbursement you received during the august recess he 
added everything should be dated before aug 1 reflecting the 
oral agreement between you and roger 
on may 15 1984 a deed signed by durenberger notarized by 
johnson and dated july 28 1983 was filed at the hennepin county 
courthouse the star tribune said 
johnson declined to comment because the matters concern a 
relationship with a client the newspaper said 
because minnesota law requires a written document to make 
property transfers valid durenberger would still have been the 
legal owner of his condominium in august 1983 when he began filing 
for reimbursement under the partnership arrangement that had not 
yet been signed the star tribune said 
four months later durenberger filed papers with the senate 
changing his official minnesota residence to avon his familys 
hometown retroactive to july 28 1983 the newspaper said

a fake bomb discovered on the desk of a 
city council member has touched off a police investigation 
authorities said but the council member says the whole thing was a 
joke that was blown out of proportion 
police chief john scagno said wednesday officers are 
investigating the discovery of a lookalike bomb on jay j armes 
desk tuesday evening city hall was evacuated after a custodian 
spotted the device about 6 pm 
the realisticlooking bomb had seven sticks of wood wrapped with 
waxed paper used on actual sticks of dynamite and a working mercury 
switch that caused lights to flash when the thing was tilted said 
lt dave hamrick a member of the polices bomb squad 
until we had a chance to check it out it looked very real 
hamrick said 
but armes says the bomb was a gag christmas gift from his 
adult son and that he brought it into his office to use as a clock 
tuesday morning armes said his son ordered the device through a 
magazine 
he accused the police of overreacting to the bomb because he has 
been feuding with scagno for months often questioning the chiefs 
competence at city council meetings 
this is the only way they can get back at jay armes armes 
said 
police deny they are seeking revenge this case is being 
handled like any other investigation said lt jr grijalva 
police spokesman 
earlier this month bombs killed a federal judge in alabama and 
a city council member in savannah ga and wounded a state judge 
in maryland other bombs were found before they exploded in 
jacksonville fla and atlanta el paso police officials said the 
fear created by those incidents was one reason they evacuated city 
hall when the bomb was found tuesday 
in texas making or possessing a device that causes somebody to 
believe it is an actual bomb or causes emergency officials to 
respond is a class a misdemeanor 
scagno said his department will turn over its investigation to 
the county attorneys office scagno said the attorneys office 
will decide if charges should be filed

resistant american doubters wondering whatever had happened to 
the evil empire

exxon corp alyeska pipeline service 
co and other defendants in more than 150 lawsuits resulting from 
the exxon valdez oil spill are asking that all evidence be kept 
secret until the cases go to trial 
the order requested earlier this month has come under fire 
from the state and other plaintiffs who contend that alaskas 
legislative responsibilities and the publics right to know demand 
release of such information 
superior court judge brian shortell is scheduled to rule on the 
secrecy order next month violating the secrecy order would result 
in contempt charges 
as requested by the oil companies the order would bar all 
parties from disclosing virtually anything learned during the 
discovery phase of the litigation 
it would apply to legal motions corporate records and sworn 
statements of company officials 
attorneys say the lawsuits may not go to trial for a decade and 
most probably will be settled out of court 
a secrecy order could prevent the public from learning exactly 
what caused the march 24 wreck of the exxon valdez or why efforts 
to contain and clean up the nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil 
from prince william sound failed 
even the state would be forbidden to disclose what it had 
learned about the spill critics of the request said that would 
impair the ability of lawmakers and environmental officials to do a 
better job of regulating the industry 
national wildlife federation president jay hair calls the 
proposed order a blatant and outrageous attempt to hide the facts 
from the american people 
these oil companies are terrified that the public could learn 
the complete details about what they have done he said 
john anderson a management consultant for exxon said release 
of large quantities of internal business records could result in 
disclosure of trade secrets even if the individual documents 
contained no secrets 
competitors could piece together millions of bits of 
information creating a mosaic of exxon operations that would 
betray trade secrets he said 
alyeska is owned by a consortium of seven oil companies that 
pump about 2 million barrels of oil a day to the valdez tanker 
terminal and into tankers 
all of the state court cases have been consolidated for pretrial 
motions and discovery the evidencegathering stage of a lawsuit 
plaintiffs in the cases range from the state of alaska which 
wants to prove exxon and alyeska were negligent in preparing for 
and responding to the spill to fishermen tourism companies and 
environmental groups 
the idea that this will all be done behind closed doors is 
unacceptable said dave oesting a counsel for the plaintiffs 
the state wants exxon and alyeska to prove confidentiality on a 
documentbydocument basis 
basically we just think this case is a uniquely public case 
and affects a broad section of the public virtually the entire 
state of alaska and the public does have a broad right to know 
what is going on said assistant attorney general craig tillery 
if exxon obtains a blanket secrecy order the state will seek an 
exception for the legislature and administration so they have 
access to make policy regarding future spills he said 
oil companies trade secrets are protected by state and federal 
rules of evidence but courts have ruled in several major cases 
such as the agent orange suits and claims against cigarette makers 
that the public has a right to know

banks reopened today the panama 
canal resumed 24hour operations and a us spokesman said nearly 
6 million in confiscated funds had been turned over to the new 
government of president guillermo endara 
the former strongman manuel antonio noriega remained inside 
the vatican embassy panamas archbishop the rev marcos mcgrath 
said several of noriegas associates left the embassy voluntarily 
in general the number has been getting lower and it will 
continue to do so mcgrath told reporters outside the vatican 
embassy he said some were leaving because there were no charges 
against them and others were negotiating with the new panamanian 
government 
a us justice department spokesman in washington when asked 
about the report that some had surrendered said i dont believe 
so 
but the spokesman david runkel said its possible there may 
have been one or more people who have left that may include 
children 
army lt col jerry murguia a spokesman for the us southern 
command said 582 million belonging to noriega had been 
confiscated and released to the panamanian government 
officials said the panama canal had returned to its regular 
24hour schedule and worked through the night the panama canal 
commission said 21 ships passed through wednesday 35 were 
scheduled to go through today and another 150 were waiting for 
transit 
the canal was closed for 48 hours after the united states 
invaded dec 20 and has been gradually increasing the hours of 
operation since then 
murguia also said panama citys international airport should be 
reopened by saturday it has been closed to commercial aviation 
since the invasion 
banks in this international financial center reopened throughout 
the nation with first vice president ricardo arias calderon 
appearing at a ceremony at the central bank 
endara in a news conference wednesday had appealed again to 
the vatican embassy to surrender noriega for trial on drug 
trafficking charges but the vatican today said it had received no 
formal request from the panamanian government and would not simply 
push noriega out and hand him over to us authorities 
we have not received any letter said joaquin navarro the 
vaticans chief spokesman 
in texas president bush said his administration was determined 
to bring noriega to the united states to stand trial but admitted 
that the vaticans stand complicated things 
the us invasion began dec 20 and noriega was on the run until 
appearing at the vatican embassy on sunday 
us troops armored cars and helicopters have stood watch 
outside around the clock to ensure he doesnt escape or get 
spirited away 
navarro said the vatican still hoped to resolve the crisis 
within days but he gave no details about negotiations 
he also declined to comment about a story in todays los angeles 
times in which the vatican embassy in panama reportedly authorized 
us forces to take necessary measures in the event that noriega or 
his associates take the vatican envoy or any other staff hostage 
the newspaper said the authorization has been interpreted by 
some us officials as an invitation to the united states to seize 
the ousted panamanian dictator from the embassy while others have 
said that isnt the case 
navarro said he couldnt comment on the report because he didnt 
know the source of information for the report 
panamas new government hustled to restore order screening 
members of noriegas disbanded defense forces and incorporating a 
growing number of them into a new armed force that includes police 
murguia told reporters today that lt col arnulfo castrejon 
left the embassy and was detained by us forces castrejon was the 
officer on duty at defense forces headquarters when panamanian 
forces fatally shot a us marine officer dec 16 in one of the 
principal incidents leading to the us invasion 
the us southern command said all but a few hundred of the 
15000 members of the defense forces had surrendered or been 
arrested 
the us justice department asked france switzerland 
luxembourg and britain to freeze bank accounts in which noriega is 
believed to have stashed more than 10 million in illegal drug 
money 
france froze accounts in two banks holding 33 million and 
swiss officials placed a precautionary freeze on two accounts 
the united states and the endara government which was elected 
in may balloting that noriega nullified renewed their pleas to the 
vatican to turn over the ousted military ruler 
us troops cannot go after noriega who was thought to be 
trying to negotiate safe passage to a third country because 
embassies are inviolable under international law 
noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in florida in 
february 1988 on charges of trafficking in colombian cocaine and 
money laundering 
the southern command said wednesday 23 american servicemen and 
two dependents have been killed and 322 americans wounded since the 
united states invaded it said 297 panamanians troops were killed 
and 123 wounded 
murguia cited an army surgeon as saying at least 250 civilians 
were killed that figure did not include others who were quickly 
buried in the first days of the invasion murguia said

if there were a truthinpackaging law for 
federal spending president bushs forthcoming budget proposal 
might have to carry this warning label this plan is optimistic 
at best and is likely to bear only a partial resemblance to 
reality 
bush is expected to propose 30 billion to 40 billion in 
savings when he submits his 12 trillion spending blueprint for 
fiscal 1991 in late january that would meet a requirement in the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law that the projected 1991 
shortfall not exceed 64 billion 
the numbers make the proposal sound like a tough attempt to mop 
up the governments red ink which has been about 150 billion 
annually for the last three years but a look back at how the 
administration and congress went about their budget work for this 
year is instructive in assessing how the plan for next year may be 
translated into reality 
white house and legislative budget writers began the year by 
agreeing to use a set of optimistic economic assumptions that let 
them shrink the size of the anticipated 1990 deficit 
by projecting 1990 economic growth of 34 percent and inflation 
of 35 percent both of which now seem rosey they were able to 
calculate lower government spending and higher revenues than are 
likely to occur look for a repetition of the ageold tactic next 
year 
fiscal planners were also able to take advantage of technical 
budget rules to chip away at their projections of red ink 
in one case the pentagon saved nearly 3 billion by 
shifting a payday from a monday in early october to a friday in 
late september the reason the new federal fiscal year begins oct 
1 
in another instance of the many billions of dollars the 
government expects to spend to bail out bankrupt savings and loan 
associations this year only about 14 billion of it will show up 
on the budget the reason bush and congress agreed that the bulk 
of the operation would be offbudget 
we did a better job than we have in most previous years in 
trying to achieve some deficit reduction but much of what we did 
was to redefine or take advantage of scorekeeping options that 
didnt give us real savings concedes rep bill frenzel of 
minnesota ranking republican on the house budget committee 
last february a month after outgoing president reagan submitted 
a proposed 1990 budget to congress president bush presented a 
116 trillion spending plan of his own 
bush said his blueprint would leave a 911 billion deficit 
well within the 100 billion target the grammrudman law required 
for fiscal 1990 which began last oct 1 it relied heavily on 
domestic program cuts user fees and new revenues bush believes 
would be generated by reducing the tax rate on capital gains 
the plan was shrugged off by congress which complained that 
bush failed to specify which domestic programs would be slashed 
serious budget work did not begin until april when administration 
officials and congressional leaders agreed to a plan that would 
reap a 994 billion shortfall 
but when congress adjourned for the year on nov 22 lawmakers 
and the white house had achieved less than half of what they had 
agreed to do the two sides shook hands in april on 28 billion 
worth of deficitcutting but in the end wrote only about 13 
billion of it into law 
the targets they set were modest says robert reischauer 
director of the nonpartisan congressional budget office which 
studies fiscal issues for lawmakers and they had a difficult 
time even coming to those targets 
indeed practically onethird of the 13 billion was not a true 
bite out of the deficit at all but rather bookkeeping tricks and 
changes in federal payment schedules 
budgetwriters claimed savings of 18 billion by not counting 
the money the postal service is likely to lose this year 800 
million by slowing the rate with which medicare claims are paid 
and 700 million by delaying for a year some of the payments 
federal retirees can collect 
they also took credit for saving 400 million by moving some 
assistance to farmers offbudget 250 million by accelerating the 
payment of gasoline and airline taxes to the government and 50 
million by delaying some federal payments to farmers 
few of the savings that were written into law were part of the 
april budget pact or bushs february budget 
the presidents coveted capital gains tax reduction was gone 
and 46 billion of the savings a third of the total came from 
letting indiscriminate cuts in most federal programs imposed by the 
grammrudman law remain in effect for the first 130 days of the 
fiscal year 
the threat of those automatic cuts has been seen since the 1985 
enactment of the law as a terrible alternative that would prod 
congress and the white house to work out a better deficitreduction 
deal now they could become a regular part of the budget process

alexander dubcek the former 
communist party chief ousted two decades ago for leading the 
prague spring reforms returned triumphantly to power today as 
speaker of czechoslovakias parliament 
in a political renaissance unimaginable only two months ago 
dubcek was elected unanimously by 269 deputies present out of the 
350member communistdominated federal assembly 
the newspaper vecerni praha today reported that the former 
prague communist party boss has been in custody since dec 23 under 
indictment on charges of abuse of power 
miroslav stepan oversaw police attacks on demonstrators in 
prague in november that sparked czechoslovakias peaceful 
revolution against its hardline communist leadership 
in the parliament dubcek shook hands quietly with a few 
colleagues and shuffled papers nervously during the vote 
this is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands of 
people who have upheld the ideals of the prague spring dubcek 
said in an address carried live on state tv 
in 1968 sovietled tanks and troops crushed dubceks reform 
movement and oversaw the installation of a hardline communist 
leadership that ruled until the peaceful uprising began nov 17 
dubcek praised the revolution and said it was inspired by ideas 
that began in 1968 
earlier dubcek sat unsmiling before the parliament as deputy 
josef simuth praised dubcek as a man who showed courage and 
resolve in making a personal sacrifice for truth 
simuth who represents the slovak district of uhrovce where 
dubcek was born 68 years ago said the current democraic revolution 
is an outgrowth of the liberal reforms championed by dubcek 
dubcek was among 23 new deputies elected by parliament today to 
replace hardliners and serve until free elections next year 
among the new deputies were at least five former dissidents who 
signed the human rights manifesto charter 77 
the 35omember federal assembly has been dominated for more than 
four decades by the communist party and the restructuring to 
take place today is the latest victory by the opposition that has 
overturned party control in the past two months 
communists will continue to hold a majority in the bicameral 
parliament although without many of the most rigid members 
of the 23 new deputies only one was a member of the communist 
party the rest were members of other smaller parties or were 
unaffiliated members of the opposition 
those named to fill the seats were agreed to during negotiations 
last week between the opposition the communist party and several 
other smaller political forces 
dubcek was ousted from power one year after the sovietled 
invasion in 1968 that crushed his prague spring reform movement 
the current speaker stanislav kukral resigned today 
the election will be a vindication of the humanistic reforms 
that dubcek tried to introduce as communist party secretary general 
in 1968 his hopes for liberalization and his political career were 
crushed under the invasion that ushered in 21 years of hardline 
communist rule 
dubcek was expelled from the party and sent to work as a 
forestry manager in bratislava 
on nov 24 he made a triumphant comeback speaking to 250000 
admirers gathered on pragues wenceslas square for a prodemocracy 
demonstration 
next to vaclav havel the opposition leader and sole 
presidential candidate dubcek is the second most potent symbol of 
reform in czechoslovakia and is the favorite son in his native 
slovakia 
havel said a condition of his accepting the presidency was that 
dubcek be somewhere close by my side 
on friday deputies will reconvene in special televised session 
at pragues hradcany castle to vote for president havel will be 
sworn in immediately afterward 
deputies began the session today by amending the presidential 
oath that havel will take eliminating a pledge of allegiance to 
socialism

livein couples who have put off 
marriage are rushing to wed before jan 1 because of a change in 
the deathbenefit law 
couples are flocking to churches and town halls to marry before 
the new rules come into effect in the new year at stake are 
widows pensions of up to 160 a month 
weve performed 100 civil marriage ceremonies daily since 
november weve had to hire extra staff stockholm city hall 
official anna barrett said thursday 
stockholm city hall registrars used to perform about 12 
marriages a week and only on fridays now they carry out six 
weddings every 30 minutes seven days a week couples chose between 
threeminute or 20second ceremonies 
a clerk at the two hearts goldsmiths said gold rings were in 
such demand that some couples had to get married without them 
some borrow our testrings for the occasion and get their own 
later she said 
at the lutheran parish of storkyrkan the big church in 
the medieval part of stockholm anna ekstrom said more than 50 
marriage ceremonies were performed this year compared with 35 in 
1988 
many swedish couples prefer to live together in commonlaw or 
sambo relationships cohabitation is socially accepted and 
children in such families have virtually the same legal status as 
children of married parents 
sambo is short for sammanboende which means people 
living together 
until now women who took part in such relationships qualified 
nearly automatically for supplementary pension benefits after their 
partners died 
under the new rules women who are under 45 years old and who 
have children will not receive the same benefits unless they have 
been legally married to their partners 
childless women in commonlaw relationships will continue to be 
eligible for supplementary death benefits but officials say many 
childless couples not fully understanding the new regulations are 
also rushing to get married 
maud gardelius of the national social insurance office said the 
new benefits rules have made couples see the financial side of 
romance 
they discovered that they were not protected in the old 
relationship this change has put a spotlight on the situation 
she said

work units began holding political meetings to instruct their 
employees not to let the ouster of romanias hardline president 
nicolae ceausescu shake their faith in socialism 
more plainclothes police were seen on beijings college 
campuses where several anonymous illegal posters have gone up in 
the past week mocking ceausescu and urging china to learn from 
romania 
at beijing university qinghua university beijing normal 
university and other colleges whose students led massive 
prodemocracy protests in beijing in the spring romania was the 
main topic of conversation with most students expressing joy over 
ceausescus ouster 
several chinese and western sources said students at two 
colleges planned marches to celebrate events in romania but were 
found out and stopped the reports could not be independently 
confirmed 
the beijing city government reiterated thursday that it or the 
central government must approve any gatherings or demonstrations in 
tiananmen square the focal point of the spring protests the 
central government recently approved a law making most 
demonstrations illegal

jiang zemin and top military and police officials met with the 
party committee of the peoples armed police an armed force 
separate from the army that is responsible for guarding state 
installations and putting down major disturbances

forth the line on romania stressing the need for sobriety and 
faith in socialism 
work units have begun holding special meetings on the subject 
teachers at the beijing normal university were called to such a 
meeting wednesday 
although students and foreign teachers said excitement over 
romania was high on campuses they noted that students are busy 
with endofterm exams and will begin leaving for winter vacation 
in a week reducing chances for any efforts at protests 
after initially maintaining silence on events in romania the 
official chinese media has reported ceausescus ouster and

the uprising or the mass arrests and killings of civilians by 
secret police but many chinese have heard such reports on foreign 
radio broadcasts

about 4800 residents who were evacuated 
after a propane explosion and fire were allowed to return to their 
homes this morning when firefighters extingished the remaining 
flames 
no injuries were reported at whiterodgers co when propane 
surged from a faulty tank and exploded shortly before 4 pm 
wednesday workers were evacuated and people who live within a mile 
of the plant were ordered from their homes said dale rust of the 
independence county office of emergency services 
officials in this town of 9000 lifted the evacuation order 
shortly after 8 am and by midday a skeleton staff of about 30 
had resumed work in the plants payroll and shipping operations 
dean kent vice president for human resources for the company 
said a small amount of vapor was still leaking from the 
38footlong tank it was not dangerous but it prevented 
investigators from immediately examining the tank 
until that completely goes out we wont be able to determine 
what happened kent said hopefully well find out what caused 
it and do what we can to prevent it from happening again 
the fire which had burned into the night ebbed this morning 
after workers managed to shut off one of the leaking valves that 
fed the flames mayor jim shirrell said 
were on our way said amy boister of batesville as she left 
a shelter set up in a church her husband lewis had two green 
pillowcases under one arm and a worn plaid sleeping bag under his 
other arm 
sheriffs officers began pulling back some of the roadblocks in 
the evacuated area at first only allowing residents living in 
areas farthest from the plant to return later everyone was 
allowed back to their homes 
workers using gas meters had determined that there were no 
significant propane vapors lingering at the plant or in the 
evacuated neighborhood while firefighters kept their hoses trained 
at the tanks to cool them 
earlier officials had expressed fears that the heat could set 
off blasts among other nearby tanks 
the explosion sent a large plume of smoke and fire into the sky 
over the town about 80 miles northeast of little rock 
ten state troopers were sent to the city to help control 
looting after independence county sheriff david hunter said there 
had been some reports of burglaries in the evacuated area 
were having people ripping us off out here hunter said 
emergency workers withdrew from the fire site about 9 pm after 
gas was detected in the air near the burning tank county judge 
david wyatt said the eight firefighters who had been battling the 
blaze retreated to batesville high school about a mile away 
they left three unmanned trucks with their hoses trained on the 
fire and adjacent tanks the mayor said each of the trucks pumped 
1000 gallons of water a minute 
we think weve got it stabilized right now it should burn 
itself out if it doesnt rupture and explode before then 
rust said were trying to keep the tanks cool to keep them from 
rupturing 
police erected roadblocks to keep people from entering the 
evacuated area emergency officials drove through some 
neighborhoods using loudspeakers to urge residents to leave 
the eight tanks at the plant contained about 12000 gallons of 
propane rust said which could inflict damage within a mile if it 
all exploded 
the fire was burning about 500 gallons of propane an hour he 
estimated 
several churches opened facilities to accommodate people forced 
from their homes rust said 
spokesmen at the citys three motels said they had rented nearly 
all of their total of 216 rooms about half of them to evacuees 
officials do not know what caused the tank to rupture and 
explode rust said 
the plant a division of emerson electric manufactures water 
heater and gas controls and employs about 1000 people

the white house said today the fate 
of ousted panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega is now in the 
hands of the vatican although president bushs spokesman said 
us troops surrounding the vatican embassy are prepared to move in 
if hostages are taken 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that the us 
position on noriega who is holed up in the panama city papal 
nunciature with several supporters remains the samewe believe 
that he is as an indicted person a criminal and not a poliical 
refugee in the normal sense of someone who seeks political asylum 
however the spokesman suggested negotiations on noriega remain 
delicate 
we continue to make our views known the vatican continues to 
consider this matter and we leave it to them to work this out as 
they see fit he said 
this matter is now in the hands of the vatican said 
fitzwater briefing reporters in corpus christi as bush enjoyed a 
hunting vacation on an isolated ranch near the south texas 
community of beeville 
asked about a reported letter from the papal representative in 
panama city saying us troops could go into the embassy if a 
hostage situation arose fitzwater said 
we have no indication there is trouble within the nunciature 
there are no hostages that were aware of 
but he added certainly would there be any danger there we 
would be prepared to offer assistance to help 
noriega has been in the vatican embassy since christmas eve 
fitzwater said that altough some noriega loyalists that had 
been in the embassy with noriega have been released to us 
authorities most of his cronies are still there 
fitzwater said that overall the situation is good and 
steadily improving in panama with the usbacked government of 
guillermo endara continuing to expand its control 
although bush has voiced continued determination to have noriega 
returned to the united states administration officials said 
privately that little headway has been apparent in prying noriega 
from the vatican embassy to face drug trafficking charges in the 
united states and they expressed some frustration at the pace of 
negotiations 
i want to see this man who is under indictment brought to 
justice for poisoning the children of the united states of america 
and people around the world bush said at a barbecue held in 
beeville wednesday night in his honor 
the president and fellow texan secretary of state james a 
baker iii are spending the next few days quail hunting on the 
10000acre ranch of william farish a wealthy houston oilman and 
longtime bush friend 
bush who has been coming to texas for a holiday season quail 
hunt annually for more than two decades thanked the crowd of more 
than 700 people for this homecoming 
fitzwater said bush was receiving briefings in writing and by 
phone on any developments in panama but otherwise intended to 
spend the day hunting 
look i dont make any cover im going to be enjoying myself 
and i think the american people understand that bush told 
reporters on his arrival at the corpus christi naval air station 
the president spent several hours fishing on nearby san jose 
island where he said he and baker caught about a halfdozen fish 
meanwhile justice department officials are planning to ask 
one or two more european countries to freeze bank accounts 
where noriega is thought to have hidden illegal drug profits 
spokesman david runkel said today 
similiar requests were made wednesday to the governments of four 
nations france luxembourg switzerland and the united kingdom 
runkel said those governments are cooperating 
authorities in france responded by freezing accounts in two 
banks holding 33 million under the names of noriega and members 
of his families swiss officials placed a precautionary freeze 
on two accounts in banks in zurich and geneva 
speaking to reporters in corpus christi bush congratulated 
romanias new president ion iliescu and said he was amazed and 
respectful of the changes there 
my concern is for tranquility and freedom in romania bush 
said 
he declined to criticize harshly the quick executions of former 
dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife adding we did say that 
we were concerned that the trial of ceausescu should have been more 
open but thats their matter

fourteen mothers who were once on 
welfare have found jobs doing what they know best being moms 
the women have been taken off government assistance and receive 
21000 annual salaries for being foster mothers to disabled 
children under a state program called life or living in family 
environments 
these women are capable of doing something but for the most 
part theyre best at being moms and theyre happy being moms 
said state rep shirley johnson who helped win funding for the 
program 
i was scared to death at the beginning how would you match 
the right mom with the right child but it has worked beautifully 
the 3yearold program which operates primarily on a 200000 
grant from the state department of mental health was the idea of 
mounir sharobeem president of the judson center in royal oak a 
detroit suburb the center helps abused and neglected children and 
disabled adults 
instead of stereotyping welfare recipients as lazy lets 
train the families let them select a developmentally disabled 
child and use their time and energy more effectively sharobeem 
said 
people said we would be endangering handicapped children by 
putting them with welfare families but these families have been 
doing a great job with them and its not easy 
sharobeem said one disabled child in an institution costs the 
mental health department 45000 a year a welfare family of four 
costs the department of social services 16000 a year 
the children are also given more personal care inside a home 
even though most of the mothers are single parents sharobeem said 
the mothers are screened and licensed by the judson center and 
receive training in caring for disabled children said diane 
devineabdullah life director 
they go through a sevenday 28hour training then 20 hours 
home training in a current foster home devineabdullah said 
we have four more families ready and waiting for placement 
the mothers are then matched with children from michigan 
institutions the average age of most of the children is between 15 
and 16 devineabdullah said 
dss director c patrick babcock said the state is looking to 
expand the program but johnson said budget constraints wont allow 
a fullscale program 
one mother darlene gisel of warren cares for 11monthold 
william who was born with tuberculosis of the brain the condition 
was stabilized but could result in a learning disability or 
retardation 
he was in the hospital six months before i took him gisel 
said he didnt respond at all hes gotten farther than they 
ever thought he would 
theres a lot of joy in watching them grow these are kids who 
probably wouldnt have had a chance in life 
gisel said her mother also was a foster mom and worked with 
handicapped children 
i knew i wanted to deal with handicapped kids she said 
they need a little more of a chance i think we can show that 
they can learn and they can live a normal life with a disability 
mothers in the life program also find that the salary allows 
them to provide more for their own children 
bertha crawford is foster mother to dorothy 17 who cant dress 
herself and cant talk crawford also has two highschoolage 
children of her own 
i feel good about helping someone else crawford said it 
also gave me the chance to send my daughter on her senior trip i 
couldnt have afforded it without the program

president bush is completing plans to have the 
us military interdict drug supply routes from latin america the 
white house said today a defense official said one proposal 
includes drawing a much much tighter noose around colombia 
with a virtual air and sea blockade 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed that final plans 
are now being made to interdict supply routes in south and 
parts of central america but he offered no specifics 
the overall program is evolving from proposals that senior 
military commanders submitted to defense secretary dick cheney he 
in turn relayed them to the white house 
fitzwater speaking with reporters today in corpus christi 
texas confirmed that bush is mapping plans to use the us 
military to disrupt the drug supply routes from latin america 
we have decided to take certain actions to help the countries 
of latin america interdict those supply routes he said we are 
anxious to work closely with colombia whatever actions we would 
undertake in this regard will be done with the closest consultation 
with them and coordination with them 
bush is slated to attend an antidrug summit in colombia in 
february 
although the militarys interdiction operation could be launched 
before the summit the senior defense official declined to offer a 
startup date for the maneuver 
its supposed to be a bigtime operation said the official 
who spoke on condition on anonymity we want to make it 
impossible for any drugs to come out of there by air or sea 
the operation would involve positioning an aircraft carrier 
battle group and its accompanying air wing off the caribbean coast 
of the south american country the source said in a recent 
interview 
the pentagon official stressed that there would be no question 
of us military shooting down planes flown by suspected drug 
dealers 
there are no plans to start blowing people out of the sky 
the official said the role would be one of support and focus on 
forming a much much tighter noose 
the official said the plan was being formulated in cooperation 
with the colombian government and is not designed to impede the 
export of legal products 
the official cautioned there were problems involved in such an 
effort first of all he said the plan could be delayed because 
the us militarys attention has been diverted by the panama 
invasion 
and one weak link in the massive operation could be the 
handoff to colombian authorities who are expected to take up the 
enforcement role he said 
in addition the official pointed out because the drug problem 
is so pervasive the drug lords most certainly will choose more 
land routes to move their illicit products 
theyve got a lot of money and theyre not fools the 
official said we know this is a hydraulic problem no sooner do 
you squeeze and close off one route than it spurts out through 
another 
the official said the plan could be altered by the president 
the maneuver targets colombia because that country is one of 
the major flow points for drugs we are proposing a virtual air 
and sea blockade the official said 
the navy will play the key role in the operation the official 
said because of its ability to put airborne warning and control 
planes e2c hawkeyes in the air from carriers 
such planes with saucerlike radar equipment mounted on their 
frames are able to keep tabs on drugsmuggling suspects in planes 
or ships because they can track surface and air targets over a wide 
region 
the antidrug summit is slated to be held in cartagena a port 
city 680 miles north of bogota it is located in a medellin cartel 
stronghold in a country ravaged by bombings and assassinations 
since colombian president virgilio barco declared war on the drug 
traffickers three months ago 
peru has decided to resume joint antidrug operations with the 
united states a week after canceling the activities as a protest of 
the us military intervention in panama us and peruvian 
officials said wednesday 
the peruvian embassy said joint operations resumed because the 
fight against drugs is so important last week peru also 
canceled plans to participate in the summit

a strong earthquake today crumbled 
buildings and homes in this southeastern city killing at least 11 
people and injuring more than 120 officials said the army was 
called in to help prevent looting 
some reports said as many as 30 people died in newcastle an 
industrial hub of 500000 people about 75 miles north of sydney 
hundreds of thousands of homes were reported without electricity 
and phone service was cut off an insurance official estimated 
damage at 1 billion 
rescue workers frantically hunted for victims in the rubble 
severe damage was reported 
the quake which measured 55 on the richter scale struck at 
1028 am and lasted 45 seconds police said it was the first in 
australian history to strike a heavily populated area 
it felt like there was someone under my bedroom floor who 
lifted the house said one newcastle resident who reported two 
aftershocks 
the worst damage appeared to be at the newcastle workers club 
where drinkers relaxing after nightshift work were crushed by 
collapsed walls police said at least eight people died there 
police spokesman simon latimer said police recovered five bodies 
and were working to free three others 
there could be at least another six still trapped in the 
building latimer said 
it just shook and everything just caved in the walls caved 
in everything inside the club piping machines going down every 
way an eyewitness at the workers club told broadcasters 
the room just shook everybody just got thrown onto the floor 
it went black we were all told to get out there was a bomb in 
there 
three people were killed in a suburban shopping center when they 
were hit by bricks and awnings from shops latimer said police 
said 122 people were injured 
police inspector kenneth holmes commanding the police rescue 
operation said he expected the death toll to rise 
i saw at least six people lying in the road said a shocked 
emergency worker in the city as we looked back we could see 
destruction all around us the second story of the carpark also 
gave way bringing the structure down and crushing scores of cars 
prime minister bob hawke visited the scene and condemned reports 
of widespread looting in the business section he warned that 
looters would be punished 
latimer said 200 soldiers were called into the city and to the 
suburb of hamilton to help police patrols medical crews were 
airlifted from sydney for the emergency 
newcastle australias sixthlargest city also is a major coal 
mining center but there were no immediate reports of any miners 
trapped or injured underground 
the insurance council of australia put damages at 1 billion 
council chief john westmore described the figure as a very early 
estimate 
many buildings were reduced to rubble the newcastle hospital 
reported major structural damage and doctors treated the injured on 
the grass outside 
ambulances are reporting lots of devastation lots of damage 
lots of injuries a spokeswoman for the child care organization 
was quoted as saying by the australian associated press 
the quake was felt across new south wales australias most 
populous state there was a short jolt in sydney but the temblor 
lasted 45 seconds in some places newcastle and the adjoining 
hunter valley wine growing region were hardest hit 
vicki klein a seismologist at the australian seismological 
center in the federal capital of canberra said if the quake had 
struck right in sydney it would have brought down highrise 
buildings they are simply not built to withstand something of this 
magnitude 
bureau of mineral resources associate director peter cook said 
the quake was unusually large for australia and warned of 
aftershocks 
a quake measuring 55 on the richter scale can cause 
considerable damage the scale is a gauge of the energy released by 
an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
in canberra a spokesman for the australian seismological center 
put the quakes epicenter at 50 miles northwest of sydney 
the australian broadcasting corp said hundreds of thousands of 
homes lost electricity as a result of the quake 
many homes banks shops and stores have been demolished 
its report said there is severe damage 
a traffic control officer said sydneys harbor bridge shook for 
three seconds during the quake he said the windows desks and 
computer screens in the office built into the bridge shook 
the quake was the second disaster to hit australia during the 
christmas season last week a bus crash claimed 36 lives the 
countrys worst road crash 
in london queen elizabeth ii offered sympathy to relatives of 
the victims and said she was praying for rescuers searching for

the army ordered an investigation into the 
shooting of four palestinian youths who reportedly were fired on 
early thursday as they drove a donkey cart to market in the gaza 
strip 
the youths age 12 to 16 were among 10 palestinians reported 
shot and wounded by troops in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip the 12yearold boy was in serious condition 
in the west bank city of nablus a leaflet signed by plo chief 
yasser arafats fatah faction called for a halt to the killing of 
accused collaborators with israel and said only arafat had 
authority to order such slayings 
the slayings of 163 palestinians by fellow arabs during the 
2yearold uprising have prompted israeli charges that arafat is 
using the label collaborators to get rid of political 
opponents palestinians deny the accusation 
at least 640 palestinians have been killed by israelis during 
the revolt and 43 israelis have been slain 
thursdays shooting of four palestinians by soldiers came 
shortly after 330 am in gaza city 
an army spokesman said an initial report indicated soldiers 
opened fire on four masked palestinians it said the palestinians 
were barricading a road refused orders to halt and ignored warning 
shots in the air 
but the spokesman who was not identified under army 
regulations said an investigation was ordered into whether 
soldiers acted properly following arab reports the four victims 
were driving a cart to a wholesale vegetable market 
one of the youths said neither he nor his companions were 
wearing masks but that one of the wounded youths ran away in fear 
as the soldiers approached 
arab reporters said the 16 year old who was driving the cart 
went to the market each morning to pick up vegetables to sell door

condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and stomach

protest the army said he was wearing a mask 
an army statement said one youth was shot when soldiers opened 
fire at the eight palestinians who were armed with axes and ran 
away despite orders to halt and warning shots 
army regulations allow soldiers to open fire at the legs of 
masked men if they disregard such warnings and flee 
the fatah plea against killing suspected collaborators came 
after earlier leaflets by plobacked uprising leaders failed to 
stop such killings especially in nablus where masked attackers 
have shot stabbed or beaten to death 20 palestinians 
in the name of the brother the leader the president yasser 
arafat we call on national forces and all our organizational units 
to stop immediately and finally the killings of collaborators 
said the leaflet signed by the fatah unit in nablus

to issue a decree to execute collaborators it said arafat was 
named president of the selfdeclared palestinian state by the plos 
parliament in november 1988

rebels fighting for 14 years to turn 
ethiopia into a stalinist state claim to have captured three key 
towns and are making perhaps their biggest push yet against the 
foundering governments dispirited forces 
the rebels claim to be battling the marxist governments troops 
along the nations main northsouth highway and are fighting within 
100 miles of the capital of addis ababa western diplomats said 
thursday 
the escalating bloodshed comes as a devastating drought 
threatens to bring famine to 4 million people most of them in 
northern ethiopia where the rebels are based 
the rebels the tigre peoples liberation front say that in the 
last 10 days they have captured the garrison town of debre tabor in 
northwest gonder province and the towns of rabel and mehal meda in 
shoa province 
addis ababa is located in shoa province 
those battles the insurgents said have caused the government 
nearly 3000 dead wounded or captured soldiers 
diplomats in addis ababa say the claims appear to be true and 
that the rebels now are in control of the 25mile road from debre 
tabor to lake tana source of the blue nile 
they say the rebels also are continuing their southern push in 
shoa and are battling government troops along the main northsouth 
highway around debre sine 100 miles northeast of addis ababa 
it obviously looks like things are hotting up said one of 
the diplomats all of whom spoke in telephone interviews from addis 
ababa and requested anonymity but whats going to happen no one 
knows 
the rebels claimed the battle for debre tabor where the 
government garrison has been increased to 10000 to 15000 troops 
was the beginning of a government counteroffensive to drive the 
rebels back 
however the diplomats were doubtful the government could muster 
much resistance 
i dont think were looking at much of a government 
counteroffensive at all if theyre even capable of making one 
said one diplomat the government hasnt succeeded in pushing 
them back to any degree 
the source said president mengistu haile mariams army 
disorganized and dispirited after a failed armyled coup attempt in 
may had been reinforced by hundreds of thousands of poorly trained 
conscripts of dubious quality 
i think the best they might be able to do is hold the rebels 
in position he said 
the tigrean rebels began their offensive in august after joining 
forces with a smaller rebel group the ethiopia peoples democratic 
movement 
they control all of their home province tigre and have made 
significant advances into tigres southern neighbor wollo in the 
last two months they also have moved into gonder and shoa provinces 
theyve proven to be much stronger much more coherent than 
they were believed to be several months ago said one of the 
diplomats theyve basically rolled over one government position 
after another 
the tigrean rebels have been fighting for 14 years to topple 
mengistus marxist government they themselves are marxists who say 
they want a government modeled after albanias harsh 
stalinistleninist rule 
mengistus government and the rebels have held two rounds of 
preliminary peace talks the last of which ended dec 19 in rome 
with both sides agreeing to meet in march 
however the peace talks dont appear to be going very far 
now said a diplomat who pointed out that the latest offensive 
began immediately after the negotiating sessions ended 
he said there was speculation that the tigrean rebels had 
launched their onetwo attack in gonder and northern shoa in 
coordination with another rebel group the eritrean peoples 
liberation front 
the diplomat said sources in the capital understood the eritrean 
front was planning an offensive in their province of eritrea and 
that the tigre rebels were effectively pinning down government 
forces in preparation for that attack 
the eritrean rebels who have been fighting a 28year 
secessionist battle for eritrea ethiopias northernmost province 
fought their last major offensive in mid1988 that push also was 
coordinated with the tigre rebels and resulted in the eritrean 
rebels gaining much of eritrea 
in addition to the fighting the united nations says northern 
ethiopia is again the scene of drought and famine 
on wednesday the united nations called for an international 
relief operation of major proportions and appealed for 700000 
tons of food to prevent a repeat of the 198485 famine that killed 
an estimated 1 million 
relief agencies have so far unsuccessfully appealed to the 
rebels and ethiopias government to agree on air and ground 
corridors through which supplies can move unhindered by fighting

ruckus get arrested and spend one of floridas coldest nights in a 
warm jail cell 
but police say the unemployed roofer went too far and now faces 
up to five years in prison and a 5000 fine 
cooper 36 who has lived in several florida cities since moving 
from the north in september said he came up with the idea of 
getting arrested saturday night while sitting in a grocery store in 
this orlando suburb 
i figured i would get arrested for disturbing the peace 
cooper said i did not want to get arrested for doing anything 
violent 
because of a power failure police were directing traffic at the 
busy intersection near the store cooper walked into the road 
refused to leave and wound up hitting an officer in the mouth 
during a scuffle police said 
he was charged with battery on an officer and resisting arrest 
with violence 
cooper denied hitting the officer claiming that he himself was 
punched in the head 
he said that before the scuffle he asked police to take him to 
jail but that they refused 
no way in the world i would even think about hitting a police 
officer he said thursday from jail 
police lt butch yelvington said cooper never asked police for 
their help officers would have tried to get him transportation to 
a shelter if he had yelvington said all he asked for was to go 
to jail he said 
cooper whose next court appearance is in midjanuary said i 
guess my idea backfired i had no idea i would have to spend this 
much time in jail

people who have upheld the ideals of political pluralism and 
individual freedom dubcek told legislators after he was 
unanimously elected by the 269 deputies present 
the televised vote by the communistdominated 350member federal 
assembly for a man ousted and banished by authorities would have 
been unimaginable just two months ago 
dubceks political renaissance is just the latest in a series of 
historic political victories for czechoslovakias prodemocracy 
movement since midnovember it has ousted the hardline communist 
leadership and installed a reform government dominated by 
noncommunists

taken by havel to eliminate the pledge of allegiance to socialism 
in his acceptance speech before parliament dubcek praised the 
peaceful revolution as a continuation of the reforms that began in 
1968 and were crushed by a sovietled invasion 
the deep changes in society have resulted in my return to 
responsible work in the highest legislative body in the land 
dubcek said the autumn of 1989 developed the ideals of the 
prague spring of 1968 and inspires our nation today toward new 
creative actions 
after the sovietled invasion dubcek was ousted as communist 
party chief expelled from the party and sent to work as a forestry 
manager in bratislava where he was kept under police surveillance 
although renowned abroad he was excluded from the statecontrolled 
media in czechoslovakia 
he recaptured the spotlight nov 24 speaking to 250000 
prodemocracy demonstrators on pragues wenceslas square 
next to havel dubcek is the second most powerful symbol of

romanians still learning to openly 
question their government said thursday they are nervous about the 
number of former communists leading their revolution 
less than a week after communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was 
overthrown captured and executed by a popular revolt romanians 
are sure of only one thing they wont turn back 
we will continue the revolution until we get democracy said 
valentin hornicar who was with the student protesters occupying 
the communist partys central committee building 
we want a real democracy with a government and an opposition 
there is no way back we suffered too much he said 
romanias interim government is a group of intellectuals 
dissidents and disaffected former communist officials who call 
themselves the national salvation committee 
the committee has promised free elections by april and has 
repealed some of ceausescus most repressive laws 
i dont trust this government because it includes communists 
they turned once they could turn again said hornicar 26 
this is the symbol of power in this country he said 
gesturing to the massive central committee building 
we want the government to come here and say who elected 
them hornicar said they think that if they change some of 
ceausescus hated laws that will be enough it is not enough 
others offered support to the interim government but tempered it 
with concern about former communists in its ranks 
not all the people have made up their minds on this thing 
said aurel palea a computer technician 
i trust this government he said but there are communist 
members in this government we only hope they want to help and to 
make something for this country 
the national salvation committee decided at a meeting last night 
to separate government from political functions with the committee 
itself acting as a makeshift legislature western diplomats said 
the diplomats who asked not to be further identified said the 
fluid membership of the committee originally consisting of 37 
people had been expanded to 101 including representatives from 
all of romanias 40 regions 
the committee includes some prominent excommunists who had been 
ousted or demoted for criticizing ceausescu they include newly 
chosen president ion iliescu former foreign minister corneliu 
manescu and silviu brucan former ambassador to the united states 
another leading member is dumitru mazilu a diplomat under house 
arrest for most of the last two years because he refused to doctor 
a report for the un human rights commission in geneva 
other prominent members are grassroots dissidents such as 
university professor doina cornea clergyman laszlo toekes and poet 
mircea dinescu 
but even dinescu was a member of the communist party until last 
spring 
diplomats note that communist party membership was virtually 
automatic for anybody in leading positions 
the communists are compromised communism made it to power 
with terrorism and now it must be destroyed everywhere the people 
will not be fooled again said gheorghe tagarta 40 
but university librarian ion visoiu said in romania everyone had 
to be a communist of a sort just to work 
you cant compare us with the other eastern european countries 
that have changed they did it more slowly their opposition was 
better organized 
structurally we are still peasants we still think like 
peasants we will make a lot of political mistakes but in time we 
will have a good thing he said 
visoiu said he has confidence in iliescu and the new government 
and he said it is trying to recruit the best experts to run the 
country 
my worry is that the enthusiasm of the moment will pass too 
soon visoiu said

only 42 percent of south 
africas black high school seniors passed their final exams the 
lowest rate since 1962 and only one of 190081 youths who took the 
tests got an a average the government said thursday 
bernhard louw directorgeneral of the department of education 
and training described the results as unsatisfactory among 
the causes he said were a rapid growth in the number of black 
pupils and the lingering effects of classroom boycotts that were 
widespread during nationwide political unrest in 198486 
a total of 74249 black students passed the exams last month 
including 17553 who did well enough to qualify for automatic 
admission to universities louw said last year 54 percent of 
170966 black exam takers passed including 27865 who qualified 
for university admission and in 1987 the overall pass rate was 
563 
the most recent year with a lower pass rate was 1962 when only 
910 black students took the exams and 60 percent failed 
nationwide exam results for south africas three other official 
race groups white indian and mixedrace have not yet been 
released but in transvaal the most populous province 969 
percent of the white students and 727 of the mixedrace students 
passed the exams 
louw said one reason for the poor results at black schools was a 
new grading policy aimed at ensuring that students from all race 
groups were graded by identical standards in the past louw said 
officials overseeing black education set their own grading 
regulations 
in view of the drastic effect of this policy louw said the 
government has ordered an urgent indepth analysis of the 
examination results 
louw said several other factors contributed to the poor test 
results including an average annual increase in school enrollment 
of 13 percent in recent years 
many teachers and administrators lack the experience to deal 
effectively with the problems flowing from the provision of 
education to such a large number of pupils often under very 
difficult conditions he said 
he said a period of relative tranquility at schools in recent 
months was not enough to compensate for losses in groundwork 
suffered over a period of years when severe disruption of the 
education system occurred 
past disruptions led to particularly bad results on math and 
science exams he said 
louw said was encouraged by recent appeals from black leaders 
for youths to rededicate themselves to education 
among those making such calls was walter sisulu a senior leader 
of the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement who 
was freed in october after 26 years in prison 
our young people must continue to participate in the struggle 
for liberation sisulu said in a message to a black education 
conference last month but at the same time it is also very 
important we learn to read and write so that we equip ourselves for 
the south africa of tommorrow

the rap group public enemy has raised hackles 
again with a new single that has been denounced as antisemitic by 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith and others 
the song welcome to the terrordome was released wednesday 
its lyrics a multitude of statements and images focusing on black 
life in 1989 include the lines told the rab get off the rag 
and 
crucifixion aint no fiction 
socalled chosen frozen 
apology made to whoever pleases 
still they got me like jesus 
the groups critics argue that public enemy is accusing the jews 
of killing christ and of treating public enemy the same way the 
same critics say descriptions of jews as the socalled chosen 
people are common among black muslims who say they and not the 
jews are the chosen people 
public enemy leader chuck d said the song refers to last 
summers controversy involving professor griff the groups 
nonperforming minister of information who was quoted as 
saying that jews were responsible for most of the wickedness in the 
world 
chuck d fired professor griff and disbanded public enemy 
within weeks the group came together again with griff as a 
community liaison who was no longer supposed to give interviews 
chuck d insisted that the criticized lyrics of welcome to the 
terrordome were not antisemitic 
it says i apologized for griffs comments and then the media 
crucified me griff was wrong and i was the first to admit it 
but a lot of wrong things happened after that too he told the 
daily news 
he said socalled chosen referred to both jews and muslims 
he does not believe that any people are chosen he said and he 
suggested that critics were misinterpreting the record because they 
were ignorant of rap language 
ridiculous said rabbi abraham cooper associate dean of the 
simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies in los angeles 
the people who wrote it the people who sang it the people 
who produced it the people who distributed it all know that this 
song is antisemitic cooper said 
jeffrey sinenski head of the adls civil rights division said 
weve been in the business for 25 years and the antidefamation 
league is very familiar with the language of bigotry we know it 
when we see it 
in a letter to tommy mottola president of cbs records which is 
distributing the record sinenski said the song revives the 
repulsive and historically discredited charge that the jews 
killed christ cbs records he said was helping to distribute 
antisemitic statements 
sinenski said he had received no response from mottola and there 
was a wall of silence in the music industry cooper who has 
met with chuck d several times in recent months and has introduced 
him to a holocaust survivor agreed 
where is it said in the first amendment that the mainline 
record companies must distribute the rantings of racists and 
antisemites we do not reward in any other area of american life 
bigots he said 
officials at cbs records said mottola was on vacation and could 
not be reached for comment other company spokesmen also were 
unavailable they said 
russell simmons president of def jam records public enemys 
recording company told the new york times that welcome to the 
terrordome is a good record but he did not praise the 
controversial lyrics 
theyre not great lines and im not happy about it simmons 
said but he was frustrated and thats what he wanted to say im 
not defending everything hes saying but chopping peoples records 
up is not what i do and in the end public enemy has done a lot 
more good than harm

an east german newspaper on thursday warned 
of growing rightwing extremism in the country and the official 
news agency reported that a memorial to the soviet soldiers who 
fought the nazis had been defaced 
a researcher who requested anonymity told the newspaper junge 
welt that neonazi groups were growing in number and creating a 
pogrom atmosphere 
the newspaper said the researcher a sociologist wished to 
remain anonymous because of threats from rightwing extremists 
junge welt also printed a letter it said was received recently 
we are not to be stopped anymore said the handwritten 
letter signed with the nazi salute sieg heil and carrying a 
swastika in the bottom left corner 
east german opposition leaders and the coalition government late 
wednesday issued a joint statement expressing deep concern over 
the increase in neofascist incidents 
the statement said 44 acts of violence by suspected neonazis 
were registered by police in 1988 while there were already 144 
such incidents by the end of november this year 
the official news agency adn said vandals in east berlin defaced 
a 40foot bronze statue of a soviet soldier carrying a child a 
momument to soviet soldiers killed in the 1945 battle to liberate 
berlin from the nazis 
one spraypainted message scrawled overnight said occupiers 
go home and another said blast the last prison of peoples 
the ussr adn said 
the agency said the slogans were removed but officials had 
temporarily closed the park 
east germany is the soviet unions most important strategic ally 
in the warsaw pact and the soviets keep about 380000 troops in 
east germany according to western estimates 
in the junge welt interview the unidentified researcher said 
that in early 1988 there were about 1000 organized neofascists 
but their numbers now are much larger not including their 
sympathizers 
he said most of the extremists were between 18 and 26 years of 
age and were particularly aggressive toward foreigners and 
leftists who for them represent slovenliness disorder and 
dirt 
peter przybylski a spokesman for the general prosecutors 
office said 185 people had been prosecuted for neonazi activities 
in 1988 while the number rose to 296 in 1989 excluding december 
he told adn that about 1100 people were known to the police 
through previous neonazi offenses 
since the ouster of the communist leadership and the opening of 
the countrys borders east german officials have frequently warned 
of possible infiltration by west german rightist radicals 
west germanys republican party which has won as much as 10 
percent of the vote in some local elections claims to have set up 
cells in east germany 
ultrarightists have also been seen distributing leaflets to 
reunification advocates at prodemocracy rallies in leipzig 
despite vows by authorities that the party will not be allowed to 
function in east germany 
at recent rallies students said so much disdain had built up 
against the communists in 40 years that they thought east germany 
could provide fertile soil for rightist sentiments 
a wave of protest demonstrations forced the resignation of 
hardline communist leader erich honecker on oct 18 and his 
replacement by egon krenz krenz opened the berlin wall and gave 
east germans freedom to travel but growing pressure from the 
prodemocracy movement forced the entire communist leadership to 
step down on dec 3

the united states has asked japan to help 
rebuild panamas shattered economy and has dispatched a team of 
experts to assess the costs of repairing the devastation caused by 
last weeks military invasion officials said thursday 
in addition representatives from the treasury state and 
commerce departments have begun deliberations on longterm plan to 
repair the damage wrought by two years of us economic warfare 
against former panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
the panama economic reconstruction committee the name for the 
interagency task force is holding meetings this week with a 
threeman panamanian team headed by a leading economic planner 
guillermo chapman 
that task force will travel to panama next week to review the 
situation said a state department official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the focus of the panamanianamerican meeting is the transfer of 
some 400 million in panamanian government money frozen last year 
in the united states president bush last week ordered the funds 
released but the process is expected to take several weeks 
administration officials said 
the administration in talks both before and after the operation 
that removed noriega from power urged japan to help panama said a 
japanese embassy official the us expects japan to play a 
significant role said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
japan stopped its aid to panama six months ago because of the 
instability created by noriega who has been twice indicted in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges the japanese official 
said that once his government recognizes the new panamanian 
government installed with us support last week we will offer 
new economic programs 
japan has a strong interest in panamas stability because many 
japanese exports to the united states pass through the panama canal 
to meet an urgent need for funds the united states transferred 
582 million in money confiscated from noriega to the new 
government headed by guillermo endara an american military 
spokesman in panama city said thursday 
the immediate us priority is to assess the direct damage from 
four days of bombing and shooting which destroyed homes and 
offices and left thousands homeless and from several days of 
extensive looting 
alfredo maduro president of the panamanian chamber of commerce 
said thursday that insurance brokers had estimated losses from 
looting or other damage to businesses in the capital at 750 
million to 1 billion 
maduro said businessmen planned to ask the united states for 
something like a marshall plan for panama to recover 
an estimated 570 people of them 23 american servicemen were 
killed in the military operation launched last wednesday to remove 
noriega from power in panama 
the team of experts assembled to deal with the immediate 
problems resulting from the military intervention arrived in panama 
thursday led by the head of the office of foreign disaster 
assistance andrew natsios the group will try to determine how 
much money the endara government needs for rehabilitation projects 
said a spokesman 
it also will also consult with the defense department to 
determine its needs for building shelters and providing food and 
medicine to panamanian refugees said michael marlow of the agency 
for international development aid is the state departments aid 
arm 
the administration has not yet asked congress for money for 
panamas rehabilitation relying for now on the 400 million in 
unfrozen panamanian assets 
but rep lee hamilton chairman of the joint economic committee 
of the house and senate said that money would not go far enough 
the panama economy is in a mess maybe in a bigger mess than i 
think he said 
panamas needs must be identified and aid must be provided 
hamilton said at a news conference you cant promote their 
democracy unless you help their economy 
the economy of panama once a prosperous banking center with a 
per capita income far higher than that of its neighbors has shrunk 
at an estimated annual rate of 10 to 15 percent since 1987 
according to economic analysts 
economic sanctions by the united states and a loss of confidence 
in noriega led us firms including largescale employers like 
xerox and ibm to scale down their businesses in panama 
unemployment has risen to more than 20 percent 
in addition panama owes at least 56 billion to foreign banks 
governments and international lending agencies such as the world 
bank and international monetary fund

whenever authoritarian rulers are 
toppled the question invariably arises what about their swiss 
bank accounts 
the role of swiss banks traditional havens of capital from 
other countries has prompted criticism following the recent 
ousters of romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu and gen manuel 
antonio noriega of panama both are alleged to have stashed 
personal fortunes in switzerland 
once more the reputation of the swiss financial center is 
being dragged through the mud said the geneva newspaper tribunbe 
de geneve on thursday 
sergio salvioni a swiss lawyer representing the philippine 
government in its efforts to recover ferdinand marcos funds said 
if this continues the swiss will be considered as 
receivers of stolen goods 
the government concerned about its image swiftly slapped a 
freeze on any accounts ceausescu may hold even without waiting for 
a formal request by the new romanian leadership it also responded 
immediately to a washington request to block assets linked to 
noriega 
but tracking down the funds wont be enough if similar cases in 
the past set a pattern a long and complicated legal battle is 
likely before any assets are repatriated and estimates of their 
size vary widely 
ceausescu according to romanian exile sources is believed to 
have transferred 400 million much of it in gold to switzerland 
during his reign the romanian national bank asked all countries to 
freeze any ceausescu accounts 
ceausescu had denied that any such accounts exist credit 
suisse one of the two swiss banks that received the freeze order 
has said it had no evidence of ceausescu funds the other union 
bank declined comment citing banking secrecy rules 
noriegas alleged accounts might be easier to come by because 
the us request for assistance names the banks where funds are 
suspected us justice department spokesman david runkel said 
noriega was thought to have transferred at least 10 million into 
various accounts in europe 
in both cases swiss reaction was as prompt as it was following 
the ousters in 1986 of marcos and of haitis jeanclaude duvalier 
but efforts by new leaders to recover the allegedly illgotten 
wealth drag on 
assets held in switzerland by marcos and his associates are 
estimated by the manila government at hundreds of millions of 
allegedly illgotten dollars they remain frozen since 1986 pending 
completion of complex proceedings 
lawyers for the marcos family filed appeals at virtually every 
level so that a final decision is likely to have to come from the 
federal tribunal the swiss supreme court last week however an 
initial 23 million returned to manila 
no appeal was filed in the proceedings concerning duvalier 
assets suggesting that only minor amounts were involved in 
november the supreme court formally granted legal assistance to 
the haitian authorities but so far there have been no word of any 
funds being repatriated 
in 1974 the military leaders who overthrew emperor haile 
selassie of ethiopia claimed that he had transferred 15 billion 
abroad much of it to switzerland but they never addressed a 
formal request to the swiss government and did not renewed their 
claim later 
similarly unconfirmed reports about secret swiss accounts 
allegedly held by third world leaders have abounded in the swiss 
press for decades former presidents juan peron of argentina 
anastasio somoza of nicaragua and hugo banzer of bolivia were among 
many names mentioned

they gave dutch morial a new orleans sendoff 
thursday a sometimes mournful sometimes jubilant jazz funeral 
procession to and from st louis cathedral where a mass was held 
for the citys first black mayor 
he had a vision and the lives of black people in louisiana 
were changed forever retired archbishop phillip hannan said at 
the mass he saw that equal rights for all would bring in a new 
era for louisiana 
morial who also broke ground as the first black to graduate 
from the louisiana state university law school the first black 
judge in new orleans and first black louisiana state representative 
since reconstruction died of a heart attack saturday he was 60

when he ended a eulogy with the words that were a campaign theme 
for his father

alexander dubcek suffered two 
decades of humiliation at the hands of hardline communists who 
ousted and banished him for trying to humanize socialism and 
increase freedom for his people 
but with his stunning return to power thursday as leader of 
parliament the man once considered by many as czechoslovakias 
tragic hero may be remembered as one who fought the noble fight and 
won 
this is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands ot 
people who have upheld the ideals of the prague spring dubcek 
said thursday in his acceptance speech before the federal assembly 
elected to replace antonin novotny as head of the communist 
party in january 1968 dubcek led a courageous band of reformers 
who dreamed of a socialism with a human face for an 
exhilarating eight months czechoslovaks felt new personal freedoms 
and saw the emergence of political pluralism and economic reforms 
intellectuals straining at the leash of communist control 
provided ideological ammunition for dubcek as he argued with moscow 
for the abolition of censorship and the curbing of police all in 
the name of a rejuvenated party 
the radical novelty of the prague spring was the realization 
that economic reform was impossible without political 
decentralization an idea proposed nearly 20 years later by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
but under soviet leader leonid brezhnev in 1968 the ideas 
dubcek championed were considered dangerous 
at the head of a column of warsaw pact troops soviet tanks 
rolled into pragues broad wenceslas square on aug 20 1968 to 
crush the liberal reforms it was a dramatic and enduring message 
to the world that the soviet union would not refrain from using 
force if its imperial position was threatened 
the soviet invasion became a watershed in eastern european 
history and dubcek came to personify all those who challenged 
communist tyranny 
like thousands of czechoslovak intellectuals and reformist 
politicians dubcek was the target of repression after the invasion 
he was flown to moscow and forced to sign an agreement 
sanctioning the invasion and allowing 80000 soviet troops to 
remain inside czechoslovakia 
by may 1970 dubcek had been ousted from parliament his last 
public position and stripped of his party membership 
his name was removed from history books and his picture 
airbrushed out of official photos leaving an empty space where the 
popular leader once appeared 
he was sent with his wife and three sons to work as a forestry 
manager in bratislava the capital of his native slovakia and was 
kept under constant police surveillance 
dubcek while not actively involved in dissident human rights 
activities throughout the 1970s was embraced by the opposition 
during novembers peaceful revolution 
the dramatic photo of a triumphant dubcek 68 waving to 
hundreds of thousands of prodemocracy supporters and admirers from 
the balcony over wenceslas square on nov 24 made front pages 
around the world

enrile a former aquino supporter denied involvement in the 
coup attempt saying the accusations wer meant to harass the 
opposition he said he welcomed the opportunity to face his 
accusers in court 
fernando de leon the chief state prosecutor said the national 
bureau of investigation recommended prosecution after witnesses 
claimed to have seen enrile with mutiny leaders dec 1 when 
thousands of troops launched the sixth and strongest attempt to 
topple mrs aquino 
de leon said government prosecutors would review the 
recommendation to decide whether charges would be filed 
enrile joined with mrs aquino in the militarycivilian uprising 
that swept her to power in february 1986 he was named as defense 
minister but fired from the post that november after a failed coup 
by his followers 
de leon said those reportedly seen with enrile at his home

he had not more than 20 bodyguards all in civilian dress 
he said there also were some guests attending a mass customarily 
held at his house on the first friday of every month 
i know that i have not done anything that is criminal under 
our laws enrile said i am not part of the rebellion i have 
not seen any of the participants in this military rebellion 
he called the accusations a machination of the presidential 
palace 
they want to seal the lips of the opposition in the country 
and to threaten them but i will tell them now that they cannot 
silence me enrile said this government is like a wounded 
tiger flailing its paws

dec 19 coup attempt 
many of the coup leaders including honasan are at large

the white house said thursday that 
manuel noriegas fate rests in the hands of the vatican and it 
ruled out the possibility of a thirdcountry refuge for the 
exdictator of panama 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the united states has 
agreed to come to the papal nuncios rescue should noriega and his 
cronies take hostages inside panama city embassy where noriega has 
been holed up since christmas eve 
but fitzwater briefing reporters here while bush was off 
hunting quail at a remote ranch 60 miles away said we dont see 
a hostage situation or any danger at the moment but were willing 
to offer assistance should that be necessary 
on another issue fitzwater confirmed that bush is readying 
plans to use the us military to disrupt drug supply routes in 
south and central america asked about a report that the pentagon 
was planning a virtual blockade of colombia fitzwater said we 
have decided to take certain actions to help the countries of latin 
america interdict those supply routes 
whatever is done will be in close concert with colombian 
authorities he said 
papal officials reportedly sent us authorities a letter 
tuesday authorizing a rescue effort should a hostage situation 
develop i assume that when you have people of the ilk of mr 
noriega and his cronies in the embassy there certainly is reason 
to be concerned said fitzwater 
a vatican spokesman said wednesday in italy that the papal 
nuncio could not legally turn noriega over to us authorities who 
want to try him on drug trafficking charges the papal embassy in 
panama city is empowered only to deal with the government of 
panama and no other foreign governments the spokesman said 
our position remains the same that we want noriega returned 
to the united states for prosecution but this matter is now in the 
hands of the vatican and we will work with them and with the endara 
government to calmly consider the issue said fitzwater 
asked why the united states opposes letting noriega seek refuge 
in a third country as both the reagan and bush administrations 
had suggested over the past two years as part of deals to restore 
democracy in panama the presidential spokesman said those offers 
were contingent on noriega giving up power peacefully 
we had to go in militarily we have paid a price for this 
said fitzwater referring to the 23 american servicemen killed and 
322 wounded in the dec 20 invasion that toppled noriegas regime 
fitzwater said us authorities have detained and interviewed 
some noriega associates who have left the vatican embassy most 
of his cronies are still in the embassy with him said 
fitzwater who would not disclose how many there were 
us authorities blared loud rock music including such tunes 
as nowhere to run and i fought the law and the law won 
outside the vatican embassy wednesday 
fitzwater said it was not a pressure tactic on the vatican but 
simply fairly standard practice to disrupt any attempt to 
eavesdrop on us officials conversations the same thing was done 
during the 1988 moscow summit he said 
of the choice of records he added im certainly glad to see 
the american sense of whimsy comes forward in this situation 
bush was off hunting quail with secretary of state james a 
baker iii at their friend will farishs 10000acre lazy f ranch 
outside beeville texas on a vacation that began wednesday and 
continues through new years day 
fitzwater said he had no response to protests by animal rights 
activists against the hunt an annual christmastime ritual for 
bush an avid outdoorsman 
the quail that bush bags are always dressed for consumption 
said fitzwater who added that in his own youth on a kansas farm he 
hunted and ate quail all the time its a great dish 
bush departs the lazy f ranch late friday afternoon to join his 
wife barbara for the weekend in houston still their legal 
residence although their home consists only of a hotel suite 
they use when there 
they will visit servicemen wounded in panama at two military 
hospitals on sunday and bush will stop in montgomery ala to go 
bass fishing before returning to the white house monday night 
bush was accompanied by an everpresent military aide and 
personal assistant tim mcbride on the ranch as well as baker and a 
secret service contingent but neither national security adviser 
brent scowcroft nor deputy robert gates accompanied him to texas 
and bush relied on written reports for his daily morning 
intelligence briefing fitzwater said 
bush got up at 6 am read the intelligence report and morning 
newspapers ate breakfast and was out hunting by 845 am 
fitzwater said it was a foggy chilly morning in much of south 
texas

a series of small earthquakes rattled 
southern california on wednesday and thursday raising scientists 
concern somewhat about the possibility of a major jolt 
a quake measuring 43 on the richter scale jarred people awake 
at 141 am thursday in an area stretching about 120 miles from 
los angeles to east of palm springs no injuries or damage were 
reported 
that quake was the largest of about 10 that began wednesday 
afternoon and were centered in an area seven miles from downtown 
san bernardino said seismologist kate hutton of the california 
institute of technology in pasadena 
a magnitude33 aftershock at 2 am thursday and a 32 
foreshock at 210 pm wednesday were in the same area 
the tremors were cause for slightly increased concern because 
they were centered close to the san jacinto fault which itself 
produced several quakes this month 
weve had slightly unusual activity and were keeping a watch 
on it said lucile jones a seismologist at the us geological 
surveys pasadena office im a little more concerned than i was 
yesterday but not much more 
a 1988 forecast by the geological survey said a magnitude65 to 
7 quake is 50 percent likely by the year 2018 somewhere on the san 
jacinto fault which starts at a point northwest of san bernardino 
and runs roughly 130 miles southeast into eastern san diego county 
state emergency services officials said in 1988 that such a 
quake could kill a few hundred people injure 1000 and cause more 
than 1 billion damage 
hutton noted that previous quake sequences situated a bit 
farther northwest of san bernardino in cajon pass ended without a 
large jolt 
in southeastern australia on thursday a strong earthquake 
crumbled buildings and homes in newcastle killing at least 11 
people and injuring more than 120 officials said scientists dont 
believe quakes in widely distant areas are related 
thursdays magnitude43 quake in california was a good sized 
one said jay diamond a disc jockey at san bernardino station 
kfrgfm which received several calls from jittery residents it 
shook us pretty good the glass on the booth was shaking 
there was a bit of a rolling then a sharp jolt said 
christie hall who was awake in her lake arrowhead home when 
thursdays quake and aftershock struck the aftershock was much 
milder 
quakes ranging in magnitude from 4 to 5 on the richter scale of 
ground motion are considered small to moderate but can produce some 
local damage knocking items off shelves and sometimes breaking 
windows 
palm springs is about 100 miles east of downtown los angeles

reporting suspected drug dealers here is 
as easy as clipping a coupon 
newspaper readers fill in the blanks on the coupon and mail it 
to police under a program started by a citizen group a month ago in 
this city of 52000 outside new haven 
police have received 15 reportadealer coupons and the 
complaints are being investigated officer edward kelly a police 
spokesman said thursday 
just because there is information on the coupon doesnt mean 
we can go right out and make an arrest kelly said we have to 
make sure it is valid people are going to have to be a little 
patient 
the campaign was organized by drug free milford inc a group 
trying to help police fight drugs the coupons marked by a 
hypodermic needle with a slash through it are published daily for 
free in the milford citizen 
we will make it extremely uncomfortable for the dealers we 
are going to eradicate this poison by getting everyone involved 
said deforest smith president of drug free milford 
topped by a bold black box that exclaims enough the coupons 
read ive had enough of drugs in my neighborhood ive reason to 
believe that blank is using or dealing drugs im suspicious of 
activities at blank ive noticed the following license plates on 
cars in the vicinity of suspected drug activity 
tipsters are given the option of identifying themselves for a 
possible reward of up to 1000 if there is a conviction resulting 
from the information 
the reportadealer coupons could cause expose the antidrug 
group to lawsuits if someone decides to turn in a name just to 
embarass that person said william olds executive director of the 
connecticut civil liberties union 
but smith said the group has liability insurance we 
anticipate lawsuits dealers will do their best to derail this 
program he said 
drug free milford has also helped set up a drug hotline but has 
received only six calls police said the coupons are more 
effective kelly said because many people are hestitant to talk on

the state department on thursday said 
nicaragua was citing specious reasons for delaying the monthly us 
flight carrying supplies for the american embassy in managua 
the sandinista government took the action on wednesday after 
complaining that us forces blocked the departure of two 
nicaraguan planes parked at the airport in panama city 
state department press officer adam shub said the nicaraguan 
planes have been unable to leave because of limited capacity at the 
airport a problem that has affected other aircraft as well he 
said the problem is expected to be resolved shortly 
it is unfortunate that the sandinistas who say they want 
better relations with the united states have chosen to make this a 
political issue by delaying our embassys monthly c130 supply 
flight he said 
he added that nicaragua knows full well the circumstances at the 
airport in panama city 
if the sandinistas are sincere about wanting better relations 
with the us and their neighbors they should stop raising such 
specious issues shub said 
the next monthly supply flight to managua is scheduled for jan

harvard university the first ivy league 
school has become the last to try to protect its name with a 
trademark after years of seeing it emblazoned on sweatshirts and 
other goods around the world 
under new licensing procedures towels watches and boxer shorts 
for the crimson may still be allowed 
but string bikinis maybe not 
we just dont want it to be outrageous said ellen mitchell 
of the harvard office of patents copyrights and licensing we 
dont want to look silly 
more than 100 us colleges and universities already issue 
licenses for the use of their names including the seven other ivy 
league colleges according to the office of robert scott vice 
president for finance 
margot naulleau international licensing coordinator for 
champion products inc one of the main suppliers of athletic wear 
with college insignias said harvard americas oldest college 
was one of the last major schools in the nation to seek a trademark 
its simply that we are very old and very conservative it 
took us a long time to decide if it was something that we ought to 
do said joyce brinton director of the harvard patent office 
she said there was no incident that led to the decision to apply 
such as a particularly egregious product on the market 
it was just that the time has come she said 
before the harvard corporation decided in june to apply for a 
trademark on their name from the us patent and trademarking 
office brintons office had inquiries from many manufacturers 
about getting a license 
brinton said the trademark has not yet been approved but she 
didnt anticipate any problems 
i think most of the companies have felt uncomfortable that 
they dont have a license from harvard she said those companies 
worried about being left with hundreds of products if the schools 
lawyers suddenly cracked down she said 
harvard ran a few trial programs before moving toward licensing 
on a broad scale at the schools 350th anniversary in 1986 
harvard wanted to ensure commemorative items were of high quality 
another program licensing the trademark in japan has been booming 
bringing in 130000 in royalties annually 
under the new licensing procedure if someone wants to make a 
product bearing the name harvard harvard university or the 
schools insignia he must first show designs and samples to 
demonstrate the quality of the product before harvard will grant a 
license 
and the cost of renting the harvard name a bargain mitchell 
said brinton said companies that market harvard products pay a 
flat fee of 300 and sales royalties of 7 percent 
only a few licenses have been distributed so far after a couple 
of years officials expect from 300000 to 500000 to come in a 
year but with an endowment of some 45 billion the income from 
licensing is a drop in the bucket

the famous leaning tower of pisa shifted less 
this year than its average annual tilt of the last three decades 
university technicians said thursday 
the inclination of the 180foot tower was about 003 inches 
compared to an average 0045 inches recorded over the past 30 
years the italian news agency ansa reported 
the measuring instruments are set for very small values 
which show that the tower is slowing its fall said gero geri a 
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower 
since 1969 
his findings are reassuring to the shopowners merchants and 
hoteliers who depend on the 800000 tourists who clamber up the 
towers spiral staircase every year nonetheless pisas mayor 
recently agreed to close the tower starting next month for 
temporary restoration work 
the tower begun by bonnano pisano in 1173 started to lean 
almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath the tower 
now tilts about 13 feet off the perpendicular but tower experts 
say it will not topple for at least another century 
public works minister giovanni prandini sparked an outcry this 
fall by sounding an alarm about the decay of the national symbol

the united states begins the 1990s facing a 
host of tough decisions needed to erase policy mistakes in the last 
decade that are threatening americas global economic leadership a 
congressional study concluded thursday 
the study prepared by the staff of the joint economic 
committee said the no 1 economic problem facing the country was 
the federal budget deficit 
eliminating the deficit will not by itself solve all of our 
economic problems or put an end to our national consumption 
binge the study said however we will not solve our most 
pressing economic problems unless we reduce the deficit 
the study called on president bush and congress to come up with 
a credible package that would include a mix of both tax increases 
and spending cuts to eliminate the deficit 
the study said policymakers must abandon the budetary gimmicks 
they have used in recent years to give a false appearance of making 
progress in eliminating a budget deficit that has been stuck near 
150 billion for the past three years 
the economic policies of the 1980s have not prepared us for a 
brighter future said committee chairman rep lee hamilton 
dind who directed preparation of the new report we need new 
economic policies for the 1990s policies that will improve us 
economic performance and make us a richer nation and a fairer one 
the study offered a stark assessment of americas economic 
prospects if policies are not altered contending that the united 
states must do more to boost savings increase investment and spur 
gains in productivity if the country hopes to compete 
internationally 
our country has been driven for most of this decade not by 
investment but rather by a binge of consumption that threatens our 
longrun standard of living and our standing as the worlds leading 
economic power the report said 
it said the huge federal deficit was the biggest contributor to 
this consumption binge but it also cited a big 20 percent drop in 
new business investment over the past 10 years and productivity 
growth that is far below the levels of the 1950s and 1960s 
the study which did not have the backing of republican members 
of the committee said it would be impossible to reduce the budget 
deficit without tax increases to accompany spending cuts this is a 
conclusion that bush has repeatedly rejected 
his administration is putting the finishing touches on a 123 
trillion budget proposal for next year that will meet the 
grammrudman target of reducing the deficit to 64 billion without 
raising income taxes 
the study said bushs efforts to rely on rosy economic forecasts 
and elusive savings in goverment programs would prove as 
unsucessful as similar policies pursued by president reagan 
while a tax increase alone would not be politically acceptable 
it could win approval as part of a package deal that would combine 
modest tax increases with spending cuts the study said 
in other findings the report predicted that economic growth 
prospects over the next year were weak in part because the effort 
to reduce americas huge trade deficits had stalled out with the 
trade imbalance stuck at levels above 100 billion a year 
the report devoted an entire chapter to suggestions on how the 
country can resume making progress on trimming the trade deficit 
but it warned reaching trade balance will be difficult and 
painful 
it said efforts to boost the savings rate were essential as a 
way of curbing overconsumption in the united states and reducing 
americans appetite for foreign goods a bigger savings pool would 
also provide the capital us industry needs to modernize the 
report said 
it called for international organizations such as the 
international monetary fund and the world bank to devote more 
efforts to resolving the third word debt crisis which has severely 
limited us export opportunities in latin america

the justice department says it obtained guilty 
pleas or convictions in 107 environmental criminal cases in the 
last fiscal year a record 
richard stewart assistant attorney general for the land and 
natural resources division said the numbers reflected a 70 percent 
increase over the previous year and demonstrate the bush 
administrations commitment to environmental protection 
but department officials acknowledged thursday that many of the 
107 cases concluded during the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 
and cited in wednesdays announcement may have been initiated 
before president bush took office last january 
the number of indictments alleging environmental crimes actually 
declined in fiscal 1989 by about 20 percent to 101 the lowest 
number in three years compared with 124 in 1988 and 127 in 1987 
spokeswoman amy casner acknowledged that the sharp increase in 
the number of cases won in fiscal 1989 in part reflected the high 
number of indictments filed in previous years 
she said she did not know how many of the 107 convictions 
reflected cases initiated in earlier years 
the 107 cases resulted in the collection of 127 million in 
fines including a 225 million penalty paid by ashland oil co 
for the discharge of 500000 gallons of diesel fuel into the ohio 
river 
justice had sought 75 million from protex industries for 
endangering workers at a hazardous waste site but a judge later 
suspended all but about 400000 of that fine ms casner said the 
suspended portion of the fine was not included in the 127 million

the main shipping link between 
the great lakes closed two weeks early thursday because of ice a 
gloomy finale to a slump caused by coal strikes november gales and 
a sluggish steel industry 
well probably not even reach the tons we carried in 1988 
well probably be even or down as much as 2 million tons george 
ryan president of the lake carriers association said from 
cleveland 
shippers in 1988 posted their best year since the crash of the 
steel industry six years before this years slump reverses a trend 
of increases since the recession 
ryan blamed the weather november gales prompted ships to drop 
anchor and ore coal and stone shipments that month dropped 10 
percent or 128 million tons coal alone was down 17 percent 
early december ice closed the major link between the lakes soo 
locks on lake superior two weeks early 
an estimated 2 million tons of cargo most of it iron ore was 
stranded in port until spring when the last freighter the american 
republic locked through sault ste marie at 244 pm wednesday 
on thursday 22 ships remained on the four lower lakes fighting 
the ice to finish their deliveries before heading home for winter 
ryan said cargo should continue to move down lake michigan to 
indiana ports through the middle of january 
he was unsure what 1990 will bring but some carrier customers 
expect more of the same 
well have some slowdown not drastic said m thomas moore 
chairman of clevelandcliffs inc the nations largest iron ore 
producer 
the biggest great lakes cargo traffic is in moving ore from 
mines in minnesota and michigans upper peninsula to steel mills on 
the lower lakes deliveries began the year at a pace to break 
1988s postrecession record but stalled over the summer 
reduced demand for the raw ore that goes into steelmaking is the 
problem moore said steel sales are down and more mills are 
recycling steel rather than producing it he said 
coal shipments have been depressed since may by a strike at 
pittston co mines in west virginia virginia and kentucky as of 
december lake erie ports had moved 24 million tons less coal than 
they had by december 1988 
shipping lanes this week remained open in the lower lakes 
though they are restricted in some areas 
conditions on western lake erie and the detroit river have 
improved since late last week when eight vessels were stopped or 
slowed by ice the coast guard said

a man paid a college student to kill him 
by running him down with a car police said thursday 
graham glickfeld who was killed over the weekend had made 
similar requests before but it was not clear why he wanted to die 
said police spokesman dennis satariano but this was obviously a 
man with some emotional problems he said 
the driver michael k doeschot 27 a student at san jose state 
university was arraigned wednesday on murder charges and held 
without bail 
it was murder for hire said sgt mike eads 
police would not say how much money was involved only that it 
was not a lot and would not give details of the earlier offers by 
the victim 
the two men attended a christmas party separately friday night 
police said 
police responding to a call around midnight found glickfeld a 
31yearold supermarket worker seriously injured in the empty 
parking lot of a community center he died a short time later at a 
hospital 
the arrangement between the two men probably took place within 
a couple hours said eads 
after the car hit glickfeld doeschot called police to let us 
know whats going on eads said we had some idea it was an 
intentional act from the beginning doeschot admitted running 
over glickfeld the sergeant said 
detective ken bingaman said the men were acquaintances from a 
theater class at a community college

vowing not now not ever outgoing mayor 
edward i koch said thursday the city is challenging a new law that 
permits the borough of staten island to vote on secession 
he said the bill signed dec 15 by gov mario cuomo could 
dismember this the worlds greatest city 
the bill violates the state and federal constitutions because it 
was passed by the state legislature without the consent of the city 
council or the mayor koch said and would allow only the residents 
of staten island to vote on a matter that directly affects citizens 
of the citys other four boroughs 
new york city is and should continue to be one city not two 
not five just one he said at a news conference in city hall 
secession not now not ever 
koch who leaves office jan 1 said the city filed a lawsuit 
challenging the law in state supreme court on thursday 
the bill was sponsored by state sen john marchi a staten 
islander who said his borough would lose its political clout in the 
city under a reorganization that eliminated the powerful board of 
estimate marchi did not immediately return a telephone call to his 
office thursday 
the us supreme court ruled last spring that the board of 
estimate which has broad authority over contracts and planning and 
approves the citys annual budget violated the one manone vote 
principle because it gave equal voting power to the boroughs 
despite vastly different populations 
staten island has fewer than 400000 residents while brooklyn 
has about 26 million 
koch said secession would have an enormous impact on the 
property affairs and government of the city 
would the residents of new york state stand silently by if the 
city of buffalo were to annex itself to canada he asked i 
dont think so they would put up a fight 
we too will put up a fight to make sure that one of the five 
jewels in our citys crown the borough of staten island remains 
a shining vital part of our community koch said 
he said when cuomo signed the bill he plunged a dagger into 
the heart of new york 
koch said secession would remove substantial housing resources 
from the city staten island has the largest share of single and 
twofamily dwellings as well as the most available land for future 
housing development he said 
the city also owns buildings and other properties on staten 
island worth billions of dollars there are sewer lines water 
mains over 50 schools over 25 parks police precincts 
firehouses a ferry terminal streets and bridges and cultural 
facilities he said 
the citizens of all five boroughs have contributed financially 
to the construction and the operation of all of these facilities

the un general assembly met thursday in 
emergency session and prepared to rebuke the united states and 
deplore its invasion of panama nicaragua said america was trying 
to impose the law of the jungle 
after hearing nicaragua the 159nation assembly adjourned until 
friday 
it was expected to adopt a resolution then sponsored by 
nicaragua and cuba which demands withdrawal of us forces from 
panama and calls the us military intervention a flagrant 
violation of international law 
in his speech nicaraguan ambassador alejandro serrano caldera 
condemned the invasion saying 
this affront to sovereignty in panama is a new and especially 
dangerous threat to the entire peace process in central america 
there can be no moral juridical or political justification 
for one country invading another militarily the day this ceases to 
be the case the day that brute force is justified for any reason 
we will have established violence as a norm of conduct and the 
law of the jungle will become the guilding principle of foreign 
relations 
the assembly will reconvene friday to hear more speakers before 
voting on a resolution that strongly deplores the us invasion 
us troops drove panamas gen manuel antonio noriega from 
power last week after diplomatic and economic efforts failed to 
budge him following his indictment in 1988 on us drugtrafficking 
and moneylaundering charges 
serrano said the latest military intervention was the sixth time 
over the years that the united states has invaded panama can 
there be any possible justification for this he asked the 
us representatives says this was an act of selfdefense has 
panama committed an act of armed aggression 
proceedings were delayed because central american and other 
nations offered a compromise resolution to modify the draft measure 
proposed by nicaragua and cuba and incorporate elements that would 
appeal to more moderate nations 
the new resolution expected to pass overwhelmingly friday was 
still forceful it used the same language to strongly deplore 
the invasion and to demand withdrawal of us forces it called 
the us intervention a flagrant violation of international law 
and respect for sovereignty 
but it included an element considered vital by the united 
states it recognized the need to reestablish conditions in panama 
to ensure respect for human rights and democracy 
both nicaragua and cuba endorsed the new resolution which 
expresses profound concern over serious consequences the 
invasion might have for peace and security in central america 
it deletes the statement that the us invasion definitely 
endangers peace and security in the region and now says it 
might threaten stability there 
the us government said it launched the invasion to unseat 
noriega and restore democracy in a nation where it had been 
trampled by that military leader 
the new resolution was expected to be supported by most latin 
american nations the soviet union and some of its allies and the 
movement professing nonalignment with either superpower

the populations of five states grew at rates 
faster than 10 percent in the last half of the 1980s the census 
bureau said thursday in a report that is causing revised estimates 
for congressional reapportionment 
the census figures on state population issued for release 
friday showed nevadawith the biggest population gain at 18 percent 
from 1985 to the middle of 1989 arizona had the second highest 
growth rate at 12 percent followed by florida and new hampshire 
at 11 percent and california at 10 percent 
seven states lost population during the same period the bureau 
said iowa north dakota montana west virginia wyoming 
louisiana and oklahoma 
the population figures are closely watched at the end of each 
decade because they determine how many seats in the us house of 
representatives each state will have the next reapportionment will 
be based on the final 1990 census figures which will be collected 
in the 10year census next year 
the report issued thursday represents one last checkpoint before 
that final official count and two forecasting groups on thursday 
issued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends 
while the two reports varied on some specifics they agreed on 
the overall trend states in the sunbelt will generally pick up 
seats lost by states in the northeast and midwest 
the nonprofit population reference bureau said that if the 
trends in thursdays report hold true through the final 1990 
figures 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in congress 
while seven will gain 
it said new york will lose three seats pennsylvania two ohio 
two michigan two illinois two new jersey one massachusetts one 
iowa one kansas one west virginia one and montana one 
the population reference bureau said california will gain seven 
seats texas will gain three florida three virginia one north 
carolina one georgia one and arizona one 
the comparable prediction by election data services inc a 
washingtonbased political consulting firm differed only for a few 
states it said florida is likely to pick up four seats rather 
than three and it added kentucky to the list of those losing 
seats dropping one 
there is still a wild card in the deck which cannot at this 
point be predicted with certainty the census bureau figures on 
which the projections are based do not include members of the 
military and their dependents living overseas 
the government recently announced that they will be counted in 
the 1990 reapportionment this change could tip the balance in some 
states that now appear close to winning or losing a seat

the united states would like the 
extra troops it sent here out by february but that is unlikely 
because panamas security forces must be rebuilt from scratch a 
senior us embassy official said thursday 
the official told a press briefing the newly formed security 
forces are made up largely of officers and troops from gen manuel 
antonio noriegas old panama defense forces and that adjustments 
are being made province by province 
we cannot get to that fully in one month he said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
he said one change already was made in the southern city of las 
tablas in los santos province 
while people there were celebrating he said the zone military 
commander told them to whoop it up all they wanted but to bear in 
mind that the americans were leaving and he was staying 
the man was arrested and replaced but this is the type of thing 
that needs to be sorted out the official said 
it is no secret that the new government does not have a lot of 
confidence in some of these people he said 
he said former officers who were exiled arrested or retired 
because noriega didnt like them were called back to duty but they 
make up a small minority of the officer corps 
he said no indication emerged of a guerrilla movement taking to 
the hills following last weeks us military invasion that drove 
noriega from power should that happen he said the united states 
not panama probably would deal with it 
the united states had 12000 troops stationed in panama and 
14000 more were brought in as reinforcements the official said 
authorities had hoped to be able to withdraw all the extra troops 
by february 
thats probably not meetable he said 
he said one problem is that the strength of noriegas 
paramilitary dignity battalions is not known he said the 
battalions are still there to be turned back on again 
us troops are convinced of cuban troop involvement but no 
evidence has surfaced he reported 
he said about 3300 shooters were in the 16000strong 
defense forces and about threefourths of those have been accounted 
for the rest were in support or police roles he said 
the official said he believes the new government is looking at 
forming a security force at a lower level than a conventional army 
but stronger than a police force also there may be a move to 
decentralize and move some functions to other agencies noriega had 
consolidated all policerelated functions within the defense forces 
to keep better control 
the ap reported tuesday that us military officials want to 
establish a professional army but officials of president guillermo 
endaras government fear an army would become a threat to 
democracy the armed forces ruled panama the last 21 years 
the us official said a list exists of people sought by 
panamanian and american forces most were caught but some are 
believed to be in the vatican embassy and the cuban embassy 
residence 
noriegas wife felicidad is in the residence she is not on 
the wanted list but investigators want to see if she came by all 
she has legally he said 
he said former finance minister orville goodin who holds 
panamanian and american citizenship had 3 million in cash with 
him when arrested 
i think they just gave it back to the bank he took it from 
the official said 
he said the united states does not want to be seen as running a 
puppet government in panama 
what we want to do is fix it right he said we sure dont 
want to do this again

joseph e brennan who traded the 
governorship for john r mckernans seat in congress three years 
ago faces a selfimposed deadline this week to decide whether to 
challenge mckernans reelection bid for governor in 1990 
brennan a democrat was constitutionally barred from seeking a 
third consecutive term in 1986 when he was first elected to 
congress and republican mckernan was elected governor but no 
longer faces that obstacle 
for months brennan 55 has courted speculation he would take 
on mckernan 41 and he has been under increasing pressure from 
democratic activists to do so 
brennans closest advisers insisted thursday that even they did 
not know whether he would seek the governorship or a third term in 
congress 
he still hasnt made up his mind completely david redmond 
brennans congressional chief of staff said after having lunch 
with his boss thursday 
no announcement was expected before friday and its liable to 
be sunday at midnight redmond said referring only halfjokingly 
to brennans promise that he would disclose his plans before the 
years end 
brennans supporters hopes were buoyed by a recent independent 
poll showing that a brennanmckernan race would be a virtual dead 
heat and brennan fueled speculation earlier this month by 
appearing before 300 democratic faithful who had gathered on his 
behalf in augusta 
in a sense he told the crowd on dec 9 a governor is a 
little bit more like a quarterback and in some respects in the 
united states congress youre a little more like an offensive 
lineman 
mckernan who has not yet announced his candidacy for 
reelection but has begun soliciting campaign contributions has 
said he is convinced brennan will enter the race 
brennan has held open the prospect for too long to do otherwise 
mckernan said last week i just think that when it gets right 
down to it its going to be very hard for him to go to his 
friends and say im not doing it 
brennans deliberations also are being monitored by maines 
other member of the us house of representatives republican rep 
olympia j snowe whom mckernan married this year 
democratic leaders were hedging their bets on brennans future 
thursday 
right now i would not call it but im not a betting person 
said democratic state chairwoman keron kerr 
what do you hear state sen barry j hobbins a former 
state party chairman and onetime congressional candidate asked a 
reporter who had called to ask him the same question 
hobbins said he was surprised that speculation about brennans 
future has spread so far outside of political circles he said the 
subject came up thursday morning when he stopped at a rural grocery 
store in western maine 
its unbelievable said hobbins everyones asking the 
question whether its in denmark maine or the state house

yo put out those fires 
for generations merchants at their stalls in the openair 
italian market a philly tradition along with the liberty bell and 
soft pretzels smeared with mustard have warmed their hands around 
roaring trash fires in metal drums and millions of moviegoers 
watched doowop singers crooning around street fires in rocky 
but in a state where cleanair laws have banned the burning of 
leaves for years the street fires of south philadelphia must go 
says city managing director james white he wants the fires doused 
by jan 7 
produce vendors at the italian market paused between sales 
thursday to say theyll probably obey but not cheerfully 
i was born here in 1928 and theres always been fire cans on 
this street to keep warm said anthony messina but times 
change what can i do what can i say ill probably get a kerosene 
heater but i dont like it 
next door lawrence lacovara 31 fed cardboard boxes and boards 
into a steeldrum fire what will he do in two weeks when the ban 
will be in force 
get a kerosene heater probably or a heater with a blower 
its going to cost more though he said 
up the street joseph girado carved up empty produce boxes while 
his wife and son waited on customers the cardboard went piece by 
piece into a drum 20 feet away where the flames helped ward off 
temperatures in the low 30s 
i dont see any damage from that fire do you he asked 
thats a tradition it keeps me warm it keeps my customers 
warm 
were trying to make an honest living here were working like 
dogs like animals if i had any sense i wouldnt be here we 
dont get any benefits no paid vacation no retirement and now 
this 
city councilman james tayoun who is going to bat for the 
vendors said the ruckus started because of complaints from the 
health department 
the merchants cannot physically operate without a decent 
source of heat tayoun said theyve been there long before us 
i see no reason we cant allow them to burn clean wood if they 
burn other trash they should be cited 
the federal environmental protection agency isnt involved but 
an epa spokesman said putting out the fires is probably a good idea 
research indicates that any kind of open burning is a serious 
problem said lee blackburn an epa expert on air quality a 
lot of particulate matter comes out inks solvents and plastics 
being burned can release a lot of toxic components 
standing over a roaring trash fire on ninth street pervis adams 
was unconvinced 
i think kerosene heaters give off as much pollution as this 
he said what about fireplaces are they going to make people 
quit using them too go look at junkyards theyre burning there 
all the time

police were holding eight reputed 
members of a notorious colombian drug ring on thursday to determine 
if they should be extradited to the united states a police 
official said 
miguel gomez padilla the national police chief said the men 
belong to the socalled ochoa clan and would be held until 
authorities could establish whether they were wanted in the united 
states on drug trafficking charges 
gomez padilla said there were apparently no outstanding charges 
against the men in colombia 
he added that all were close relatives of jorge luis 
ochoavasquez juan david ochoavasquez and fabio ochoavasquez 
the three brothers considered central figures in the powerful 
medellin cocaine cartel the three are on a list of 12 top drug 
traffickers wanted by the united states 
an antinarcotics police unit captured the suspects in a raid on 
a ranch wednesday about 125 miles north of bogota they were 
brought to this capital city 
gomez padilla said authorities were searching intensely for 
pablo emilio escobargaviria the reputed leader of the medellin 
cartel and the most wanted man in colombia but he stressed that 
the manhunt was part of a general battle against the drug 
traffickers 
we are not obsessed with the capture of one or two bandits 
the police chief told reporters at a news conference on wednesday 
gomez padilla said that the governments drug crackdown would be 
reinforced by the installation of a new government in neighboring 
panama 
the colombian press echoing charges by the us government has 
repeatedly said the countrys former dictator gen manuel antonio 
noriega was an important ally of the drug cartels 
it is charged that noriega allowed the colombian cartels to 
import cocaine processing chemicals from panama to launder drug 
money in the country and to use it as a transfer point for cocaine 
deliveries to the united states 
colombian security forces have seized 31 tons of cocaine this 
year and in the last four months the administration of president 
virgilio barco has extradited 11 drug suspects to the united states 
gomez padilla said the immediate objective of the government 
campaign was to destroy the traffickers terrorist and paramilitary 
organizations 
officials have said that the groups are responsible for the 260 
terrorist attacks that have killed 209 people since the government 
declared war on the traffickers in august 
the government scored its biggest victory in the struggle when 
police shot and killed jose gonzalo rodriguezgacha 42 a medellin 
cartel leader in a dec 15 gunfight on colombias northern coast 
the police chief said that groups of criminals formerly owing 
their allegiance to rodriguezgacha had begun to disband as a 
result of his death 
in the last two weeks police have found the bodies of 22 people 
suspected of formerly working for rodriguezgacha and riots in two 
bogota jails have resulted in the death of 12 prisoners also linked 
to the medellin cartel 
officials have blamed the violence on traffickers and other 
gangsters battling for control of the slain drug lords vast 
criminal enterprise which generates billions of dollars each year 
on wednesday a white house spokesman said the pentagon was 
studying a naval and air blockade of colombia particularly along 
colombias caribbean coast to cut the flow of cocaine reaching the 
united states 
but the us embassy here said in a statement thursday that it 
never has considered a blockade of colombia and that a proposed 
antidrug operation would be conducted in international waters 
without affecting legitimate shipping interests 
the report caused outrage among many colombians who think their 
countrys battle against drug traffickers since the august slaying 
of a leading presidential candidate has helped the united states

maoist guerrillas attacked a jungle police 
post at dawn thursday in the cocarich upper huallaga valley but 
were repelled with the help of us helicopters stationed in the 
area for drug raids officials said 
one policeman was killed and four were wounded they reported 
at about 645 am about 100 shining path rebels with 
submachine guns and bazookas attacked the police post in nuevo 
progreso a jungle area 260 miles northeast of lima according to 
interior minister agustin mantilla 
mantilla said the guerrillas fled after three peruvian police 
helicopters attacked them 
a government antinarcotics official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the three helicopters were dispatched from the 
usbuilt antidrug base at santa lucia about six miles from nuevo 
progreso 
eight helicopters on loan to peruvian police from the us state 
department are stationed at the base for use in antidrug 
operations the helicopters are flown by american contract pilots 
but are officially under police command the only police 
helicopters that operate in the area 
us embassy spokesman gene bigler said no us helicopters or 
personnel were involved in the battle 
he told the associated press two helicopters piloted by 
americans flew a reconnaissance mission thursday morning from the 
base he said base personnel received a request for assistance from 
the police post at nuevo progreso but said he did not know if the 
reconnaissance flight was related to the attack 
bigler said three peruvian army helicopters stationed in nearby 
uchiza picked up the police casualties and took them to santa lucia 
so they could be flown to lima 
a military spokesman in lima had no comment 
the peruvian drug official said three helicopters from the base 
flown by peruvians took part in the thursday fray and pursued 
retreating rebels 
bigler said no peruvian pilots or copilots currently are at the 
base 
santa lucia is the operations center for us drug agents 
working with peruvian police to attack clandestine airstrips and 
cocaprocessing laboratories used by cocaine smugglers 
twenty to 40 americans including agents contract pilots and 
mechanics work out of the base where eight uh1 huey 
helicopters are stationed the helicopters have doormounted m60 
machine guns 
huallaga valley is the worlds single largest source of the coca 
leaf most of the leaf is made into coca paste and sent to colombia 
to be refined into cocaine 
joint operations began in september peru suspended them dec 21 
to protest the us invasion of panama the government lifted the 
suspension and operations resumed tuesday 
valley drug traffickers operate in league with shining path 
rebels who protect them from police for a share of drug profits 
bigler said us law bars us personnel and helicopters from 
being used to fight the guerrillas us officials have 
acknowledged however that antidrug operations could result in 
confrontations with the rebels 
the shining path began its insurgency in 1980 near ayacucho 235 
miles southeast of lima in the andes mountains the rebels now 
operate throughout the highlands and in the cocaproducing jungles 
of the northeast 
the government says more than 17000 people have died in the

perus ambassador to panama mario castro has 
resigned because of differences with president alan garcia over 
panama according to a letter made public thursday 
castro said in his resignation letter that he was leaving 
because of substantial differences with the garcia governments 
position concerning the panamanian problem he also cited the 
injurious language employed to describe democratic leaders in 
panama 
garcia recalled castro from panama city three months ago to show 
displeasure with the regime of gen manuel antonio noriega 
but the president condemned the us invasion of panama and 
refused to recognize the government of guillermo endara installed 
after us troops ousted noriega castro has publicly expressed his 
support for the endara government however 
foreign minister guillermo larco cox called endara a judas 
suggesting he betrayed other latin american lands by going along 
with the us action 
in a news interview castro opposed garcias call for new 
elections in panama he said endara qualified as legitimate 
president of panama because of his victory in the may 7 elections 
which noriega annulled 
the votes that elected mr endara are just as valid as those 
that elected alan garcia in 1985 castro said

an attorney representing manuel antonio noriega on 
federal drug charges said thursday he is unhappy with public 
discussions of the case by other members of the defense team and 
has asked to withdraw from the case 
neal sonnett of miami said one of the reasons for his request is 
his disagreement with the other attorneys over some of the 
statements to the media he said he would prefer not to go into 
detail or discuss the other reasons 
it was a question of drawing the line between function as a 
lawyer and a general spokesperson he told the associated press 
i didnt really want to create a firestorm there have been other 
conflicts between me and cocounsel but nothing i feel is 
appropriate to discuss 
i have consistently refused to comment on panamanian affairs 
they are outside my responsibility its important for me to 
practice law 
sonnett made the announcement official wednesday in a fivepage 
motion asking the us district court here to allow him to quit the 
case 
two of the three other noriega attorneys reacted with surprise 
to sonnetts motion both frank rubino and raymond takiff said they 
had experienced no conflict attorney steve kollin said he had no 
comment 
weve had no problems whatsoever just general differences of 
opinion takiff said 
he said he found it puzzling especially after sonnett recently 
appeared on cnn to talk about noriega 
its just too hot in the kitchen takiff said 
sonnett denied he had talked about the deposed panamanian 
dictator on the news show he said he appeared as president of the 
national association of criminal defense lawyers to talk about 
forfeiture of attorneys fees 
a february 1988 indictment accuses noriega and 14 others of 
running drugs into the united states and using panama as a safe 
haven 
noriega driven from power in a us invasion of panama last 
week is currently seeking asylum at the papal embassy in panama 
city while the us government attempts to negotiate his 
extradition

us forces arrested an israeli 
security adviser and three other top aides of manuel antonio 
noriega on thursday including two associates who abandoned the 
vatican embassy where the ousted general has taken refuge 
banks meanwhile opened for the first time since the dec 20 us 
invasion and thousands of public workers were paid as millions of 
dollars confiscated by us troops were returned to panamas new 
government 
noriega the nations fallen strongman remained in the vatican 
embassy with 17 other people including at least two senior aides 
according to the rev javier villanueva 
noriega has spoken very little and does not go out on the 
patio generally he stays in his room said villanueva in a 
telephone interview with the associated press 
but two of the generals top aides lt col carlos velardes and 
lt col arnulfo castrejon left the shelter of the embassy and 
were taken into custody by us troops that surround the area 
according to us army lt col jerry murguia 
murguia also said lt col roberto cedeno was arrested in the 
last 24 hours and a senior us embassy official said michel 
harari a former israeli intelligence agent and top security 
adviser to noriega had also been detained 
the senior official said the united states would like to pull 
out by february the 14000 troops it sent in for the attack but 
said the soldiers will probably stay longer because panama needs 
time to recreate a security force 
traffic jams resumed in the capital of 1 million and the panama 
canal returned to 24hour operation for the first time since the 
invasion 
people raced to withdraw money from banks with noriega 
seemingly out of the picture many panamanians said they felt a 
sense of security returning 
im here because i need some cash i dont want to withdraw 
all my money said a man who identified himself only as carlos 
it is safer here now than ever before 
a panamanian official said president guillermo endaras 
government sent a letter to the vatican asking that noriega be 
turned over 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
letter was sent by the foreign ministry but he did not know 
whether the government asked that noriega be turned over to us 
authorities or to panama 
us armored cars were on the streets and occasional patrols 
roamed residential neighborhoods to search cars for noriega 
loyalists 
the us embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the united states estimated the panamanian defense forces had 
been 16000 strong and that most of the 3300 shooters capable 
of resistance were accounted for 
he said the security forces are being reconstituted but there 
is some concern about holdovers from the noriega days 
it is no secret that the new government does not have a lot of 
confidence in some of these people said the official 
troops surrounding the vatican embassy seemed prepared to stay 
awhile as negotiations lingered in rome spokesman joaquin navarro 
said the vatican still hoped to resolve the crisis within days but 
he gave no details 
villanueva came out of the embassy at one point thursday and 
appeared to argue with us soldiers pointing to his ears and then 
to small but powerful olivegreen loudspeakers blasting rock music 
the troops set up the outdoor stereo system wednesday but it 
was unclear whether it was to relieve their own boredom or serenade 
noriega with such tunes as somebodys watching you and youre 
no good 
in texas where president bush is hunting white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said noriegas fate is now in the hands of the 
vatican he said us troops were ready to move in if hostages 
were taken but that there was no indication this could happen 
the los angeles times reported that monsignor sebastian laboa 
the papal nuncio had given us forces a letter authorizing them 
to enter the embassy if noriega took hostages but the existence of 
a letter could not be confirmed 
villanueva a parish priest helping the papal nuncio said 
noriega largely keeps to his room speaks with few people and does 
not go out in the yard 
remember he is not the owner of this house said 
villanueva he does not move around 
velardes who left the embassy was chaplain of the panamanian 
defense forces and castrejon had been the officer on duty at 
noriegas military headquarters on dec 16 the day an unarmed us 
marine officer was killed nearby 
harari had served as one of noriegas top security advisers and 
an instructor for the defense forces while cedeno had been chief 
of noriegas state security intelligence 
villanueva said col nivaldo madrinan chief of noriegas 
investigations department and capt eliezer gaytan chief of 
security were among those inside the nunciature 
he said four members of the basque separatist group eta along 
with one of their wives also had taken shelter as a precaution 
they were in exile in panama as part of an agreement with the 
spanish government villanueva said 
he refused to identify 10 other people staying at the embassy 
the embassy official said noriegas wife felicidad was inside 
the cuban embassy residence that embassy is also surrounded by 
us troops because it was thought noriega henchmen would flee 
there 
fitzwater reiterated the us stance that noriega should be 
handed over to the united states where he is wanted on drug 
trafficking charges 
a us military spokesman said thursday that 58 million had 
been confiscated from noriegas men and turned over to the 
panamanian government 
as panamas 110 banks reopened and the cash began to flow into 
the economy the countrys 150000 public employees began receiving 
their paychecks customers lined up early 
comptroller ruben dario carles said japanese ships will keep 
flying the panamanian flag more than 12000 japanese ships fly 
panamas flag representing nearly 50 million in annual income 
through fees and services 
in its efforts to oust noriega the bush administration had 
ordered us ports closed to panamanianflag ships and imposed 
economic sanctions that froze 400 million in government assets and 
revenues 
us officials also told the government the united states will 
consider some form of assistance to compensate for the 1 billion 
lost when looters sacked hundreds of stores after the us invasion 
the us embassy official said about 300 panamanian civilians 
died in the fighting he said reports of large numbers of civilian 
bodies being found were unfounded 
the southern command said wednesday that 23 american servicemen 
and two dependents have been killed and 322 americans wounded since 
the united states invaded it said 297 panamanians troops were 
killed and 123 wounded

interest rates skyrocketed to 600 
percent a month at argentine banks thursday as economic turmoil 
continued to undermine the credibility of the government of 
president carlos menem 
banks resorted to paying their largest depositors a 600 percent 
annual rate to retain funds that otherwise might be withdrawn and 
converted to us dollars 
investors here traditionally covet dollars for stability and 
safe returns but the last two months have increasinly bought as 
many dollars as are on the market driving down the austral 
argentinas national currency to 19501 on thursday from 7281 on 
nov 1 63 percent lower 
during that time one economy minister and two central bank 
presidents were sacked two economic stabilization plans were 
launched and financial institutions were closed four times by 
government order 
said local historian felix luna there is no reason to be 
optimistic even if one wants to be 
analysts attribute the turmoil in financial markets to a lack of 
public confidence in the ability of menem who took office in july 
to carry out his proposed program of economic reform because of 
opposition by powerful unions businesses that sell to the state 
and his own laborbased peronist party 
he is seeking reduction of state expenditures that contribute to 
chronic inflation and the sale of public companies that annually 
ring up huge deficits 
a survey by the federation of commercial centers meanwhile 
indicated that in the capital buenos aires medicine prices soared 
by an average 334 percent in december food 210 percent hardware 
items 240 percent clothing 200 percent 
pharmacies reported their distributors were refusing to deliver 
goods particularly imported medicines for fear of charging too 
little and not being able to cover the cost of resupplying 
wages linked to the governments calculation of inflation have 
failed to keep pace many public and private employees received 
raises of 65 percent in early december to compensate them for the 
cost of living in november 
economy minister antonio gonzalez predicted that inflation in 
december may top 50 percent 
ground crews at aerolineas argentinas staged a surprise strike 
thursday that resulted in the suspension of outgoing flights they 
demanded immediate wage hikes and participation in the proposed 
sale of the stateowned carrier 
bus drivers subway and commuter train operators court clerks 
doctors and nurses at municipal hospitals teachers and other 
public employees all have conducted job actions in recent weeks in 
demand of higher pay 
inflation for the first 11 months of 1989 increased by 3731 
percent according to the national institute of statistics and 
census

romance in hard times a new musical set in 
the depression attempts to be whimsical but follows too many 
tangents and rattles around rather messily 
at least it has some goofily charming moments the show was 
written and composed by william finn who has been acclaimed here 
for march of the falsettos it opened thursday night at the 
offbroadway newman theater at the public theater complex 
lillias white is a plus she has a striking voice which she 
wisely doesnt push to its limits and a stage presence which adds 
up to adorable she played effie the second time dreamgirls was 
on broadway 
finns abilities to write good songs at least for part of his 
extensive score and to float more than one song at the same time 
are pluses so are some of the other performers particularly a 
fiveperson singingdancing chorus of unemployed but the plot 
which doesnt really arise from the depression is a mess 
romance in hard times is set in a manhattan soup kitchen 
the unemployed are standing in line for soup 
hennie played by miss white tells her always silent husband 
harvey lawrence clayton that shes pregnant and hopes that he 
will now speak everybody sings harvey promised to change the 
world explaining that when he didnt he quit talking however 
clayton displays a fine voice in songs which convey his thoughts 
boris played by cleavant derricks proclaims his love for 
hennie though she is married 
now events fantasy and the muddle speed up eleanor roosevelt 
enters made up like pat nixon in nancy reagans red and barbara 
bushs pearls with a shallow optimism like nobodys she stays 
babe ruth shirley temple and bojangles have walkons 
hennie saves the supreme court from a fire is promised a 
reward doesnt get it boris robs a bank harvey gets shot hennie 
decides not to have her baby in that kind of world and gets 
continually larger for some two years 
the soup kitchen becomes prosperous selling hennies soup but 
boris who robbed to give money to hennie has become a national 
hero buyers boycot the soup when boris is imprisoned after 
proclaiming his love to the nowwidowed but stillpregnant hennie 
she called the police 
in a final plea for romance no matter what victor trent cook 
steps out of the chorus and unleashes his rockoriented high tenor 
on you cant let romance die that is presumably the message 
david warren directed keeping movement flowing briskly over a 
stage design by james youmans in which outdoors is a ramp above 
the soup kitchen marcia milgrom dodge choreographed bruce 
coughlins orchestrations didnt enhance the songs

the states attorney general refused 
thursday to reopen an investigation into the fatal shootings of two 
13yearold hmong boys by a police officer 
for me to go forward with a new investigation would raise 
serious ethical questions hubert h humphrey iii said after 
meeting for about two hours with a coalition representing 
minnesotas minority communities 
a dakota county grand jury on dec 8 refused to indict kenneth 
murphy an inver grove height police officer for the fatal 
shootings nov 15 of ba see lor and thai yang both from st paul 
the boys were shot in the back as they fled from a stolen car 
the officer told authorities he believed yang was pointing a gun 
at him police found no weapon but they believe murphy mistook a 
screwdriver found near the boys bodies for a pistol 
the attorney generals office investigated the shooting at the 
request of dakota county authorities and presented the case to a 
dakota county grand jury which on dec 8 declined to indict murphy 
humphrey defended the states investigation thursday and said 
the case could not be reopened unless significant new evidence were 
disclosed 
although humphrey refused to reopen the case members of the 
coalition said they were satisfied with his plan to appoint a task 
force to look into their other concerns 
we had what i would consider a very good meeting said steve 
zachary of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
john huyen president of the vietnameseamerican association 
said the coalitions main concern is to prevent future incidents 
about 350 people attended a vigil for the dead boys in the 
capitol rotunda while humphrey met first with the boys families 
and then with the coalition representatives 
among the coalitions other requests were 
annual training for all law enforcement officers and attorneys 
representing law enforcement agencies on the use of deadly force 
and on the cultural diversity in their communities 
a code of conduct for law enforcement officers with special 
emphasis on the use of deadly force 
creation of panel with powers of a grand jury to review 
allegations of police misconduct and violations of the proposed

a twinengined plane crashed into the second 
floor of a house thursday killing the pilot and his passenger 
authorities said 
the pilot floyd e smith 75 and elwood graham were testing 
the beech 60 aircraft in preparation for a flight friday to florida 
when it crashed around noon into the home of willard and antoinette 
flatley not far from lake erie 
the flatleys were not home when the plane crashed heavily 
damaging the second floor of the house 
i looked up i saw it was low and it was making a strange 
noise said paul petak a neighbor then it looked like it was 
upside down and it straightened up and went right down 
smith was the president and founder of automation devices inc 
in fairview and graham was a shop employee who had been with the 
company for more than 20 years 
the flight originated from erie international airport and was 
scheduled to return there airport director rosemary noble said the 
pilot apparently radioed the tower shortly before noon about an 
engine problem 
the pilots first report indicated one of the engines was going 
on and off ms noble said the second report mentioned trouble 
with the second engine the crash apparently occurred about 30 
seconds later 
the plane was owned by automation devices which employs 44 
people in the manufacture of vibratory feeders devices that feed

the winds of change sweeping across the communist 
world have reached distant mongolia where a newly formed 
organization is demanding democratic reform 
the mongolian democratic union made up of students writers 
artists and intellectuals has held two sunday openair rallies in 
the capital ulan bator this month a foreign diplomat there said 
thursday 
the diplomat reached by telephone from beijing said the 
government had not interfered in the peaceful demonstrations and 
the official press and television carried reports on the rallies 
saying they attracted up to 1000 people he said there were no 
reports of arrests 
mongolia ruled by communists since 1921 and long a client state 
of the soviet union in recent years has cautiously followed the 
soviet lead in embracing perestroika or reform 
but it appears the recent dramatic changes in the soviet union 
and eastern europe which have been reported in mongolias press 
may be reverberating in this sparsely populated nation of vast 
grasslands and deserts 
ulan bator radio said in a recent broadcast the mongolian 
democratic unions 15member coordinating council had adopted a 
draft charter and had petitioned the great hural the nations 
parliament for official status 
soviet reports said the union was demanding an end to communist 
party influence over government affairs debate on setting up a 
multiparty system a fulltime parliament and establishment of a 
commission to investigate those who supported past repressive 
regimes the reports said demonstrators shouted for an end to 
bureaucracy and special privileges for those in authority 
the size of the union and the outcome of its bid for 
legitimacy were not known but it appeared to have sympathizers 
within official quarters 
the partycontrolled press while not outrightly criticizing 
todays leaders prints articles about social and economic 
problems the party paper unen recently noted that thousands of 
innocent people had been victimized by repression in the past and 
demanded largescale legal renewal to guarantee the rights and 
freedoms of mongolias 2 million people 
unen also wrote that writers in the past had been killed and 
imprisoned for their social convictions and called for the 
staterun union of mongolian writers to be replaced by an 
independent national pen club 
ulan bator radio also said that at a session of the parliament 
earlier this month members were outspoken in criticizing the 
slowness of economic reform saying fundamental changes in price 
and wage systems had yet to be carried out 
the communist party in a plenary session this month broadcast 
for the first time on television and radio reasserted its role as 
the political vanguard of the nation but it also said it must 
render active influence on the process of reconstruction in all 
spheres of social life by renewing itself first 
jambyn batmonh a former university rector who became party and 
state leader five years ago told the plenum mongolia has natural 
interest in the experiences of reforms and renovation taking 
place in the soviet union and other communist countries 
so far open criticisms of the party have been directed at the 
stalinist purges in the 1930s and 1940s when the nations religion 
and culture were suppressed and the forced collectivization 
policies of yumjaagiyn tsedenbal ruler for 40 years until his 
ouster in 1984 
the foreign diplomat said direct attacks on current leaders are 
still avoided and the mongolian democratic union is working within 
existing legal frameworks not wishing to break from the mold

officials said thursday that the last 
senior leader of the militant ultranationalist sinhalese peoples 
liberation front was killed in a gun battle after being taken into 
custody 
they also said the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the 
dominant tamil guerrilla group killed 28 members of a rival tamil 
organization in an ambush late wednesday but three tigers also 
died 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said sinhalese extremist saman 
piyasiri fernando was seized tuesday in a colombo suburb but died 
when a police team escorting him was fired at from inside a 
house 
he said six more men were killed inside the house by police 
gunfire including another sinhalese extremist leader known as 
ragama soma 
three other leaders died earlier in similar circumstances 
including the sinhalese fronts supreme leader rohana wijeweera 
after he was captured in november 
according to accounts by government officials and witnesses as 
of thursday at least 67 people died over a threeday span in the 
ethnic wars 
the sinhalese peoples liberation front began a terrorist 
offensive against the sinhalesedominated government in 1987 
saying it compromised the interests of the sinhalese majority 
through its peace efforts with the tamil minority 
initial fighting tended to pit sinhalese against tamils but 
massacres and jungle wars led to killings within each ethnic 
community 
sri lankan military officials said the tigers ambushed two 
trucks carrying 35 members of the eelam peoples revolutionary 
liberation front near nelukulam about 130 miles northeast of 
colombo 
residents of the area gave the casualty figures of 31 dead 
sri lankas violence grew out of friction between the sinhalese 
and the tamils who make up 18 percent of the countrys 16 million 
people and claim they are discriminated against in jobs education 
and language

the government will stop reimbursing operators 
of nuclear weapons plants for their own criminal fines 
environmental penalties fraudulent losses and other questionable 
costs officials say 
the decision spurred by growing congressional criticism of the 
weapons program marks the most fundamental change in the energy 
departments weapons contracting system since companies were 
recruited to build the first atomic bombs in the 1940s 
the companies traditionally have been allowed to recover 
virtually all their costs even those resulting from their own 
negligence the logic was that weapons production was so 
specialized and vital to national security that the government 
could not afford to risk losing a plant operator over money matters 
the new thinking under energy secretary james d watkins is 
that the weapons contractors will perform better if they are held 
accountable for their mistakes

angry homeowners besieged oil delivery 
companies and governors across the northeast are calling on federal 
officials to find out why home heating oil prices skyrocketed this 
month to their highest levels ever 
the price jump from about 85 cents a gallon two weeks ago to as 
high as 162 per gallon now has led officials from gov mario 
cuomo of new york to gov judd gregg in new hampshire to call for 
federal investigations of possible gouging and pricefixing 
whether oil companies are in collusion or not public officials 
and industry experts agree that an unusual confluence of events has 
led to the highest prices ever for home heating oil 
events ranging from low water levels on the rhine river in 
germany to a refinery explosion in louisiana have contributed to 
the upsurge officials say above all though is the record cold 
spell that has gripped much of the nation this month for the

murder rates soared to new highs in some of the nations largest 
cities in 1989 but at least eight cities saw a surprising drop in 
homicides 
police were quick to blame crack for homicide records that were 
set in at least seven cities but they were less certain about why 
there was less killing elsewhere 
one official suggested that violence may have ebbed in cities 
where drug dealers have already won their turf wars by killing off 
rivals and dividing up territory 
final 1989 statistics in most cities wont be prepared for at 
least several weeks but a preliminary survey by the associated 
press of police departments in more than 30 cities shows that the 
number of homicides rose in most of them

the japanese economy heads into the 1990s riding a 
boom based on spending at home its fundamental shift away from 
export dependence may make it an even greater powerhouse in the 
next century say economists 
at the same time american exports to japan have been rising 
they jumped 34 percent in 1988 and were increasing at a 19percent 
rate for 1989 by middecember 
the japanese are still working overtime but not necessarily to 
send cars tv sets or vcrs to main st usa or elsewhere abroad 
but to satisfy their own appetites 
im thinking of buying a new car since two of my children 
graduated from school this year said a middleage man looking 
over nissans in a showroom i am now living comfortably now i am 
going to enjoy life with my wife 
akihiro nagayama a junior at meiji university said he already 
has a car a stereo and a video and now was shopping for a leather 
coat he said he wasnt as conscious of brandname products as the 
older generation 
i buy what i need i have a parttime job and get some money 
from my parents when i go shopping im satisfied with the way 
things are 
japan is entering a longterm cycle of consumer spending like 
the united states in the 1950s and 1960s says kenneth courtis 
economist at db capital markets in tokyo 
economists think the present domesticbased expansion may well 
outlast the export boom in the quarter ended in september japans 
gross national product grew at an annualized 122 percent the 
fastest of any quarter since 1973 based primarily on strong 
spending on investment in plants by japanese companies 
the problem is says courtis that the world hasnt 
crystallized whats happening here just as the world woke up in 
the 1970s to discover japan had an automobile industry in the 
1990s well wake up and say look at these companies 
in 1985 exports made up 165 percent of japans gnp the measure 
of a countrys production of goods and services today they are 
less than 10 percent of gnp this ratio is lower than any major 
industrial country except the united states according to bank of 
japan figures relatively sluggish export growth has actually 
slowed down the japanese economy for the past three years 
still competition with japanese exports remains a formidable 
problem for countries like the united states which suffers a 
50billion trade deficit with japan but the japanese challenge 
comes from an export sector that is only one small part of japans 
total economy 
japan is the most profitable market in the world according to 
more than half of the american and european companies polled by 
consultants booz allen and hamilton 
american products finding profitable niches in japan include 
levi jeans and other apparel items bourbon beer california wine 
soft drinks instant film razor blades muscle cars and jeeps 
fast food and processed foods 
japan is investing three times more per capita than the united 
states in factories research and development says courtis most 
of that is aimed not at increasing export capacity but at reducing 
labor costs and developing new technologies and products 
based on this investment and the restructuring of the economy 
away from exports japan will probably be a more powerful and 
resilient economic force than ever in the next century believe 
many economists 
ironically the present boom was spurred by an event that some 
doomsayers said would cripple the economy the rise of the yen 
starting in 1985 pushed by governments trying to reduce japans 
worldwide trade surplus exports were indeed hurt as the exchange 
rate made them more expensive and less competitive but the economy 
came out stronger than ever 
like the discipline imposed by the oil shocks of the 1970s the 
pain of the high yen was in the end a tonic for japan 
manufacturers started switching markets from foreign to 
domestic and found japan was a very profitable market says 
tsutomu tanaka an economist at the governments economic planning 
agency 
in 1987 real gnp grew a healthy 52 percent in 1988 51 percent 
and the overall level for 1989 is expected to be about 5 percent 
the change is rather dramatic says tanaka we used to 
depend on exports for growth 
anyone who visited japan in 1985 and returns today can see the 
changes wrought by the high yen 
in 1985 a foreign car was a rare sight most people worked on 
saturdays people constantly complained that japan was a poor 
island country with no natural resources that must export to 
survive 
today shoppers cruise the tokyo boutique scene in maseratis and 
mercedes benzes surfboardladen rvs head for the beaches on 
twoday weekends tiffanys displays jewels in the windows of a 
ginza department store that now is part owner of the luxury 
retailer 
tokyo stores today make the typical american mall look 
outofdate 
every week seems to spawn a new health drink a smaller portable 
video player wilder fashions a new ethnic restaurant 
japanese need whattobuy magazines with names like trendy and 
goods press just to keep up 
dominos pizza scooters buzz pepperoniandmushroom specials to 
japanese couch potatoes playing with electronic gadgets not yet 
available in the united states 
neighborhoods where rabbit hutch houses huddled five years 
ago are sprouting solidly built condominiums the only rub is that 
prices are too high for most young families who console themselves 
with new cars and appliances and overseas vacations 
a recruiting pamphlet for giant nippon steel does not feature 
factories but spiffily dressed young men enjoying life in the 
flashy roppongi nightlife district nowadays steel manufacturers 
are building resorts and importing wine theyre also selling so 
much steel to the booming domestic construction market that there 
isnt enough left over to meet export demand

loves labor has not been lost for jabra 
ibrahim jabra one of the giants of contemporary arab letters who 
has translated shakespeares plays and sonnets into arabic critics 
say they are the best translations of the bard yet in arabic 
it took him 24 years from 1959 to 1983 to translate 
hamlet coriolanus king lear macbeth 
othello the tempest and 40 of the sonnets 
now he says thats it 
i wanted to translate all his plays jabra said in an 
interview at his home in a fashionable baghdad suburb but after 
finishing the tempest i realized it was virtually impossible id 
never have the time to do anything else 
he said the tempest which he completed in 1979 was the 
toughest to translate because it was deceptively lyrical which 
makes it very difficult to render in another language 
his translations of shakespeare and other western works are 
very very beautiful said professor abbas altonsi of the 
american university in cairo 
eisa abushamsieh an arab academic noted in a literary thesis 
on jabra that his shakespeare translations as well as scholarly 
studies on shakespeares works stand as a remarkable contribution 
to the modern arabic drama in particular and literature in 
general his accuracy in translation is a characteristic upon which 
his critics agree 
jabra 69 is one of the most prolific and versatile arab 
writers he is a novelist poet essayist critic and translator as 
well as artist 
he has translated oscar wilde emile zola guy de maupassant 
chekov andre maurois walt whitman dylan thomas ezra pound 
edith sitwell and william faulkner along with many english poets 
such as shelley keats dryden and byron 
it took me a year to do hamlet the first shakespeare play i 
translated jabra said 
it was an agony and a pleasure he added sitting in his 
study lined with books in arabic english and french as well as 
paintings and sculptures by himself and other iraqi artists 
it was something id always wanted to do id had this 
ambition since i was a young man he explained 
ever since i first read julius ceasar in jerusalem when i 
was a boy id always wondered if it was possible to make 
shakespeares characters talk in arabic without losing the force of 
his words in english 
when he studied at cambridge university in england he found 
that arabic translations of shakespeare were verbally awkward 
strangely static 
so he decided to do his own and found himself immersed in the 
almost impossible task of sustaining the same verbal charge 
the evocative imagery sustained metaphors diversity of rhythm and 
tone the eloquence and the word play into another language 
apart from such works as his novel hunters in a narrow 
street which was originally written in english and published in 
1960 and several collections of poetry he has written seven major 
novels in arabic among them the ship the search for walid 
masoud and the other rooms 
professor tonsi noted jabra and another novelist 
abdelrahman munir are considered the only two arab novelists 
whose influence could go beyond that of naguib mahfouz who won 
the 1988 nobel prize for literature 
jabra was born in bethlehem in pre1948 palestine the son of a 
christian farmer who fell on hard times forcing the family to move 
to jerusalem 
there jabra quit school to work as a carpenter and plumber but 
he continued studying at the arab college and later went to 
cambridge in 195254 he studied at harvard 
he returned to palestine in 1943 and worked as a teacher in 
jerusalem before being driven into exile at the age of 29 when 
the state of israel was declared 
exile has been one of the central creative forces of his life 
engendering a passion for his arab heritage and arab nationalism 
he converted to islam in baghdad where he wound up in 1948 
he taught english literature at baghdads college of arts and 
he said preached change unashamedly 
he said he told his students we lost palestine because we had 
confronted a ruthless force with an outmoded tradition 
we had been cheated and betrayed by thousands of years of 
decay weve been victims of our insane rhetoric 
jabra noted as he puffed on his everpresent pipe change has 
to begin with a change of vision with a new way of looking at 
things 
jabras understanding of the west and european literature has 
combined with a burning belief shared by many arab intellectuals 
that the arab world has to change in all facets of life to survive 
and preserve its rich heritage 
the heroes of his novels are generally arab intellectuals 
standing alone facing up to the unknown and dreaming of change 
like other arab writers who have long fought decline and 
darkness jabra believes he has a special obligation to the young 
arab generation and that as a writer he can do that only through 
vision and awareness 
to that end he now writes exclusively in arabic 
i write not only to renew my own energy but above all to 
renew the energy within the new arab generation he said

for some of the rock groups of the 1960s and 70s 
the comeback trail includes a gig in the courtroom to try and 
reclaim their household names 
lineups have changed founding members have retired died or 
gone solo and in some cases the reunion has entailed lawyers 
poring over dusty old files to establish who owns the name of the 
group 
members of the british group yes which won popularity in the 
70s have just fought through tortuous litigation to win a 
solomonic ruling on use of the name another british group pink 
floyd suffered similar tribulations 
the american rockpop group the byrds had to reunite temporarily 
for three concerts in california last january just to lay renewed 
legal claim to their name because three different groups all 
fragments of the original were calling themselves the byrds 
a lot of acts are getting back together again and touring so 
the name is absolutely crucial said patrick isherwood a music 
industry lawyer at frere cholmeley the londonbased law firm that 
represents the beatles in a sense thats your passport to make 
money or not 
the names count for a lot thats why pink floyd had their 
battle with roger waters said brian howard a lawyer at 
russells a london law firm that represents waters at the end of 
the day if youve got a good name you sell albums before people 
have even listened to them 
pink floyd illustrates the power of the name 
forbes magazine estimates that the groups reunion tour and 
album momentary loss of reason pulled in 56 million and put 
pink floyd among the 10 biggest entertainment earners of 1989 
meanwhile the latest album by waters who founded pink floyd in 
1967 but went solo five years ago sold fewer than 1 million copies 
had waters kept the name pink floyd and used different artists 
he might have been much more successful says chris gilbert a 
londonbased music industry manager because you could argue 
that waters was the creative spearhead of that band from day one 
waters sought a court order to dissolve the band calling it a 
spent creative force he lost but the giant pig that has been 
one of the groups bestknown stage props is still in litigation 
nostalgia buffs provide a large market for oldies and 
middleaged classic rock bands are taking advantage of the 
nostalgia wave 
the rolling stones are touring north america selling out four 
shea stadium shows in six hours the kinks are on the road as are 
crosby stills and nash jefferson airplane and the stray cats are 
reuniting while the who has just completed a successful tour 
in yess case a us district court ruled in july that four 
former members of the rock band led by singer jon anderson cannot 
use the name the judge awarded ownership to bass player chris 
squire who said he paid a hefty sum for it the four musicians are 
touring under their own names but billboards advertise an evening 
of yes music 
a bands name is particularly important when it comes to 
merchandising 
its the ultimate brand name gilbert said in an interview 
its as valuable as kit kat or gordons gin when you think of 
the sums of money going into those brand names and then multiply 
them by the creative care and measure thats gone into a groups 
name you can see why someone is upset not to be able to use that 
name 
entertainment industry lawyer alexis grower said the name 
battles began with fleetwood mac in the late 1960s when their 
manager who had registered fleetwood mac under his name 
attempted to retain it after the band had replaced him 
fleetwood mac got the name even though the exmanager went out 
and hired four other people grower said the court established 
the precedent that it doesnt matter who has the ownership of the 
name what matters is who the public thinks the name is 
the image of bands that once stood for the counterculture now 
surrounding themselves with highpriced lawyers may not sit well 
with hardcore fans but some rockers may wish they had been with 
lawyers from the beginning

new plays are about to take centerstage in london 
as the theater capital moves away from the starfilled revivals and 
classic productions that have dominated recent seasons 
alan ayckbourn michael frayn and simon gray are just three of 
the wellknown english dramatists who will open new plays on 
londons commercial west end in the first six months of 1990 
howard barker and david hare two wellknown leftist 
playwrights will premiere three plays between them in londons 
governmentsubsidized theaters 
barker kicks off the activity with two plays starting 
performances jan 4 seven lears at the royal court which 
takes its title from shakespeares king lear and scenes from 
an execution at the almeida 
the latter brings twotime academy awardwinner glenda jackson 
back to the london stage following her performance this fall in a 
los angeles stage revival of edward albees whos afraid of 
virginia woolf 
the new play casts her as a painter in renaissance venice 
feb 8 sees the bow at the royal national theater of racing 
demon david hares play about four south london clergymen the 
show marks hares first play since his 1988 the secret rapture 
which had a long run at the national but flopped quickly this fall 
on broadway 
alan ayckbourns man of the moment the prolific authors 
36th play opens feb 14 with michael gambon tvs the singing 
detective heading the cast 
its my play with a swimming pool ayckbourn 50 said in an 
interview referring to the setting for one of the scenes the 
plays theme he added was what the media selects from people 
im always amazed that it picks out the people it likes and 
the people who might be nicer it leaves alone he said some of 
the nicest people on tv are the nastiest people in real life 
look look michael frayns first completely new play since 
his 1984 benefactors opens april 17 at the aldwych the 
dramatist has been busy lately translating and adapting the plays 
of anton chekhov and writing for television frayn who had 
broadway successes with both benefactors and noises off 
was reluctant to discuss his new plays plot 
silence is what one had better preserve at this point he 
said the play stars stephen fry and serena gordon and is directed 
by mike ockrent me and my girl 
simon gray who wrote butley and the common pursuit is 
expected to have a new play on the west end by the summer and john 
osborne and christopher hampton are two other noted playwrights 
readying new works 
the flurry of new writing contrasts with 1988 and 1989 when the 
primary theatrical excitement came from seeing stars do the 
classics vanessa redgrave in orpheus descending and dustin 
hoffman in the merchant of venice to name two london 
productions that traveled to broadway 
this past years most revelatory staging was trevor nunns 
tightly focused revival of william shakespeares othello for 
the royal shakespeare company the production paired tonywinning 
actor ian mckellen and opera singer willard white as iago and the 
jealous moor 
unlike recent years there are few new musicals to whet 
theatergoers appetites by far the most eagerly awaited are the 
british debuts of two shows by stephen sondheim sunday in the 
park with george opening march 15 at the royal national and 
into the woods which bows next fall on the west end

while president bush talks about a 
kinder gentler nation laura rosetree says everything about his 
face from his straight eyelids to his narrow nose and thinlipped 
smile suggests that bush isnt very keen on kindness 
and about those lips bush says read my lips about not 
raising taxes but what are his lips really saying 
what they suggest is that bush controls his speech very 
carefully says ms rosetree a selfproclaimed expert in 
analyzing faces to learn what they reveal about personality 
he doesnt say whatever hes really feeling or thinking she 
said if you literally read his lips they are proclaiming im 
not ever going to get sentimental on you im not going to be a 
bleeding heart 
ms rosetree 41 is a former selfdevelopment teacher who 
became interested in reading faces in new york in 1976 when 
she met an elderly chinese practitioner of an ancient method known 
as siang mien 
after a decade of research she says she developed her own 
psychic roadmap of the human face which she describes in a 
285page book titled i can read your face 
she claims that every facial feature from eyebrows to chin 
dimples can betray how people think behave and handle lifes 
challenges while most psychologists would scoff at such a claim 
ms rosetree says shes been hired by several businesses to train 
salespeople and real estate agents how to read the faces of 
prospective customers 
sitting in her sunny apartment in this washington suburb ms 
rosetree studied a closeup photo of bush and a videotape of a nov 
7 news conference for clues to his personality 
her conclusion bush is a hardnosed pragmatist and skeptic a 
diehard ideologue a shrewd negotiator and skilled conciliator an 
intellectual who revels in the realm of ideas a decisionmaker who 
respects facts disdains feelings and isnt afraid of criticism 
hes not a people person hes more of an idea person ms 
rosetree says even the small inner circle of bushs ear suggests 
that he listens for facts and objective information rather than 
feelings emotions or spiritual aspects she says 
kindness is not a major trait of george bushs judging by his 
face ms rosetree said he has other strengths but kindness 
is not one of those there are at least 10 facial traits that 
indicate kindness and bush doesnt have a single one 
when bush and mikhail s gorbachev met at the waterlogged malta 
summit she said they may have differed on some eastwest issues 
but they have noses in common long and straight with tips 
pointing down 
ms rosetree said that means bush and the soviet leader both 
tackle problems logically theyre good at longterm strategy and 
they have a strong sense of selfinterest but she says they are 
strikingly different in the shape of their eyelids 
bushs lower eyelids are straight meaning hes naturally wary 
of new people while gorbachevs are curved meaning he probably is 
the openhearted one of the two ms rosetree says 
to set the record straight she says bush is a macho man its 
right there in the semicircular knob on his prominent squarejawed 
chin 
that semicircle relates to being very proud of his 
masculinity the macho aspect forcefulness and being very 
sensitive to appearing weak in front of other people she said 
the wimp image in the presidential campaign must have bothered 
him excruciatingly she added 
his straight chin shows that he makes his major life decisions 
based on principles and ideology not on compassion or other 
peoples feelings this is not the chin of a santa claus its the 
chin of a crusader 
further she says the way bushs ears lie flat against his head 
indicates he is a strong conformist a stickler for correct 
behavior and intolerant of kooks and his deepset eyes she says 
suggest hed make an expert poker player 
his strong suit isnt hearts its clubs ms rosetree said

songs about the homeless tiananmen square 
international politics 
are you sure these are the hooters the philadelphia popsters 
with a penchant for hooks 
its not anything we set out to do in fact we wrote a lot of 
songs that had nothing to do with anything political said eric 
bazilian in explaining the genesis of the bands third lp zig 
zag 
but it seemed to be when the smoke cleared the political 
songs were the best songs and they fit together the best 
and so the hooters bouncing back from the disappointing sales 
of their second album one way home tried something different 
lyrically to match the catchy pop tunes of bazilian and partner 
rob hyman 
as political novices the hooters turned to some veterans for 
assistance peter paul and mary who contributed vocals to an 
updated version of the folk classic 500 miles 
bazilian and hyman wrote new verses to insert in hedy wests 
song after seeing television footage of the chinese students in 
tiananmen square particularly the shot of a lone student halting a 
row of tanks 
we were seeing that picture as we were recording the song 
we actually walked out and saw this tthe nyses composite index of all 
its listed common stocks rose 
60 to 19329 at the american stock exchange the market value 
index was up 34 at 37330

for the first time since turkey invaded 
in 1974 openings are appearing in the line that divides greek and 
turkish cypriots some see it as the first sign of a breakthrough 
toward reunification 
withlittle fanfare ordinary greek and turkish cypriots have 
been in touch with each other to seek an end to 15 years of 
political and religious division on this east mediterranean island 
contact between the two communities has been increasing 
noted columnist petros andreou in the cyprus mail an 
englishlanguage newspaper published in the greek cypriot sector 
at last the two sides are beginning to understand each 
others position 
events in eastern europe may have inspired the grassroots trend 
since the berlin wall began to crumble in november several groups 
from the rival communities have come together for the first time 
since the turkish army in 1974 seized the northern third of the 
island in the wake of a shortlived coup by those seeking union 
with greece 
the moslem turkish cypriot minority declared the 
turkishoccupied north a republic in 1983 but it is recognized 
only by turkey 
cyprus still has a long way to go before the barriers come down 
as they have in europe but columnist andreou said that the 
570000member christian greek cypriot communitys growing 
awareness of social and economic problems is finally taking the 
edge off their obsession with the islands divisions 
people are beginning to realize that theres more to life than 
the national question andreou wrote 
perhaps the same realization is crystallizing in the north if 
it is then its quite probable that people will eventually begin 
to shed all their nationalistic fixations and instead start to deal 
with what is really important how they can live in peace on this 
island 
since the invasion rauf denktash president of the northern 
statelet has banned turkish cypriots from visiting the greek 
sector and refused to allow greek cypriots to visit the north the 
greek cypriots have imposed no travel restrictions 
but denktash recently allowed the door to open a crack 
world war ii veterans from the two communities who fought side 
by side against the germans held an emotional reunion in the 
nomans land of the united nationspatrolled buffer zone in 
december old comradesinarms embraced complaining about their 
separation and voicing hopes of a settlement 
alpay durduran a member of the turkish cypriot parliament and 
leader of the newly formed opposition new cyprus party attended a 
public discussion in the greek sector of nicosia the islands 
divided capital on whether the two sides could live together again 
in harmony he described his visit as a unique and historic 
event 
a month earlier denktash allowed greek cypriot journalists to 
visit the turkish sector for the first time since the invasion and 
permitted turkish cypriot doctors to attend a buffer zone meeting 
with greek physicians 
united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar noted 
in december the recent relaxation in the crossing procedures by 
the turkish cypriot side and the growing number of contacts between 
groups of the two sides are positive developments which should be 
built on 
until now most of the drive for reunification has come from the 
greek cypriots 200000 of whom were forced to flee the turkish 
north they left homes businesses and roots put down many 
generations ago 
the turkish cypriots outnumbered 51 believe that having their 
own enclave affords protection from the sectarian violence that 
plagued the island for years before 1974 when some 40000 turks 
fled north from the predominntly greek south 
unsponsored talks between denktash and president george 
vassiliou the greek cypriot leader on reunifying cyprus in a 
bizonal federation have deadlocked 
the greek cypriots are reluctant to meet denktashs demands for 
political parity or make concessions they believe would be 
tantamount to recognizing a state they and the united nations brand 
illegal 
denktash rejects un resolutions calling for the withdrawal 
from the north of an estimated 30000 turkish army troops and 
35000 to 50000 turkish settlers and the return of greek cypriots 
who fled in 1974 
denktash argues that this would create security problems for his 
community and trigger fresh intercommunal clashes 
but an emerging opposition bloc in the north believes 
reunification with the proper guarantees for both sides is the 
right road 
durduran the turkish cypriot member of parliament acknowledged 
that both sides still fear and mistrust each other 
both communities have committed atrocities against each 
other he said but if we want to live in a federated state 
democratically respecting human rights we must avoid the mistakes 
of the past 
todays challenge is can we honestly care about each other 
can we escape from the past our mistakes will teach us how to 
proceed to build a common future together 
a predominantly greek cypriot gathering loudly applauded his 
words 
the greek cypriot newspaper phileleftheros said it takes 
courage and vision for a turkish cypriot politician to come to the 
greek cypriot side and address a greek cypriot audience ignoring 
the overt and covert threats and intimidation of the chauvinists of 
his side 
denktash maintains that turkish cypriots oppose reunification 
but durduran rejected that 
the leadership in the north has tried to tie our tongues and 
forbid us from using the word reunification he said 
when we talk in a language that annoys our leaders we get 
bombs at our doors 
two small bombs have exploded outside dudurans home in 
nicosias turkish sector causing slight damage in recent weeks 
reunification is also supported by mustafa akinci mayor of 
nicosias turkish sector who for years has been quietly working 
with his greek cypriot opposite number lellos demetriades to 
build sectarian bridges 
akinci has said he will run against denktash in presidential 
elections in the north this coming spring hes taking on 
denktashs powerful party machine and an akinci victory is seen as 
very likely to spur reunification

from classroom news video to waitingroom tv 
hardcover book inserts to spanish magazines whittle communications 
keeps inventing ways for advertisers to reach the audiences they 
want 
the gutsy media company has angered madison avenue critics who 
say its new ad vehicles arent roadtested and may not work but 
whittle has forced rivals to at least think about similar 
strategies and concoct a few of their own 
whittle executives say the competition is one reason they are 
scrambling to devise other offbeat ways to reach consumers through 
the power of advertising they say their approaches are the best 
we have minor competition in virtually every area of our 
business said whittle founder and chairman christopher whittle 
but he said no competitor had yet matched all 40odd areas in 
which whittle offers advertisers a focused approach to reach 
specific customers from highschool sophomores to bluechip ceos 
whittle a knoxville tennbased concern 50 percent owned by 
multimedia giant time warner inc has ambitious expansion plans 
that easily could double the 180 million in revenue expected for 
the year ended next june 30 
in november whittle debuted the first in a series of short 
hardcover books with ads interspersed among the pages like those 
in conventional magazines 
that concept has stirred considerable skepticism among big book 
publishers who historically have limited ads in hardcover books to 
short plugs for an authors other works on the inside jackets 
whittle said its books written by such wellknown authors as david 
halberstam and john kenneth galbraith will be sent free to people 
whom the company considers american opinion leaders 
whittle perhaps is best known for its channel one daily news 
program for the classroom scheduled to debut in march the company 
is signing up schools nationwide for the program which has aroused 
heated debate among educators because it is sponsored by 
advertisers like ordinary television shows 
schools get free video equipment for subscribing to channel one 
but in return they subject captive audiences of students to ads for 
products ranging from jeans to dandruff shampoo 
the uproar over channel one evidently was enough to convince 
another pioneering media entrepreneur ted turner to launch a 
rival news show for high schoolers in august turners program 
contains no ads but subscribers must use their own video gear 
unfazed by the channel one controversy whittle is evaluating 
whether to make televised programming available in another 
captiveaudience situation doctors waiting rooms some physicians 
already subscribe to whittles special reports quarterly magazines 
for patients to browse 
the company plans a spanishlanguage magazine distributed 
through medical offices and beauty salons in hispanic 
neighborhoods whittle also will produce brief programs for 
spanishlanguage tv 
additional projects are under study a magazine for women in 
beauty salons and a magazine for senior citizens for example 
whittles aggressive approach has raised questions about whether 
the company is moving too fast into too many untested areas but 
the companys founder said it was designed to concoct ways to 
communicate a message to a tightly defined group 
for virtually everything we are doing now we started planning 
three years ago said whittle a doctors son and 
multimillionaire who started the company as a college graduate in 
1971 
while some projects have died in the laboratory whittle said 
i cant remember putting a property into the marketplace that 
doesnt work 
one reason so many projects can be launched simultaneously he 
said is that the company is divided into five parts each headed 
by a partner responsible only for its performance 
ed winter for instance runs the channel one school project 
while peter finn heads the division with the book and 
spanishlanguage projects and alan greenberg is in charge of 
publishing special reports magazine and evaluating a pilot project 
the company is calling waiting room tv 
while they operate separately one divisions work often helps 
the others 
whittle said the staff of 70 trained to sell the channel one 
system in schools probably will be pressed into service next year 
to help sell waiting room tv to physicians if the company proceeds 
with that project the same goes for the channel one network of 
equipment installers 
we realized that to develop all of that infrastructure and 
then to dismantle it didnt make any sense whittle said 
he usually goes directly to top management of companies such as 
kraft general foods and federal express co with his proposals 
bypassing ad agencies he argues that his magazines and tv programs 
give advertisers the opportunity to precisely target the people 
they want as buyers without having to compete for airtime or page 
space purchased by other advertisers 
whittles approach has aroused some hostility among traditional 
madison avenue ad agencies some ad executives also have expressed 
skepticism about whittles claimed results 
none of his media projects are proven yet said richard 
kostyra director of media services at j walter thompson co one 
of the largest and bestknown ad companies 
kostyra said whittles own audience research results for special 
reports waitingroom magazines for example are inconclusive this 
has complicated the agencys efforts to advise clients on where to 
place their ads 
other agency executives speaking privately said they suspected 
whittles waiting room tv project might be an effort to boost ad 
renewals for special reports now in their second year 
whittle called such talk competitive chatter from rivals and 
ad agents who feel threatened 
he said his company had to create its own audience research 
system because whittle products are different the measurement 
system for newsstand magazines cant measure what we do he said 
special reports overseer greenberg said he expects current 
sponsors will buy twothirds of the advertising space in the 
magazines and new advertisers will buy the rest 
several special reports advertisers declined comment on their 
plans but kraft general foods spokesman mike caruso said that 
company doesnt dispute whittles research 
greenberg denied that waiting room tv was promoted now to 
invigorate renewals in special reports nonetheless advertisers in 
the magazines get the first opportunity to advertise on the tv 
program 
whittle said the company was promoting the waiting room tv 
project because it knew waiting rooms were a powerful media 
environment we knew we had better get into that business or 
someone else will he said 
he was right another company headed by former advertising and 
programming executive frederick doner is testing the good health 
channel a program on health topics with commercials to debut in 
doctors waiting rooms by april

the bigticket item in 1990 for agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter is the uruguay round of trade talks in 
geneva followed by a new farm bill in congress 
ok but what about other closertohome consumer issues such as 
nutrition labeling or fish inspection or a sensible approach to 
rural development 
those topics so far have been relatively muted in the 
agriculture departments agenda overshadowed in the yeutter camp 
by the drumbeat of global trade and farm bill strategy 
in a recent yearend assessment yeutter characterized 1989 as 
one of the best ever years for the american farmer 
the yeutter list of top priority issues faced by usda in 1989 
his first year as secretary included world agricultural trade 
food safety the environment research and serving rural 
america in general 
we have worked hard this year to lay the groundwork for 
enactment of the 1990 farm bill and for successful conclusion of 
the uruguay round yeutter said we now need a strong vigorous 
push if we are to open up market opportunities for the future 
the geneva talks held under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade are due to conclude in a year if successful they will 
be a big step toward reducing and eliminating distortions in global 
agricultural trade 
eileen kugler of the washingtonbased consumer group public 
voice for food and health policy was asked in a telephone 
interview what kind of recommendations she had for yeutter in the 
new year 
the federal meat and poultry inspection system in usda should be 
strengthened she said and microbiological criteria should be set 
for meat and poultry products to help cut down on contamination by 
salmonella and other harmful organisms 
in the national school lunch program kugler said the usda 
should take the leadership in reducing fat and set maximum 
permitted levels of fat in meals served to children 
another item on her wish list for 1990 is better labeling on 
food products to show nutrition information in a clear 
informative manner 
kugler said she would like to see usda take the lead in 
promoting safer food supplies to assert itself in such a way that 
when congress approves legislation for fish inspection the 
department can show itself to be more than capable of 
implementing a strong fish inspection program 
overall she said yeutters first year has included both pluses 
and minuses 
we think that in some cases hes headed in the right 
direction and his hearts in the right place kugler said 
weve given the bush administration a honeymoon so to speak and 
now wed like to see some real action 
most general farm organizations and commodity groups see at 
least some good things coming out of the gatt talks that occupy so 
much of yeutters dream for a futuristic agriculture 
no one really quarrels with gaining better foreign access for 
us commodities few would argue against the objective of getting 
the 12nation european economic community to open its doors wider 
to us goods for example 
there are many differences however on how great would be the 
benefits or losses to american farmers from a global free 
market arrangement and whether the geneva negotiations are a 
major step toward the abandonment of us price support programs 
bob frederick legislative director for the national grange 
said he wishes that the eec instead of talking like a world 
trading leader would start acting like one by opening markets and 
reducing its tradedistorting subsidies 
another item on fredericks 1990 wish list would be that all 
us farm organizations and commodity groups stop speaking in 
tongues that sound like a babel of voices when it comes to 
agricultural policies 
frederick said he also wishes that yeutter would place more 
emphasis on keeping agriculture a part of rural development and not 
let congress solve rural problems by imposing urban solutions 
asked to elaborate frederick said the grange for some time has 
been critical of rural economic remedies that would involve 
factories and electric generating facilities to create a 
smalltown detroit environment 
by doing that he said a communitys base would be shifted from 
agricultural to industrial or business in character 
many communities got in trouble when they were all based on 
agriculture and frederick said it could be as disastrous to shift 
entirely away from agriculture to one particular kind of industry 
rural development has never been high on usdas list during 
any administration frederick said there have been stabs at 
it hopefully we can get it organized 
frederick said he fears that important aspects of agriculture 
may get lost in the shuffle as farm and rural development 
legislation now in congress is implemented 
theres very little mention if any of the maintenance of 
agriculture as the nucleus for rural communities he said not 
every rural community has the resources or the infrastructures to 
take on economic development so theyre going to have to build on 
what that have and thats agriculture

on the eve of a new year and a new decade an 
agonizing image haunts the emblems of hope for the 1980s are 
ending as they began with americans held hostage 
and the scrapbook of the 80s could hardly be complete without a 
collection of outoffocus instant photographs of longheld 
hostages in lebanese captivity sent out from time to time by men 
waging what they deem to be holy war 
for most of the decade there have been american hostages in the 
middle east the names and faces have changed but not the torment 
ten years ago there were 52 in tehran and the hostage impasse 
was a crisis that helped undo a president ending only as another 
came to office 
now there are eight in beirut and the air of crisis has long 
since yielded to a grim seldom spoken concession that for all its 
might there seems to be nothing the united states can do to force 
the safe release of its people 
the standing government statement is a demand that 
hostagetakers and their sponsors free all the captives and that 
the united states is pursuing every possible avenue to that end 
but there are no known avenues 
president bush calls the situation one of enormous frustration 
its on my mind an awful lot he said in a review of his first 
year in office 
the us hostages are among 18 westerners kidnapped and believed 
held in lebanon terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press has been held longer than any other hostage 
nearly five years now he was seized in beirut on march 16 1985 
they are held by militant shiite moslems aligned with iran with 
different factions claiming to control groups of hostages anderson 
and thomas sutherland are held by a group calling itself islamic 
jihad or holy war it has made one demand from the beginning 
offering to free them in exchange for 15 shiite moslems jailed in 
kuwait for terrorist bombings 
the administration stands firm on the nodeals policy declared 
by ronald reagan who secretly breached it with the iran 
armsforhostages dealings disclosed in 1986 
the new iranian government said at one point last fall that it 
would seek to help gain the hostages release if the united states 
would free assets frozen during the tehran hostage crisis assets 
disputes are in the hands of an international tribunal in the 
hague which has been releasing funds it determines to belong to 
iran the administration insists there is no link although after 
one decision releasing assets to iran bush said he hoped it might 
help the situation 
it hasnt so far nor have administration suggestions of 
improved relations that could benefit iran should the hostages be 
released 
one american hostage lt col william r higgins was killed 
and his captors issued a photograph of his hanging body last summer 
after israel kidnapped a shiite leader in southern lebanon while 
bush denounced the brutality there was no retaliation he was said 
to have been preparing reprisals in the event death threats against 
a second hostage were carried out 
but the plight of the other american hostages limits us 
options 
a week after he took office reagan had said he wouldnt stand 
for hostage episodes our policy will be one of swift and 
effective retribution he said in welcoming the tehran embassy 
hostages seized on nov 4 1979 and held until his inauguration 
day jan 20 1981 
it was a warning on which he could not deliver when his own 
hostage problems began three years later with the kidnappings in 
lebanon 
lacking options or answers bush has uttered no such warnings 
and has played down the hostage situation he inherited 
the number is small the victims are isolated and unseen it is 
an unrelenting problem but not a crisis forcing its way onto the 
national agenda 
nevertheless the haunting figures of americans held hostage 
stand as symbols of the 1980s and as unfinished business in the 
new year

poised on the brink of a new decade the world 
will pause tonight for just a second 
a leap second will occur at the very end of dec 31 1989 
making it the longest day of the year 
the extra second is needed to keep the worlds clocks in time 
with the rotation of the planet according to government 
timekeeping officials 
the turning of the earth has always been the time standard for 
humans who marked the passage of days by the hours of light and 
darkness and years by the seasons as the planet moved around the 
sun 
but while early timekeeping sought to measure the planets 
movement todays clocks might be called more accurate than the 
earth itself 
time measured by the rotation of the earth is not uniform when 
compared to time kept by atomic clocks reports the us naval 
observatory the government agency in charge of keeping track of 
what time it is 
as a result of this difference atomic clocks can get out of 
sync with the earth and have to be adjusted since its the atomic 
clocks that are used to set all other clocks a leap second has to 
be added or skipped from time to time to make up the difference 
fifteen leap seconds have been added to human time since an 
international time agreement was signed in 1972 when a full 10 
seconds had to be added to the atomic clocks to get them together 
with the earth this will be the first leap second in two years 
the leap second will occur officially at 23 hours 59 minutes 
and 60 seconds coordinated universal time when a onesecond pause 
will occur before the arrival of zero hours on new years day 
coordinated universal time popularly known as greenwich mean 
time is the time experienced in london england and serves as a 
standard reference for the worlds timekeepers 
in the united states the actual adjustment will be made one 
second before 7 pm est 
atomic clocks are extremely accurate because they measure time 
based on the frequency of regular events in atoms of cesium 
hydrogen rubidium or mercury 
the national institute of standards and technology formerly 
called the national bureau of standards is the government agency 
in charge of timekeeping 
over the years the rotation of the earth has tended to slow down 
somewhat and thus all 15 leap seconds needed so far have had to be 
added to atomic clocks if the earth were to speed up leap seconds 
would have to be subtracted

researchers have made the startling discovery 
that some chemical messages sent by genes are changed before they 
arrive at their destinations a finding that challenges a central 
tenet of genetics 
its an absolutely astounding concept said olke uhlenbeck 
of the university of colorado in boulder a biochemist familiar 
with the research nobody has the foggiest idea how it works 
the phenomenon is called rna editing one of its 
discoverers larry simpson of the university of california los 
angeles said the discovery could lead to new treatments for 
african sleeping sickness a similar south american ailment called 
chagas disease and leishmaniasis a disfiguring skin disease 
those diseases are all caused by the group of parasites called 
trypanosomes the first evidence for rna editing was found in 
trypanosomes by rob benne of the university of amsterdam who 
reported the discovery in 1986 
rna editing has since been found in a slightly different form in 
a slime mold called physarum in measles virus and in the human 
gene for the protein called apolipoprotein b associated with heart 
disease 
most recently independent teams in france and canada reported 
in nature magazine in october that they had discovered rna editing 
in wheat plants 
researchers do not yet know how widespread rna editing is or why 
it evolved but it appears to be a normal part of the functioning 
of some genes in trypanosomes for example researchers found that 
certain genes were missing crucial elements yet the elements were 
present in the genetic messenger chemicals associated with those 
genes 
rna editing is the name that researchers gave to the process 
by which the missing elements were restored 
although the initial discovery was made in 1986 the existence 
of the phenomenon has not been widely accepted until now says 
another discoverer kenneth stuart of the seattle institute for 
biomedical research 
it was initially met with extreme skepticism said stuart 
who has occasionally collaborated with simpson when stuart 
presented some findings to biologists last year they were met 
with disbelief he said 
now he said other research groups have confirmed the findings 
and more clearcut examples of rna editing have been found we 
now have three examples in which more than 50 percent of the gene 
has been edited stuart said 
its been found by too many people in too many places now 
said uhlenbeck who studies interactions between rna and proteins 
the reason i like it is that rna has consistently been putting 
out surprises for the last couple of years and this seems to be 
the next one 
earlier work on rna splicing a different process in which rna 
is altered in accord with genetic instructions earned a nobel 
prize last year for thomas cech of the university of colorado in 
boulder and sidney altman of yale university in new haven conn 
rna editing differs in an important way from rna splicing and 
other forms of rna processing that were known previously stuart 
said rna editing is the only process that appears to require the 
addition of information not provided by the genes 
it means that the genetic system has more capability than we 
had previously recognized he said people who think about 
things like this would not have predicted that such a complex 
mechanism for changing information even existed 
the reason for the initial skepticism was that rna editing 
seemed to violate what biologists call the central dogma of 
genetics which holds that genetic information contained in the 
genes passes from the genes by way of a messenger chemical to 
proteins 
the genes made of dna or deoxyribonucleic acid direct the 
manufacture of messenger rna made of ribonucleic acid the 
messenger rna travels from the cell nucleus to protein factories 
called ribosomes where the rna directs the manufacture of the 
myriad proteins the cell needs to survive and reproduce 
in rna editing changes are made in the rna after it is produced 
by the genes but before it arrives at the ribosomes 
imagine a book that has less than half its pages stuart 
said and somehow upon reading it all the missing pages get 
magically put back in or you type it into your computer and all 
the vowels are missing and when you send it to the printer all the 
vowels somehow get put back in 
the discovery of rna editing poses a difficult question where 
are the missing pages or the missing vowels coming from where 
does the cell get the information to restore or delete parts of the 
messenger rna 
if the information is not coming from the genes the central 
dogma of genetics has been violated 
what i hypothesize is that the genetic information actually 
resides in the genes in encrypted form in an abbreviated or 
compact form said stuart if that is the case then the central 
dogma would not be violated the editing information would be 
coming from the genes 
simpson who calls the edited genes cryptogenes also 
believes that the information added by the editing is somehow 
hidden in the genetic code 
the discovery of rna editing in trypanosomes could lead to the 
development of a drug that would kill them without harming human 
cells simpson said 
these are very important human and animal parasites he 
said if rna editing is found to be widespread in human cells it 
is likely to occur in a different form drugs that attack 
trypanosomes by interfering with rna editing might therefore have 
no ill effects in humans 
we could kill the parasite and not harm the host he said 
any time you find something thats unique to a parasite its 
incredibly significant 
simpson said there are similarities in the rna editing in the 
trypanosomes and in physarum the slime mold in both organisms 
the rna editing occurs in the cells energyproducing structures 
called mitochondria 
what gets me excited is if the trypanosome type and the 
physarum type are the same which we dont know yet then that 
implies there was a common ancestor that had rna editing in its 
mitochondria 
if rna editing was present in the ancient ancestor of 
trypanosomes and physarum then it must have developed early in 
evolution and could have by now spread to many other organisms 
simpson said

ozonedepleting chlorofluorocarbons are 
being absorbed by the soil and oceans according to scientists who 
say they still dont know where exactly the chemicals are going or 
what the process means 
researchers aslam khalil and reinhold rasmussen were studying 
australian termite mounds to see how they dumped the gas methane 
into the atmosphere when their measurements indicated that the soil 
was absorbing cfcs 
and its not confined to australian termite mounds we looked 
at areas of brazil and found it we also found it in chinese rice 
fields said khalil a physicist at the oregon graduate institute 
of science and technology 
the process may have only a minor effect on the atmosphere but 
to khalil it suggests that cfcs interaction with the environment 
is more complex than has been thought i dont think on a global 
scale this will be significant but compare the greenhouse gases 
they have only a minute effect by themselves whats important is 
their additive effect 
two other atmospheric scientists f sherwood roland of the 
university of california irvine and mario molina of massachusetts 
institute of technology agree the mechanism of chlorofluorocarbon 
absorption by the soil may be worth studying but that the effect 
on the atmosphere is minimal 
its not a process thats materially shortening the 
chlorofluorocarbon lifetime in the atmosphere roland said 
its not a major sink 
the ocean appears to be merely storing the cfcs the scientists 
said cfcs are permanently lost in atmospheric processes but in 
the ocean thats not so its just dissolving said khalil 
the oceans capacity is huge so its possible they will build 
up over a very long time scale on the order of thousands of 
years roland said but only about 1 percent of all cfcs are in 
the ocean now which again doesnt change the overall calculation 
very much 
a much more serious concern is the amount of chlorofluorocarbons 
stored in polyurethane insulation vehicle air conditioning units 
and home refrigerators the scientists say 
the ban on cfcs in aerosol sprays merely put them into 
polyurethane insulating foam just being stored for future 
release khalil said thats more alarming than soil uptake 
which at best is good at worst is nothing 
chlorofluorocarbons were widely used in aerosol propellants 
until evidence mounted they were contributing to the depletion of 
the earths protective ozone layer which shields the planet from 
harmful ultraviolet radiation 
in may representatives of 81 nations met in helsinki and called 
for the elimination of cfc use by the year 2000 their declaration 
seeks to toughen the provisions of a 1987 ozoneprotection treaty 
called the montreal protocol 
about 85 percent of the cfcs manufactured already have been 
released into the atmosphere roland said for aerosol 
propellants its about a sixmonth lag time for automobile air 
conditioners its about two to three years for home refrigerators 
it may be 20 years 
what that means is that well reach the maximum concentration 
of cfcs in the atmosphere about five to 10 years after 
manufacturing stops 
khalil said in a way its not bad that cfcs are tied up 
somewhere so their release is slow and wont bother anybody its 
better than going into the air in large quantities 
greenhouse gases that could contribute to global warming such 
as methane are a far more serious threat he roland and molina 
said 
you can ban cfc production in the narrow highly 
industrialized band of cities in the northern hemisphere khalil 
said but you cant ban methane or carbon dioxide you cant tell 
bacteria to stop making it

peanut butter sandwiches and apple juice day 
after day after day dinner table negotiations over exactly how 
many peas a child will eat how many forkfuls of spinach whats a 
parent to do 
finicky is pretty normal for lots of kids said vicki 
lansky author of feed me im yours and common sense will 
indicate whether a child has gone beyond fussy to worrisome 
parents should not be shortorder cooks or spend every dinner 
pleading eat your broccoli lansky said 
easier said than done right 
dinner neednt be a battleground if parents make nonnegotiable 
rules which most children will follow said dr william dietz of 
bostons new england medical center citing the wide use of cod 
liver oil a generation or so ago 
talk about a terrible food but the message and the culture 
was that cod liver oil was good for kids so millions of kids 
obediently opened their mouths and swallowed that stuff and it was 
awful he said 
its more the dynamic than the childs eating per se said 
ellyn satter author of how to get your kid to eat but not 
too much i recommend a division of responsibilities in 
feeding which says essentially that the parent is responsible for 
what is offered and when and where its up to the child to 
decide what to eat and whether to eat 
parents have to judge whether a finicky child truly doesnt like 
whats on the table is trying to get attention or has some other 
motive 
a lot of times kids are trying to push their parents to see 
how far they can go said martha stone a nutritionist at 
colorado state university saying yes and no to food is one way 
of exerting control 
its also natural for children to play with food 
toddlers are exploring trying to develop a sense of what does 
or doesnt taste good learning how to feed themselves all those 
add up to finicky said dr ronald kleinman of massachusetts 
general hospital 
telling a child who refuses to eat that theres no more food 
until the next meal is ok that throws the situation back to the 
child a choice of eating or being hungry stone said parents 
must be consistent about such rules dietz said you have to be 
wiling to let them go hungry 
parents also should respect strong food dislikes and not give 
rewards for eating if a child rejects a food once serve it again 
as many as 10 times sometimes children need to grow accustomed to 
new tastes and try to wait out food jags which begin around 18 
months and can occur throughout childhood 
what counts is a balanced diet protein fruits and vegetables 
dairy and grains even if only one or two things are eaten from 
each group 
they dont have to have variety in their lives at that age 
they have to have the nutrients to grow kleinman said with his 
own children now 12 and 14 kleinman and his wife only made food 
an issue if meals were skipped we kind of insist that at least 
two times a day we see them eating a meal 
its important to get a pediatricians opinion on whether a 
childs weight is appropriate for height several experts noted 
but despite reports of welloff parents underfeeding youngsters to 
keep them thin children are more likely to face problems today 
from too much food they should not be forced to clean their plates 
and usually are the best judges of how much to eat stone said 
keep in mind that the grownup way of eating is not necessarily 
a pattern to be admired or emulated satter said grownups have 
pretty systematically learned to ignore their internal cues 
the best way to prevent obesity she said is to nurture 
childrens exquisite senstivity to their own hunger

us textile imports rose by 13 percent and 
their value climbed to more than 32 billion in 1989 the american 
textile manufacturers institute said 
imports of cloth and clothes increased to 1219 billion square 
meters this year from 1074 billion square meters in 1988 the 
institute said wednesday the us market though increased by 
only 4 percent the industry group said 
imports were valued at 3236 billion compared with 2963 
billion last year the biggest increases came from china and taiwan 
and smaller increases from canada and thailand institute 
spokeswoman deborah anderson said 
us imports are held down by a series of agreements between 
industrial countries and third world exporters textiles are a 
major industrial export of third world countries since large 
quantities can be produced with labor that requires little training 
us exports rose to 5952 billion from 5226 billion last 
year aftertax profits of the us textile industry rose to an 
estimated 17 billion from 16 billion in 1988 
this year brought still larger numbers of textile and apparel 
imports into this country which had a direct negative impact on 
employment in the domestic industry said institute president

the commerce department has ruled that imports 
of mechanical transfer presses from japan were being sold in the 
united states at less than fair value 
mechanical presses are automatic metalforming machine tools 
machines that are used to make other machines 
with the ruling wednesday by the commerce department the us 
international trade commission now has 45 days to determine whether 
the lowcost imports are injuring us manufacturers of the same 
products 
if the commission finds that us companies are being hurt then 
the commerce department will issue a final order imposing higher 
duties on imports of the mechanical presses from japan 
the department proposed antidumping duties of 1516 percent on 
komatsu limited 749 percent on aida engineering limited and 1451 
percent on all other japanese companies manufacturing the 
mechanical presses 
the us investigation began last january after a complaint was 
filed by the verson division of allied products corp two unions

cbs and abc have rejected a commercial for a 
cold medicine that features the leaders of the superpowers in a 
play on the term cold war 
the two television networks said wednesday they would not run 
scheringplough corp commercials for the cold remedy drixoral 
featuring president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
unless the company obtains permission from the two heads of state 
schering is using pictures of bush and gorbachev at their recent 
summit talks in malta in a television and newspaper advertising 
campaign that starts today 
but cbs and abc notified the companys ad agency wednesday that 
they would not run the ads without government permission said kent 
roman an account supervisor for the agency messner vetere berger 
carey schmetterer nbc still plans to run the ads and schering is 
considering placing them on cable television channels he said 
in the past the white house has sent stiff ceaseanddesist 
warnings to companies using the presidents picture to make him 
appear to endorse a product 
schering did not ask bushs permission before making the ads 
company officials said 
presidential aides with bush in texas were unavailable for 
comment wednesday a secretary in the white house press office said 
several principals of the ad aency worked on commercials for 
bushs 1988 presidential campaign 
they schering should obtain the consent of the white house 
and soviet authorities said matthew margo a vice president for 
program practices at cbs it is not appropriate to use the 
presidency to sell products he said 
margo said however that cbs would run the commercials if the 
leaders gave their permission 
abc officials couldnt be reached for comment late wednesday on 
their refusal to run the ads 
tom feitel a senior brand manager of schering said nbc plans 
to air the commercial and newspapers will run the ads 
it is extremely tasteful he said in a telephone interview 
we feel theres no attempt to make it appear that either of the

wholesale vegetable prices have tripled in some 
cases as florida farmers scramble to harvest crops that survived a 
deadly twonight freeze and plant replacement vegetables 
a lot of people have a builtin resistance to paying over a 
dollar a pound for tomatoes or over a dollar a head for lettuce 
said pete packett spokesman for the state department of 
agriculture some people will obviously choose other foods until 
the price comes back down 
prices jumped wednesday at the wholesale level as vegetables 
harvested before the freeze saturday and sunday night are shipped 
from cold storage to stores primarily in the east and in midwest 
the pipeline stays filled for three to seven days in advance 
of any major prices change in the marketplace said reggie brown 
spokesman for the florida fruit and vegetable association in 
orlando youll start seeing it showing up probably within a 
week 
wholesalers are seeing the early effects of the freeze and 
passing them along 
everything has just tripled in price green cabbage was doing 
about 875 a box and theyre asking over 20 for it now said 
paul graff manager of the len strom brokerage in miami zucchini 
is way up in the 25 range which was between 11 and 12 before 
and so it goes 
all of the states major vegetables including tomatoes bell 
peppers sweet corn lettuce cucumbers and celery have been hurt 
brown said 
collier county agricultural agent steve dobbs estimated 150 
million damage to vegetables in the immokalee area alone a prime 
growing district southwest of lake okeechobee 
in the near term 40 to 60 days were going to see some very 
strong prices come out of florida said brown then about 60 to 
90 days down the road well probably see a large return in the 
marketplace of volume and well see those prices fall 
but even with the bitter cold taken into consideration the us 
department of agriculture is predicting a modest 3 percent to 5 
percent rise in consumer food prices for 1990 
buyers for lakelandbased publix super markets inc the 
nations eightlargest chain with 370 stores in florida have been 
told it will be another day or two before the full extent of crop 
damage is determined 
its a devastating blow but nobody is pressing any panic 
buttons because of the alternative sources on standby said 
publix vice president bill schroter referring to substitute 
supplies from california mexico and latin america 
but the widespread arctic chill also hurt crops elsewhere 
further clouding the supply 
not only did we get it but texas got it packett said 
were the kingpins in the market now youre going to be looking 
all the way across the country to california and mexico for 
imported produce 
more than 80 percent of the states 700000acre citrus crop was 
still on the trees when the freeze hit but a large juice reserve 
in florida a boom year in brazil and swift processing of iced 
oranges were expected to stabilize juice prices 
the fresh citrus growing region of indian river county showed 
limited damage packett said

a united mine workers spokesman terms 
as ridiculous a lawsuit filed by a strikebound coal company 
alleging the unions selective strike program is a thinly veiled 
racketeering operation 
the 60 million lawsuit was filed wednesday in us district 
court in beckley by new beckley mining corp which also announced 
it is closing its glen daniel mine in raleigh county because of 
alleged union violence including murderous attacks on 
employees 
the decision to shut down and seal new beckleys glen daniel 
mine was reached because the continued organized violence 
orchestrated against new beckley by the umwa has reached an 
intolerable level of acceptibility by any rational standard said 
new beckley president jay sasell at a press conference 
marauding pickets continue to cause great hardship upon the 
company and its families on a daily basis we are disappointed that 
the umwa has chosen this path of destruction of a fine company 
forcing us to take these severe steps to prevent further harm to 
our employees sasell said 
the umw has been on strike against new beckley since january 
idling 130 miners and also is engaged in a bitter strike against 
the pittston coal group inc in west virginia virginia and 
kentucky 
the 53page lawsuit cites alleged violence at more than 20 coal 
companies in west virginia kentucky and virginia since 1983 when 
the union began its selective strike strategy in which the umw 
targets specific companies for work stoppages previous strikes 
were industrywide 
the suit alleges new beckley employees have been the victims of 
vandalism death threats shootings and beatings at work and at 
home 
indeed the violence affects not one company or group of 
companies but rather pervades the coal industry discouraging 
productivity and inhibiting the economic wellbeing of individuals 
living and working in coalproducing communities the suit says 
thats ridiculous said union spokesman john duray who 
accused the company of engaging in a pressrelease lawsuit by 
hiring a public relations company to notify the media of the filing 
it looks to me like these guys are a lot more interested in 
trying their case in the media than in court duray said 
umw district 29 president everett acord said he knew nothing of 
the lawsuit or the mine closing although he said it isnt 
unprecedented for a company to close a mine that is being struck 
the suit filed under the federal racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act contends the union has engaged in a 
pattern of racketeering that includes 34 counts of attempted 
murder 23 counts of arson and 79 counts of extortion 
under the rico statute the companys requested 20 million in 
damages can be tripled if the union and various individuals are 
found to have violated the act

but theres a twist 
the company that was hca is now three companies and baxter has 
signed contracts with them all the 25 billion deal covers more 
than 450 hospitals nationwide 
under separate contracts that become effective jan 1 baxter 
will provide products and services for six years to hca 
healthtrust inc and hca management co together they own or 
manage 452 hospitals nationwide 
healthtrust and hca management are former hca units that became 
independent companies through a reorganization completed in the 
four years since hcas original contract with baxter 
that contract a fiveyear pact worth 125 billion was due to 
expire at the end of 1990 baxter spokesman geoffrey fenton said 
the new contracts replace and expand upon the old one providing 
products and services that meet the different needs of the new 
companies fenton said 
hca owns and operates 78 us medicalsurgical hospitals and 53 
psychiatric facilities 
healthtrust a network of 93 former hca hospitals was formed in 
1987 through an employee stock ownership plan 
hca management became independent this year when hca sold the

fenton said the company manages 228 hospitals 
baxter based in deerfield ill outside chicago manufactures

supply had agreed to merge with hca but baxter offered more money 
and bought the company for 37 billion 
baxter paid hca 150 million to terminate the merger agreement 
and hca agreed to buy 250 million worth of baxter products 
annually for five years 
weve been very satisfied with the products and services weve 
received during this term so once we went through the divestiture 
we asked to renegotiate said david mcfadden an hca spokesman 
in 1988 baxter signed its largest supply agreement a 5year 
pact worth up to 64 billion with american healthcare systems a 
group of more than 1000 healthcare facilities

detectives at the downtown nordstrom store who 
chased a shoplifter now find their employer embroiled in a personal 
injury lawsuit 
two men who were run over by the shoplifter claim the detectives 
were negligent and have filed suit against the national retail 
chain 
nordstrom lawyers say the store sympathizes with alexander 
passovoy 63 of lake oswego ore and william pack 64 of 
britain but feels their legal recourse should be aimed at the 
shoplifter 
pack suffered cracked ribs and passovoy said he will need 
surgery to repair torn leg ligaments caused by the sept 20 1985 
incident passovoy said he fell to the bottom of some stairs with 
his leg twisted under him 
there was a sort of heavy pounding behind us and we were 
knocked sideways said pack 
pack and passovoy longtime friends contend the store and its 
lawyers have been anything but sensitive about the case scheduled 
for trial june 25 
three years ago king county superior court judge susan agid 
threw out their suit she said nordstrom could not be held 
accountable for the actions of a fleeing criminal 
last year the state court of appeals reinstated the suit 
saying a jury should decide whether the detectives failure to 
shout a warning for customers in the store amounted to negligence 
to concede responsibility would be to restrict store workers 
from doing their jobs nordstrom lawyers have said 
nordstrom is not taking care of a prison michael reilly 
nordstrom lawyer told the seattle times theyre not prison 
wardens theyre merchants merchants shouldnt be required to walk 
around with balls and chains he added 
he said the nordstrom store detectives exercised reasonable care 
in the crowded store and did exactly what they should have done 
the shoplifter who was the object of the chase was eventually 
grabbed near the downtown monorail by a couple of bon marche 
department store security officers who heard shouts from nordstrom 
store detective david siler 
siler gave chase after he saw two men stuffing suits into bags 
one shoplifter was tackled in the store the other was pursued 
through the store and onto the sidewalks of downtown seattle 
im not looking for the moon here said passovoy we just 
want some equity but they claim they werent responsible 
nordstrom and the national retail merchants association were 
upset by the appeals court ruling the association represents 4500 
retailers nationally 
no appellate court in the united states has ever gone so far 
as to impose a duty to warn customers of the possible dangers 
caused by a fleeing shoplifter the association said

uncertaintity about the prospects for sears 
roebuck and cos new retailing strategy has led duff amp phelps inc 
to lower its rating on sears fixedincome securities the credit 
rating agency said 
duff amp phelps said in announcing the downgrade on wednesday that 
the move reflected the increased risks and earnings volatility 
of sears retail operations after the nations largest retailer 
switched last spring to a strategy of everyday low pricing 
the strategy designed to win back market share from discount 
retailers involves offering more namebrand goods lower prices 
and fewer sales than in the past 
some retail analysts believe the strategy is failing but sears 
says it is committed to the strategy and is still in the process of 
converting its stores to the format 
sears advertising of everyday low prices was attacked last 
week by the attorney general of new york who claimed in a lawsuit 
that the prices at sears stores are actually as high or higher than 
before the strategy shift 
sears has denied the charge which it contends is based on 
comparisons of only 14 of the more than 100000 items it sells 
duff amp phelps downgraded sears senior debt acceptance senior 
debt and discover card credit senior debt wednesday to aaminus 
from aa 
at the same time however duff amp phelps reaffirmed the 
commercial paper rating of all three entities at duff 1plus 
the downgrading affects about 2 billion of debt securities

the 1960s 
i love that airline he said it could be the best and

winter travelers around the country may start the new year with 
lower air fares as several airlines announce cuts in the cost of 
flying for the first months of 1990 
but the two principal air shuttle services in the northeast 
which cater mostly to business passengers are raising their fares 
for the first time since august 1988 
chicagobased united airlines the nations secondlargest 
carrier followed the lead of crosstown rival midway airlines and 
said wednesday it would lower some fares as much as 30 percent 
we have matched them in most markets united spokesman joe 
hopkins said 
northwest airlines and trans world airlines followed suit late 
wednesday announcing they were matching the fare cuts it wasnt 
immediately clear whether other major carriers also planned to join 
the move 
separately wednesday trump shuttle told travel agents it was 
raising fares from 99 one way to 119 on weekdays and from 69 to 
79 on weekends agents said pan am corp spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon said that companys shuttle service which competes with 
trumps was matching the increase effective jan 3 
the hourly shuttle flights link new york with boston and 
washington billionaire developer donald trump bought his service 
from eastern airlines for 365 million in early june 
trump spokeswoman joan fudala today cited increased costs for 
fuel labor and aircraft maintenance as the reason for the increase 
uniteds fare reductions are effective immediately and require a 
14day advance purchase and a saturday night stay said rob 
doughty another spokesman for the airline 
the new united fares are based on mileage roundtrip fares for 
flights of up to 1000 miles are 198 for peak times and 178 for 
offpeak times peak times are saturdays sundays and mondays 
offpeak fares apply other days 
for flights from 1001 to 2000 miles fares will be 258 peak

than 2000 miles will cost 318 peak and 278 offpeak 
uniteds action spread the farecutting that began last week 
when southwest airlines reduced prices on its longer routes a move 
other carriers followed on a limited basis 
midway which operates its main hub at chicagos midway airport 
had announced oneway fares ranging from 19 to 99 across its 
50city route system within the continental united states 
the entire industry is seeing soft bookings for the first 
quarter said midway spokeswoman laura podlesny explaining the 
fare cuts 
passengers wanting to take advantage of uniteds lower fares 
must make reservations by jan 31 and may travel through march 6 
the fares are available only on a roundtrip basis and are not 
refundable 
midway cut its chicagolos angeles roundtrip fare from 318 to 
198 and its chicagowashington roundtrip fare from 228 to 158 
midways new 38 roundtrip fares 19 one way apply to 
routes connnecting chicago with detroit and kansas city mo the

canadian shoppers have made this 
holiday season jolly for us retailers but some residents are 
feeling a lack of goodwill toward fellow shoppers from across the 
border 
low us prices and a comparatively strong canadian dollar have 
caused canadians to throng grocery stores liquor marts and factory 
outlets throughout this border city 
the prices check it out said manny hilario 23 who drove 
100 miles from brampton ontario to shop at the factory outlet 
mall one recent saturday outside in an overflowing parking lot 
ontario plates outnumbered new york plates more than three to one 
the crowded lots long checkout lines and delays entering canada 
on the areas three international bridges have caused tempers to 
rise at times 
a group of six niagara falls residents announced recently they 
were forming a group called people against canadian shoppers to 
press local merchants to deal with the problems 
we have nothing against them canadians personally but we do 
think something could be done to improve the situation for 
everyone steve hughes a spokesman for the group told the 
niagara gazette 
hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming canadians 
for everything from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting 
gasoline across the border in extra tanks 
that effort in turn has prompted us business and tourism 
officials to hasten to assure canadians that they are still welcome 
its easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that 
theres a major war going on said ray wigle spokesman for the 
niagara falls convention and visitors bureau 
the convention and visitors bureau and the niagara falls area 
chamber of commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and 
expand checkouts local governments have been asked to increase 
traffic control in order to reduce the complaints 
local canada customs officials have asked the agency that 
operates the international bridges to expand the customs facilities 
and are trying to persuade ottawa to allocate more staff 
sameday shopping traffic across the rainbow and whirlpool 
bridges has increased by almost 60 percent over the past four 
years and at the lewistonqueenston bridge the main route to 
major canadian cities such as hamilton and toronto traffic is up 
107 percent over that period said john johnston district manager 
for canada customs operations in niagara falls 
theories abound over why the number of shoppers has multiplied 
though the yearold uscanada free trade pact isnt considered a 
direct cause the agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on 
several categories of merchandise but has not yet affected the 
duties paid by individual shoppers at the border 
still free trade may have subtly boosted crossborder shopping 
by helping to strengthen the canadian dollar the canadian dollar 
trades at about 85 us cents these days after falling as low as 70 
cents earlier in the decade 
niagara falls ny also has a builtin price advantage because 
western new york is one of the cheaper regions of the united states 
while niagara falls ontario is an extension of the pricey toronto 
metropolitan area said wigle 
price is not the only attraction of the united states some 
canadian shoppers said 
in groceries anything new they come out with in the us is 
in canada the year after said lisa morrice of hamilton ontario 
you just dont have the choices in canada agreed a 
toronto woman who declined to give her name you see different 
things down here 
us grocery chains began advertising heavily across the border 
in the past few months after seeing the stronger dollar and the 
increased willingness of canadians to cross the bridges 
their money is worth a lot more than it was two years ago 
said ralph meranto manager of a local tops supermarket it 
wasnt even worthwhile before 
canadian merchants say they cant compete with us prices but 
are not calling for stronger government action to protect them 
turkeys that cost 69 cents a pound in the united states sell for 
the equivalent of 128 to 149 a pound in canada said justin 
sauve manager of hy and zels supermarket in niagara falls 
ontario 
a lot of people i know buy a case of beer for 10 bucks in the 
us and over here its 22 or 23 sauve said people go over 
there to gas up and they go to the stores while theyre there 
canada unlike the united states has no dutyfree allowance for 
shoppers who have been out of the country less than 24 hours sauve 
said a lot of canadians are escaping the duty and federal sales 
tax which can add up to 198 percent to the cost of a purchase 
but declined to fault customs officials for letting them through 
if you take everybody who you could pull over youd be 
pulling everybody over he said youd be there all day pulling 
them over 
johnston the customs manager said his agencys penetration 
rate was reasonable given the need to keep traffic flowing 
when we have to take enforcement action it tends to slow 
things down he said

hillsborough holdings corps wednesday filing in us 
bankruptcy court in tampa marks the first kohlberg kravis private 
holding to seek bankruptcy protection the action will be closely 
watched for its impact on the junk bond market 
junk bonds used to finance corporate takeovers have been 
battered in recent months because of problems facing numerous 
heavily indebted companies 
new yorkbased kohlberg kravis formed hillsborough last year as 
part of its 24 billion takeover of jim walter corp a building 
materials company jim walter which is not involved in the 
bankruptcy filing was later sold by kohlberg kravis 
hillsborough is expected to file bankruptcy petitions for its 31 
subsidiaries said bankruptcy court clerk chuck kilcoyne by 8 pm 
wednesday kilcoyne had received hillsboroughs petition and those 
of nine subsidiaries 
hillsboroughs bankruptcy petition did not list creditors and 
reported assets of 3042 million and liabilities of 3476 
million he said 
hillsboroughs case has been assigned to the courts chief judge 
alexander p paskay said kilcoyne 
kilcoyne said he had not yet received word from paskay if a 
court date had been set 
earlier this month hillsborough officials said they would file 
for bankruptcy if an exchange offer for 624 million worth of the 
companys bonds was not accepted by at least 80 percent of the 
companys bondholders 
hillsborough said it could not repay its bonds in full 
hillsborough is the third company owned by kohlberg kravis to 
encounter financial difficulties in recent months 
in august kohlberg kravis confirmed that seaman furniture co 
a leading furniture retailer could not meet its debt payments and 
might not be able to continue operating the companys debt 
payments were later rescheduled successfully 
sci television inc of which kohlberg kravis owns 45 percent 
is also involved in a bond exchange offer that is facing resistance 
from bondholders 
but neither of those kohlberg kravis holdings is as large as 
hillsborough

consumers are paying more than 1 a gallon for 
home heating oil in many parts of the country as cold weather 
continues to deplete supplies and drive prices higher 
but oil users arent the only ones in a bind prices are rising 
for other fuels and some utilities are asking natural gas customers 
to limit consumption 
in philadelphia a gallon of heating oil at one distributor went 
from 135 wednesday morning to 140 in the afternoon in 
westchester county ny just north of new york city the average 
price of home heating oil was 135 a gallon up 27 percent in just 
a month 
the cold weather has kept demand and in turn prices running 
high transportation problems and refinery shutdowns have 
complicated the situation 
the increases are incredible and theyre coming just about 
every day from a penny to a nickel per gallon said w claiborne 
coupland jr marketing director for papco oil co a supplier in 
southeastern virginia 
oil prices are high even in places where the weather has been 
temperate 
in seattle where temperatures have been running in the 40s 
slightly above normal for this time of the year heating oil was 
selling for nearly 102 a gallon in portland ore where 
temperatures ranged from the 30s to the 50s heating oil costs as 
much as 1 
on the new york mercantile exchange home heating oil for 
delivery in january soared 723 cents wednesday to 9971 cents a 
gallon 37 cents higher than the nov 30 price and up sharply from 
5377 cents a gallon a year earlier on tuesday the contract rose 
1074 cents 
in early trading today the contract rose another 229 cents to 
102 a gallon 
a contract comprises 42000 gallons of oil which means one 
contract for heating oil would cost 41878 at wednesdays price 
however the price paid by most distributors the people who 
deliver oil by tanker truck to residential customers was 115 a 
gallon wednesday in what is known as the new york spot or cash 
market 
its very cold outside and the inventories of heating oil got 
dangerously low and its difficult to get heating oil here prior to 
the second half of january said james fiedler an analyst with 
edampf man international futures inc 
shutdowns at many refineries have worsened supply problems and 
driven prices even higher 
the most prominent shutdown was of a huge exxon facility at 
baton rouge la where a weekend explosion killed two workers but 
production at many gulf coast refineries has been slowed because of 
frozen water pipes just when the oil companies were trying to 
step up their output to meet the increased demand 
it seems like every refinery was affected fiedler said 
most of the refineries have got some of their units back to 
normal and most were talking that theyd be back to full 
operation by the weekend 
oil companies continued to report low heating oil supplies at 
some terminals 
at star enterprise a texaco inc affiliate supplies were 
tightest in the boston area spokesman top ingram said star has 
begun limiting the amount of oil its customers can buy he said 
freezing temperatures also have increased the demand for propane 
and kerosene 
in south carolina deliveries of the two fuels have been 
hampered by icy roads and a shortage of supplies dealers said 
some suppliers said they were raising their prices and giving 
priority to longtime customers 
propane prices have risen about 10 cents to 1 a gallon during 
the last two weeks while kerosene prices have risen 20 cents a 
gallon to 80 cents dealers said 
in iowa state officials said prices for liquid propane for 
residential consumers have increased from under 50 cents a gallon 
last month to a range of 80 cents to 95 cents a gallon 
natural gas customers while not facing delivery problems of 
oil propane and kerosene users also suffered shortages because of 
increased demand 
philadelphia gas works a cityowned system on wednesday asked 
its 517000 residential commerical and industrial customers to cut 
back consumption 
pgw spokesman don kenley said the companys two main suppliers 
texas eastern corp and transcontinental pipeline corp cut 
supplies by 28 percent because of higher demand 
even wood was in short supply in some areas 
walter holdsworth owner of wakefield firewood inc in 
wakefield va said his wood lot was empty friday for the first 
time in 10 years the rush began he said about three weeks ago 
when the cold weather first set in

in a remote jungle region infested 
with drug smugglers and radical guerrillas peruvian entrepreneurs 
have enlisted a private army to protect their struggling palm oil 
business 
about 1200 workers at one of the wrlds largest palm oil 
plantations go about their tasks protected by a hundred men dressed 
in jungle fatigues and armed with automatic rifles 
the guards most of them experuvian marines are deployed to 
repel guerrilla attacks on the palma del espino complex a model 
project that peru hopes will help solve its shortage of vegetable 
oils 
the private fighting force is an example of the security that 
more and more legitimate businesses in this impoverished south 
american nation have been forced to organize to protect themselves 
from rebel sabotage 
located near the town of uchiza in perus upper huallaga valley 
245 miles northeast of lima palma del espino and its 16000 acres 
of african palm trees form an oasis in a region under the domain of 
cocaine traffickers and fanatical maoist insurgents who call 
themselves the shining path 
the entire complex is ringed by a 6foothigh fence and its 
managers come and go by plane to avoid ambushes 
begun in 1979 the project is intended to help eliminate perus 
imports of 80000 metric tons of vegetable oils each year which 
cost more than 30 million and drain the countrys foreignexchange 
reserves 
when the first trees were planted in 1982 the companys major 
concern was draining swamps said ruperto raygada the plants 
chief of operations 
but today the illegal coca fields that stretch up and down the 
150milelong valley have reached the plantations doorsteps and 
rebels who prowl the surrounding jungle pose a serious threat 
the shining path guerrillas have been fighting perus government 
since 1980 they expanded into the valley from ayacucho their 
stronghold in perus andean mountains 
the upper huallaga valley generates about 70 percent of the 
world cocaleaf supply the raw material for cocaine police say 
the jungle surrounding the plantation contains 13 drug trafficking 
organizations and nearly a thousand guerrilla fighters 
government officials say the rebels tax coca growers and 
smugglers for permission to operate in the area in return the 
guerrillas provide protection from police 
the 56 million project is proceeding and expanding despite 
terrorist threats the complex includes a processing plant a 
barracks for the workers and 18 technicians offices and security 
equipment 
squadrons of workers toiling by hand cultivate the african palm 
which produces 20 times more vegetable oil than any other plant 
they lug it to the processing plant using 250 mules the result is 
a red dense liquid transformed into vegetable shortening oil and 
cosmetics ingredients 
palma del espino owned by a peruvian industrial group expects 
to produce 20600 tons of palm oil in 1989 more than twice what it 
produced in 1987 its first year of production 
the biggest threat however appears to be the insurgents who 
ring the plants perimeters besides their threat of attack they 
demand payment of protection money from the truckers who take the 
oil to the cities 
some trucks have been turned back at guerrilla blockades 
forcing the plantation to store the oil in big tanks that can 
accomodate 4000 tons the plantation recently began running out of 
room so workers gouged pits in the ground and lined them with 
plastic sheets to store the excess 
last year the rebels dynamited nine bridges along the 70mile 
stretch of road that connects the plantation with tingo maria the 
largest town in the area 
since 1984 when the plantation was attacked for the first time 
the rebels have burned 14 trucks the last major attack occurred in 
march 1988 
when they attacked us the first time we only had one guard 
raygada said now we have constant patrols

pan am corp says it intends to protest american 
airlines planned purchase of eastern airlines profitable latin 
american routes 
we strongly object to the further concentration of americans 
market dominance in latin america and the caribbean through the 
purchase of these government route authorities and facilities 
said pan am spokeswoman elizabeth manners 
pan am contends that the route transfer from ailing eastern to 
the nations largest airline will hinder competition 
after months of negotiations american said dec 19 it would buy 
easterns latin american routes and certain other assets from 
easterns parent texas air corp for 471 million 
the surest sign that an asset sale is good for consumers and 
enhances comepetition is the opposition of a competitor in the 
market eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said today i dont 
think anyones surprised by pan ams plans she said 
officials of american based in fort worth texas werent 
immediately available for comment 
pan am intends to file its objections to the deal with the 
justice department and the department of transportation after 
american files its acquisition plan 
federal officials and the us bankruptcy judge overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 financial reorganization must approve the 
purchase 
the sale would shake up the strength of airlines at miami 
international airport catapulting american from third place there 
to first ahead of eastern and pan am 
both american and new yorkbased pan am have boosted their 
presence in miami since eastern was hit by a strike march 4 and 
filed for bankruptcy protection five days later

three members of the family that founded 
campbell soup co disclosed today they would sell their 17 percent 
stake and urge a sale of the entire foodproducts company 
the announcement intensified speculation that campbell the 
company that founded condensed soup popular with millions of people 
around the world would be put on the auction block due to a rift 
among family members who control it 
an investor group pushing for the sale composed of nieces of 
campbells late chairman john t dorrance jr said in documents it 
planned to file with the securities and exchange commission that it 
was seeking a price per share significantly in excess of current 
market value 
the group also said it actively would encourage campbells board 
of directors to do the same and would consider trying to oust 
members opposed to the sale 
james h moran a spokesman for camden njbased campbell 
said the company had no comment on todays announcement 
wall street however responded enthusiastically on the new 
york stock exchange campbell soared 375 to 5675 in active noon 
trading 
its not particularly surprising pavlos m alexandrakis an 
industry analyst with argus research in new york said of the 
dorrance familiy announcement there has been a split among the 
family members for some time 
alexandrakis said those pushing for the sale of campbell 
probably had little interest left in running the company and with 
the right price could draft other family member to their cause 
he described campbell as a laggard in the food industry slow to 
update facilities and products 
heirs of campbell founder john dorrance sr dorrances father 
control about 59 percent of campbells 1296 million outstanding 
common shares speculation about their intentions have grown since 
dorrance jr died last april

grand economic hopes often disappear under a 
mountain of emergencies but some of the broader plans of the 
reagan administration held up remarkably well 
failures were big such as budget deficits and negative trade 
balances and an inability to show statistically that federal 
spending had indeed been reduced as a percentage of gross national 
product 
important parts of the vision were maintained however and the 
impact of some of them can be seen in domestic and world politics 
and economics perhaps even in the overthrow of communist regimes 
one of the primary aims of the administration was to bring 
inflation and interest rates down by freeing the economy from 
regulatory controls restraining the money supply and lowering 
spending 
such action was needed in order for other plans to work in 
december 1980 the prime rate had reached a record 215 percent and 
threemonth treasury bills had doubled in yield in a matter of 
months 
better control of the money supply thanks to federal reserve 
cooperation helped reverse the climb in rates an immediate tax 
cut not only stimulated economic activity but helped take inflation 
down from doubledigit levels 
the economic report of the president sent to congress in 
february 1982 expressed the broad hopes a critical element in 
this outlook is the assumption that inflationary expectations will 
continue to recede it said 
if the process continued as expected the report stated 
market rates of interest will decline significantly wage demands 
will continue to moderate and the proinflationary biases will 
quickly disappear 
they did and the impact continues today 
however a far greater impact of the reagan plan for the decade 
can be traced to the reports section on government and the 
economy it had domestic and international ramifications 
the section begins with this preamble 
all nations which have broadbased representative government 
and civil liberties have most of their economic activity organized 
by the market 
economic conditions in market economies are generally 
superior to those in nations with a comparable culture and a 
comparable resource base in which the government has the dominant 
economic role 
a major objective of the reagan economic program therefore was 
to reduce the federal governments role in economic 
decisionmaking while strengthening the economic role of 
individuals private organizations and state and local 
governments 
that objective the report stated emanated from a belief that 
the politicization of price decisions whether of wages 
commodities or interest rates tends to reduce both the breadth 
of popular support for the government and the efficiency of the 
economy 
nations all over the world large and small socialist 
capitalist and mixed took their cue from the united states 
developing the concept of privatization or turning over 
governmental functions to the private sector 
in every instance the goal was the same to achieve economic 
efficiency a higher level of responsiveness to individual and 
collective needs by drawing on the creative selfinterest of 
private individuals and institutions 
the revolution was smoothly accomplished in mostly capitalist 
nations sometimes convulsively in socialist economies but to some 
degree it occurred almost everywhere 
historians eventually will unravel the reasons for the 
economicpolitical upheavals in the late 1980s but even now they 
can follow one fine thread to that 1982 economic report 
it was written by chairman murray l weidenbaum and members 
jerry l jordan and william a niskanen and transmitted to 
congress on february 6 1982

plasticsmaker rexene corp says it will suspend 
its quarterly common stock dividend citing current industry 
conditions changes in the financial markets and other operating 
factors 
the suspension of the quarterpershare dividend comes less than 
six months after dallasbased rexene borrowed 500 million to pay a 
special 7 per share dividend to stockholders the company which 
has forecast improved fourth quarter earnings also is selling off 
assets to pay off debt 
rexene was taken private in a 456 million buyout in april 
1988 financed through high yield or junk bonds sold by drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
four months later rexene went public again selling stock at 
2150 per share the stock has fallen dramatically since then 
standing at 375 a share at midday thursday down 50 cents from 
wednesday when it fell 187 in composite trading on the new york 
stock exchange 
almost half of the companys new stock is held by partnerships 
controlled by current or former drexel employees the wall street 
journal reported thursday 
in the past year rexene has announced a 10percent work force 
reduction plus sales of manufacturing facilities in bayport and 
odessa texas where more than half of its employees are located 
the bayport facility which includes polypropylene and 
polyethylene plants was sold to lyondell petrochemical co for 88 
million analysts had anticipated it would bring about 100 million 
the odessa styrene plant also is on the block and the company 
said wednesday it still is looking for buyers 
other asset sales need to occur soon analysts said because an 
anticipated downturn could cut their value 
we are in for another shakeout so their timing in getting on 
with it is rather critical said peter savage a vice president 
at consulting firm dewitt amp co in houston 
rexene said the dividend suspension will be reviewed quarterly 
in the latest quarter rexene lost 91 million or 29 cents per 
share compared with a profit in 1988 of 355 million 
the company formerly known as el paso products co and based in 
odessa makes thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products used 
in the manufacture of such items as plastic milk cartons and other 
containers

they are singing it dancing it acting it even 
chanting it yellow and black are the sign of courage can you 
fight 24 hours businessman businessman japanese businessman 
japan has gone wild over this catchy theme song to a television 
commercial for an energyrestoring health tonic called regain 
whether seen as an ode to the japanese businessman or as a 
satire of his excesses the regain commercial has achieved a 
popularity akin to wendys wheres the beef in the united 
states 
companies play it over loudspeakers businessmen sing it at 
parties students dramatize it at culture festivals some japanese 
even use it get out of bed every morning 
sankyo co the drink manufacturer and japans no 2 drug maker 
says that since the song was first broadcast in may his office has 
received 10 to 20 inquiries per day from people anxious to learn 
the lyrics 
the companies that have called sankyo read like a list from a 
whos who of the tokyo fortune 500 nissan motor co nippon life 
insurance co shiseido co nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
recruit corp mitsui toatsu chemicals inc mitsubishi electric 
corp japan airlines and many others 
not only companies but also the economic planning agency a 
police station and a city government office have requested copies 
of the song sankyo says 
even students at prestigious nada high school perhaps 
anticipating the day when they too will join the ranks of japans 
business elite dramatized the song at a school fest 
the commercial features the swarthy young television star saburo 
tokito as a businessman stalking deals in foreign lands keeping 
his strength up with the tonic drink 
in one version tokito is rowed through the canals of venice to 
a ship he climbs a rope ladder while belting out the song and is 
greeted on deck by executives waiting for him to sign a contract 
they explode in applause confetti and clicking cameras before the 
shot pans to the tonic bottle with its yellowandblack label 
there is a glimpse of a newspaper headline in english japanese 
businessman pulls it off 
a group of engineers at the hitachi vlsi device development 
center used three weeks of their overtime and weekends to adapt the 
regain tune for a company song contest in their version 
businessmen wielding attache cases dance their way through crowded 
train stations and sexy barmaids while singing about the trials 
of being a hitachi businessman 
why all the fuss 
yukichi amano a wellknown advertising critic says the 
selflampooning in the commercial has found a very receptive 
audience 
singing in loud voices with ones comrades this obviously 
unrealistic parodying comic song fits the taste of todays 
japanese he says citing the absurdity of the songs call to 
work 24 hours a day 
tokitos robotlike singing and expressionless face when kissed 
by a south pacific beauty in one version of the commercial are jabs 
at the stereotypical overserious overworked japanese businessman 
amano says 
that japan has become the richest country in the world does 
not make japanese truly happy they love expressing their cynicism 
even selfscorn 
jun moriwaki who was regains commercial planner says the ad 
was not originally designed to mock the businessman 
we thought of it from the start as a pep song that if you 
drink regain youd feel energetic again 
moriwaki says he and associates at dentsu inc japans biggest 
advertising firm were looking to create a new image of the 
businessman a new japanese hero 
theres a pattern to the japanese who appear in hollywood 
movies with thick glasses and cameras hanging from their 
shoulders we wanted to start off from there if tokito is the 
japanese businessman when he is with foreigners he would not 
cower he would stand equal to them to go one step further he 
might even look down at them 
to the 29yearold moriwaki the image of the japanese 
businessman who never takes a break has always been depressing 
even when he goes home he is ignored by his wife who pays more 
attention to the kids but moriwaki says his peers who are now 
filling the work force and at whom he is aiming the commercial are 
different 
when we work we work very hard and dont care about going 
without sleep to do our work but when we rest we insist on taking 
our vacations the younger the person is the better he is able to 
divide his life that way these people just enjoy the commercial as 
a kind of joke 
some japanese do not seem to have gotten the punch line however 
shortly after the song appeared the labor ministry made an 
informal protest to sankyo ministry officials wanted to make sure 
the sponsors of the commercial were not obstructing government 
efforts to get japanese to work less hard

soybean futures prices rose strongly thursday on 
the chicago board of trade leading the grain markets higher amid 
widespread rumors of new buying interest from eastern europe 
the soviet union czechoslovakia romania bulgaria and hungary 
all were said to be in the market for soybean meal 
algeria was rumored to have bought some us soybean meal 
overnight 
the rally halted a downward trend in the soybean market which 
had been drifting lower for more than a week 
a pickup in soybean meal sales in europe also supported the 
market analysts said 
the strength in the soybean complex spilled over to the corn and 
wheat markets which had opened nearly unchanged due to a lack of 
significant new export business 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 408 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 2 cents higher with march at 240 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with march at 154 a bushel soybeans were

the cattle industry said thursday that demand 
for beef is stabilizing after several years of decline in part 
because farmers and ranchers have responded to consumer tastes by 
producing leaner cuts 
if bones are counted americans buy more chicken if the bones 
are omitted from retail weights beef is the leader 
the national cattlemens association said it expects little 
change next year in average per capita beef supplies and average 
consumer prices 
the associations presidentelect john lacey said the cutting 
away fat from retail cuts has helped improve beefs image he also 
cited breeding and feeding advances as further boosts for the 
industry 
topper thorpe general manager of cattlefax a market 
information service said no dramatic changes are expected in the 
nations cattle herd or in us beef production in 1990 
but todays total cattle herd of about 100 million head 
including dairy animals is producing almost as much beef as the 
much larger herds of the 1970s thorpe told a news conference 
cattle herds peaked at about 132 million head in the mid1970s 
and generally have fallen because of oversupply rising production 
costs drought and other factors thorpe said the herd liquidation 
has ended and a modest expansion has begun 
now if weather is favorable and if financing becomes cheaper 
more producers may hold back heifers and expand their breeding 
herds he said however we do not see foresee rapid 
expansion 
using one method based on bonein retail weights the us 
department of agriculture says per capita consumption of beef in 
1990 may drop slightly to an average of 678 pounds from 686 
pounds in 1989 and 721 pounds in 1988 the peak was 94 pounds in 
1976 
total poultry which includes broilers baking hens and turkeys 
has been setting records annually and is forecast to average 894 
pounds in 1990 up from 844 in 1989 and 806 in 1988 poultry 
first passed beef in 1987 
but the cattle industry says in its promotion campaign that if 
you take away the bones beef is still far ahead of poultry 
richard stillman of usdas economic research service said that 
on a boneless basis 1989 per capita beef consumption may average 
671 pounds down from 682 in 1988 a further slight decline is 
expected in 1990 
on the same boneless basis he said 1989 poultry consumption 
may average 599 pounds up from 572 pounds in 1988 with another 
gain in the works next year

government officials on thursday outlined a package 
of tax incentives tariff eliminations and other measures aimed at 
reversing past trade policies and making japan an importing 
powerhouse in the 1990s 
trade experts in the united states welcomed the plan as a sign 
japan has recognized it must import more goods but they were 
hesitant to comment on how much of an impact the program ultimately 
might have on the availability of us goods in japan 
reacting to the japanese announcement us trade representative 
carla hills said we applaud any efforts to open markets but 
she cautioned that us officials would be watching for actual 
results 
the tax program appears to be quite complicated and we will 
have to wait and see whether and how it affects importing 
behavior she said 
the trade program comes as the united states is pressuring japan 
to remove what it considers impediments to free trade which the 
united states blames for worsening its huge foreign trade deficit 
a report released by the ministry of international trade and 
industry called the package of import expansion measures which 
will be submitted to parliament early next year unparalleled in 
history 
it is a 180degree turnaround from the old exportoriented 
policies of the 1960s said masahisa naito director general of 
the ministrys international trade administration bureau we will 
try to assure that imports which are a latecomer into the japanese 
marketplace will take root 
the report said miti plans to boost the importexpansion related 
budget to 50 million in fiscal 1990 which begins april 1 from 
135 million this fiscal year 
the money would be used to finance a nationwide information 
network and computer databank promote trade missions and boost the 
exchange of trade experts to act as matchmakers for potential 
exporters and importers 
miti also intends to eliminate tariffs on 1004 items and 
reduce levies on four more the value of imports of these items 
currently totals 13 billion the report said 
the total package naito said would cost the government 1 
billion a year in lost taxes 
the tariffcutting measures are the first of their kind since 
1986 when the government slashed levies on 1800 items as part of 
its marketopening action program 
naito said the plan includes a tax cut for companies that import 
10 percent more than their highest previous level and an 
additional depreciation rate of 10 percent to 20 percent on some 
imported machinery and equipment 
retailers and wholesalers would be allowed to set aside 20 
percent of the increased import value taxfree to be used for 
marketing imported goods 
the report said more than half of all capital goods including 
semiconductors and computers qualify for import promotion under 
the program other items covered include automobiles electrical 
appliances and sporting goods 
the government also would offer 15 billion in loans and import 
credits 
in washington some trade experts said it could be too early to 
determine how effective the plan would be once it actually was 
implemented 
i think we should welcome this as recognition by japan that 
there is a problem said ronnie goldberg senior vice president 
at the us council for international business but whether its 
as good as it sounds i really dont know 
in the past there has been less than what met the eye coming 
out of these kinds of initiatives said goldberg whose group 
represents us businesses in international economic organizations 
willard m berry vice president of the national foreign trade 
council a lobbying group for us companies had a similar 
reaction is this really market access i cant say without 
studying the plan 
naito said miti expects the measures to eliminate discrepancies 
between the costs of products in japan and abroad make the 
japanese distribution system more efficient and lead to the 
breakdown of the keiretsu system in which many japanese 
companies are clustered in tightly knit groups 
all of those issues are on the table in the usjapan 
structural impediments initiative trade talks 
naito said a government economic forecast for fiscal 1990 
approved by the cabinet on thursday predicted a 3 billion decline 
in japans trade surplus next year from the current 81 billion to 
78 billion 
this prediction reflects how sincere and convinced we are of 
the effects these measures will generate naito said 
he said the forecast was based on an estimated 103 percent 
increase in imports in the coming year bringing their total value 
from 195 billion in fiscal 1989 to 215 billion 
the government also estimated exports will grow from 276 
billion to 293 billion next year an increase of 62 percent he 
said 
naito said the japanese government has realized the need to 
drastically reduce its huge trade surplus which has been roughly 
90 billion a year for the past three years 
we believe that it is not appropriate for japan to continue 
with such a large trade surplus and that if it does continue the 
preservation of the free trade system could become difficult he 
said

orange juice futures prices added to their freezedriven gains 
thursday on news that brazilian officials had halted orangejuice 
exports to assess the florida situation and decide whether to raise 
prices 
nearmonth heating oil futures closed lower for the first time 
in nine days as waves of profitseeking sellers swept through the 
market 
on other commodity markets precious metals retreated grains 
and soybeans advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
all frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose the 
5centsapound daily limit on the new york cotton exchange except 
the limitless contract for january delivery which soared 785 
cents to 158 a pound 
the january contract had fallen on wednesday perhaps indicating 
the market had fully absorbed the price impact of the weekend 
freeze in florida 
but rumors surfaced late wednesday and were confirmed on 
thursday that brazil had suspended exports of orange juice until 
tuesday brazil is the worlds largest producer of orange juice and 
a major supplier to the us market 
i believe that caused a little bit of panic on the part of the 
trade and the speculators said celeste georkakis an analyst 
with cargill investor services inc 
forecasts for warmer temperatures in the florida citrus belt 
spurred further buying of futures a warmup would hasten the 
falling and rotting of freezedamaged fruit frustrating the 
efforts of orange producers to get it all picked and processed 
before it spoils 
heating oil for january delivery ended sharply lower on the new 
york mercantile exchange but not as sharply as it was down earlier 
in the session during a virtual tidal wave of profittaking 
the selling peaked late in the morning when the january contract 
fell to 88 cents a gallon 1171 cents below the previous days 
settlement after peaking at 102 the contract finished thursday 
with a loss of 331 cents 
the contract had gained almost 20 cents a gallon in a little 
over two days trading noted analyst andrew lebow of edamp f 
man international futures inc in new york certainly a market 
like that is due for some liquidation and i think we saw it today 
the recent gains reflected tightening supplies of heating oil 
due to unusually cold weather 
wholesale home heating oil settled 331 cents lower to 28 cent 
higher with january at 9640 cents a gallon west texas 
intermediate crude oil finished 17 cents to 28 cents lower with 
february at 2150 a barrel unleaded gasoline was 44 cent to 106 
cents lower with january at 6011 cents a gallon 
gold and silver futures fell sharply for the second straight day 
on new yorks commodity exchange amid a continued lack of investor 
demand for precious metals 
gold futures settled 240 to 350 lower with february at 
40140 a troy ounce silver was 96 cents to 116 cents lower with 
january at 515 a troy ounce

in recent days dropped thursday amid profittaking and higher 
deposit requirements imposed by the new york mercantile exchange 
january heating oil which has led the recent price jump fell 
331 cents to 9640 cents a gallon on the exchange after surging 
723 cents wednesday the february contract rose 028 cent to 7417 
cents a gallon while contracts for later delivery fell between 
054 cent and 143 cents 
meanwhile wholesale unleaded gasoline for january delivery lost 
074 cent to close at 6011 cents a gallon and west texas 
intermediate the us key grade of crude oil dropped 28 cents to 
2150 cents a barrel 
analysts said selling activity began at the opening bell after 
wednesdays late announcement by the new york merc that it was 
raising margin or deposit requirements for customers 
at the start of trading thursday cash deposits for spot heating 
oil and unleaded gasoline contracts rose from 4000 to 7000 per 
contract said nacamah jacobovits spokeswoman for the exchange 
those requirements will go up to 10000 starting friday and to 
15000 on tuesday the next regular trading day after the new 
years day holiday 
to raise the money many investors have to liquidate their 
contracts ms jacobovits said 
energy analysts said the new requirements began forcing out the 
weaker players in the market 
it put a big damp towel on the market and got rid of the 
phonies the people that dont belong there said kevin breslin 
analyst with united energy inc 
heating oil and gasoline contracts comprise 42000 gallons each 
analysts said profittaking also contributed to the price 
erosion after the recent steady rise in futures prices 
heating oil had soared more than 40 percent in the the last two 
weeks from 7042 cents a gallon on dec 15 for the january 
contract to 9971 cents on wednesday 
analysts said in addition to the margin requirements new 
imports may help to dampen prices in coming days which would be 
good news for consumers 
about 30 cargos or 270 million gallons of heating oil are 
headed for the united states from europe said sal gilbertie 
assistant vice president and energy analyst with elders futures inc 
when prices rose sharply everyone with spare heating oil in 
europe began shipping to the us he said 
recordsetting cold temperatures across the nation in the last 
two weeks raised the demand for heating oil depleted already low 
inventories and sent retail prices rocketing in some states 
heating oil prices nearly doubled 
furthermore frigid weather caused refinery problems in texas 
and louisiana that delayed the shipment of crude oil to some areas 
we hope to see retail prices stabilize over the next week 
gilbertie said

accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the annual growth rate in m2 so far this year is 44 percent 
which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 percent 
the annual growth rate in m3 is 33 percent which is below the

interest rates skyrocketed to 600 
percent a month thursday amid continuing economic turmoil and 
runaway inflation 
banks paid their biggest depositors the 600 percent rate to 
retain funds that otherwise may have been withdrawn and converted 
to us dollars 
investors have bought dollars heavily for two months driving 
down the austral argentinas national currency to a value of 
19501 on thursday from 7281 on nov 1 a devaluation of 63 
percent 
the monthly interest rates amounted to six times the rates 
quoted two days ago it is impossible to predict what rates might 
be next tuesday when banks open after yearend holidays friday and 
monday 
virtually no one can afford to borrow except the government 
which pays that much and more on the reserves it requires banks to 
set aside reserves average about 63 percent of banks total 
deposits 
as the austral has lost its value prices have soared 
a survey by the federation of commercial centers indicated that 
in buenos aires medicine prices soared by an average 334 percent in 
december food 210 percent hardware items 240 percent clothing 
200 percent 
pharmacies reported their distributors were refusing to deliver 
goods particularly imported medicines for fear of charging too 
little and not being able to resupply 
a quart of milk cost 470 australs or 24 cents on thursday up 
from about 170 australs earlier this month a movie ticket cost 
2100 australs 107 up from about 900 australs 
since november one economy minister and two central bank 
presidents have been sacked two stabilization plans launched and 
financial institutions closed four times by government order 
did someone tell you they see a light at the end of the 
tunnel i dont not now or in 1990 said a central bank official 
speaking condition of anonymity 
analysts attribute the financial turmoil to a lack of public 
confidence in president carlos menems ability to carry out a 
proposed program of economic reform in the face of opposition by 
unions businesses that sell to the state and his own peronist 
party 
menem won national elections in may and took office in july 
the core of the program is the reduction of state expenditures 
that contribute to chronic inflation and the sale of public 
companies that annually ring up huge deficits 
wages are linked to the governments calculation of inflation 
but have failed to keep pace many public and private employees 
received raises of 65 percent in early december to compensate them 
for the cost of living in november 
economy minister antonio gonzalez predicted that inflation in 
december may top 50 percent 
inflation for the first 11 months of 1989 increased by 3731 
percent according to the national institute of statistics and 
census including 114 percent in june and 197 percent in july

smithkline beecham clinical laboratories inc 
has agreed to pay 15 million to settle a federal investigation of 
alleged kickbacks for physicians who referred medicare and medicaid 
business to the company the government said thursday 
the department of health and human services inspector general 
found that more than 100 physicians were investors in three 
california laboratories managed by the company 
the inspector generals office said the arrangement under which 
doctors were recruited as investors and lab profits were 
distributed to those same doctors violated a federal law 
prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of medicaid and 
medicare patients 
the 15 million settlement was the largest ever made under the 
law the inspector generals office said 
smithkline spokeswoman tobey dichter said the settlement is an 
agreement that was reached to avoid costly litigation and 
disruption to our business 
it is not an admission of liability in any way we say there 
was no wrongdoing we believe it is an ambiguous statute she 
said 
the inspector general proposed the three laboratories be barred 
permanently from participating in medicare medicaid social 
security and california health care programs and that some 
individuals and companies linked to the labs be barred for several 
years 
the inspector generals office said the arrangement cost the 
federal health care programs an unspecified amount of money 
our studies have shown that with this type of arrangement 
there is a significant amount of overutilization by those 
doctors said d mccarty thornton chief of litigation in the 
inspector generals office doctors ordering unecessary tests 
does cost the program significant amounts of money he said 
the company agreed to cooperate in the continuing investigation 
the inspector generals office said documents on agreements the 
company has with 56 other physicianowned laboratories indicate 
there may be other illegal arrangements 
physicians referring business to entities in which they have 
an ownership interest and contractual arrangements such as those 
involved here are very common in the industry the inspector 
generals office said in a statement 
the labs covered in the settlement were established by the 
hanlester network of santa ana calif smithkline beecham clinical 
laboratories inc based in king of prussia pa contracted to 
manage the facilities 
under the inspector generals recommendation the pacific 
physicians clinical laboratory ltd of santa ana the omni 
physicians clinical laboratory ltd of pasadena and the placer 
physicians clinical laboratory ltd of sacramento would be barred 
from the various government health care programs 
patric hooper a los angeles lawyer representing the three labs 
said they will challenge the hhs attempt to bar them from the 
programs on the ground that the department lacks authority to take 
the action 
he added that payments to the physicianinvestors were based on 
amount of ownership not on referrals and that the investment was 
marketed to physicians because they have an interest in 
maintaining the quality of the laboratory to which they send a 
specimen

the revelry of the new years weekend marks the 
end of bourbons 200th year but the only truly american liquor 
faces declining consumption as drinkers turn to sipping cordials 
and gulping vodka 
outside the united states especially in japan bourbon is 
accepted as a very sophisticated very american very high price 
very quality spirit said barry berish president of jim beam 
brands co which makes the bestselling us bourbon 
but thats at odds with bourbons image back home where its 
considered an everyday kind of liquor summoning images of 
twofisted drinkers throwing back shots of bourbon or patrician 
southerners sipping bourbon in the form of mint juleps 
bourbon has only half the share of the us distilled spirits 
market it had 20 years ago falling from 207 percent in 1970 to 
about 10 percent in 1988 the last year for which numbers were 
available 
after hitting a high of 255 million cases in 1973 us bourbon 
consumption has fallen to 153 million cases in 1988 according to 
jobsons liquor handbook an industry guide 
basically its the white goods the vodkas gins tequilas 
rums and cordials that are gaining said jobsons editor nicholas 
furlotte vodkas now the most popular stiff drink in america with 
302 million cases sold in 1988 
bourbon is generally considered to be the legacy of a pioneer 
baptist minister living in the wilds of what was then bourbon 
county va a region thats now part of kentucky 
sometime in 1789 probably september according to the 
dallasbased bourbon information bureau the rev elijah craig 
mixed spring water corn rye barley malt and who knows what else 
to concoct bourbon 
within 21 years the region had 2000 stills and bourbon had 
even become an unofficial currency 
today kentucky is home to 14 bourbon distilleries and produces 
80 percent of the worlds bourbon supply 
the liquor craig devised was clear however not the amber 
bourbon we know today the reason according to even less provable 
lore has to do with a barrel makers mistake 
according to legend a 19th century barrel maker was steaming 
and bending barrel staves over an open fire the bourbon 
information bureau says he didnt watch the staves carefully 
enough and they soon began to char being a frugal fellow he went 
ahead and used them anyway not bothering to tell the distiller 
however the distiller who used the barrel found that his 
whiskey had improved in flavor and picked up a rich color needless 
to say he insisted that all of his barrels in the future have 
charred staves 
and now according to a federal law passed in 1964 a liquor can 
only be called bourbon if it contains more than 51 percent corn in 
the mash and is aged in new charred oak containers for at 
least two years some bourbons however contain more corn and are 
aged longer 
the holidays are an especially important time in the liquor 
business in 1988 137 percent of bourbon sales were in december 
according to jobsons and furlotte estimates that 25 percent to 35 
percent of sales come between thanksgiving and new years 
bourbon apparently is most popular in washington dc which 
leads the per capita rankings for bourbon consumption 
washingtonians drink up 1613 cases per thousand people almost 
three times the national average of 622 cases 
kentucky is second at 1395 cases per thousand residents 
while consumption of bourbon and other distilled spirits has 
been declining jobsons says the fall seems to have slowed and 
people want the best but they dont want to feel as if theyre 
being taken 
the bourbon information bureau a promotional office funded by 
the schenley american whiskey group says a shakeout is taking 
place among marginal and lessprofitable brands leaving the 
market open for the biggest bourbon producers 
jim beams berish agrees sayings his brands market share and 
volume are increasing in the united states where the company is 
using a backtobasics advertising campaign to capitalize on 
bourbons history and tradition 
in addition we see a marvelous potential to sell and promote 
what is the american spirit throughout the world berish said 
industry officials arent sure how much bourbon is sold in 
japan but berish said jim beams international sales are up 11 
percent to 15 percent 
the japanese love american products he said they like 
our food they like our music they like our clothes and they like 
our bourbon

eastern airlines announced thursday it will cut 600 
jobs and temporarily trim salaries for about 10000 workers as the 
retrenching carrier prepares to sell its latin american routes and 
shrink its home base 
the downsizing is part of easterns plan for reorganization in 
the wake of the strike that idled the miamibased carrier for 
several months early this year 
eastern president phil bakes said the pay and benefit reductions 
were something we wanted to avoid but large losses are 
expected to continue in the first half of the new year 
the belttightening package is expected to save 100 million 
next year for eastern which posted a net loss of 1852 million in 
this years third quarter 
the announcement reflects easterns intention to return to its 
original reorganization plan cutting its prestrike operations by a 
third in august dogged by failure to sell the profitable latin 
american routes eastern had decided to pare operations by only 10 
percent 
attrition and early retirement will blunt the effects of the 
cutbacks but a number of operational employees will be out of work 
jan 31 as miami operations are reduced from 75 daily flights to 50 
job cuts also will come july 1 when rival american airlines 
plans to take over the latin american routes eastern senior vice 
president tom matthews told a news conference in miami 
after months of negotiations american said dec 19 it would buy 
easterns latin american routes and certain other assets from 
easterns parent texas air corp for 471 million 
federal officials and the us bankruptcy judge overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 reorganization must approve the deal 
separately thursday pan am corp said it intends to protest to 
the government americans planned purchase of the latin american 
routes pan am contends that the route transfer from ailing eastern 
to the nations largest airline will hinder competition 
eastern said pilots flight attendants and machinists will not 
be affected by the job cuts the airline has hired thousands of 
employees in those categories mostly nonunion to replace members 
of the striking unions 
but half of easterns 20000 employees including management 
pilots and flight attendants working at the higher prestrike wage 
levels will have their wages reduced by 10 percent to 20 percent 
for a year beginning jan 16 
about 850 pilots will see their 72000ayear salaries slashed 
by 20 percent for six months half of the cut will be restored 
after six months and pay will return to normal after a year about 
950 newly hired pilots are working for 27500 a year and will not 
be affected 
flight attendants earning a prestrike salary of 30000 a year 
also will take cuts but those hired under the new wage levels of 
15000 will not 
the wage cuts are subject to union negotiations matthews said 
officials of the air line pilots association were not immediately 
available for comment on easterns action mary jane barry head of 
the eastern flight attendants union said she couldnt comment 
since contract negotiations are ongoing 
the pilots and flight attendants unions which walked out in 
sympathy with the machinists strike called off their actions just 
before thanksgiving but few got their jobs back 
matthews said he expects the latest round of cuts to be the last 
necessary to achieve the reorganization plan 
eastern employed about 32000 before the strike began march 4 
the airline filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors five days later 
eastern plans to reshape itself at about twothirds of its 
prestrike size with its major hub in atlanta matthews denied 
speculation that eastern plans eventually to move its headquarters 
from miami to that city 
rising fuel prices and the prospect of only modest growth in air 
travel in 1990 also were factors in the decision to cut jobs the 
airline said 
also thursday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland extended 
until feb 12 fridays deadline for eastern to submit its revised 
reorganization plan the judge already has given the airline 
several such extensions

dealers attributed the higher stock market start to dollar 
selling on a news report that japans ruling liberal democratic 
party might lose an election for the powerful lower house of

caused more by yearend position adjustments 
with dollarbased account settlements becoming due some 
dealers found themselves short on collection and bought dollars 
he said 
on the stock exchange a dealer with nippon kangyo kakumaru 
securities co said transactions of trading firm issues dominated 
the selling 
this shows that the new year will open with trading firm 
issues at the center of trading he said speaking anonymously 
that the year ended with four consecutive days of increases
