lalo a bomb maker with one 
arm pressed a whittled foilsheathed plug through a tube wired to 
a flashlight battery and tiny bulb the bulb went on 
boom lalo said softly there goes your foot 
the switch is designed to be buried and activated by a soldiers 
footstep it is one of dozens of devices leftist rebels have 
improvised to make up for a shortage of commercial weaponry 
lalo whose left arm was blown off by a mine makes explosives 
from various mixtures of nitrogenrich fertilizer ground charcoal 
from the guarumo tree powdered aluminum ammonia sulfur and 
sawdust for shrapnel lalo uses nails glass even stones 
he and his assistant jorge fashion their mines and mortar 
shells on this extinct volcano 15 miles north of san salvador with 
the rudimentary tools of a traveling tinker 
everything we make is a copy of industrially manufactured 
weapons lalo said 
five years ago he lost his arm to the explosion of a homemade 
mine he was digging up for relocation 
every amorer makes two mistakes he told an interviewer 
stripping wire with his teeth the first when he gets into this 
line of work the second when he gets creamed 
details of government casualties are classified but foreign 
military attaches say homemade mines wounded more soldiers than 
rifle fire in the 1980s 
the most common guerrilla mine is the quitapie literally 
foottaker it is designed to maim rather than kill and its 
components cost about 2 
congress voted in october to halve us military aid to el 
salvador originally set at 85 million for the year 
while defense minister rene emilo ponce lamented the effect on 
logistics and operations lalo and his colleagues were making bombs 
of what seemed little more than chewing gum baling wire sticks 
and spit 
more than 1 billion in us military aid in the 1980s swelled 
the armed forces from 12000 to 56000 men and gave them 
sophisticated weapons including jet fighterbombers helicopters 
and artillery 
rebel ranks are believed to have about 7000 fulltime 
combatants and roughly the same number of militia fighters 
they have received some arms mainly assault rifles and 
ammunition from cuba and nicaragua since the civil war began in 
late 1979 but generally rely on the black market and their own 
ingenuity 
included in the arsenal are 35pound bombs made from refillable 
tanks of the propane gas salvadoran workers use as cooking fuel a 
dozen such bombs launched like mortar rounds from barrelsized 
pipes were among projectiles that rained on the main air force 
base in an attack oct 17 
guerrilla arms makers are scavengers who utilize what the enemy 
throws away or inadvertently bestows 
bomb casings are made from ration cans discarded by army 
patrols lalo has extracted as much as 200 pounds of tritonal high 
explosive from ussupplied 500 lb bombs that did not explode 
when dropped on the slopes of guazapa 
like lalo and his arms makers guerrilla doctors also 
demonstrate great ingenuity 
in 198283 the rebels on guazapa were decimated by a malaria 
epidemic pharmaceutcal quinine was almost impossible to obtain 
because of government offensives 
the doctors extracted the alkaloid from the bark of the cinchona 
tree mixed it with cornmeal and sugar and pressed it into pills 
by early 1984 the disease was under control 
agusto one of the doctors recalled operating with a razor 
blade and tweezers for lack of surgical implements he learned to 
modify a disposable syringe for tracheotomies and used the severed 
fingers of rubber gloves to drain wounds of pus and blood 
ive done several amputations with the saw blade of a swiss 
army knife he said 
folk medicine based on herbs sap roots and bark is a mainstay 
during the early 1980s when their positions on and around 
guazapa were less stable and lines of supply more tenuous rebels 
recruited the local bootlegger to distill cane liquor into 
hospitalgrade alcohol

electrician sami 
kanouneh is one of thousands of palestinians who have become 
economic casualties of rising arabisraeli violence 
the jewish contractor who had employed kanouneh for the past 12 
years fired him on oct 29 
he was fed up with strikes curfews and the army closing the 
roads kanouneh said in an interview in this refugee camp south 
of jerusalem and i think he was afraid 
a wave of stabbing attacks by palestinians and israelis since 
midoctober was the last straw in labor tensions built up during 
the 34monthold uprising against israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the arab stabbings of israelis and counterattacks by jews 
followed the oct 8 slayings of 20 palestinians by police on 
jerusalems temple mount five people have died and more than a 
dozen have been wounded in revenge attacks 
no official figures exist on how many palestinians have been 
laid off since the latest arabjewish violence began 
but israeli newspapers have carried almost daily reports of 
palestinian firings they include the cleaning crew at a big tel 
aviv shopping mall construction workers at a nearby bus terminal 
textile mill employees in southern dimona and restaurant workers in 
jerusalem 
shaher saed secretarygeneral of the west bank trade union 
federation estimates that 9000 of the 110000 palestinians 
employed in israel have lost their jobs since the temple mount 
riot 
israels employment service reported 10000 requests for workers 
during a fiveday army closure of the occupied territories to 
prevent arab attacks that is seven times more than normal said 
benny schwartz of the service 
the layoffs couldnt come at a worse time for the 17 million 
palestinians living in lands seized by israel in the 1967 middle 
east war 
they already faced new competition for jobs from the thousands 
of soviet jews emigrating to israel the 120store coop blue 
square supermarket chain has replaced its arab cleaning crews with 
soviets company officials said 
and palestinians cant turn to the occupied lands for work 
israeli restrictions on industry and a lack of investment in the 
territories have left the arabs with few factories neither basic 
industries such as steel and cement nor hightech ones such as 
electronics 
the west bank data project an israeli think tank headed by 
former jerusalem deputy mayor meron benvenisti accuses israel of 
systematically blocking development in the territories 
the goal has been to keep palestinians as a cheap and captive 
labor force and the territories as a ready market for israelimade 
goods it concludes 
palestinian businessman charles shamas says israel has denied 
construction permits limited imports of raw material refused 
marketing permits and even taxed loans and grants for palestinian 
development 
in general they will not permit any industry that could 
compete with theirs especially in the export market shamas 
said 
for arab workers such as kanouneh 28 this means there are few 
jobs to replace those lost in israel 
ive been looking everywhere but there is no work he said 
a father of six he has food to buy utility bills to pay and no 
savings to fall back on 
many israeli employers are keeping arab workers out of loyalty 
or to keep paying cheap wages but the realization that thousands 
more might be fired has prompted another look at government 
policies on palestinian labor 
defense minister moshe arens told a parliament committee this 
week that israel risks social upheaval if there is a wholesale 
firing of arabs 
what arens is saying is that the policy of the government 
since 1967 was to create job opportunities for arabs from the 
territories in israel said arens aide dan neveh now is the 
time to start changing this so israelis will get the opportunities 
in israel and arabs will find jobs in the territories 
some palestinians were skeptical that israel would do anything 
to make up for the lost jobs saying israelis feared economic 
independence would only encourage calls for a palestinian state 
economist adel samara from the west bank town of ramallah said 
the new layoffs could quickly damage the territories 15 billion 
economy 
most workers have no savings he said their financial 
difficulties will be immediate and their lower consumption will 
result in further economic stagnation in the territories 
and saed the trade unionist said the dismissals of arabs could 
be costly to israeli businesses 
the average palestinian construction worker earns 1200 
shekels 600 a month saed said an israeli would demand 
double and he also would get benefits like unemployment insurance 
and pension 
it will be hard to find unemployed israelis willing to clean 
streets work in bakeries and do other menial jobs that 
palestinians have filled he said

pianist leon fleishers tragedy was losing his 
right hand to a crippling muscle disorder his triumph was showing 
the world that it hardly mattered 
after building a new life for himself in the past 
quartercentury as a conductor and teacher fleisher 62 returned 
to the concert stage last weekend for a bravura piano recital 
featuring solo works for the left hand only 
his homecoming performance in the kennedy centers crowded 
terrace theater was praised by music critics with the same 
enthusiasm that greeted his carnegie hall debut with the new york 
philharmonic in 1944 when he was a gangly 16yearold from san 
francisco 
several works on saturday nights program were written for other 
great pianists who like fleisher were unable to use their right 
hands they included russian composer alexander scriabin who 
suffered the same ailment as fleisher and viennese pianist paul 
wittgenstein who lost his right arm in world war i 
it was fleishers first solo recital in a major concert hall 
since he was stricken more than 25 years ago 
when fleisher withdrew from the concert stage in april 1965 on 
the eve of a european tour with the cleveland orchestra his 
righthand fingers had become weak numb and beyond control 
once hailed by the new york times as the finest american 
pianist of his and probably any time fleisher was devastated 
i had the sense that my whole world had dropped out from under 
me he said my whole lifes direction pointed toward the 
abyss for two years i struggled with why did this happen to 
me i was wallowing in selfpity 
he was rescued by dina koston a former student at the peabody 
institute in baltimore who persuaded him to become codirector and 
conductor of the kennedy centers resident chamber music ensemble 
the theater chamber players in 1968 
she came up with a suggestion that took me out of that abyss 
and showed me i could still function as a musician fleisher 
said 
thus began his resurrection as guest conductor of many of the 
worlds major symphony orchestras an opera conductor associate 
conductor of the baltimore symphony and artistic director of the 
berkshire music center at tanglewood mass 
meanwhile fleisher completed 30 years of teaching at peabody 
last spring and is busy recording the known repertoire of 
lefthand piano concertos with the boston symphony he plans to 
write his memoirs under the title eightyeight keys and no 
lock 
doctors have never diagnosed his affliction which he dismisses 
as writers cramp a subsequent bout of carpal tunnel syndrome 
a painful nerve disorder of the wrist and hand which scriabin and 
robert schumann also suffered was cured surgically 
these ailments are common to professional pianists typists and 
others whose work requires sustained repetitive wrist motions 
man was not created for the computer keyboard or the piano 
fleisher said 
fleisher said he practiced incorrectly even stupidly for 
six to eight hours a day for 20 years until the muscles of his 
right hand just curled up and said dont beat on me anymore 
the damage was irreversible 
no matter fleisher is too busy savoring his rich new life to 
waste time fretting over the past 
ive learned a lot he said what you think are the most 
important things in the world are not the most important whats 
important are relations with people nature the world around us 
thats where its at 
fleisher said his handicap has somehow opened my ears 
making him a good listener for the first time in his life he 
believes it also has improved his teaching by forcing him to 
verbalize his musical concepts instead of demonstrating them on 
the keyboard 
the ecstasy of conducting has been a revelation he said 
he recalled conducting the boston symphony in a performance of 
rachmaninoffs symphony no 2 it took my breath away he said 
it was like riding the crest of a tidal wave it was 
incredible 
he also enjoyed some extraordinary moments conducting a 
community orchestra in annapolis md whose amateur musicians 
got so caught up that they rose to levels they never knew they 
were capable of 
just as he has finally learned to play the piano properly using 
forearms and shoulders rather than hammering away with curled 
fingers fleisher has become aware of the hazards of such ordinary 
objects as doorknobs 
its a totally unhealthy design he said curving his 
fingers around an imaginary doorknob and twisting his wrist door 
handles are much better

iraqs elaborate fortifications in kuwait 
including trenches filled with flammable oil products are 
complicating american military planning a senior marine corps 
officer says 
gen john r dailey the deputy commandant of the marines said 
monday that us forces in the persian gulf region are capable of 
overcoming any iraqi defense although he stressed that president 
bush has given no order to conduct an offensive against iraq 
dailey also said in an interview that the marines have not been 
told to expand the size of their 45000troop force in the gulf 
area he said adding troops remained a possibility and that about 
55000 marines in the united states have been readied for possible 
deployment 
the general said the prospect of iraq raising an oilfed wall of 
fire around its defensive positions on kuwaits southern border 
with saudi arabia and along its eastern gulf shoreline added a new 
twist to us contingency plannin 
with the dust and smoke mixed its going to be hard to see 
targets ahead and that will impact on the tactical air support 
and the artillery and the naval gunfire he said so all the 
supporting arms are degraded to some extent 
even so dailey said the marines are trained to handle unusual 
obstacles 
one of the ways we would get through these tank traps is to 
fill them in with bulldozers that would come in and push sand 
down the side which would tend to put the fires out he said 
for all the things hes doing we have techniques to breach 
dailey said a firewall we could drive through in any of the 
equipment we have unless it was so wide that it would burn all of 
the oxygen and the engines wouldnt run 
the general said fires even if they included oilfed blazes 
offshore from kuwait city would not stop a successful amphibious 
landing he said troops could be taken ashore in their amphibious 
assault vehicles which are routinely tested against fire damage 
heavy equipment such as tanks would hit the beaches aboard landing 
craft that move across water and ground on an air cushion 
helicopters could simply fly beyond the fire obstacles and 
airplanes such as the marines av8b harrier jump jets could help 
clear the way for ground forces dailey said 
an amphibious assault force of about 11000 marines has been 
afloat in the gulf since early in the crisis it is practicing 
amphibious landings in the northern arabian sea 
the general said that while an amphibious assault on kuwaits 
coastline might not be the main thrust of a possible us attack 
it could at least divert the iraqi armys attention away from a 
largerscale offensive elsewhere 
the thing he wouldnt know is where wed come from if we 
decided to move against him he said 
the pentagon estimates that 430000 iraqi troops are in and 
around kuwait the us force in the area is nearly 240000 and 
more than 100000 other foreign forces are there too

the fate of ronald harmelin and possibly the 
use of mandatory life prison terms in the war on drugs hinges on a 
supreme court ruling over what is cruel and unusual punishment 
the justices heard arguments monday in a case from michigan over 
the constitutionality of life behind bars without parole for 
cocaine possession and over the deterrent effect of such stiff 
sentences 
what are you going to do next cut their arms off said 
carla johnson an attorney for harmelin sentenced to a mandatory 
life term in michigan for possessing about 1 pounds of cocaine 
ms johnson said the state law the toughest of its kind in the 
nation has failed to deter drug dealing and most often snares the 
lowlevel courier and not the narcotics kingpin 
in this war on drugs we have to fight it with constitutional 
weapons she said 
some justices sounded skeptical repeatedly asking ms johnson 
to propose a broad principle defining what punishment is 
permissible the court is expected to announce its decision by 
july 
in other action monday the court 
carved out a oneman exception to the militarys ban on 
homosexuals letting stand a ruling the army must reenlist gay 
soldier perry watkins of tacoma wash an appeals court did not 
address the validity of the militarys ban on homosexuals but 
instead noted the army repeatedly had reenlisted watkins while 
knowing he is gay 
refused to let some puerto rico cable tv systems be prosecuted 
for carrying the playboy channel rebuffing arguments that states 
antiobscenity efforts may be hampered unduly 
ruled unanimously in a mississippi case that someone suing more 
than one defendant generally does not have to include all of them 
in the same lawsuit 
in the arguments over the harmelin case michigan prosecutor 
richard thompson said the law is helping stem the drug flow because 
mules narcotics distributors are turning in their crime 
bosses to avoid a life behind bars 
previously thompson said short prison terms used to be 
merely a cost of doing business the focus is on the distribution 
system 
harmelin now 45 was stopped by police for going through a red 
light on may 12 1986 there were 672 grams of pure cocaine in his 
cars trunk police also found other items they said are tools of 
the drug dealers trade including a pistol strapped to harmelins 
ankle 
a 1978 michigan law imposes life in prison without parole for 
anyone possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine nearly 1 pounds 
alabama is believed to be the only other state with mandatory 
life for drug possession but in that state the minimum amount of 
drugs is about 15 times the michigan amount 
if the high court upholds the michigan law it could be a green 
light for other states to adopt similar measures 
thompson urged the justices to send a clear signal that 
tough penalties for drug dealers pass constitutional muster 
the supreme court in 1983 overturned by a 54 vote a life 
sentence without parole for a sixtime repeat offender convicted of 
bouncing a 100 check the court said punishment must be 
proportionate to the offense the sentence imposed for other crimes 
in the state and the practice of other states 
since then two justices in the majority lewis f powell and 
william j brennan have retired and have been replaced by 
justices anthony m kennedy and david h souter

do i have to give back the engagement ring now 
that hes called off the wedding 
can i really eat all i want at a restaurants all you can 
eat night 
a pizzeria advertises the best pizza in new yok but i 
disagree can i get a refund 
maybe maybe not and no according to a new legal guide by the 
state bar association that explains new york law to nonlawyers 
with nary a reference to res ipsa loquitur or collateral estoppel 
understanding the law is the first book in a 
questionandanswer format to focus on the law of a specific state 
according to brad carr spokesman for the bar association 
the 995 guides questions are drawn from queries received by 
the bars telephone referral service about a third of the callers 
dont really need legal assistance carr said why call a 
lawyer if you dont have to 
despite its promise of direct simple answers the guide leans 
hard on qualifiers isnt an all you can eat restaurants 
refusal to serve more than two helpings of roast beef false 
advertising probably not the guide mumbles the refusal 
is probably reasonable under the circumstances however a 
complaint to management would probably be in order 
but the guide does offer some solid advice such as never share 
the same divorce lawyer and sets out the law in something like 
black and white 
you cannot work outside the home before the age of 14 unless you 
are a model performer or newspaper carrier you cannot marry 
before 18 without parental consent or before 14 even with it and 
after getting a license you must wait 24 hours to tie the knot 
unless a party is in danger of imminent death or another 
emergency of public interest exists 
a pregnant woman cant force the father to marry her blood 
tests can be used only to rule out paternity not to prove it 
neither spouse is responsible for debts incurred by the other 
before marriage there is no right to sex in marriage but denial 
of it may be grounds for divorce 
the socalled heart balm law that barred former fiances from 
suing to recover engagement rings was repealed years ago now a 
judge can order you to hand back a ring if you got it solely on 
the condition of marriage 
what if a contract contains fancy language that i cant 
understand absent fraud or deception youre bound by it if you 
sign it if you are sold tough meat at a premium price you may 
demand your money back but not if you ate it 
if you default on your home improvement loan you cant stop your 
car from being repossessed as collateral even though its the only 
way you can get to work to make the money to pay off the loan on 
the bright side you cant be jailed for defaulting on a loan 
the guide does its best to dissuade the litigationhappy 
including the man who wants to know if he can sue a restaurant that 
turned him away because he was not wearing a jacket and tie 
the law will not grant a refund to the leisure traveler who 
books a cruise and spends much of it bent over the rail nor will 
it protect the business traveler unable to work because the toddler 
in the next seat wails from boston to los angeles 
you can sue your hairdresser for dying your hair even though 
youd asked for a highlight but you cant sue your neighbor 
because the lawn mower you bought at his garage sale needs major 
repairs 
the seller has no obligation to refund the purchase price of a 
mailorder magicians kit just because an 11yearold deemed it not 
as neat as he expected 
finally you can write your will by hand but you cant videotape 
it and the fee for a cemetery plot must be kept on deposit until 
you use it 
much of the guides legal wisdom is common sense for instance 
one caller noticed a hair in my vegetable in an expensive 
restaurant and wondered if she should have returned it 
the guide says yes and adds gratuiously that a restaurant 
impliedly warrants that the food it serves contains no foreign or 
deleterious substance and is fit for human consumption even if 
its not the best pizza in new york

almost seven in 10 americans responding to a 
survey expect the united states to become involved in a war with 
iraq and most respondents say america should attack if iraq 
mistreats us hostages 
the poll conducted by abc news and released monday also said 
65 percent of those surveyed approve of president bushs handling 
of the crisis in the persian gulf that figure is about the same as 
a poll last month 
bushs approval rate overall was 59 percent up from 51 percent 
last week when the presidents ratings dropped apparently because 
of criticism of his approach to budget negotiations with congress 
about 61 percent disapproved of bushs handling of the nations 
economy the same number that disapproved of the way the democrats 
are dealing with economic matters about 69 percent did not favor 
the approach of republicans in congress to the issue 
on the economy 77 percent of americans said the nations 
economy is getting worse which represents no change from a month 
earlier 
but bushs approval rating for a president heading into midterm 
elections was second only to john f kennedys 61 percent in 
october 1962 
the telephone poll was conducted nov 24 among a random 
sampling of 1093 voters it has a error rate of plus or minus 35 
percentage points 
the survey suggested that americans are hardening their views on 
iraq for instance 
56 percent said the united states should attack iraq if it 
mistreats american hostages and 41 percent favored such an attack 
even if it costs hostages lives 
51 percent favor an attack if the international economic 
embargo does not succeed in driving iraqi troops out of kuwait 
nearly seven in 10 expect the united states will become 
involved in a war with iraq 
twothirds approve of the united states stationing troops in 
saudi arabia while 31 percent believe american forces should have 
stayed out of the gulf 
a majority seven in 10 want bush to gain permission from 
congress before going to war with iraq 
the poll also indicated that the antiincumbent fever may be 
moderating among voters 
some 50 percent said they are inclined to look around for 
someone other than the incumbent but that number is down from 57 
percent last month 
and while 54 percent said they still disapprove of congress 
about 72 percent said they approve of their own representative

united press international says it will be 
forced into liquidation in less than two weeks unless union 
employees of the news service accept a 90day pay cut of 35 
percent 
a spokesman for the wire service guild which represents the 
employees said monday the union is recommending rejection of the 
proposal 
pieter vanbennekom upi executive vice president told 
employees a no vote to the companys request will simply mean 
that after nov 16 we cannot ensure that we will have enough 
cash on hand to meet the payroll and other lifeordeath 
obligations for the next two weeks 
therefore we will have to take the once unthinkable step of 
putting upi into liquidation vanbennekom said 
at this point we see no real alternative if the vote is 
against the proposal upi vice president and spokesman milt capps 
said he declined to say how the liquidation would be carried out 
chris dahl secretarytreasurer of the guild said from the 
unions headquarters in new york there is little doubt in our 
minds that the company needs a lot of money and it needs a lot of 
money fast we are simply saying that they are coming to the wrong 
people to get that kind of money 
these employees cant afford a 35 percent wage cut dahl 
said he said upi has come to us for concessions probably seven 
times in the last decade and there is no more left to give 
still he said the proposal would be submitted to the members 
because this is a very very serious situation that every member 
should have the opportunity to have their own say on 
capps declined to say how many employees are involved saying it 
is against company policy an industry source speaking on the 
condition he not be identified estimated there are 500 to 600 
employees covered by the guild contract of whom about 300 belong 
to the union 
upi announced friday that it had cut management salaries by 35 
percent for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from 
employees represented by the guild in an effort to improve the 
companys financial condition as it seeks a buyer 
upi has changed ownership three times in the past eight years 
the news service announced in september that it would close bureaus 
in five states and said oct 12 it was dismissing an unspecified 
number of employees 
vanbennekom in a message to employees transmitted over the 
companys wires said upi in its last few decades never had a 
real chance at taking its rightful place among the successful 
giants of the growing information industry it is up to us now to 
make sure we get a real chance 
he cautioned however that approval of the pay cut would not 
guarantee upi will be successfully sold 
the only thing it guarantees is that we will be able to take 
the process to its conclusion giving us vital breathing room to 
find the best possible home for upi he said 
vanbennekom said last friday that at least six possible buyers 
had expressed interest in the 83yearold news service which is 
owned by infotechnology inc 
he told employees that if the proposal is rejected it is 
virtually certain that there will be no assets left to satisfy 
obligations such as severance pay

democrats hold out hope that todays election 
will boost their senate majority to the largest margin since the 
final years of the carter administration 
the outcome of a tossup contest in north carolina and close 
races in oregon and minnesota will determine whether those hopes 
are realized or remain stars in democratic eyes 
political historian allan lichtman of american university 
believes the latter is likely 
forget all the nonsense about turn the rascals out ninety 
percent of the incumbents are holding firm lichtman said monday 
forecasting little change in the 5545 democratic advantage in the 
senate 
it may be the only change will come in hawaii where republican 
rep pat saiki has a strong shot at unseating recently appointed 
democratic sen daniel akaka and that could narrow the democrats 
margin 
nevertheless democrats are counting on a few surprises in 
several states 
their prime target in 1990 has been north carolinas republican 
sen jesse helms who faces a strong test from challenger harvey 
gantt 
polls differed on who was the leader going into todays 
election 
on the final day of campaigning monday helms charged that 
gantt who is black supports racial quotas in job hiring but 
helms denied he had made race an issue in the volatile contest 
gantt said he would accept helms liberal label if the 
definition of the word is a person who cares 
also on the eve of the election the justice department 
announced it was sending a team of lawyers to north carolina to try 
to ensure that minority voters arent disqualified from voting 
based on information gathered by the state republican party 
democrats have accused the state gop of sending out postcards to 
intimidate black voters who otherwise might vote for gantt and of 
gathering information with which to challenge the eligibility of 
minority voters 
elsewhere republican sens mark hatfield of oregon and rudy 
boschwitz of minnesota received political scares last month as 
polls showed their opponents within striking distance 
both incumbents appear to have stemmed the tide of voter 
disenchantment although polls have businessmanscientist harry 
lonsdale not far behind hatfield and college professor paul 
wellstone was close on the heels of boschwitz 
in the latest political volley the boschwitz camp sent a letter 
to the minnesota jewish community noting that while both candidates 
are jewish wellstone married a nonjew and his children are not 
being raised in the religion 
wellstone called the letter unforgivable the most personal 
attack of all 
not since the last years of the carter administration 197980 
have the democrats enjoyed such a lopsided majority in the 
senate then the democrats held a 5941 margin 
they lost control of the senate in the 1980 reagan landslide and 
didnt reclaim it until 1986 
a victory for gantt could change the tenor of the senate where 
lawmakers have fought long and hard with helms the 
archconservative who has sought to end federal assistance for arts 
deemed pornographic and to reduce spending to combat aids 
helms dubbed senator no battled both the democrats and the 
gop administration over the 1988 ussoviet treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles from europe helms was one of 
five votes against the pact 
the senate is likely to take up the expected ussoviet 
agreement to limit conventional forces in europe when it returns 
next year helms is certain to lead the fight against that pact if 
hes still in the senate 
if elected gantt would be only the fourth black to serve in the 
senate and the first since republican edward w brooke represented 
massachusetts from 1967 to 1979 
the other two blacks were mississippi republicans hiram r 
revels 18701871 and blanche k bruce 18751881 
if saiki wins it would be the first time three women have 
served in the senate since 1954 when republican margaret chase 
smith represented maine and nebraska republicans hazel h abel and 
eva k bowring were appointed 
it also would mark the first time the senate included three 
elected female members the others are sens nancy kassebaum 
rkan and barbara mikulski dmd

the justice department filed suit to force 
tennessee to accept absentee ballot applications sent by facsimile 
transmission from three servicemen stationed in the middle east 
the lawsuit charged that tennessee the only state the justice 
department said was not allowing us soldiers in the middle east 
to vote by fax was violating the uniformed and overseas citizens 
absentee voting act 
the complaint filed in us district court in nashville stated 
that shelby county election commission on the advice of the state 
refused to accept absentee ballot applications from three gis 
the refusal was based on a state legal opinion that the absentee 
applications were not mail as defined by the tennessee election 
statute but the complaint contends that the election law allows 
applications by mail to be in any form 
assistant attorney general john r dunne said in a statement 
that tennessee is the only state to refuse applications for 
absentee ballots actually sent by fax from military personnel 
the complaint seeks a court order directing the state to accept 
the three applications send the gis absentee ballots as quickly as 
possible and count the ballots if they are cast in accordance with 
the law

a constant stream of oil tanker trucks 
flows in both directions over the jordanianiraqi borders but 
police turn away jordanian trucks stacked with food supplies for 
iraq 
the jordanbound tankers full of crude petroleum rumbled in at 
a rate of two a minute during an overnight observation sunday night 
and monday morning 
but that was the only activity in ruweishid a bleak desert 
outpost 210 miles northeast of amman 
camps that housed tens of thousands of arab and asian refugees 
fleeing iraq and kuwait are now empty except for the jordanian 
army and desert police who patrol the frontier 
some refugees from kuwait have said they saw jordanian trucks 
loaded with vegetables in the captive emirate but any lapse in 
enforcing sanctions on the only highway linking iraq and jordan 
appears to have been a thing of the past 
open the trunk an army officer bellowed at a driver at a 
border checkpoint he confiscated a bag of cookies 
you are not allowed to take this or any food to the iraqi 
borders he shouted unaware he was talking to a reporter 
the border has increased in importance as a key link in the 
unmandated embargo on trade with baghdad that seeks to force 
saddam hussein to relinquish kuwait 
iraqs economy is particularly vulnerable because it depends on 
exporting oil and importing food iraq had imported at least 70 
percent of its food much of it from the united states canada and 
australia and was anticipating oil revenue of 14 billion to 15 
billion this year 
jordan dragged its feet in implementing the sanctions amman 
depends heavily on trade with iraq and saddam hussein enjoys 
popular support in jordan 
king hussein found it hard to comply immediately 
but with the incentive of economic aid from the persian gulf oil 
states to help an economy reeling from refugees and trade losses 
jordan sealed the border shut for food and other supplies 
information minister ibrahim izzeddine said in an interview 
thagt jordan does not stop the oil tankers because we do not have 
any other oil resource at this moment 
we have informed the un sanctions committee that we did not 
stop importing iraqi oil because we need iraqs oil now that saudi 
arabia cut off its oil supplies to jordan he said 
the saudiowned tapline corp stopped supplying oil to jordan in 
september claiming jordan had an outstanding debt of 46 million 
many observers interpreted the move as punishment for supporting 
iraq 
finance minister basil jerdaneh denies jordan is failing to 
honor the embargo we will not allow any violations of the 
mandatory sanctions or tolerate anything like that 
he says jordan has issued strict orders to police to stop all 
relief convoys from crossing into iraq adding that the army has 
so far succeeded in stopping all convoys including supplies on 
humanitarian grounds 
truck convoys set up by jordanian charity groups carried food 
and medicine to iraq in september 
i have instructions to allow only oil tankers across after i 
check their cargo a young jordanian soldier told a reporter who 
cruised miles of back roads during the night 
dozens of jordanian army patrols were seen in ruweishid and 
nearby desert towns along the border all vehicles were forced to 
stop at nine separate police checkpoints 
at about dawn monday a line of 14 trucks was parked at the 
entrance to ruweishid police threatened to arrest truck drivers 
if they did not turn back to amman 
we are carrying food supplies for the iraqi people said one 
driver who identified himself as mohammad taji i know we are 
not allowed to do so but we do not want to see a neighbor 
starving 
oil coming into jordan is a different matter 
before the crisis that began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait jordan relied on iraq and kuwait for about 90 percent of 
its annual imports of approximately 22 million barrels of oil and 
oil derivatives 
it bought the rest from saudi arabia 
the oilrich kingdom offered in midaugust to provide jordan 
with 35000 barrels of oil daily to help wean it from depending on 
iraqi oil 
we are importing oil from iraq under a special arrangement 
under which iraq is repaying a 310 million debt to jordan 
incurred during the iraniraq war said izzeddine 
jerdaneh has said that under the agreement the price of oil 
will not exceed 1640 a barrel well below current world market 
rates

a technical error in billdrafting is 
accomplishing what pitched battles on the floor of congress 
sometimes fail to produce a cut in us foreign affairs spending 
to the tune of 395 million 
lawmakers plan to restore the lost money when the 102nd congress 
convenes in january in the meantime the cut is small enough 19 
percent of a 20 billion foreign operations budget that 
bureaucrats will be able to minimize the effects by juggling other 
funds officials said 
but the slipup is an embarrassing one coming on the heels of a 
yearlong budget war between president bush and congressional 
democrats that polls say added to the publics lack of faith in 
government officials 
administration and congressional aides who discussed the 
blunder on condition of anonymity agreed that the mistake was made 
late last month during congress dash to finish its business and 
adjourn for the year 
its too bad we couldnt change it said one congressional 
official but everyone was gone by the time we figured it out 
but once committed the error forces acrosstheboard cuts under 
new budget procedures congress also enacted in the hours before its 
departure 
all foreign operations spending will be reduced by 19 percent 
until the money is restored including foreign aid operations of 
the state department and its embassies and us contributions to 
the united nations and other international organizations 
at this point the state department and other international 
agencies and omb are working to see there is as minimal an impact 
resulting from this as possible said state department 
spokeswoman nancy beck 
omb is the office of management and budget the white house 
agency that oversees federal spending 
an administration official said the slashes probably would be 
triggered on friday 
one of the last measures lawmakers approved on oct 27 hours 
before adjournment was the annual foreign aid bill 
the measure provided 155 billion for the budget year that 
began oct 1 separate legislation provided another 46 billion 
for the operations of the state department and its embassies and 
for us contributions to international organizations bringing 
total foreign affairs spending to 201 billion 
included in the 155 billion foreign aid legislation was 46 
billion for military assistance the bill also granted 403 million 
in military loans 
but instead of including the 403 million within the 46 
billion in total military assistance which should have occurred 
the bill was written to make the 403 million additional spending 
the error referred to by one aide as our little glitch 
caused a problem with the new budget procedures 
under those rules spending on international programs may not 
exceed 201 billion this year if it does all foreign affairs 
spending is cut acrosstheboard by enough to compensate for the 
over spending 
because of the drafting error that 201 billion cap was 
exceeded by 395 million that will result in a 19 percent cut in 
all foreign affairs programs until congress restores the money 
the new budget law states that the acrosstheboard cuts must 
take effect within 15 days after congress adjourns 
the laws are very strict the official said 
the new congress will be sworn in on january 3 it then plans to 
recess and return for legislative business on about jan 21

a private study says a spacecraft that can 
climb into orbit by firing a single group of reusable rockets could 
cut the cost of flying in space dramatically 
the study advocates an aircrafttype operation capable of 
putting a ship into orbit every two days 
the pentagons star wars organization has four aerospace firms 
under contract to design a singlestagetoorbit spacecraft 
choosing from among ships that take off and land vertically those 
that take off and land like a conventional airplane and those that 
are launched vertically and land on a runway like the space 
shuttle 
the organization high frontier studied a concept in which a 
coneshaped vehicle named ssx for spaceship experimental would 
launch and land vertically using eight thrusters 
operating a fleet of four such vehicles the study says would 
bring down the cost of putting a satellite into low earth orbit 
from 10803 a pound to 440 the study estimated that building a 
prototype of the ssx would be 16 billion 
at present the united states is concentrating on developing new 
space technologies for the national aerospace plane the 
socalled orient express envisioned by former president reagan 
and has budgeted 258 million for the project this year 
daniel o graham a retired lieutenant general who heads high 
frontier said the ssx would draw on the lightweight materials and 
other advanced technologies developed for the plane high frontier 
is an organization made up of retired military officers scientists 
and engineers that strongly backs the strategic defense initiative 
popularly called star wars 
graham said it takes 12447 people for space shuttle operations 
a major part of the expense but that the ssx would reduce that 
number by 96 percent

rabbi meir kahane who campaigned to drive arabs 
from israel and urged american jews to arm themselves against 
antisemitism was shot to death monday night after a speech at a 
manhattan hotel 
police identified the assailant as el sayyid a nosair 35 
whose nationality was unknown he was wounded by a postal police 
officer as they exchanged gunfire outside the halloran house said 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli 
the postal officer and a bystander in the hotel were also 
wounded police said 
kahane 58 a brooklynborn israeli extremist who once served in 
the israeli parliament was pronounced dead at bellevue hospital 
said hospital spokesman peter schectman 
mayor david dinkins said the shooting was an international 
tragedy that shocks all of us 
kahane was head of the antiarab kach party in israel the party 
advocates the ouster of all arabs from israeliheld territory and a 
ban on jewisharab marriages the movements symbol is a clenched 
fist inside a star of david 
kahane founded the militant jewish defense league in the united 
states in 1968 to mount armed responses to antisemitic acts the 
group organized classes in karate and weapons training and held 
patrols in highcrime neighborhoods 
seymour reich chairman of the conference of presidents of major 
americanjewish organizations called kahane a highly 
controversial figure who had strong supporters and opponents 
whatever one thought about his political program his shocking 
assassination will be deplored by friends and foes alike he 
said 
witnesses said kahane had given a speech to about 60 people at a 
meeting of the zionist emergency evacuation rescue organization 
shortly after 9 pm as kahane answered questions from the podium 
a gunman who sat through the speech stood up and fired twice at him 
from a distance of about 4 feet borrelli said kahane was hit once 
in the neck 
the assailant ran from the room bumping into a 73yearold man 
whom he shot in the leg borrelli said 
the gunman fled outside and tried to hijack a taxi he said an 
onduty postal officer outside a nearby post office intervened 
they exchanged gunshots and both were wounded 
the officer was shot in the arm and the gunman was hit in the 
chin 
all were taken to bellevue where the gunman was taken to 
surgery said hospital spokeswoman karen crowe he was expected to 
survive the officers wound was superficial she said all were 
listed in stable condition 
the gunmans nationality was unknown and he apparently lived in 
new jersey borrelli said 
the hotel on lexington avenue is also called the new york 
marriott east side 
kahane served as a member of the knesset israels parliament 
for four years but was barred from running for reelection in 1988 
after legislators passed a law banning parties that have a racist 
platform 
in september kahane went on trial in jerusalem on charges of 
disturbing public order for leading an antiarab rally after the 
stabbing deaths of two israelis last year kahane was also charged 
with sedition for calling arabs cancer spreading in our midsts 
during a separate incident another hearing in the trial was 
scheduled for december 
the sedition charge stems from a kahane rally in jerusalem on 
july 7 1989 a day after a palestinian from the occupied gaza 
strip grabbed the wheel of an israeli bus plunging it into a steep 
ravine on the tel avivjerusalem highway sixteen people were 
killed in the attack 
kill those who come to kill you kahane told the crowd his 
supporters chanted death to the arabs and waved signs 
demanding that all arabs be expelled from israel and the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
kahane moved to israel in 1971 and became a citizen a year 
later he renounced his american citizenship to run for israels 
parliament 
kahane conceded in a 1971 interview that the jewish defense 
leagues tactics were inspired by black militant groups 
our point of view is that no antisemitism was ever created by 
a jew who fought back kahane said 
he was born martin david kahane on aug 1 1932 in the new york 
city borough of brooklyn he began using the name meir after his 
ordination as a rabbi in 1957 
martin cohen an attorney and follower of kahane who was at 
mondays meeting called kahane a martyr 
he stood for every jew who no longer wants to be kicked 
around for every jew who remembers the holocaust cohen said 
many people believed he was an extremist but he was a kind 
gentle man who died for what he believed 
rabbi alexander schindler president of the union of american 
hebrew congregations said he disagreed strongly with kahanes 
political philosophy 
i nevertheless deeply regret his violent end schindler 
said he did not deserve to die by an assassins bullet

life may or may not begin at 40 but a new 
federal study says getting on in years does not mean a person has 
to get old in the sense of getting sick and frail 
a committee of the institute of medicine said in a report 
released monday the fact is that research health promotion and 
education can head off much of the illness and disability 
associated with aging 
our misplaced pessimism gives rise to the particularly 
troubling consequence that many more individuals who could 
experience a fulfilling maturity are denied the chance by these 
stereotypes the committee report said 
we should not let pessimism become an obstacle to the 
introduction of new research on interventions to restore and 
maintain function among physically or mentally impaired older 
people 
since american society is gradually aging the report said the 
medical community should promote healthy lifestyles not only for 
the young but for all ages 
the committee made recommendations in 13 areas 
high blood pressure since high blood pressure often precedes 
stroke and heart attack the committee said there should be 
programs of education detection and treatment among those over age 
50 it said medicare and private insurance should reimburse the 
expense of doctor visits to evaluate blood pressure and that more 
research is needed on treating hypertension in the elderly 
medications age should be taken into account in testing drugs 
health care workers and elderly patients should be more aware of 
the combined effects possible from combinations of medications 
infectious diseases all people over 50 should be immunized 
against pneumonia and influenza better infection controls should 
be used in hospitals and nursing homes 
osteoporosis older people should be instructed about measures 
to prevent thinning of the bones such as adequate calcium and 
vitamin d intake and the need to maintain physical activity more 
research is needed about how to best treat fractures caused by 
osteoporosis 
sensory loss better services should be provided to those 
losing sight and hearing and public and private insurers should 
cover more of these costs 
oral health more research is needed to achieve and maintain 
dental health among the elderly dental loss now is largely 
preventable in the elderly 
cancer screening more aggressive cancer checkups should be 
instituted among the elderly 
nutrition further research is needed on the minimum nutrition 
requirements of the elderly 
smoking even the elderly should be encouraged to stop 
advertising of tobacco products should be banned 
depression doctors should be trained to recognize and treat 
depression among the elderly and some limitations on medicare and 
insurance reimbursements for psychiatric care should be removed 
physical inactivity sedentary lifestyles can damage health 
health care workers should promote programs to encourage elderly to 
get regular exercise 
social isolation isolated individuals should be identified and 
means found to give them more social contact loneliness the 
report said can play an important role in development of disease 
and disability 
falls falls among the elderly are a major cause of 
mortality morbidity and disability the report said it 
recommends more research on methods of preventing falls and 
studies on how best to treat injuries that result from falls 
the institute of medicine is associated with the national 
academy of sciences which is a private organization chartered by 
congress to be an advisor to the federal government

rabbi meir kahane was hated by the israeli 
establishment but could gather thousands of fanatical young jews to 
march through the streets of jerusalem shouting death to the 
arabs 
kahane who was shot to death in his native new york on monday 
night founded the militant jewish defense league in the united 
states 
in israel he created the kach movement which demanded the 
ouster of all arabs from israeliheld territory 
the 58yearold rabbi with a saltandpepper beard and piercing 
eyes could give coldly logical explanations for his views at news 
conferences and speeches arousing hatred on the streets 
revenge is a very jewish concept he used to say when asked 
about his call to expel the 17 million palestinians from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip as well as the 800000 arab 
citizens from israel 
when he was elected to the israeli parliament in 1984 kahane 
promised a bill that would bring about such an ouster 
there will be a detailed bill calling for the transfer of the 
arabs from the land of israel he said in an interview 
we expect a majority of them to leave on their own since the 
promise is that those who are ready to leave quietly will receive 
compensation and those who wont well throw out he explained 
kahane however was blocked from enforcing his ideas by both 
the israeli left and right his term in the knesset or parliament 
was fiery but without results 
at his death he faced charges of sedition in israel for saying 
at a rally that arabs were a cancer spreading in our midst he 
had been barred in 1988 from running again for the knesset under a 
court ruling that deemed his faction racist 
kahane however maintained that he was only blocked from 
running because the popularity of his movement was growing amid the 
violence of the palestinian revolt against israels occupation of 
the west bank and gaza 
he maintained that kach would get six or seven seats in the 
120member parliament taking away votes from the rightwing likud 
bloc that heads the israeli government 
i have touched a simple and honest nerve on the part of the 
people he said in a newspaper interview everything in israel 
has a time and this is an idea whose time has come 
kahane born in brooklyn first attracted notoriety in the 
tensions that arose as traditional new york jewish neighborhoods 
began to give way to blacks in the 1960s 
he founded the jewish defense league in 1968 calling on young 
jews to arm themselves against antisemitism 
it began as a patrol group to protect elderly jews from muggers 
in new york neighborhoods but was eventually described as a jewish 
terrorist organization blamed for fatal bombings and other attacks 
on arabs and soviets 
in 1971 kahane moved to israel and urged other american jews to 
follow as a way to build the country into a purely jewish state 
he founded kach hebrew for thus and began preaching his 
philosophy of casting the arabs out by walking through the steets 
waving a bible and shouting through a megaphone 
he was mocked by most israelis and ignored by the news media he 
ran unsuccessfully for the knesset three times 
but the turn to the right that israeli politics took in the late 
1970s was to kahanes advantage after his election in 1984 
israelis were talking about the new phenomenon of kahanism an 
extremist philosophy based on the rabbis frequent characterization 
of arabs as disgusting dogs 
ora namir a member of the centerleft labor party said in 
1985 kahane is articulating what other rightwingers so far dare 
not say out loud the difference is a matter of style not 
content 
gabi sheffer a hebrew university political scientist said the 
kach movement preyed on israelis fear and uncertainty over what to 
do about the arabs in their midst 
even if kahane himself can be regarded as a temporary 
aberration the development of kahanism will continue to haunt 
israel he wrote in the jerusalem post 
israels rightwing leaders vociferously denied they shared 
kahanes ideas my friends and i have nothing in common with the 
man said former prime minister menachem begin whose likud bloc 
ended 29 years of labor party rule in 1977 
after a law was passed to bar political parties that were racist

a hubble space telescope instrument has 
focused on a quasar billions of light years away in the first 
spectral observations of a faint object by the 15 billion 
orbiting telescope says nasa 
the instrument a faint object spectrograph targeted the quasar 
known as um675 in a study of the chemical composition of the early 
universe 
a nasa announcement said monday that the quasar appears to be 
receding from the earth at a speed of about 80 percent of the speed 
of light 
to make the readings the space telescope focused on um675 for 
33 minutes in each of three different orbits a computer at the 
goddard spce center then combined the data to create a single data 
set 
hubble has a focusing problem that seriously affects 
instruments such as cameras that work only in the visible portion 
of the spectrum the focusing flaw however has less effect in the 
invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum

manufacturers would have to tell physicians 
how prescription drugs affect elderly patients under a new 
government proposal 
the information some of which is already provided voluntarily 
by many companies already would have to be included in drug 
labeling sent to physicians and pharmacists said the food and drug 
administration this labeling required by the fda is usually 
available to patients upon request 
as our knowledge has grown of how drugs work within the body 
weve recognized the special concerns associated with drug use in 
the elderly health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
said monday in a statement 
physicians need to be provided with any patient information 
thats available about the drugs they prescribe for senior 
patients he said 
one of the differences between an old patient and a young one is 
the ability of their kidneys people lose a third or more of their 
kidney function between the ages of 30 and 90 sullivan said 
with less kidney function drugs do not clear the body as fast 
this might mean that a muscle relaxant that works fine for a young 
person might relax older people too much causing them to fall and 
break a hip he said 
the american association of retired persons said the proposal is 
important because those over 65 account for more than 30 percent of 
people taking prescription drugs while comprising 12 percent of the 
population 
one of the factors in drug misuse by the elderly is the 
amount of elderlyspecific information that comes from clinical 
trials and then goes to physicians to guide their prescribing 
practices said susan raetzman an aarp research analyst 
the proposal would require manufacturers to include in physician 
labeling all available information on the effects of the drug on 
the elderly this information could come from the clinical trials 
in which the drug was tested before it was approved for commercial 
sale or from medical literature

a shinto shrine in southern japan built to honor a 
legendary emperor caught fire early today and police said they 
suspected arson by radicals opposed to next weeks coronation of 
emperor akihito 
the roof of a wooden gate leading to the kibaru hachimansa 
shrine on the southern island of kyushu and a nearby barn were 
damaged in the fire police said the blaze which broke out 
shortly after midnight was quickly extinguished and there were no 
injuries 
shinto japans indigenous religion is closely associated with 
the monarchy and radical groups that link the monarch to japans 
militarist past have vowed to destroy mondays coronation 
authorities believe radicals were also behind a fire at a shinto 
shrine on okinawa island on monday and a bombing attack on a police 
dormitory in tokyo that killed one policeman and injured six people 
on thursday 
kibaru hachimansha is believed to have been built in the late 
fourth century to honor the 12th emperor keiko 
meanwhile police said that they toda6y raided 20 sites in 
northern tokyo used by the leftwing radical group kakurokyo or 
revolutionary workers association 
police said they seized 29 items including documents and 
wireless transmitters from the groups office in utsunomiya 
university and from leaders homes 
some news reports said police believe a faction within the 
kakurokyo which has about 800 members was responsible for 
thursdays dormitory attack members of the radical group have 
denied involvement 
the attacks have heightened fears that police efforts to guard 
the coronation may not prevent trouble 
police are mounting their largest security operation ever with 
26000 officers more than half the tokyo metropolitan police 
department already deployed on coronationrelated assignments

contact with the plo since it broke off a dialogue in may us 
ambassador thomas pickering has met with a plo envoy to discuss the 
plight of palestinians 
pickering was acting as security council president at the 
meeting monday night which was called to discuss the plos call 
for un observers to protect palestinians in israelioccupied 
territories 
washington severed its dialogue with he palestine liberation 
organization in may after an attack by a radical plo faction on an 
israeli beach 
both sides said mondays meeting was businesslike related only 
to security council business on the occupied territories they said 
there was no hint of resuming the usplo dialogue 
pickering said nonaligned nations had formally requested an 
urgent meeting of the 15member security council to discuss the 
latest violence in the gaza strip no meeting was set the plo said 
it hoped for a meeting today or wednesday at the latest 
pickering a former us ambassador to israel and jordan met 
the plos acting permanent observer m nasser alkidwa for a half 
hour 
us diplomats emphasized that pickering met kidwa strictly in 
his role as president of the security council for november the 
presidency rotates monthly among the 15 members 
pickering said only that the plo discussed its position with him 
concerning a council meeting and its call for un observers he 
declined to elaborate 
earlier monday the plo proposed a resolution asking the 
security council to send unarmed un observers to protect 
palestinians in the territories captured by israel in the 1967 
middle east war 
it also called for the parties to the 1949 fourth geneva 
convention on protection of civilians in time of war to hold an 
unprecedented meeting to protect palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
the proposed plo resolution says the council decides to 
establish immediately under its authority a un observer force 
and to dispatch it to the palestinian territory occupied by israel 
since 1967 including jerusalem 
israel rejects the presence of observers as a violation of its 
sovereignty over the west bank and gaza strip which were captured 
in 1967 from jordan and egypt

for decades neutral sweden and finland 
never considered entering the common market 
now the end of eastwest rivalries and the prospect of economic 
difficulties ahead may combine to bring the countries on europes 
northern tier in from the cold 
last week the image of nordic selfsufficiency and 
disengagement suddenly came apart sweden announced its intention 
to join the european community and angered finland by calling for a 
joint nordic application 
in norway where voters said no to membership in a 
referendum 18 years ago the governing coalition collapsed when its 
smallest partner opposed trade negotiations with the community the 
new laborite government favors the talks 
of the other two nordic nations denmark already is a member 
while iceland is opposed to joining 
foreign minister sten andersson says the end of the cold war and 
the prospects for a new alleuropean security system clear the way 
for neutral countries like sweden to join the european community 
observers have called swedens intention to join the community 
the biggest turnaround in swedish foreign policy since shortly 
after world war ii 
wilhelm agrell a leading security policy expert called it 
the most important political crossroads since 194849 when 
sweden tried to organize a scandinavian defense association 
the governments change of position was announced in an 
emergency economic package presented last week and observers 
agreed it was forced by economic concerns the package itself made 
major changes in domestic policy deeply cutting the welfare system 
the social democratic party built 
economic observers said the declaration of intention to join 
the common market was an attempt to calm swedish industry which 
has made massive investments in community countries 
the swedish concerns do not want to be closed out of their main 
export market in 1993 when community nations are to unite in 
economic union 
the investments had caused a large outflow of swedish currency 
intensifying a drop in the kronas strength and an increase in 
devaluation speculation before the package was announced 
the swedish announcement caused consternation at the european 
communitys brussels headquarters and among fellow european free 
trade association countries which are currently negotiating an 
agreement that would link the two trade associations 
critics say the swedish initiative renders the negotiations 
which also involve norway finland iceland austria and 
switzerland pointless 
finland an avowedly neutral country with traditionally strong 
ties to the soviet union has recently begun discussing future 
european community membership 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said a year ago that 
moscow would not object to finland joining the community 
but when andersson was quoted as saying nordic countries could 
start discussing a joint european community application next year 
finlands president mauno koivisto said the statement was 
premature 
risto penttila a researcher at the finnish foreign policy 
institute said that finland could be in a problematic position in 
the future if there is friction between the soviet union and the 
european community 
finland shares a long common border with the soviet union 
for their part norwegians appear to be warming to the idea of 
european community membership 
a poll of 607 people conducted by the mmi survey institute in 
late october showed 38 percent favored membership 33 percent 
opposed it and 29 percent were undecided no margin for error was 
given

a tv commercial in which a volvo withstands 
attempts by a monster truck to crush it has been dropped by the 
automaker under pressure after it turned out the car had been 
reinforced with steel or wood 
volvo was touted as a car that you can believe in 
unfortunately these ads you could not believe in them said 
texas attorney general jim mattox who had challenged the 
commercial the ad was broadcast nationally 
william hoover senior vice president of volvo cars of north 
america emphasized on monday that independent studies have found 
that volvos are among the safest if not the absolute safest 
cars on the road today 
but he said we agree that the consumers in the state of 
texas as well as consumers throughout the country deserve better 
advertising 
volvo agreed to make no unproven claims run corrective 
newspaper ads and pay the state 316250 in investigative costs 
the automaker admitted no wrongdoing 
in the ad filmed in austin in june a volvo appears to be the 
only car left standing after being run over by a largetire pickup 
the ad is a dramatization of a 1988 vermont event according to the 
company 
however the ad is not billed as a dramatization and mattox 
said the other cars in the ad were weakened structurally while the 
volvo was reinforced 
the modifications were made to ensure the crews safety and 
allow the volvo to withstand the number of runs required by the 
truck in filming the company said 
some of the shots of the truck running over the volvo also may 
have been fabricated mattox said

the corruption scandal that drove 
navajo chairman peter macdonald from office and shook the tribes 
political institutions will eventually result in a stronger more 
honest government some officials say 
the scandal broke wide open two years ago when the navajo 
council suspended macdonald its fourterm chairman amid 
allegations he took money and gifts in exchange for favors to those 
doing business with the biggest us indian tribe 
macdonald convicted sept 17 of bribery theft extortion and 
conspiracy was sentenced to six years in prison and disqualified 
from holding tribal office his son peter rocky macdonald jr 
36 was sentenced to 1 years 
the days of an imperial chairmanship are over said al 
bennett who provided security for several tribal council members 
during the corruption cases most bitter moments two men were shot 
to death during a clash between macdonald supporters and navajo 
police in 1989 
the favoritism of the old days is slowly being phased out 
bennett added what the turmoil has done has strengthened the 
court system of the navajo nation and strengthened the councils 
power it has brought the executive branch in line with the 
distribution of power 
the scandal gave birth to a threebranch form of government for 
the 180000 navajos living on the 21000squaremile reservation in 
arizona new mexico and utah 
the new government established in april has already curbed 
abuses of power by splitting authority between the tribal chairman 
the leader of the tribal council and the tribal courts said navajo 
councilman daniel tso 
he said the judicial branch in particular demonstrated its 
independence during macdonalds trial 
its judges didnt yield to macdonald or to the violence that 
occurred he said 
at the time of his conviction macdonald was seeking election to 
the new position of tribal president his name was struck from the 
ballot and the election was postponed from today to dec 18 
interim president leonard haskie will take macdonalds place on 
the ballot against former tribal chairman peterson zah 
navajo legal advocate carol retasket who defended macdonald 
complained that his punishment was too severe but she agreed that 
the scandal should strengthen navajo political institutions in the 
long run 
before macdonald she said navajos viewed theft by political 
leaders not as a crime but as a quirk to be punished by ridicule 
duane beyal spokesman for the tribes legislative branch 
likened the navajos problems to the growing pains of a new 
government the us government went through the same thing he 
said like any adolescent youre clumsy and awkward

the council 
the leaders and indeed the people have contributed so much to 
bringing the division of europe to an end

dramatic peaceful switch from communist dictatorship to democracy 
are expected to also join the council in the coming months 
the soviet union yugoslavia and bulgaria have observer status 
and romania and albania may become observers soon 
the council of europe which includes nearly all western 
european countries has produced 130 international treaties it is 
best known for the european human rights convention and european 
court of human rights whose rulings are binding on council 
members 
jeszensky signed the human rights treaty at todays ceremony a

france as the national anthem was played 
hungarys admission is the first step in the restoration of 
the unity of our continent jeszensky said 
he added that joining the council was one of the most 
important foreign policy successes of the hungarian government

police said today that four 
blacks were killed including one shot by the army in a township 
near johannesburg where more than 20 people have died in several 
days of black factional fighting 
the killings occurred in bekkersdal where black students 
demanding a boycott of final exams to protest school conditions 
have clashed with pupils who want to take the tests 
police said they found the bodies of three people who were 
killed monday by a crowd the police statement did not indicate 
anything about the affiliation of the attackers or their victims 
a man also died when he was shot by soldiers after he resisted 
arrest and attacked the troops with a knife police said 
at least 23 people have died in the township 40 miles west of 
johannesburg since thursday according to police who believe most 
of the killings are linked to the student violence 
schools have been empty this week many workers have stayed 
home businesses have been closed and some families have fled in 
search of safety 
police said several people were hurt seven were arrested and 
houses were set on fire in clashes on monday authorities said they 
confiscated two ak47 assault rifles from the house of a man who 
belongs to the pan africanist congress a militant black opposition 
group 
militant students are opposed to the yearend exams which 
determine whether students advance to the next grade or gain 
admission to universities they say they have not been able to 
prepare properly because of poor conditions at the schools 
last year 42 percent of black high school seniors nationwide 
passed the final exam compared to a pass rate of more than 95 
percent for white students 
the whiteled government spends about five times as much to 
educate a white pupil as a black pupil and antiapartheid 
activists have complained for years about problems in the black 
schools 
more than 800 blacks have died since august in factional 
fighting in the black townships around johannesburg most of the 
battles have been between supporters of the african national 
congress and the conservative inkatha freedom party the two

mikhail s gorbachevs special envoy to the middle 
east has told western diplomats that his country is not ruling out 
the use of force against iraq the british broadcasting corp has 
reported 
the bbc reported monday that yevgeny primakov told ambassadors 
in moscow that a translator in paris had erred last week in 
interpreting gorbachev as saying a military option was 
unacceptable 
primakov has traveled twice to baghdad for meetings with iraqi 
president saddam hussein in an effort to find a peaceful solution 
to the crisis precipitated by iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the bbc said primakov told the ambassadors that the soviet union 
continues to insist on full implementation of the un resolutions 
ordering an embargo on trade with iraq and demanding an immediate 
and unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
primakov also said there was no sign of the soviet union 
breaking with the international consensus the bbc reported 
the soviet envoy was evasive on what the soviet union would do 
in the event of war in the persian gulf it said 
soviet participation in military action would have to be 
approved by the countrys parliament the bbc quoted primakov as 
saying 
primakov said he found no evidence of popular dissatisfaction 
when he visited iraq and advised the ambassadors that domestic 
difficulties would not undermine saddams position the bbc said 
the bbc reported that primakov told the briefing that the 
embargo appeared to be working but only very slowly 
saddam is doubly determined not to be forced out of kuwait 
emptyhanded after his experience with the eightyear iraniraq 
war the bbc quoted primakov as telling the ambassadors

thousands of southern baptists nationwide 
are considering state budgets that could deepen the decadeold 
split between conservatives and moderates in the nations largest 
protestant denomination 
moderates in virginia north carolina and south carolina are 
pushing for spending plans that would withhold contributions from 
some of the churchs national programs in which the conservatives 
or fundamentalists hold way 
such contributions support missionary educational and 
benevolent work 
if the spending plans are approved they could wreck the 
national budget adopted in june for the 149 million southern 
baptists 
we are going to have churches torn apart families torn apart 
ministers torn apart said neil jones a moderate pastor of 
columbia baptist church in falls church some of my good friends 
are preachers on the other side 
the most damaging thing it will result in is a weakening of 
missions and fewer souls being saved and more souls going to hell 
for eternity said tc pinckney a conservative member of 
alexandria good news baptist church 
conservatives believe in the literal truth of the bible 
moderates say the bible is open to individual interpretation 
the conservatives dominate the southern baptists in the past 12 
years they have gained control over many seminaries and national 
boards and forced out leaders who disagree with them 
representatives from churches in 21 states will hold separate 
meetings nov 1214 to approve their spending plans the 
denomination is based in nashville tenn 
the moderates plans would restrict or cut off money for such 
programs as the churchs executive committee the southeastern 
baptist seminary in wake forest nc and the christian life 
commission the commission determines the southern baptists 
position on social and ethical issues 
less money also would be sent to the southern baptist 
conventions cooperative program the denominations major funding 
program 
in virginia where moderates continue to wield influence their 
plan urges more money for the new associated baptist press the 
group was chartered after editors of the baptist press were fired 
by conservatives 
pinckney said the spending dispute while keeping the 
denomination together diverts our attention and resources away 
from winning souls 
if thats the alternative to a split he said then its 
probably better in the long run for everybody on both sides that a 
split occur

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said 
today there is a clear case for immediate worldwide action 
against global warming and said footdragging could spell disaster 
more research is needed on a potential climate upheaval next 
century but that should not be an excuse for delay mrs 
thatcher said in a keynote speech to ministers meeting on the 
issue 
we will not succeed if we are too inflexible mrs thatcher 
said and succeed we must for the sake of this and future 
generations 
french prime minister michel rocard told the officials from 
about 120 countries they face a race against time to save our 
planet 
in an appeal believed aimed largely at the united states and the 
soviet union mrs thatcher demanded all countries begin work on 
binding commitments to limit emissions of socalled greenhouse 
gases 
the commitments would be part of a global treaty on climate 
change to be completed in 1992 
washington and moscow are resisting the setting of targets now 
they argue more study is needed to justify huge expenditures on 
emission controls 
the united states and the soviet union are the biggest sources 
of manmade carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas much of which 
comes from burning fossil fuels 
mrs thatcher and rocard spoke as top officials were wrapping up 
a un conference on climate change the gathering was aimed at 
giving momentum to negotiations on global warming due to start in 
february 
scientists from 100 countries who met last week issued a united 
appeal for immediate steps to counter pollution from gases trapping 
heat in the atmosphere 
officials drafting a political declaration to cap the meeting 
wednesday are facing a clash between european community efforts to 
urge quick action and the less enthusiastic us stand 
mrs thatcher conceded much more research is needed 
but she added there is already a clear case for precautionary 
action 
many steps would be sensible in any event improving energy 
efficiency developing alternative sources of supply 
reforestation rethinking industrial processes and tackling the 
waste problem she said 
less air pollution reduced acid rain and lower energy costs are 
desirable in any case she said 
both mrs thatcher and rocard offered their governments support 
to help developing countries cope with the research and vast 
technical resources required to help in the fight against warming 
the cost of inaction would be much too great to risk said 
rocard 
he said wednesdays ministerial declaration should have real 
content setting objectives and deadlines 
he cited as a model an ec agreement last week to stabilize 
carbon dioxide emissions at current levels by the start of next 
century six other countries grouped in the european free trade 
association joined that effort monday 
however a draft of the concluding ministerial declaration sets 
no targets reflecting the us approach 
the united states which has sent a lowerlevel delegation did 
not immediately take the floor at the unsponsored gathering 
among the feared results of global warming are higher sea levels 
that would displace coastal dwellers a disruption of agriculture 
and vast changes affecting wildlife

saudi arabias foreign minister today warned 
iraq the united nations has not restricted the use of military 
force to liberate kuwait 
prince sauds assertion at a news conference in jiddah saudia 
arabia as he saw secretary of state james a baker iii off to 
egypt marked a hardening of the antiiraq coalition 
we would like a peaceful settlement but that option is in the 
hands of the iraqis the foreign minister said 
he confirmed meanwhile that king fahd and baker had devised a 
joint command in the event of war 
us troops defending saudi arabia would be under the joint 
command but if the americans go into combat elsewhere in the 
persian gulf they would take orders only from us commanders 
saud said baker had not discussed military options with the 
saudis during his talks monday in jiddah 
however saud said the un resolutions demanding that iraq give 
up kuwait do not foreclose force 
the united nations has not put any restrictions on what 
actions the united nations would take to implement this saud 
said 
in cairo baker was seeking reaffirmation of egypts role in the 
usled coalition against iraq 
he met with president hosni mubarak who has sent about 14000 
troops to defend saudi arabia and may double that number 
there was no immediate appraisal of the meeting with mubarak 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
mubarak canceled his appearance at a planned joint news conference 
saying he had another appointment baker decided not to appear 
without the president tutwiler said 
baker later met at cairo international airport with chinas 
foreign minister qian qichen as they posed for pictures the 
chinese official dodged a question about whether his government 
would support military action against iraq 
all the armed forces have two roles to play he said one 
is to fight a war and the other is to seek peace 
asked if by authorizing the use of force the united nations 
would increase pressure on iraq to release its hold on kuwait the 
foreign minister again avoided a direct reply 
well still have to wait and see he said the 10 
resolutions approved by the un security council qian said are 
intended to increase the pressure on iraq to reach a peaceful 
settlement 
the bush administration needs the support of china a permanent 
member of the un security council for further economic and 
political moves against iraq or military action if that is taken 
to reverse the ocupation of kuwait 
baker reached agreement monday with king fahd that us troops 
will be under american command if they are sent into combat 
the decision on command and control was announced after baker 
held a twohour meeting with the king 
a us official who insisted on anonymity said the saudis 
would play a decisive role in two ways they would share command 
of american troops used to defend saudi arabia and would have to 
give a green light before the 100000plus us troops in the 
oilrich kingdom were sent into action 
once the americans go into battle outside saudi arabia american 
commanders will direct them the official said 
baker and the king resolved the issue as tensions appeared to 
heighten over iraqs annexation of kuwait three months ago 
a senior saudi official said we are satisfied and from the 
kingdoms standpoint there had never been a problem 
the saudi official who talked to reporters under condition of 
anonymity said we are still genuinely hoping to see a peaceful 
outcome 
baker leaving the saudi mountain resort of taif earlier monday 
after talks with the exiled emir of kuwait said the situation was 
changing 
this crisis is entering a new phase he said and while we 
are still seeking a peaceful political and diplomatic solution we 
have to put ourselves in a position where we would be able to 
exercise any options that might be available 
baker did not elaborate but the us official said he meant the 
united states and its allies were bringing increasing pressure 
to bear on iraqi president saddam hussein 
the secretary implied a heightening of tensions in the region 
and a redoubled us resolve to evict iraq from kuwait i dont 
think that we can or should we rule out resort to force if that 
should be necessary he said 
baker is on a sevencountry trip designed to test support among 
arabs europeans and the soviets for military action against 
saddam 
of critical importance are the opinions baker hears from leaders 
of saudi arabia the linchpin in the arab alliance and from soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev on thursday

jurors who convicted four men of crimes in 
the death of us drug agent enrique camarena said they discussed 
media coverage of the trial and facts not admitted as evidence 
during their deliberations 
the jury convicted juan ramon matta ballesteros ruben zuno arce 
and juan jose bernabe ramirez of conspiracy kidnapping and violent 
crime in aid of racketeering in camarenas slaying 
javier vasquez velasco was convicted of violent crimes in aid of 
racketeering for the deaths of two americans mistaken for us drug 
agents in guadalajara mexico 
eight jurors testified in a hearing monday before us district 
judge edward rafeedie on defense claims that the jurors were 
unfairly influenced by media reports about the case and their 
clients should get a new trial 
the 12member jury discussed press accounts of the trial on july 
28 the day after they convicted defendant juan ramon matta 
ballesteros the jurors said 
we went back over the verdict juror linda overholt said 
we reconsidered everything because of what we heard we wanted to 
make sure of our feelings 
other jurors testified that they reviewed their verdict only 
briefly before moving on to the other defendants 
juror william r parris said the panel talked about a previous 
drug conviction of matta that was not introduced as evidence at the 
camarena trial 
but other jurors said they didnt remember discussing the prior 
conviction 
rafeedie gave defense lawyers 10 days to submit written 
arguments supporting their claims 
camarena a us drug enforcement administration agent was 
abducted tortured and killed in guadalajara in 1985 prosecutors 
said members of a cocaine cartel ordered the killing because 
camarenas work had led to seizures of cocaine and marijuana

the productivity of american workers rose at 
the fastest rate in two years in the julyseptember quarter 
climbing at an annual rate of 16 percent the government said 
today 
however the rebound is still well below the level needed to 
significantly boost americans living standard according to most 
economists 
increased productivity or getting each worker to produce more 
during each hour of work is vital to increasing the nations 
standard of living without inflation 
the 16 percent third quarter gain in nonfarm productivity 
reported by the labor department was a marked improvement over the 
03 percent advance in the second quarter revised from an earlier 
estimate which showed a 15 percent gain 
it was also the biggest advance since productivity shot up at a 
28 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 1988 
however because productivity plunged at a 13 percent rate in 
the first quarter it is averaging only a scant 02 percent advance 
for the first nine months of 1990 
still that is better than the 07 percent decline for all of 
1989 since 1982 productivity growth has averaged around 14 
percent a year better than the 12 percent average in the 1970s 
but far worse than the 33 percent annual gain posted in the two 
decades following world war ii 
during the julyseptember period the number of hours worked 
edged down 01 percent the first decline in more than four years 
economists say this is a sign that employers are preparing for a 
recession by not hiring new workers or allowing existing employees 
to work more hours 
hourly labor costs a major indication of inflation for 
businesses shot up 45 percent in the third quarter compared with 
a 5 percent rise in the second quarter hourly labor costs advanced 
at a 45 percent average for the year so far compared with 32 
percent for all of 1989 
meanwhile unit labor costs a key gauge of future price 
inflation rose 28 percent in the third quarter compared with 47 
percent in the second quarter for the year so far unit labor 
costs averaged a 43 percent gain compared with 39 percent in the 
1989 
total business productivity including farming rose 19 percent 
in the third quarter bringing the average for the year so far to 
up 05 percent compared with a decline of 05 percent in all of 
1989 
manufacturing productivity climbed at a 56 percent annual rate 
in the third quarter bringing the average for the year so far to 
45 percent compared with 26 percent last year

president bush cast his vote in his home state 
today after signing a tax hike as part of a 492 billion deficit 
reduction plan that was a campaign albatross for many fellow 
republicans 
bush and his wife barbara waited in line behind other voters 
for about 10 minutes this morning at a polling place in a nursing 
home near the hotel they use as a legal residence 
he waved aside reporters questions saying only good to be 
home as he left the polling place to return to washington where 
he will spend the evening in the white house 
the president signed the budget package monday night at his 
houston home the late hour guaranteed that the news would not make 
primetime news broadcasts and also would miss the deadlines for 
many newspapers that voters would be reading on election day today 
in a statement bush called the hardfought budget compromise 
the centerpiece of the largest deficit reduction package in 
history and an important measure for ensuring americas longterm 
economic growth 
he said that in the agreement no one got everything he or she 
wanted but the end product is a compromise that merits 
enactment 
the bill bush signed was a 245 billion 5year 
deficitreduction package it was the major component of a 
fiveyear plan reducing the budget gap by 492 billion the 
remaining savings came from defense cuts in other legislation and 
lower than planned interest payments on the national debt 
bush spent the home stretch of the campaign trekking to eight 
states and urging voters to go to the polls and prove wrong the 
pundits who say the electorate is depressed and disgusted 
on monday bush made a daylong swing around texas with gop 
gubernatorial candidate clayton williams 
the deficitreduction plan approved by congress last week 
includes 140 billion in new taxes that bush agreed to but that 
electionconscious republicans found hard to swallow the plan also 
included a number of government spending cuts 
the president continued on monday to emphasize upbeat themes at 
the urging of some advisers that he try to look more 
presidential 
but his electioneve speech to a ballroom full of republican 
loyalists was interrupted by about four antiwar protesters who 
chanted no war for oil the audience shouted them down and 
they were quickly ushered from the room 
the outburst gave bush an opportunity to repeat his rationale 
for sending more than 200000 us troops to the persian gulf 
region 
they got it wrong he said referring to the protesters 
what were doing is not anything about war for oil what were 
doing is standing up against naked aggression 
bushs appearances have increasingly attracted antiwar 
protesters around the country 
in the closing days of the campaign the presidents senior 
advisers have been divided on how bush should conduct himself with 
some recommending that he take off the gloves and bash 
congressional democrats as he did in oklahoma city 10 days ago 
but sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
approach favored by white house chief of staff john sununu and 
some high republican party officials appeared to backfire they 
concluded that democratbashing was not helping bushs popularity 
which has foundered with his wavering positions on tax and budget 
issues coupled with the slumping economy 
the sources said bushs former pollster robert teeter and his 
1988 media consultant roger ailes persuaded the president to be 
more positive 
that approach was evident monday when bush traveled with 
williams to tyler and waco 
while still accusing democrats of wanting to raise taxes on 
every working man and woman bush said he was tired of the 
cynics these washington pundits telling us everything thats 
wrong with the united states 
he said people should vote and show us whats right about 
it 
bush tried to shore up williams support which has flagged with 
recent gaffes williams admitted knowing nothing about the one 
proposed constitutional amendment on the texas statewide ballot a 
measure dealing with gubernatorial appointment powers 
williams also has had to fend off criticism that he paid no 
taxes in 1986 a year when he said business was bad and he had no 
income 
but bush said of williams i know of his sincerity i know of 
his integrity and he will be a great governor of the state of 
texas and im going to vote for him early tomorrow morning

43 years 
president ghulam ishaq khan administered the oath of office to 
the 41yearold sharif in a 10minute ceremony attended by 600 
guests including politicians military leaders and bureaucrats 
earlier today the national assembly elected sharif prime 
minister after a brief walkout by supporters of ousted prime 
minister bhutto who demanded a secret ballot 
sharif whose islamic democratic alliance soundly defeated ms 
bhutto in the oct 24 election sounded a conciliatory note today 
the government and opposition should join hands to help the 
countrys poor he said for the prosperity of the country we 
have to join hands 
he referred to the majority of pakistans 110 million people 
most of whom are illiterate and landless laborers earning less than 
400 a year 
earlier in an address to the assembly ms bhutto sharply 
criticized the armyback caretaker government that succeeded her 
after she was dismissed from office aug 6 
i hope the new administration will depart from the policy of 
repression persecution and discrimination launched by the 
caretaker government she said democracy to us is not just a 
way to govern but a value 
ms bhuttos candidate for prime minister mohammad afzal khan 
was a political unknown who was seen as her pakistan peoples 
partys sacrificial candidate sharifs election was virtually 
assured when his alliance of 18 parties named him their candidate 
for prime minister 
he controls 105 seats in the 217seat national assembly but 
claims to have the support of several smaller parties and 
independents he was elected prime minister with 159 votes 
ms bhuttos party was routed in the national elections leaving 
her with 45 seats her candidate received 39 votes today 
in provincial elections oct 27 ms bhuttos party was 
decimated in punjab province and weakened in her home province of 
sindh she has repeatedly charged she was cheated out of victory 
sharif began his political career in the 1980s during military 
rule in pakistan his mentor president gen mohammad ziaul haq 
died in a plane crash in 1988 paving the way for the first free 
elections after more than a decade of military rule 
shortly before those elections sharif formed his democratic 
alliance of parties espousing a wide range of political ideologies 
but united in their contempt for ms bhutto her party won the 
largest bloc of votes in 1988 but required the support of smaller 
parties and independents to stay in power 
after 20 months and little legislation president ghulam ishaq 
khan dismissed ms bhuttos government charging her with 
corruption and ineptitude she discounted the charges 
ms bhutto faces seven charges of misconduct a guilty verdict 
on any one charge could disqualify her from politics for up to 
seven years

iraqi president saddam hussein on tuesday ordered the release of 
106 foreigners including some who were held as human shields 
at key installations iraqs official news agency said 
the report said those to be freed are 77 japanese 20 italians 
five swedes two portuguese news of the planned 
releases came one day after european countries denounced individual 
attempts to gain the freedom of hostages 
 
secretary of stwo germans and tate james a baker iii traveled to egypt 
for the 
next leg of his weeklong trip to test the idea of military action 
against iraq on monday baker and saudi king fahd agreed that the 
united states will not attack iraq without saudi approval but that 
american troops would be under us command once they go to battle 
 
baker also met in cairo with chinas foreign minister qian 
qichen china is a permanent member of the un security council 
and its support would be needed for a unsanctioned military 
strike against saddam 
qian was asked whether his government would support such 
military action 
all the armed forces have two roles to play the chinese 
official said one is to fight a warver the rebound is still well below 
the level needed to 
significantly boost americans living standard according to most 
economists 
increased productivity or getting each worker to produce more 
during each hour of work is vital to increasing the nations 
standard of living without inflation 
the 16 percent third quarter gain in nonfarm productivity 
reported by the labor department was a marked improvement over the 
03 percent advance in the second quarter revised from an earlier 
estimate which showed a 15 percent gain 
it was also the biggest advance since productivity shot up at a 
28 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 1988 
however because productivity plunged at a 13 percent rate in 
the first quarter it is averaging only a scant 02 percent advance 
for the first nine months of 1990 
still that is better than the 07 percent decline for all of 
1989 since 1982 productivity growth has averaged around 14 
percent a year better than the 12 percent average in the 1970s 
but far worse than the 33 percent annual gain posted in the two 
decades following world war ii 
during the julyseptember period the number of hours worked 
edged down 01 percent the first decline in more than four years 
economists say this is a sign that employers are preparing for a 
recession by not hiring new workers or allowing existing employees 
to work more hours 
hourly labor costs a major indication of inflation for 
businesses shot up 45 percent in the third quarter compared with 
a 5 percent rise in the second quarter hourly labor costs advanced 
at a 45 percent average for the year so far compared with 32 
percent for all of 1989 
meanwhile unit labor costs a key gauge of future price 
inflation rose 28 percent in the third quarter compared with 47 
percent in the second quarter for the year so far unit labor 
costs averaged a 43 percent gain compared with 39 percent in the 
1989 
total business productivity including farming rose 19 percent 
in the third quarter bringing the average for the year so far to 
up 05 percent compared with a decline of 05 percent in all of 
1989 
manufacturing productivity climbed at a 56 percent annual rate 
in the third quarter bringing the average for the year so far to 
45 percent compared with 26 percent last year

a gay former soldier celebrated a us supreme 
court decision to let stand a ruling that will allow him to 
reenlist but said it was not a significant victory because it 
leaves intact the militarys ban on homosexuals 
the high court without comment on monday let stand an appeals 
court ruling last year in the case of former staff sgt perry 
watkins 42 of tacoma 
that ruling did not address the validity of the ban but instead 
noted the army repeatedly had reenlisted watkins while knowing he 
is homosexual 
there was no immediate reaction from the pentagon 
the bush administration had sought to overturn the appeals court 
ruling 
watkins celebrated with sparkling apple juice a 16year veteran 
with an excellent service record he said he wants to serve five 
more years so he could retire with an army pension 
the courts action requires no change in military regulations 
its not a significant victory watkins said however 
because i am an admitted homosexual it is a good ruling and could 
certainly have an effect on other cases 
gay rights advocates agreed athough the appeals court ruling 
implied the army could try to discharge watkins for any future 
homosexual acts 
these days well take a victory any way we can get one 
said paul didonato of the national gay rights advocates in san 
francisco 
the courts decision to let the earlier ruling stand sends a 
broader signal out to the military and the country at large that 
gays and lesbians cannot be treated unfairly forever by the 
military or any other employer didonato said 
watkins was inducted in 1968 even though he marked yes on a 
questionnaire that asked whether he had homosexual tendencies 
he was allowed to reenlist three times after army investigators 
looked into his homosexuality but was forced to accept an honorable 
discharge in 1984 he sued for reinstatement 
asked if he anticipated problems after his reinstatement 
watkins said that goes without saying the problems that are 
going to be there are the problems the system itself will create

iraq said today that it would release 77 
japanese nationals in response to the intervention of former 
japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
japan welcomed the move and said it had made no changes in its 
gulf policy in order to win its citizens freedom 
the official iraqi news agency also said 20 italians five 
swedes two germans and two portuguese would be allowed to leave 
japanese diplomats in baghdad said at least 20 of the japanese 
nationals to be released were among those who were held at 
strategic installations to serve as human shields against a 
possible attack the others are businessmen who were in iraq during 
the invasion according to japans kyodo news service 
in tokyo the foreign ministry said iraq was freeing 69 japanese 
hostages japanese diplomats in baghdad said later that was the 
number nakasone was originally promised would be freed but they 
said nakasone held a second meeting today with saddam and won the 
release of additional japanese nationals 
japan which has contributed 4 billion to the antiiraq effort 
has said in the past it would not make a separate deal for its 
hostages 
nakasones mission was technically private but had the support 
of the japanese government and the 72yearold former leader 
retains considerable influence in japanese political affairs 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe welcomed todays iraqi 
move but said other foreigners should be freed too 
we are delighted to see the release of some japanese people in 
baghdad but we cannot permit the iraqi government to force other 
foreign visitors to remain there and we have continued our demands 
that iraq release these hostages as soon as possible watanabe 
said 
he said the japanese hostages freedom had been achieved without 
compromising the governments stand against iraq 
nakasones visit comes as japanese lawmakers are considering a 
measure to deploy japanese troops to the persian gulf in a 
noncombat role the official iraqi news agency had reported over 
the weekend that nakasone had assured saddam the measure was 
unlikely to pass 
the troopdeployment plan has prompted strong protests in japan 
and by today officials of the governing liberal democratic party 
had all but given up hopes for its passage critics contend the 
proposal violates japans constitutional ban on sending troops 
overseas 
the iraqi news agency said nakasone met with saddam today to 
thank him for iraqs decision to allow a large number of japanese 
nationals elderly sick and students to travel out 
nakasone had carried a list of 90 elderly or ailing japanese 
which he presented to saddam during their first meeting on sunday 
japanese diplomats in baghdad said the iraqi government did not say 
why it refused to free all 90 
they said by late this morning 40 of those japanese cleared to 
travel had arrived at the mansourmelia hotel in preparation for 
departure 
the japanese like most foreigners had been banned from leaving 
as iraq responded to buildup of the multinational force in saudi 
arabia that followed saddams aug 2 takeover of kuwait 
after his weekend meeting with saddam nakasone said he had 
urged an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and the freeing of all 
hostages 
the iraqi leader demonstrated serious encouragement to end the 
crisis peacefully nakasone told reporters afterward

a jury has ordered toyota motor corp to pay 75 
million for an allegedly faulty seat belt that allowed a man to go 
through the windshield of a light truck that hit a tree 
toyota spokeswoman mindy geller said the company was shocked and 
planned to appeal 
the jury awarded 6 million to cliff sadlier who was partially 
crippled and 15 million to his wife joanne

toyota 4runner struck a tree on feb 9 1988 sadlier who was 
alone in the vehicle said he was going 25 mph a toyota expert 
testified he was going 40 mph 
sadlier of suburban bloomfield hills said his head went 
through the windshield and his body hit the dashboard he said he 
now must rely on a wheelchair although he can walk short distances 
with crutches and braces 
sadliers attorneys charged the toyota seat belt lacked a device 
to take up slack toyotas lawyers said the seat belt met federal 
specifications 
we felt the seat belt was defective by design said jury 
foreman robert gura it doesnt provide the protection the 
federal law says it should

the immigration and naturalization service 
isnt cracking down on california employers who hire illegal aliens 
because of political pressure and weak laws a study concludes 
still the immigration reform and control act of 1986 has 
compelled the ins to develop a framework to implement stricter laws 
if congress passes them concludes the study by the rand corp and 
the urban institute 
in los angeles the law is being implemented appropriately 
its not being implemented in a very strong draconian fashion but 
congress probably didnt intend it to be said rand corp 
researcher elizabeth rolph coauthor of the study with abby robyn 
employers are required to make sure job applicants have legal 
documents such as a valid drivers license or social security card 
but an ins official in washington said that is circumvented by 
the widespread availability of counterfeit documents such as 
drivers licenses and social security cards 
fraudulent social security cards can be purchased on either side 
of the border for about 25 said ins spokesman duke austin 
the study said the ins has moved slowly to enforce laws against 
hiring of illegal immigrants because many communities depend 
heavily on cheap immigrant labor 
ins officials do not want their enforcement posture to alarm 
employers generating a political backlash that might cause 
congress to amend their new authority 
nor does the ins want strict enforcement to trigger employer 
discrimination against hispanics and other immigrant groups a 
trend that could spur congress to invoke provisions that would 
repeal the act the report says 
as a result the 1986 act has done little to reduce the flow of 
illegal immigrants into the country the authors said the ins 
reports that more than one million illegals were caught nationwide 
during the fiscal year that ended sept 30 compared to 850000 in 
fiscal 1989 
the study which focused on implementation of the act in the los 
angeles area was based on interviews with ins officials 
employers illegal aliens and advocacy groups in the seven southern 
california counties that make up the ins los angeles district 
between november 1986 and december 1989

two elderly palestinians were shot and killed 
in the occupied west bank today hours after a gunman believed to 
be of arab descent assassinated militant rabbi meir kahane in new 
york 
israeli news reports suggested the killings were linked 
an israel radio police reporter said that before news of the 
west bank slayings was aired an anonymous caller speaking hebrew 
told him to check in one of the villages near nablus two arabs 
were killed there 
the reporter moshe nussbaum quoted kahane supporters in 
jerusalem as saying they believed the killings were carried out to 
avenge the assassination and that more attacks could take place 
arab reports said the killings in the west bank village of 
lubban sharqiya near nablus were carried out by a man in civilian 
clothing who fired an uzi submachine gun and drove a car with 
israeli license plates 
the army said the deaths were under investigation 
several israeli political leaders tied kahanes assassination to 
his call for expelling palestinians from the west bank and occupied 
gaza strip and throwing israeli arab citizens out of the jewish 
state 
kahane was slain in a hotel monday night after addressing a 
zionist group the gunman identified by police as el sayed a 
noseir 37 was shot in the chin by a police officer and 
hospitalized 
israel army radio said today the assailant once lived in the 
occupied territories but the report could not be confirmed 
palestinians said the name as given by police was not typical and 
might be said nasser or nasser elsaid 
kahane a 58yearold former legislator was widely hated by 
mainstream israelis but he and his antiarab party kach had a 
small core of fervent and vocal supporters 
the israeli government appealed for calm as police and army 
reinforcements spread out in israel and the occupied territories to 
head off revenge attcks 
we are deeply shocked by this murder said avi pazner an 
aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir even those and they are a 
great majority in israel who do not agree with the political views 
of the late rabbi kahane deplore and condemn this further act of 
arab terrorism 
israel has been torn by arab attacks on jews and revenge 
assaults by israelis since the oct 8 riot on the temple mount in 
jerusalem when 20 palestinians were killed by police at least 
five people have been killed and a dozen wounded in the series of 
attacks 
faisal hussein a palestine liberation organization supporter in 
jerusalem said todays killings raised concerns about the 
security of our people 
kahane supporters warned of violence to avenge the 
assassination officials of his kach faction dictated a statement 
to journalists saying the lord will avenge his blood 
kach leader david ben dor said kahanes ideas will live on 
whoever thinks that today rabbi kahane and the kach movement have 
been destroyed has made a great mistake he said 
ben dor spoke beside kach flags their yellow fields centered by 
a black jewish star and a clenched fist about 50 supporters milled 
about some shouting death to the arabs 
earlier several kach supporters threw chairs at reporters to 
keep them away from their jerusalem headquarters an israeli 
television crewman was beaten by kach supporters and one sprayed 
tear gas in his face he was hospitalized the radio said 
one woman who refused to give her name told reporters you 
havent seen anything yet one jew is worth millions of arabs 
especially when we are talking about rabbi kahane 
some israeli and arab leaders linked kahanes killing to his 
beliefs 
labor party lawmaker avraham burg condemned the assassination 
but said we must not forget that kahane is the victim of his own 
ideology he sowed hatred and destruction and in the end reaped 
death 
saeed kanan a palestinian from the west bank town of nablus 
quoted the biblical phrase he who lives by the sword dies by the 
sword adding kahane was an advocate of racial discrimination 
and apartheid he became a victim of his own slogans and 
mottos 
residents of the palestinian village where todays killings 
occurred said a man believed to be from a nearby jewish 
settlement approached at about 545 am in a white car 
they said he opened fire with his uzi on mohammed alkhatib 65 
who was riding his donkey to harvest olives in his grove the 
attacker continued down the road and fired again this time killing 
miriam khassan 60 villagers said 
the deaths raised to 773 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians in the nearly 35month palestinian 
uprising 
an additional 294 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
fiftyone israelis have died in the violence

police running an undercover sting fed 
radio stations and a newspaper a false story saying a lawyer had 
been castrated on halloween during an attack at his home 
after the story made the front page of the daily american 
republic and was broadcast across southeast missouri and northeast 
arkansas police revealed the assault was a hoax 
the sting was intended to convince a man who allegedly paid a 
police informant 4000 for the job that the arkansas lawyer really 
had been castrated and his arms and legs broken police said 
on halloween night officers acted out the assault at the 
lawyers home and rushed a phony injured man to the hospital when 
reporters heard on police scanners what they thought was a story 
they contacted the sheriffs office in clay county ark 
sheriff darvin stow then told reporters that city attorney cw 
knauts of piggott ark was stabbed and rushed to a hospital 
stow said the attorney had two broken arms and was bleeding from 
the groin 
the target of the sting harold speer of greenway ark was 
charged thursday in stoddard county mo with conspiracy burglary 
and assault he was arrested in arkansas knauts represented 
speers former wife in a 1985 divorce 
investigators said they wanted to keep the plan a secret for a 
few days rather than arresting speer on the spot when he hired the 
informant because speer allegedly told the bogus hit man of other 
jobs he wanted done 
authorities also said they hoped speer might provide information 
on the slaying of his exwife in phoenix a month after their 
divorce 
stow said he was sorry if anyone was offended but it was 
necessary 
its pretty disturbing to me stan berry news editor of the 
daily american republic said monday were not in the business 
of printing fake stories for anybody 
the false information was given only by the clay county arkansas 
sheriffs department no news conference was held and no press 
releases were issued by either the missouri highway patrol or 
arkansas state police although both were involved in the staged 
assault

portauprince haiti ap the independent electoral council 
has barred 10 of the 26 declared candidates from running for 
president including two men who were key members of the duvalier 
regime 
the council released a statement late monday saying the 10 
failed to comply with filing procedures 
in anticipation of the council action and possible retaliation 
by duvalier supporters haitians jammed stores monday night to 
stock up on supplies no incidents were reported immediately 
the 29year duvalier dictatorship ended in 1986 when jeanclaude 
duvalier went into exile but haiti has been wracked by turmoil 
since then the current provisional government of ertha 
pascaltrouillot appointed in march is the fifth since 1986 
the electoral council based its decision on technicalities not 
on article 291 of the 1987 constitution which bars criminal 
supporters of past dictators from running for office until 1997 
the candidates including duvalierists claude raymond and dr 
roger lafontant were disqualified for failing to conform to 
electoral laws the council said 
raymond former army chief of staff was removed from the list 
because his political party had not been legally registered until 
after the oct 21 deadline for filing his candidacy the council 
said 
lafontant failed to obtain clearance from the government 
auditing office on his handling of public funds while serving as 
minister of the interior and defense he also failed to provide a 
birth certificate the council said 
council member jeanfrancis merisier said the decision was based 
on election rules he said application of article 291 would have 
been ambiguous because no candidate has been tried in a court of 
law for murder torture or misappropriation of public funds 
raymond has been accused publicly of having participated in the 
massacre that aborted the 1987 presidential elections he has never 
been charged 
human rights organizations have accused lafontant of multiple 
human rights violations an arrest warrant charging him with 
conspiring against national security was never served 
when 12 duvalierists were barred from running for president in 
1987 dozens of people were killed on election day armed men in 
collusion with the army killed at least 34 voters 
also disqualified monday was conservative candidate gregoire 
eugene who as a dissident was exiled by duvalier the council said

iraqi officials have agreed to allow americans 
held as human shields at strategic sites to send messages home to 
their families the red cross announced today 
the agreement between the red cross and its sister organization 
the iraqi red crescent eventually will permit family members to 
send parcels containing medicine food clothing and paperback 
books to their loved ones in iraq 
the agreement extends humanitarian assistance to americans in 
iraq said stephen richards executive vice president of the 
american red cross 
richards recently returned from bagdhad where he helped complete 
the agreement he did not see any of the american hostages held at 
the sites outside baghdad 
the messsage exchange program is expected to get under way in 
about 10 days 
about 106 americans at the strategic sites will be handed short 
forms to write messages those will be shipped to the united states 
by the red cross 
the family members will be given the messages and allowed to 
write responses which in turn will be delivered to the hostages 
the iraqi red crescent officials will serve as the couriers inside 
iraq 
richards said the red cross eventually hopes officials will be 
allowed to examine the hostages to make sure they are in good 
health iraqis have told the americans the hostages are physically 
all right but they miss their families and their psychological 
state could be better

tonights primetime election specials on cbs 
and nbc wont be sponsored although abcs coverage will have 
commercials 
the onehour nbc special and cbs two hours of election night 
coverage in prime time will be carried as sustaining or 
unsponsored representatives of both networks said 
this means the cbs and nbc broadcasts wont be counted in the 
current november ratings sweeps one of four key ratings 
periods each year that help network affilliates set their local 
advertising rates 
both nbc and cbs will use the time to promote shows theyre 
broadcasting as the sweeps period continues this month 
nbc acted after cbs decided against seeking sponsorship for its 
election night program said an nbc executive who asked not to be 
identified it took that step because of the tight primetime 
ratings race of all three networks this season the executive said 
if nbcs coverage was sponsored and included in nielsen ratings 
low viewing levels the networks expect on election night might pull 
down nbcs overall ratings average for this week 
nbc again is first in prime time ratings this season but its 
margin over secondplace cbs is small 
according to ratings averages for the season through last 
sunday nbc has a 133 ratings average cbs a 130 and abc a 125 
each ratings point represents 931000 homes

shortly after 930 am when a driver heading south on collided with 
two motorcyclists holvast said

nervous politicians put aside opinion polls and campaign 
strategies and watched voter turnout across the nation today for 
signs of winners and losers in the first midterm election of the 
1990s in north carolina where voters were deciding a bitterly 
contested senate contest officials reported long lines at polling 
places 
president bush and his wife barbara stood in line for 10 
minutes at a polling place at a houston nursing home they waved 
off reporters questions and after voting went to the airport for 
a flight back to washington 
republicans admitting a low turnout would be bad news for their 
candidates in most states had spent the closing days of the 
campaign exhorting their partisans to go to the polls 
democrats counted on uneasiness over the economy to induce their 
followers to vote 
the senate contest between conservative republican sen jesse 
helms and his black challenger harvey gantt appeared to generate 
a heavy turnout in north carolina 
most precincts say they have more people voting than they do 
in presidential elections said mecklenburg county election 
supervisor bill culp 
when you see long lines like this more than 300 voters were 
here before 830 you know youre going to have a nice day 
gantt said its a good sign for us 
helms voted in raleigh and described himself as always a 
little bit anxious about the outcome of a campaign 
ive done the best i can and if its not the best for the 
people of north carolina then well see but i think it is 
helms said 
in northern michigan highway crews had to dig out the snowedin 
clerk of wellington township so he could open the polls 
snow also was reported in iowa but election officials said 
early turnout was heavier than a normal offyear election in 
parts of nebraska officials said snow and ice was keeping turnout 
down 
weve had trouble even getting poll workers to the polls to 
open them up said nebraska secretary of state allen beerman 
embattled rep jolene unsoeld dwash said the white house was 
discriminating against her by withholding word on whether the 
president would sign or veto legislation for a study of a proposed 
historic reserve in her district 
aides to unsoeld alleged the white house didnt want to allow 
her to take credit for enactment of the bill 
voters were choosing 36 governors 34 senators and the entire 
435member us house as well as more than 6000 state 
legislators 
normally obscure legislative races have gotten national 
attention from party officials battling for control of the 
onceinadecade redrawing of political boundary lines to conform 
to new census figures 
the stakes are highest in races for governor in the nations 
fastestgrowing states california florida and texas when house 
seats are redistributed to follow population shifts to the sun 
belt those three states will pick up a total of 14 
in florida where democrats were hopeful that former sen lawton 
chiles would unseat republican gov bob martinez election 
officials forecast a high turnout 
chiles and martinez were among the early florida voters 
you can see the shifting said the underdog republican 
governor you can hear the sound of victory 
in california republicans were confident sen pete wilson would 
outpoll democrat dianne feinstein in the race to succeed republican 
gov george deukmejian 
after weeks of barnstorming for gop candidates from maine to 
hawaii bush concentrated on helping the faltering campaign of 
clayton williams for governor of texas once far ahead in the 
polls oilman williams was struggling to outlast democratic state 
treasurer ann richards 
i urge all texans to get out there and vote and do not 
take democracy for granted bush said monday campaigning with 
williams at his side 
but one preelection poll found 80 percent of texans thought the 
governors race was too negative 
my biggest complaint was we had no good choice in the 
governors race said louis lauritzen one of about 50 people 
waiting to vote at a grand prairie texas precinct it was more 
a case of voting against someone 
a republican ballot security program in north carolina 
prompted democrats to go to a federal judge in new jersey who had 
ruled against such activities in prior elections 
us district judge dickinson debevoise held monday that the 
republican national committee was not involved in the north 
carolina mailings 
but later in the day the justice department sent lawyers to 
north carolina to try to ensure that black voters arent 
disqualified at the polls based on information gathered by the 
state republican party 
senior republican sens mark hatfield of oregon and rudy 
boschwitz of minnesota had reason for uneasiness entering election 
day even though closing polls indicated a trend in their 
direction 
hatfield was challenged by businessman harry lonsdale and 
boschwitz was under siege from college professor paul wellstone 
rep pat saiki was the best gop hope for ousting a democratic 
senator she was challenging appointed sen daniel akaka of hawaii 
pollsters agreed that voters were in a sour mood unhappy with 
the president and congress alike on their handling of the economy 
an abc news poll said 61 percent of the people disapprove of how 
bush is handling the economy and the same percentage also is 
unhappy with how congress has handled the same issue 
the biggest turnover was expected to come in governors offices 
no one was predicting much change in the 5545 democratic majority 
in the senate or that partys 258175 margin of control in the 
house which has two vacancies 
among the nations governors 29 are democrats and 21 
republicans all indications were that the democrats would add one 
or two to their total 
but there also was a strong chance that two independents 
former republicans would join the ranks of the governors in 
alaska former gov wally hickel was leading the major party 
candidates in the polls and former sen lowell weicker was doing 
the same in connecticut 
democrats felt good about their chances in maine where former 
gov joseph brennan was challenging his republican successor john 
mckernan democrats also were optimistic about nebraska where 
businessman ben nelson was running against republican gov kay orr 
the hottest prospect for a republican pickup was in ohio where 
republican george voinovich was leading democrat anthony celebrezze 
in independent polls

a former state savings and loan 
commissioner received a 50000 consulting fee from the nowdefunct 
lincoln savings and loan within a week after he left office a 
newspaper reported today 
there are indications the lucrative deal was being arranged 
while he was with the state the san francisco chronicle said of 
former commissioner larry taggart 
the check was accompanied by a proposed contract that set up 
three more quarterly 50000 payments ending oct 1 1985 the 
contract was typed with the year 1984 above the signature blanks 
although taggart did not leave his state job until 1985 
taggart told the chronicle that two lincoln representatives 
asked if i could be of any service to them in consulting with 
them after he left state office 
i told them i really didnt want to discuss anything until i 
was out of office he said 
of the agreement with the year 1984 on it taggart said 
people type stuff up im not sure what it is 
the check was written 27 days after taggart approved a request 
by the now defunct savings and loan involving 900 million in 
taxpayerinsured deposits 
in one of his last major acts as sampl commissioner taggart 
approved a 900 million transfer to a lincoln subsidiary where 
lincoln hoped they would be grandfathered against a forthcoming 
rule prohibiting sampls from making risky direct investments 
taggart gave his approval three days before the deadline for 
meeting the grandfathering provision 
taggart joined the consulting company tcs enterprises after he 
left office on jan 1 1985 tcs consulting a subsidiary was set 
up specifically for taggart to head 
on jan 18 1985 lincoln invested 289 million in tcs 
enterprises the investment bought lincoln 249 percent of tcs 
which taggart has testified had a net worth of between 200000 and 
300000 at the time 
thomas stickel the founder of the tcs parent company 
speculated that the 1984 date on the contract may have been a 
typographical error 
the agreement was enclosed in a jan 4 1985 letter to taggart 
written by lincoln corporate counsel mark sauter who wrote that a 
50000 check was also enclosed representing lincolns first 
quarter payment 
lincoln was taken over by federal regulators a day after its 
parent company american continental corp sought bankruptcy court 
protection from its creditors it will cost taxpayers an estimated 
2 billion to bail out the thrift 
charles keating jr head of american continental is accused in 
civil suits of looting lincoln keating also faces criminal charges 
in the case

democrats bid tuesday to fortify their majorities in congress 
and challenged republican control of four key governorships 
highlights of a midterm election punctuated by the autumn stirrings 
of voter discontent 
with 34 senate races on the ballot democrats took aim at 
republican incumbents jesse helms in north carolina mark hatfield 
in oregon and rudy boschwitz in minnesota in hopes of padding their 
current 5545 majority 
the house of representatives was securely in democratic control 
as it has been since the eisenhower era all 435 seats were on the 
ballot although most attention clustered around 29 races without 
an incumbent 18 of them currently in republican hands 
among 36 statehouse races republican governorships in 
california texas florida and illinois were at risk probably the 
biggest prizes of the year the gop hoped for victories that would 
protect their influence in drawing boundaries for house seats that 
will shift to the sun belt in 1992 
democratic gov mario cuomo sought a third term in new york in a 
possible prelude to a 1992 presidential campaign three other 
potential challengers to president bush also seemed headed for 
landslide reelection democratic sens bill bradley of new jersey 
al gore of tennessee and sam nunn of georgia 
more than 6100 legislative races crowded the ballots and 
voters in 43 states and the district of columbia decided issues 
ranging from a proposed tax rollback in massachusetts to an 
environmentalistsponsored measure known as big green in 
california 
jesse jackson was on the ballot for the first time as a 
nonpresidential candidate seeking to become an unpaid nonvoting 
shadow senator to lobby congress for statehood for the district 
of columbia the city also chose a new mayor to replace marion 
barry who bid for a city council seat in the face of a sixmonth 
jail sentence for a drug offense 
all in all the first election of the 1990s came at a time of 
extraordinary volatility with the nation on the verge of 
recession and on the edge of war in the persian gulf other issues 
emerged in scattered races abortion crime the savings and loan 
crisis and ethics scandals among them 
the pundits agreed in advance that the electorate was 
pessimistic about the future and angry about the way the government 
is run whether that would imperil incumbents or benefit one party 
over another was a different question 
the conventional wisdom is that people are more satisfied with 
their own congressman said frank newport of the gallup polling 
organization 
president bush voted in his home state of texas after an 
energetic yet awkward campaign for gop candidates bush sparked a 
season of republican discontent when he broke his memorable 1988 
campaign pledge and embraced an october deficitreduction plan that 
raised tax rates 
democrats held a 259176 majority in the old house a pickup of 
only a few seats in either the house or senate could vastly 
complicate the presidents success with the 102nd congress and make 
it more difficult to cast his vetoes without fear of being 
overridden 
black political leaders expressed hope they could add to the 
24member congressional black caucus republicans hoped to elect 
their first blacks to the house since 1935 gary franks in 
connecticut and former cincinnati mayor kenneth blackwell in ohio 
among the most closely watched races was the california 
governors contest pitting gop sen pete wilson against former san 
francisco mayor dianne feinstein democrats control the legislature 
and the gop needed the governorship to influence redistricting that 
follows the 1990 census when california is expected to gain seven 
house seats 
the senate race that drew the most attention was in north 
carolina where threeterm conservative jesse helms battled harvey 
gantt a black former mayor of charlotte 
boschwitz was challenged by paul wellstone a liberal political 
science professor who waged an ingenious ad campaign and took 
advantage of the disarray that revolved around a hapless republican 
nominee for governor 
in oregon hatfield battled businessman harry lonsdale in his 
bid for a fifth term 
republicans hoped to capture a seat in hawaii where rep 
patricia saiki ran against sen daniel akaka appointed after the 
death of spark matsunaga 
the gop counted on three members of the house to move into the 
three senate seats being vacated by retiring republicans robert 
smith was favored in new hampshire hank brown in colorado and 
larry craig in idaho 
in all 16 democrats and 15 republicans sought senate 
reelection democrats sam nunn of georgia and david pryor of 
arkansas were unopposed republicans thad cochran of mississippi 
and john warner of virginia were also assured of victory 
thirtysix states elected governors and in 13 of them the 
incumbent was not on the ballot twentynine of the nations 
governors are currently democratic and the party was hoping to add 
a few to the list before the night was over 
clayton williams angled to keep the texas governorship in 
republican hands in a hotly contested race with democratic state 
treasurer ann richards 
in florida former sen lawton chiles challenged firstterm gop 
gov bob martinez bid for reelection 
other republicans facing difficult reelection opponents 
included guy hunt of alabama and john mckernan jr of maine the 
experts and the polls predicted edward diprete of rhode island 
would be turned out of office 
democrat rudy perpich faced a tough fight in a minnesota race 
marked by republican turmoil arne carlson was on the ballot but 
only because jon grunseth dropped out in late october over 
allegations of sexual improprieties 
eras were ending in massachusetts illinois and ohio where 
governors were electing successors to michael dukakis jim thompson 
and richard celeste dukakis had been so discredited that both 
candidates republican william weld and democrat john silber 
were running as outsiders ready to shake things up 
in the house party leaders faced little opposition speaker tom 
foley dwash was heavily favored while gop leader bob michel of 
illinois did not have a democratic opponent 
for all the campaign hoopla voter participation was forecast to 
be dismal as usual curtis gans director of the committee for 
the study of the american electorate predicted turnout similar to 
the last midterm election in 1986 when 364 percent of eligible 
voters cast ballots

the historic trend in midterm elections is for gains of 28 house 
seats and four senate seats for the party not holding the white 
house that seemed unlikely this time in part because democrats 
began with such large majorities and in part because incumbents of 
both parties had wellstocked campaign warchests 
the battle for control of congressional redistricting was 
extraordinary as both parties mounted multimilliondollar efforts 
to gain control of state legislative chambers in anticipation of 
the reapportionment wars to come 
we are under siege like i have never seen said pennsylvania 
senate president robert jubelirer a republican the democrats 
needed to capture three republican senate seats to gain control 
over the chamber 
an estimated 19 house seats are expected to move from 
northeastern and industrial midwestern states to california texas 
florida and other sun belt states a party that controls both 
houses and the governors office would have a far easier time 
redrawing the district lines to its liking and maximize its 
strength in the house for the next decade 
eight women were candidates for governor and eight for senate 
at least some candidates had nothing to worry about for 33 
democratic members of the house and 30 republicans election day 
brought no opponent 
preelection surveys indicated that voters were angry about 
their government and concerned about the future yet unlikely to 
toss out incumbents in any number much of the discontent erupted 
in the fall well after primary elections had safely returned 
incumbents to the ballot 
a gallup poll released on election morning said nearly two of 
every three people surveyed were dissatisfied with the way things 
are going in the nation many of them because of economic concerns 
a survey by the new york times and cbs said 77 percent of those 
surveyed believed the government was run by big interests looking 
out for themselves 
the same polls showed that many americans didnt know whether 
their representatives were democrats or republicans but they liked 
them and in most cases the incumbents had far more money than 
their challengers a seeming prescription for reelection 
republicans had high hopes earlier in the year that they could 
make serious inroads into the democratic majority of the senate and 
house and pave the way for possible majority rule later in the 
decade 
bush made over 100 appearances leading up to election day and 
raised more than 80 million for republican candidates by white 
house reckoning 
but his decision to embrace a tax increase after a prolonged 
series of flipflops sparked a rebellion among many republican 
candidates and seemed to bring to the surface the concern voters 
had about the economy in general it also sent his extremely high 
approval ratings plummeting 
democrats seized on the tax negotiations with bush to portray 
themselves as the protectors of the middle class and the 
republicans as defenders of the rich and republican analysts 
watched glumly in midoctober as the polls charted a decline in gop 
support 
some republicans criticized the presidents decision to his 
face still others stayed away from rallies he held for them 
others decided they didnt want his help 
a major mistake said one republican senator of the tax 
agreement he was dan coats appointed to his seat to succeed vice 
president dan quayle 
bush did his best to minimize the damage 
dont listen to that tired liberal divide class warfare 
rhetoric about soaking the rich he said in texas the day before 
the election hold onto your wallets theyre after you every 
single one of you he said of the democrats 
toward the end bush changed the focus of his speeches to the 
persian gulf and analysts said it arrested the republican decline 
in the polls and in the presidents approval ratings as well 
i want to see a peaceful resolution to this crisis bush 
said the day before the election but let me be very very clear 
we will stop short of making one single concession because 
aggression that goes rewarded today will be much worse tomorrow 
whatever the outcome there was already talk about the impact of 
this year on 1992 many republicans said bush had damaged himself 
and some held out the possibility that he would face a largely 
symbolic conservative challenge for the gop presidential 
nomination in two years 
democrats hoped that the emergence of the tax fairness issue 
would give them a wedge for the 1992 campaign 
even taking the economy into account this was an election 
without an overriding theme 
abortion played a role in a scattering of races and a few 
lawmakers were challenged for their ties to the savings and loan 
industry bushs veto of a yearend civil rights bill came up in 
the california governors race wilson voted to sustain it and 
in a few senate contests as well 
but some of the issues that provoked the loudest debate in 
congress had long since faded by the time the fall arrived 
including controversies over flag burning the peace dividend 
and many environmental concerns 
with democrats joining the presidents persian gulf policy the 
deployment of more than 200000 troops half a world away never 
became an issue either

on monday baker and saudi king fahd agreed that the united 
states will not attack iraq without saudi approval but that

military action 
all the armed forces have two roles to play the chinese 
official said one is to fight a war and the other is to seek 
peace

allen and annette clausen never thought about 
another interpretation of the phrase home sweet home until they 
found a 300pound beehive in a wall of their new house oozing with 
honey 
its a nightmare this honey clausen said monday surveying 
the twostory home that had been vacant for two years before he 
bought it from the us department of veteran affairs 
honey was dripping down the walls and spilling onto floors 
hundreds of bees killed by fumigators last month were under the 
kitchen stove and behind fireplace tile some live ones have 
returned 
this has been the worst thing of its kind that we have run up 
against said bruce manning vice president of land ho the 
company that managed the property for the veterans department 
the clausens bought the threebedroom house last month for 
78500 they had planned to put in new carpets tile and 
baseboards before moving in 
now since no one realized the extent of the problem those 
plans are on hold 
thousands of bees built the 6foot 300pound hive between the 
back of the fireplace and an outside wall another colony built a 
hive in a kitchen wall and has spread between the kitchen ceiling 
and a bedroom floor fifty pounds of honeycomb were found above a 
ceiling panel 
a pest control company killed the bees before the clausens 
completed the purchase manning said but no one realized the 
extent of the hives or that other bees might move in 
mrs clausen complained that veterans affairs land ho and the 
pest control company seem to be avoiding responsibility for the 
problem 
manning disputed that saying they had done everything possible 
to help the couple 
theyre going to be happy when it gets done he said

justice department lawyers monitored voting 
today in north carolina because of postcards the republican party 
sent regarding eligiblity to vote but officials reported no 
problems at polls 
we do not have anyone who has gone to the polling place with 
the card and been denied the right to vote said everette ward 
executive director of the north carolina democratic party 
ward said party lawyers were on duty to explain that voters who 
had moved from their old precinct still could vote 
the justice department is threatening legal action if north 
carolina election officials try to disqualify voters with 
information that state republicans compiled from a postcard 
mailing 
an investigation in the closing days of the heated senate race 
between republican incumbent jesse helms and democratic challenger 
harvey gantt found that more than 100000 postcards bearing 
misleading and inaccurate information were sent to voters in 29 
counties 
the investigation began friday after democrats charged that the 
north carolina republican party targeted heavily black precincts 
with mailings of 150000 postcards intended to intimidate voters 
from going to the polls 
a heavy turnout of black voters is important to gantt the black 
former mayor of charlotte in his effort to unseat threeterm 
helms the race has been close down to the wire 
the postcards told voters that they could not cast ballots if 
they had moved in the last 30 days they also warned voters it was 
a federal crime to give false residency information to election 
officials 
the card says if you have moved you cant vote ward said 
thats not true as late as this morning we have people who have 
received the cards who are calling in and want to discuss that with 
us 
what were doing is trying to eliminate the confusion and 
encourage people that they can vote 
alex brock state director of elections said no problems from 
the gop postcards had been reported to his office brock said the 
turnout at the states 2416 precincts was brisk and he predicted a 
55 percent turnout 
weve had no problems caused by those postcards brock said 
in our judgment the statement on the card was misleading if 
not totally inaccurate john r dunne assistant attorney general 
for civil rights said monday night 
dunne said the justice department had secured a written pledge 
from the state gop that it wouldnt compile lists of voters to 
challenge at the polls from postcards that had been returned 
because the addressee had moved 
while there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing the 
department will review the evidence to determine if a civil suit 
should be brought he said 
jack hawke the north carolina gop chairman defended the 
postcards saying the only people who received a mailing from us 
are those that are improperly registered 
the lawyers were assigned to travel to the 29 counties to send 
out the message that these challenges should not be honored and 
if necessary seek court injunctions dunne said

massachusetts voters grappled tuesday with a 26 
billion taxcutting initiative that opponents feared would 
devastate the states frail finances 
question 3 backed by citizens for limited taxation would 
shrink state taxes and fees to 1988 levels it would slash 13 
billion from the states 134 billion budget in the second half of 
the current fiscal year and cut 26 billion in fiscal 1992 which 
begins next july 
recent increases in the state income sales and gas tax would 
all be rescinded 
 
opponents argued the cuts would hamper state services including 
day care elderly programs and police and firefighter training 
college campuses could be shut down and weaker school districts 
dependent on state funding could face bankruptcy officials warned 
proponents angry over four major tax increases in a little more 
than a year to try to pay state bills said budget cuts were in 
order 
this is a chance to stop the tax increase that is coming if 
question 3 does not pass said barbara anderson head of clt 
the financially ailing state already has the lowest bond rating 
in the country bond rating agencies warned passage of question 3 
could drop the states rating from its current level of baa to junk 
bond status

a highstakes race for governor between 
republican pete wilson and democrat dianne feinstein topped a 
cumbersome california ballot tuesday along with a sweeping 
environmental initiative known as big green 
with republican gov george deukmejian retiring after two terms 
the gop sought desperately to hold onto the office otherwise 
democrats who control the legislature would have a free hand 
drawing new congressional boundaries to their partys liking 
the long list of 28 ballot issues included two conflicting term 
limit initiatives and two competing liquor tax increases 
democrat kathleen brown the sister of former gov jerry brown 
and daughter of former gov pat brown tried to launch her own 
statewide political career by challenging the incumbent republican 
state treasurer tom hayes 
incumbents were heavily favored in most of californias 45

the current makeup of the congressional delegation is 27 
democrats and 18 republicans 
a final round of independent preelection polls in the 
governors race showed wilson the states junior us senator 
leading by anywhere from 1 to 8 percentage points over feinstein 
the former mayor of san francisco 
 
feinstein the former mayor of san francisco and wilson the 
states junior us senator waged a seesaw campaign in which they 
spent a combined total of nearly 40 million 
much of the campaign focused on comparisons of wilsons 11year 
tenure as mayor of san diego before his 1982 election to the senate 
and feinsteins nine years as mayor of san francisco 
both are political moderates both prochoice and both prodeath 
penalty 
below the surface was the issue of reapportionment in 1992 when 
californias congressional delegation expands from the current 45 
to 52 or more seats 
since democrats have had firm control of both houses of the 
legislature for the past 20 years republicans believed their only 
hope to prevent a democratic gerrymander of those districts is the 
threat of a veto from a gop governor 
leaders of both parties said the difference between a democratic 
and republican governor could be 10 to 12 congresssional seats 
proposition 128 the big green initiative was a sweeping 
plan to phase out cancercausing pesticides ban chemicals that 
harm the ozone and reduce emissions of gases that contribute to 
global warming 
it would also preserve oldgrowth redwood stands restrict 
offshore oil drilling and create a new elective office of 
environmental czar 
it was supported by every major environmental group in the state 
and vigorously opposed by water timber agricultural and 
manufacturing groups 
proposition 140 would limit the governor and most other elected 
state officials to eight years in office limit state senators to 
eight years and assembly members to six years its rival 
proposition 131 would limit legislators to 12 years in office 
the two liquor tax proposals were put on the ballot by competing 
interests proposition 134 a nickeladrink plan was a 
750millionayear tax hike supported by emergency room 
physicians and many law enforcement and alcohol counseling groups 
among others proposition 126 was a pennyadrink alternative

democrat lawton chiles who said he was burned 
out two years ago when he retired from the senate tried tuesday 
for a political comeback against republican gov bob martinez 
chiles 60 said he came out of retirement to lead a revolt 
against bigmoney politics state democrats hoped he would help 
them rally against a gop tide 
martinez 55 was trying to cap his own comeback after a shaky 
first term only the second republican governor in florida since 
reconstruction martinez headed a gop ticket aiming to boost its 
118 congressional delegation lead and take control of the state 
senate it would be the first time republicans have been the 
majority party in a deep south legislative chamber in modern 
history 
floridians also voted on whether to retain their first black 
chief supreme court justice leander shaw who was targeted by 
antiabortionists and on whether the crimebeset state should make 
mandatory a threeday waiting period for handgun purchases 
 
with reapportionment looming in 1992 florida drew heavy 
attention from both national parties the state is expected to gain 
at least three congressional seats and republicans said they could 
reverse traditional democratic gerrymandering if they could control 
the governorship and at least one legislative chamber 
president bush campaigned for martinez three times and his son 
jeb was martinezs campaign chairman 
martinez started in april against chiles as much as 30 points 
behind in some polls but headed to the finish in what polls 
indicated was a dead heat 
spending 106 million the grandson of spanish immigrants kept 
up a torrid campaign schedule and bombarded floridians with 
feelgood ads that portrayed him as a beachstrolling family man 
who did best at protecting the environment and executing criminals 
one toughoncrime ad featured a picture of serial killer ted 
bundy who was executed on martinez order last year 
he tried to portray himself as the populist outsider fighting 
that tallahassee gang and called chiles a liberal washington

chiles voluntarily limited individual contributions to 100 each 
and spent 52 million he said his refusal to rely on heavy 
contributors would let him govern without obligations to special 
interests 
his lowkey lowbudget pace worried supporters such as steve 
pajcic the 1986 democratic nominee who said chiles money strategy 
was dumb naive and idealistic and chiles said because he 
personally was antiabortion although prochoice politically his 
conscience wouldnt allow him to hit martinez hard on the 
governors unpopular efforts to further restrict abortion in the 
state 
chiles stunned democrats in december 1987 by announcing he 
wouldnt seek a fourth term he had become the senate budget 
committee chairman but said he was burned out by washingtons

disclosed chiles was on the antidepressant drug prozac chiles 
who underwent quadruplebypass heart surgery in 1985 halted taking 
the drug but resumed its use midway through his campaign

democrat neil hartigan and republican jim edgar 
battled tuesday in illinois first wideopen governors race in 
more than a decade a race that reversed the usual political 
wisdom on taxes 
democratic sen paul simon was challenged in a bid for 
reelection by republican rep lynn martin whose antitax message 
and late call for limiting the terms of washington lawmakers had 
not stopped her slide in the polls 
hartigan the attorney general tried to appeal to voters weary 
of taxes by saying he would not ask lawmakers to extend a special 
income tax for education 
edgar the secretary of state said pinching pocketbooks was 
better than shortchanging schools 
a late october survey done for the chicago tribune had edgar in 
front 45 percent to 34 percent with 20 percent undecided but a 
chicago suntimes poll in the same period found the race a dead 
heat 
there also was a wild card a slate of black candidates in cook 
county who ran under the banner of the harold washington party 
named after chicagos late black mayor and urged blacks to oppose 
hartigan 
the latest senate survey showed simon ahead 62 percent to 28 
percent with 10 percent undecided 
most members of the states congressional delegation appeared 
headed for reelection but there were two competitive races in the 
chicago area 
in the 11th district republican walter dudycz tried to oust 
democratic us rep frank annunzio by portraying him as a friend 
of the savingsandloan industry 
the national republican congressional committee put annunzio on 
its list of endangered democrats 
he is the no 2 democrat on the house banking committee and 
chairman of a subcommittee that has some sampl oversight annunzios 
relatives have ties to the industry and sampls executives have 
helped finance his reelection bid 
in the 4th district freshman us rep george sangmeister who 
knocked off an incumbent by only 1000 votes in 1988 faced 
republican manny hoffman 
before the election illinois democrats had a 148 edge in the 
us house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after 14 years in office republican gov james r thompson did 
not seek reelection leaving the field open 
hartigan 52 staked his campaign primarily on one issue 
opposition to extending an income tax that is earmarked for schools 
and local governments and expires in june 1991 
edgar 44 said school districts would be a financial mess if 
the tax revenue stopped flowing 
in the senate race martin told voters that simon was too 
liberal for the state the fiveterm congresswoman from suburban 
rockford struck a timeforchange theme and declared that she would 
not vote for higher taxes although she had supported several 
increases during her house career 
simon had been considered vulnerable going into the race but he 
outspent martin roughly 2to1 by late in the campaign and martin 
conceded she knew her race was a long shot

voters chose between two political newcomers for 
governor tuesday both promising to rebuild massachusetts from the 
ashes of what only two years ago gov michael s dukakis ballyhooed 
as a miracle economy 
in the race between moderate republican william weld a former 
federal prosecutor and fiery john silber on leave as president of 
boston university the name of dukakis was mentioned often and 
unfavorably 
weld and republicans who have not won the governors race since 
1970 also got behind question three on the ballot a tax rollback 
initiative that would return 12 billion to taxpayers this fiscal 
year silber opposed the rollback as an economic disaster for a 
state that can hardly pay its bills now 
sen john f kerry a democrat and former lieutenant governor 
under dukakis was bidding for a second term he faced james 
rappaport a mutimillionaire businessman in a surprisingly tight 
race 
such challenges were otherwise restricted to the state and local 
level of the states 11 congressmen four were not opposed in the 
general election and the other seven including lone republican 
incumbent silvio conte were favored to win reelection 
although democratic rep barney frank was reprimanded by the 
house earlier this year for his activities with a male prostitute 
republican candidate john soto attracted little money in his bid to 
oust him 
 
silber who emerged as the underdog winner of the sept 18 
democratic primary was no diehard democrat he acknowleded he 
voted for president bush over dukakis in 1988 and he didnt 
hesitate to blame dukakis for the states fiscal mess including 
annual deficits and the lowest bond rating of any state in the 
nation 
the incompetence of the dukakis administration is appalling to 
me silber said in the final televised debate of the campaign 
still silber stressed traditional democratic positions such as 
economic pumppriming to help ease the states economic recession 
he opposed question 3 and pointed to welds opposition to an 
assault weapons ban as a sign of the gop nominees basic 
conservatism 
silbers general election campaign was calmer in tone than his 
primary election in which a series of statements on women 
immigrants welfare mothers were dubbed silber shockers by the 
media 
but the statements never seemed to have a serious impact on 
silber who frequently complained he was quoted out of context 
silber 64 has his roots in texas but campaigned on his 
20year record at bu and as a political outsider who would end what 
he says are the tax and spend policies of dukakis 
weld 45 a former us attorney for massachusetts and former 
head of the justice departments criminal division argued that 
underneath the rhetoric silber was a traditional democrat tied to 
other members of the power structure 
the kerryrappaport race was negative from the start 
rappaport attempted to tie kerry to dukakis and also criticized 
the incumbent for his interest in foreign relations issues 
kerry struck back claiming rappaports family had made millions 
through federal housing money and agricultural subsidies that 
rappaport opposed in his senate campaign

a unanimous supreme court ruled tuesday that 
families of american seamen killed on the job may not be awarded 
monetary damages for lost future earnings or loss of society 
the 80 decision yielding the first signed opinion of the 
courts 199091 term said general maritime law allows 
wrongfuldeath lawsuits in such cases but it added that any 
damages recovered cannot include those for loss of society or for 
lost future earnings 
loss of society is defined as a broad range of mutual benefits 
family members receive from each other including love affection 
care attention companionship comfort and protection 
the ruling was a defeat for the mother of a young seaman 
murdered while his ship was docked in vancouver wash six years 
ago 
we sail in occupied waters maritime tort law is now dominated 
by federal statute and we are not free to expand remedies at will 
simply because it might work to the benefit of seamen and those 
dependent upon them justice sandra day oconnor wrote 
justice david h souter who joined the court after the case was 
argued last month did not participate in the decision 
the ruling leaves families of seamen free to sue allegedly 
negligent shipowners and shipping companies under a 1920 federal 
law the jones act but that law places specific limits on such 
suits 
ludwick torregano a 24yearold galley assistant was killed 
aboard the archon on july 18 1984 clifford melrose the ships 
chief chef stabbed torregano at least 62 times and later was 
convicted of seconddegree murder 
torreganos mother mercedel miles later sued the ships owners 
and operators in federal court in new orleans contending that 
their negligence in hiring an unfit crewman caused her sons death 
ms miles was awarded 140000 for the pain and suffering 
torregano experienced prior to his death and 7800 for the loss of 
her sons support those awards were made under the jones act 
but the jury refused to award additional damages under general 
maritime law for the loss of torreganos future income or for the 
loss of society by both ms miles and the seamans father joseph 
torregano 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the damages award 
last year and tuesdays decision in turn upheld the appeals court 
ruling

in minnesotas wildest governors race ever 
democratic gov rudy perpich struggled to win a fourth term tuesday 
against arne carlson a republican who was put on the ballot just 
last week 
republican sen rudy boschwitz also was locked in a tight 
contest partly because of the gops gubernatorial turmoil he 
faced democratic college professor paul wellstone who waged a 
campaign with puckish humor 
election officials predicted that results could be delayed 
several hours because a switch in gop gubernatorial candidates 
forced the printing of supplemental ballots which were to be 
counted by hand 
carlson finished second in the gop primary but he became his 
partys gubernatorial candidate a week ago to replace jon grunseth 
who withdrew amid allegations he swam nude with teenage girls and 
cheated on his wives 
an independent poll taken oct 1921 while grunseth was still 
in the race and carlson was being urged to mount a writein 
campaign showed carlson leading perpich 51 percent to 41 percent 
in a hypothetical race 
five minnesota democratic congressmen and two republican house 
members were seeking reelection republicans also hoped to retain 
the 3rd district seat which bill frenzel is vacating after 20 
years 
republican rep arlan stangeland under fire for billing 
personal telephone calls to his congressional expenses faced 
frequent challenger collin peterson in minnesotas 7th district in 
the northwestern and central parts of the state 
also on the ballot was a proposal that would send 40 percent of 
net state lottery proceeds to a trust fund designated to protect 
natural resources and wildlife 
 
republican turmoil in the gubernatorial race far overshadowed 
the problems that plagued perpich at the beginning of the year 
when he was dubbed governor goofy for his actions in a series 
of disputes with the news media 
perpich 62 was seeking to become the first minnesota governor 
to serve four terms 
carlson 56 has been state auditor for 12 years he had 
launched a general election writein campaign a week before 
grunseth withdrew 
three weeks before the election grunseth was accused of 
encouraging four girls aged 13 to 16 to join him for a nude swim at 
a 1981 pool party and of trying to touch one girls breast 
grunseth denied those allegations then late last month a 
newspaper described a womans story of having an affair with 
grunseth during both of his marriages grunseth said the affair 
ended before he married for the second time but he dropped out of 
the race later that day 
certainly there have been other election seasons in minnesota 
fraught with conflict acrimony and dispute said hyman berman a 
history professor at the university of minnesota but weve never 
had a candidate who was found to have his zipper unzipped and weve 
never had a major party candidate drop out voluntarily within a 
week of the election 
wellstone 47 a carleton college political science professor 
campaigned with a series of humorous television ads one of which 
showed him looking for rudy in a takeoff of the documentary 
film roger and me 
but wellstone was on the defensive in the last week of the 
campaign after boschwitz 59 told voters that wellstones national 
health care plan would result in the shutdown of the mayo clinic 
and that wellstones spending proposals would require a doubling of 
taxes

the marine corps said today it was ordering to 
active duty about 630 reservists from units in eight states for 
combat roles in the persian gulf it is the first such use of 
american combat reserves in the crisis 
also today the pentagon announced that more than 230000 us 
forces are deployed in the gulf area and that deployments are 
continuing the total is 20000 more than the pentagons previous 
official estimate issued last month 
the marine corps decision while not significantly increasing 
us combat capability in the gulf marks an important departure 
for the pentagon it opens the way to possible use of major army 
reserve combat units in operation desert shield and signals a 
growing us military and political commitment to evicting iraq 
from kuwait 
the more than 34000 reserves called to active duty by all the 
military services over the past 10 weeks have been used only in 
noncombat roles 
pete williams a pentagon spokesman said today that defense 
secretary dick cheney is considering giving the army the authority 
to call up major combat reserve units but that no decision has 
been made 
the approximately 630 marine combat troops being put on active 
duty are among 824 marine reserves called up for a variety of 
combat and support duties the callup order issued by gen al gray 
commandant of the marine corps brings to 998 the total number of 
marine reserves put on active duty for desert shield 
among all the military services 35173 reserves have been 
called to active duty for the gulf crisis including the marines 
latest callup williams said 
the 630 marine combat reserves are being assigned initially to 
the 5th marine expeditionary brigade at camp pendleton calif to 
form a specially tailored group known as an airground task force 
it is expected that the 5th marine expeditionary brigade will be 
sent to the gulf as replacements for one of several marine task 
forces already there as part of desert shield although pentagon 
spokesman lt col stuart wagner said no decision had been made on 
an eventual deployment of the 5th meb to the gulf 
the combat reserves are being called from the following units 
4th light antiair defense battalion at pasadena calif 
totaling 55 men 
4th light armored vehicle battalion at camp pendleton 34 men 
4th tank battalion company a and a detachment from 
headquarters and service company at miramar naval air station 
calif totaling 120 men 
an antitank platoon from the 23rd marines at brousard la 
totaling 75 men 
4th combat engineer battalion an engineer support company and 
a detachment from headquarters and service company at baltimore 
md totaling 24 men 
4th amphibious assault battalion at gulfport miss and 4th 
assault amphibian battalion at norfolk va totaling 189 men 
4th force reconnaissance company at reno nev 34 men 
2nd battalion 25th marines at bronx ny 53 men 
4th combat engineer battalion charleston wva 49 men 
use of reserves for combat roles is politically sensitive 
because it can be viewed as putting the country on a wartime 
footing no shots have been fired in the confrontation with iraq 
but president bush has not ruled out the use of force to oust iraq 
from occupied kuwait 
the pentagon has been under pressure from some congressional 
leaders to use combat reserves defense secretary dick cheney had 
resisted using them saying the 180day maximum period of 
activation for reserves was too short to make good use of them 
that concern was erased earlier this month when congress 
shortly before adjourning doubled the limit on active duty service 
for combat reserves to 360 days

threeterm republican sen jesse helms and 
democratic challenger harvey gantt squared off tuesday in an epic 
clash between the conservative old south and the progressive new 
south 
gantt 47 an architect who served two terms as the first black 
mayor of charlotte campaigned as an unabashed liberal he 
advocated the idea that government has a role in solving the 
nations education environmental and health care problems 
helms 69 a leading spokesman for the american right argued 
that government is too large and intrusive and needs to be cut 
back he sounded his familiar themes attacking affirmative action 
programs as unfair to whites and decrying pornography and 
homosexuality as signs of declining moral values 
voter turnout was running heavy in both urban and rural areas of 
the state long lines were reported in both predominantly white and 
black precincts as the polls opened 
opinion polls released last week showed a close race one poll 
gave helms a lead of 4 percentage points another gave gantt the 
same lead both had margins of error of 35 percentage points 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
helms limited to eight days of fulltime campaigning by the 
late adjournment of congress injected the issue of race into the 
campaign in the final week 
helms accused gantt of running a secret campaign aimed at 
getting black voters to the polls he played a radio ad for gantt 
in which a black couple discusses the need to vote 
helms television ads also accused gantt of using his minority 
status in 1985 to acquire a television station license that later 
was sold to a whiteowned company the federal communications 
commission approved that sale which gantt called a private 
business deal that did not involve one dime of government money 
helms also criticized the 1990 civil rights act calling it the 
quota bill the measure failed when the senate fell one vote 
short of overriding a veto by president bush bush said he vetoed 
the bill because it would force businesses to develop quotas for 
minority hiring 
if you want quotas to dominate and dictate whether you get a 
job or get a promotion you vote for mr gantt helms said 
gantt said helms claims of a secret campaign to get blacks to 
the polls were stupid 
dont let jesse helms divert you into thinking that harvey 
gantt is doing something sinister or secret over the airwaves 
gantt said how can you run a secret campaign in the black 
community over radio stations that is stupid 
gantt also ridiculed the senators claim to represent north 
carolina values 
with his lies gantt asked campaign crowds with his 
distortions with his lack of courage of course not 
gantt campaigned on helms votes against education and 
environmental bills he said helms was more interested in foreign 
affairs than state concerns 
helms argued that his votes against those measures were based on 
his concerns that federal spending was excessive

sen mark hatfield bid for a fifth term 
tuesday against a surprisingly strong challenge from democrat harry 
lonsdale a freespending businessman who campaigned as a political 
outsider 
lonsdale who also criticized hatfield for not doing enough to 
reduce cutting of old growth forests had led in some late october 
polls but the incumbent appeared to aave regained momentum in the 
final week 
in the race for governor democrat barbara roberts held a slight 
edge in polls over republican dave frohnmayer independent 
antiabortion candidate al mobley appeared to be stealing support 
from frohnmayer and was favored by about 14 percent of voters in a 
late survey 
incumbent gov neil goldschmidt a democrat did not seek 
reelection 
republican denny smith was in trouble in his bid for a sixth 
term in the us house from the states 5th district he faced 
democrat mike kopetski who came within 707 votes of upsetting 
smith two years ago 
democrats were likely to retain control of the state senate 
where they hold a 1911 advantage control of the state house now 
3228 in favor of democrats could go either way 
voters also faced 11 statewide ballot issues polls showed 
voters closely divided on a measure that would shut down the 
states only nuclear power plant the trojan plant in northwestern 
oregon 
another measure would reduce property taxes by an average of 
nearly 50 percent over five years threatening the funding of 
schools and local governments late polls showed the measure had a 
slight edge 
still another proposition would give 2500 incometax credits 
to parents for sending children to private schools polls indicated 
that measure was falling out of voters favor 
a proposition to ban abortions except in reported cases of rape 
or incest or to save the mothers life appeared headed for defeat 
but a measure requiring doctors to notify a parent before 
performing an abortion on a minor had voters split 
 
the senate race was one of the most bitter in oregon in years 
both hatfield and lonsdale used television advertisements to make 
increasingly negative allegations 
lonsdale 58 financed his campaign primarily out of his own 
pocket and charged that hatfield was protecting timber companies at 
the expense of the environment 
hatfield was slow to respond he initially ignored lonsdale and 
invested little in television advertising relying instead on 
traditional handshaking and personal appearances after polls 
showed lonsdale closing to within striking distance hatfield 
counterattacked with a blitz of television commercials 
hatfield 67 is completing his fourth term in the senate and is 
the ranking republican on the appropriations committee 
roberts 53 in the middle of a second term as secretary of 
state portrayed herself as a leader who takes decisive stands on 
tough issues she charged that frohnmayer was indecisive 
frohnmayer 50 halfway through a third term as state attorney 
general claimed spending programs advocated by roberts would 
require tax increases

in a move toward peace on the eve of the 
anniversary of the bolshevik revolution boris n yeltsin said 
tuesday he and mikhail s gorbachev have agreed to discuss their 
differences 
yeltsin the russian president declined to say who proposed the 
meeting scheduled for sunday but it was the soviet president who 
approached yeltsin to shake his hand after a holiday ceremony in 
the kremlins palace of congresses 
we just agreed with gorbachev to meet on the 11th 
oneonone yeltsin said there will be very many issues and it 
will be an important meeting he said declining to elaborate 
the meeting will be the first between the rival politicians 
since their attempt at reconciliation over economic reform broke 
down in late summer the rift put yeltsins russian federation the 
soviet unions largest republic on a collision course with the 
central government 
russia adopted its own plan for converting to a free market 
economy conflicting with a more cautious plan endorsed by 
gorbachev and adopted by the national legislature 
gorbachev appeared to have been motivated to suggest the 
peacemaking session by a speech at the revolution day gala in the 
congress hall leonid y bliznov a soviet legislator noted 
gorbachev and yeltsin had tried to work together but now very 
little is left of this alliance 
its incomprehensible who or what stands in the way of the two 
leaders who know the peoples needs and whom the people recognize 
both of them must realize that future opposition makes them both 
less popular bliznov told the audience of more than 3000 
communist party officials and politicians 
as applause erupted in the huge woodpaneled hall gorbachev 
turned to look at yeltsin seated six people to his left on a long 
podium in front of a huge portrait of soviet founder vladimir 
lenin yeltsin did not turn to make eye contact 
yeltsin told reporters later that he would make a speech in a 
few weeks explaining his differences with gorbachev 
the kremlin ceremony amounted to a pep rally for communists who 
are expected to face criticism from dozens of groups on wednesday 
a traditional military parade followed by a speech by 
gorbachev is scheduled for red square to celebrate the revolution 
that brought bolsheviks to power in 1917 yeltsin was invited to 
stand atop the lenin mausoleum along with gorbachev and other 
officials 
at least two anticommunist groups plan marches in moscow some 
demonstrators urge a day of mourning be held for victims of 
seven decades of totalitarian rule some have vowed to march 
through red square demanding the resignation of gorbachev and the 
soviet parliament 
yeltsin who has quit the communist party said soviets should 
use the holiday as a time for reflection people must again look 
back and pay tribute to what the revolution did and analyze what 
the mistakes were during that period 
the biggest mistake was turning things over to a totalitarian 
regime he said

a defense attorney today challenged 
the memory of a woman who says her father killed her childhood 
playmate more than 20 years ago 
during the second day of crossexamination defense attorney 
douglas horngrad questioned eileen franklinlipsker about the 
chronology of her actions as she allegedly resurrected the 
longrepressed memory 
george franklin sr 51 is on trial for the murder of 
8yearold susan nason after his daughter told police last november 
that shed remembered the 1969 attack franklin has pleaded 
innocent to the charges 
franklinlipsker testified monday that she first recalled the 
murder in january 1989 and told a therapist about it in june 
but horngrad asked her why she took so long to discuss the 
memory with a professional 
is five months recent horngrad asked franklinlipsker 
i would say that if i had a 5monthold memory of a 
20yearold murder thats very recent she replied 
franklinlipsker at times seemed impatient under horngrads 
questioning on monday she appeared near tears as she testified 
about the slaying 
she said she watched as her father raped the girl in the back of 
his van then killed her the 29yearold woman testified the girl 
was crouched down crying when her father approached with a rock 
her hands flew up to her head the next thing i heard was 
two blows it sounded terrible it sounded like a crack and a 
splat she said 
moments later she said she walked over to her friends body 
i saw blood she said i saw hair that was no longer 
attached 
franklin was charged with murder after his daughter went to 
police last year she said she had repressed her memories of the 
slaying for two decades until they came flooding back when she 
looked at her own daughter 
franklin a former san mateo firefighter could be sentenced to 
life in prison if convicted 
the defense maintains that there is no evidence linking him to 
the murder and that his daughter could have based her allegations 
on old news reports of the slaying 
franklinlipsker appeared tense and sometimes distraught as she 
also told of suffering years of sexual abuse and beatings at the 
hands of her father 
she denied defense claims that she told her story to collect 
thousands of dollars from book and movie deals she said she signed 
a 50000 book contract and a 10000 movie deal only to stop the 
offers from pouring in 
she used 5000 to pay legal fees and donated 55000 to 
childrens charities children of the night and the 
childrens home society she said

all nations must face up to the threat of a 
climate disaster and take steps against global warming prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain said tuesday 
thatcher in a keynote speech to a united nations meeting of 
ministers on the issue said much more research is needed but a 
clear case for precautionary action exists now 
it is a race against time to save our planet french 
prime minister michel rocard told the officials from some 120 
countries including more than 80 ministers 
in an appeal aimed in good part at the united states and the 
soviet union mrs thatcher demanded all countries begin work on 
binding commitments to rein in rising pollution by greenhouse 
gases the limits would be for a planned global treaty on climate 
change to be ready in 1992 
but there were increasing signs tuesday that ministers contrary 
to european community hopes will fail to agree on targets or 
deadlines so as not to endanger wednesdays conferenceending 
declaration 
not to come to a result would be a very bad signal german 
environment minister klaus toepfer told reporters we have to do 
our best to come to a minimum compromise 
environmental groups said the draft declaration looks more 
like a nondeclaration as all the crucial points on carbon dioxide 
reduction targets dates and the urgent call for immediate action 
have been removed 
carbon dioxide pollution much of it from burning fossil fuels 
is seen as the leading cause of global warming methane and 
chlorofluorocarbons are other heattrapping greenhouse gases 
americans and soviets are the biggest contributors of manmade 
carbon dioxide emissions 
washington opposes immediate targets against carbon dioxide 
pollution saying more scientific data is needed to justify the 
enormous costs involved in changing ways of life the soviet union 
saudi arabia and some other countries also have reservations 
china sounded a third world note of reluctance measures to 
protect the global climate should not hinder the economic 
development of developing countries delegate song jian told the 
twoday meeting 
mrs thatcher who holds a chemistry degree warned climate 
change could occur more quickly than current computer models 
suggest 
should this happen it would be doubly disastrous were we to 
shirk the challenge now 
many steps would be sensible in any event improving energy 
efficiency developing alternative sources of supply 
reforestation rethinking industrial processes and tackling the 
waste problem she said 
mrs thatcher and rocard followed the lead of scientists from 
some 100 countries who met last week in the conferences first 
part the experts made plain that global warming undoubtedly exists 
and appealed to politicians for immediate measures 
scientists say global temperatures could rise at their fastest 
rate in 10000 years next century if nothing is done among the 
feared upheavals are rising sea levels that would displace coastal 
dwellers desertification and vast changes affecting wildlife 
bikenibeu paeniu prime minister of tuvalu told delegates they 
may hold the key to the continued existence of his south 
pacific coral atoll group and other islands 
we in the pacific the carribbean and elsewhere have done the 
least to create these hazards but now stand the most to lose he

the national marine fisheries service said 
tuesday that the winter run of chinook salmon in the sacramento 
river is a threatened species the ruling blocks any take of the 
fish by sport or commercial fishermen 
the services final determination means the winter run of 
chinook salmon will be added to a list of threatened species under 
the endangered species act 
the american fisheries society asked the government to protect 
the salmon in 1985 pointing to evidence that run sizes for winter 
chinook in the northern california river had fallen to about 2000 
per year down fromabout 84000 in the late 1960s 
the fisheries service decided in 1987 not to list the species as 
threatened but to depend on restoration and conservation efforts 
planned by state and federal authorities 
but in 1989 the run size for the year was estimated at 533 
fish and an emergency rule declared the species threatened on aug 
4 1989 the agency said in a statement 
early data for 1990 show even fewer winter chinook returning so 
the ruling is being made final based on the sizes of the 
returning runs of chinook in 1989 and 1990 the lack of information 
indicating success made by restoration efforts and the unique and 
fragile nature of this stock 
the fisheries service said its scientists would be monitoring 
water levels in the sacramento river to make sure that distribution 
of water for development or irrigation would not increase the 
threat to the chinook

chinese foreign minister qian qichen signaled on 
tuesday his governments willingness to go along with a un 
resolution to authorize the use of force to liberate kuwait from 
iraqi invaders us officials said 
even though qian did not explicitly approve sending troops into 
action well still have to wait and see he said the stance 
the chinese minister took on the un resolution in a meeting with 
secretary of state james a baker iii enhances president bushs 
campaign against iraqi president saddam hussein 
us officials commenting on condition of anonymity said 
qians comments were an indication that at the very least the 
beijing government would not veto such a resolution 
china as a permanent member of the un security council has 
the power to use its veto to block approval of the resolution bush 
wants authorizing the use of troops against iraq 
all armed forces have two roles to play qian told reporters 
at the outset of his twohour meeting with baker at cairo airport 
one is to fight a war the other is to seek peace 
qian thereby underscored that china was not necessarily 
approving going to war to rescue kuwait from iraqi occupation 
baker in his only public comment of a long day which included 
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak said he agreed 
with qian that armies can be used for peaceful or military 
purposes 
china has supported all 10 resolutions approved by the security 
council but was considered hesitant to take an additional step 
authorizing use of what bush and baker call the military 
option 
qian stressed his government still preferred a peaceful solution 
of the persian gulf crisis which baker on monday said had entered 
a new phase 
i think all the resolutions adopted by the united nations are 
intended to increase the pressure on iraq so as to achieve a 
peaceful settlement the foreign minister said 
baker on thursday in moscow will solicit the views of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who has declared in the past that 
it is unacceptable to have a military solution to the gulf crisis 
the outcome of bakers meeting with mubarak meanwhile was not 
all that clear 
the egyptian president abruptly canceled a news conference in 
cairo and baker did not give the 20 reporters traveling with him an 
account of the meeting as they flew to ankara for talks wednesday 
with turkish officials 
instead a memo was read to the reporters by a us official in 
which these points were made 
mubarak agreed with baker that a partial solution to 
iraqs occupation of kuwait was unacceptable and that the un 
resolutions should be implemented fully 
mubarak told baker that egypt is very very solid in 
supporting us policy in the persian gulf 
they discussed ways of giving us logistical support to the 
approximately 14000 egyptian troops deployed in saudi arabia 
alongside more than 100000 us troops 
us officials aboard bakers us air force jet refused to say 
whether us b52 bombers would be based in egypt 
they insisted meanwhile that baker had not discussed a 
timetable with mubarak for an attack 
still as baker completed the fourth day of an eightday trip 
the possibility of war still hung in the air 
baker will dispatch john kelly the assistant secretary of state 
for the near east to damascus on wednesday to brief syrian 
leaders 
kelly will then go on to brussels to talk to officials of the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the european community

a gunman believed to be of arab descent 
assassinated jewish extremist meir kahane at a manhattan hotel 
ending a fiery career that took the radical rabbi from brooklyn 
street corners to the front line of the arabjewish conflict in the 
middle east 
kahane 58 was shot to death monday night in midtown manhattan 
after addressing a zionist group the gunman el sayed a noseir 
34 was shot in the chin by a postal police officer as he fled and 
was hospitalized police said 
noseir has repaired air conditioners for the citys department 
of general services since 1988 said albert scardino a spokesman 
for mayor david dinkins other background on noseir was not 
immediately available 
israel army radio reported early today that noseir once lived in 
the occupied territories 
police said only that the gunman was believed to be of middle 
eastern origin but that his exact nationality was not known he 
carried several pieces of id with different addresses a city 
official said he lived in brooklyn 
authorities said they were investigating a motive 
everything indicates he was acting alone said chief of 
detectives joseph borrelli 
reverberations of the assassination were felt in israel where 
kahane supporters threatened vengeance two elderly palestinians 
were shot and killed in the occupied west bank today israeli news 
reports suggested the killings were linked 
an israel radio police reporter moshe nussbaum quoted kahane 
supporters in jerusalem as saying they believed the killings were 
carried out to avenge the assassination and that more attacks could 
take place 
borrelli said noseir stood up and opened fire twice with a 
357caliber handgun as kahane was taking questions in a 
secondfloor conference room the rabbi who stood about four feet 
from the gunman was shot in the neck 
ellen borakove a spokeswoman for the city medical examiners 
office said a post mortem indicated a single bullet entered the 
left side of the neck and exited through the right cheek 
the bullet was fired at close range she said borakove said the 
family did not want an autopsy performed because of religious 
reasons 
noseir and an officer and a bystander also wounded in the attack 
were reported in stable condition at bellevue hospital where 
kahane was pronounced dead 
police stood guard early today over noseir who was under 
sedation and could not immediately be interrogated officials said 
hospital spokesman rob frazier said it was unlikely he would be 
able to talk for at least two days 
kahane as founder of the jewish defense league urged jews in 
the united states to arm themselves against antisemitism later 
as a far rightwing member of israels parliament he was one of 
the jewish states fiercest antiarab politicians 
revenge is a very jewish concept he said of his call for 
the expulsion of the 17 million palestinians from the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip as well as the 800000 arab citizens from 
israel 
the bearded blackhaired rabbi made his name with brutal 
hottempered rhetoric 
american blacks were guilty of jew hatred he said arabs were 
dogs jews who ignored this were lemmings another holocaust was 
imminent he declared and made his symbol a clenched fist under 
the slogan never again 
in israel the rabbi could gather thousands of fanatical young 
jews to march through the streets of jerusalem shouting death to 
the arabs 
many denounced him as a bigot and a demagogue others considered 
him a freedom fighter 
he was our king david said charles cohen who stood sobbing 
with his wife in front of the hospital in a crowd of orthodox jews 
hoisting israeli flags and reciting hebrew prayers 
martin cohen a new york lawyer and kahane follower who was at 
the hospital called the slain rabbi a martyr he stood for every 
jew who no longer wants to be kicked around for every jew who 
remembers the holocaust he said 
kahane had no police protection state assemblyman dov hikind 
who represents the rabbis old brooklyn neighborhood said kahane 
had refused it 
he said that when his turn would come when god called him no 
one could prevent it said hikind 
the shooting occurred shortly after 9 pm at the new york 
marriott east side as the gunman fled he ran into 73yearold 
irving franklin who was selling booklets for a zionist group and 
shot him in the leg police said 
the gunman commandeered a taxi and rode a block before getting 
out and opening fire on officer carlos acosta 55 who was standing 
in front of a post office police said the bullet bounced off the 
officers bulletproof vest and struck him in the arm as he returned 
fire hitting noseir authorities said 
kahane founded the jdl in 1968 in new york the jdl organized 
classes in karate and weapons training and patrolled highcrime 
neighborhoods the group was linked to acts of violence including 
a 1972 firebombing in which one person was killed and 13 were 
injured 
after moving to israel in 1971 kahane founded the countrys 
kach party which advocates the ouster of all arabs from 
israeliheld territory and a ban on jewisharab marriages its 
symbol is a clenched fist inside a star of david 
kahane who renounced his us citizenship to run for 
parliament served four years but was barred from running for 
reelection in 1988 after a law was passed banning parties that 
have a racist platform 
seymour reich chairman of the conference of presidents of major 
americanjewish organizations said kahane had strong supporters 
and opponents 
whatever one thought about his political program his shocking 
assassination will be deplored by friends and foes alike he 
said 
the president of the americanarab relations committee dr m 
t mehdi said he disagreed with the rabbis every assumption 
during our many radio and tv debates concerning zionist claims to 
palestine 
but we maintained cordial relations and i found kahane more 
honest and straightforward than the rest of the zionists with whom 
i have debated he said 
while we totally disapproved of his politics and rhetoric on 
the middle east we strongly condemn this deliberate act of 
terrorism said a statement issued monday night by the simon 
wiesenthal center in los angeles nonprofit insitution for the 
study of the holocaust 
the center is shocked at word of the coldblooded murder of 
rabbi meir kahane it said 
rabbi alexander schindler president of the union of american 
hebrew congregations said he disagreed strongly with kahanes 
politics but added i nevertheless deeply regret his violent 
end 
he did not deserve to die by an assassins bullet schindler 
said 
kahane is survived by his wife two sons and two daughters 
his funeral was scheduled for today at the young israel of ocean 
parkway synagogue in brooklyn 
his body was to be flown to israel

prime minister vp singh his 
government heading for collapse in parliament sought tuesday to 
keep party defectors from taking power 
singhs government faces a noconfidence vote in parliament on 
wednesday following hindumoslems riots which killed at least 360 
people in two weeks 
the issue moslem possession of a site hindus claim as the 
birthplace of an important hindu god prompted the desertion of 
the rightwing hindu party from singhs coalition and was the 
immediate spark of the political crisis 
even before the riots singh was beset by other problems at 
least 148 people died in protests after he announced in august he 
would reserve nearly half of all government for low caste hindus 
he said the policy would raise the lower classes from economic 
and social impoverishment but critics said singh manufactured the 
caste problem to gain votes from the poor masses while he failed 
to follow through with economic liberalization and ignored the 
increasingly deadly sepoaratist insurrections by moslems in kashmir 
and by sikhs in punjab 
singhs parliamentary maneuvering on the eve of wednesdays vote 
created confusion and seemed to move the nation closer to elections 
just 11 months after the last national vote 
in a lastditch effort to save his government the prime 
minister said he was ready to join a sweeping coalition presumably 
encompassing the opposition congress party but that option seemed 
unlikely to win much support 
the need of the hour is a national government or a national 
coalition to look into the serious crisis the country is facing 
he said 
singhs janata dal party split on monday the leader of the 
rebel faction chandra shekhar said he would join an alternative 
government with the help of congress the largest party in the 
legislature 
congress leader and former prime minister rajiv gandhi swung 
behind chandra shekhar pledging to support him for prime minister 
and not to seek the post for himself 
chandra shekhar said monday he had the support of 58 of the 
janata dals 140 members in the lok sabha the allimportant lower 
house of parliament 
but singh moved quickly to block recognition of the group as a 
new party expelling chandra shekhar and 24 of his supporters from 
the janata dal 
under a law designed to prevent individuals from crossing the 
floor any breakaway faction must carry onethird of the partys 
members 
those whom singh expelledstay in parliament as independents 
but the 33 other rebels technically remain trapped in the janata 
dal and are obliged to vote according to party lines 
if they defect taking less than onethird of the remaining 115 
janata dal members they forfeit their parliament seats 
chandra shekhar in a letter to the house which barely concealed 
his anger said it was public knowledge that he commanded the 
support of more than the required onethird he accused singh of 
acting with an evil design 
singh responded that the splinter group had no mandate from the 
voters to form a government 
apart from technicalties there is a poltical context he 
told reporters by some manipulation some group is formed which 
has no validity or sanction of the people as they have voted 
the chaos gives ramaswamy venkataraman the 80yearold 
president of india considerable leeway in deciding the nations 
course 
if singh loses the confidence vote and resigns venkataraman can 
ask another member to form a government or he can dissolve 
parliament and call an election 
venkataraman has been holding daily meetings with political 
leaders and constitutional lawyers since the political crisis broke 
two weeks ago

a pan am security manager said tuesday 
that before the flight 103 bombing the airline investigated a 
warning that one of its usbound flights would be a target but 
determined it was a hoax 
jim berwick pan am security manager at londons heathrow 
airport at the time of the dec 21 1988 bombing told a public 
inquiry that although the airline evaluated the warning made to the 
us embassy in helsinki as a hoax it stepped up security 
the inquiry into the disaster which killed all 259 people on 
board and 11 on the ground in lockerbie 12 miles northeast of 
dumfries is focusing only on the deaths and ways to prevent future 
bombings not on criminal responsibility the inquiry began oct 1 
and is expected to last three months 
scottish authorities are still investigating the crime 
inquiring into several radical palestinian groups and the us 
drug enforcement agency is looking into a news report that one of 
its agents might have unwittingly carried the bomb on board during 
one of its undercover operations 
at tuesdays session berwick said that while he was in brussels 
dec 8 1988 he heard from a colleague a warning that a finnish 
woman would be duped into carrying the bomb on board a frankfurt to 
new york flight 
berwick who is now pan american world airways managing ground 
security coordinator at heathrow said he returned to london 
advised the us embassy regional security officer asked the 
federal aviation authority in brussels for more information and 
flew to helsinki the next day for a meeting at the airport 
officials later decided the threat was a hoax berwick said 
but he said he made arrangements for all unaccompanied female 
passengers to be treated as selectees earmarked for further 
security checks and arranged for extra vigilance at frankfurt 
in a telex sent from helsinki to pan ams new york headquarters 
berwick said emphasis should be placed on the handling of 
interline baggage from frankfurt baggage being switched from 
one airline to another 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt and switched planes in london 
before heading for new york

a kremlin official on tuesday outlined a new union 
treaty that would guarantee civil liberties and republics right to 
secede but he conceded the plan would fail without the agreement 
of the russian republic 
if russia does not sign it well have to be realistic we 
would not be able to talk about any union said grigory revenko 
a member of president mikhail s gorbachevs presidential council 
a highlevel advisory body 
the proposal represented the governments latest attempt to 
appease secession movements by the republics and smaller regions 
while creating a uniform marketoriented economic system in one 
country the treaty would replace a 1922 document that formed the 
basis for the current union 
but many details of the broad plan were unclear and it faced an 
uphill battle for acceptance by the national legislature and the 
republics 
the treaty would have a section defining human rights and 
voluntary republic membership in the redefined soviet union 
another would set out the kremlins military and economic 
authority a third would establish legislative judicial and 
executive branches of the central government revenko said 
it would define the country as a union of sovereign 
republicstates and would amount to a second chapter to the 
current constitution he said 
we do not need a union with somebody chained to it because 
that would lead to a constant attempt to break those chains 
revenko said 
republics will not have to expect any actions that would 
stop sovereignty or independence there will be no such actions 
the plan grew out of a proposal by gorbachev last summer that 
was widely criticized by the republics for failing to grant real 
independence revenko said gorbachevs ideas and a number of 
variations later were reviewed by the council of federation 
another highlevel advisory body representing presidents of the 15 
republics and one autonomous region 
the council agreed last week to have a preliminary proposal 
published in the soviet press in the next nine days that would 
bring the entire population into the discussion of the future of 
the union he said 
only after its publication sometime before nov 15 could it be 
considered by the national parliament revenko said 
he gave no date for legislative debate saying only that he 
hoped the treaty could be approved in the next few months in 
conjunction with gorbachevs economic reform plan 
the union treaty and the program of transition to the market 
economy cannot go without each other revenko said political 
issues would inevitably slow down the transition to the market the 
market would not tolerate any political or national isolation 
gorbachev last month won approval of the compromise plan that 
dropped provisions to allow private ownership and give more 
authority to republics 
russian republic president boris n yeltsin immediately rejected 
the compromise his parliament voted last week to proceed with the 
more radical plan on its own territory which occupies nearly 
twothirds of soviet territory and possesses much of its raw 
materials 
the republic already has declared the primacy of its laws over 
national laws and has moved to seize control of many of russias 
assets but it has not taken an official stance toward the union 
treaty 
the treaty would not require republics to belong to the union 
and lets each decide whether its legislature or population would 
vote on membership 
while accepting that russia might opt out of the treaty revenko 
sounded a hopeful note 
i believe russias responsibility for its own state is too 
great and that the politicians as well as the people of russia 
will come to understand that he said 
all but one of the 15 republics also have declared some form of 
sovereignty from the kremlin several have announced secession 
drives and said they would join any new federation with moscow on a 
voluntary basis only

president who charged her with political corruption and 
incompetence 
she faces seven charges of misconduct and abuse of power a 
guilty verdict on any one charge could banish her from politics for 
up to seven years ms bhutto denies any wrongdoing

the marine corps on tuesday called to active 
duty hundreds of combat forces from reserve units across the 
country marking the first use of american citizensoldiers in 
combat roles in the persian gulf crisis 
at the same time the pentagon announced that more than 230000 
us forces are now in the gulf area as part of operation desert 
shield that is 20000 more than the previous pentagon count given 
oct 23 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said desert shield deployments 
are continuing but he declined to comment on what the additional 
forces would be 
stay tuned for announcements of new deployments he told 
reporters 
williams also disclosed that the aircraft carrier battle group 
independence had left the gulf area after being replaced by the 
carrier uss midway the spokesman said he could not comment on 
where the independence was headed navy officials have said it is 
due back in the united states before christmas 
the marine reserve callup appeared to indicate that gen al 
gray the marine commandant is preparing the first stage of a 
troop rotation to relieve the expeditionary force that has been 
stationed in the gulf since shortly after iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 about 45000 marines are in the gulf area 
lt col stuart wagner a pentagon spokesman said the marine 
reserves would be assigned to the 5th marine expeditionary brigade 
at camp pendleton calif he said he could not comment on whether 
they eventually would deploy to the gulf 
gen john r dailey the deputy commandant said in an interview 
monday that the marines have prepared about 55000 regular marines 
for possible deployment to the gulf area he said no decision had 
been made on whether any or all of those would be used to increase 
the force in the gulf or to rotate there as replacements 
the callup of marine reserves while not significantly 
increasing us combat capability in the gulf marks an important 
departure for the pentagon it opens the way to possible use of 
major army reserve combat units in desert shield 
williams denied published reports that the pentagon has decided 
to activate major army combat reserve units he said defense 
secretary dick cheney had not yet granted the army the necessary 
authority to order combat reserves to active duty 
that is an option well certainly consider but no decision 
has been made williams said 
the spokesman suggested for the first time that cheney was 
uncertain whether major combat units from the army reserves are 
properly prepared for battle in the persian gulf 
its something of an untested question williams said he 
indicated that any army combat reserves called to active duty would 
be given extra training in desert warfare at the armys national 
training center at fort irwin calif and their readiness then 
evaluated before deciding to send them to the gulf 
you dont want to send anyone there until you have full faith 
and confidence in a tested environment in their ability to 
defend themselves williams said 
all of the more than 34000 army air force navy coast guard 
and marine corps reserves called to active duty for desert shield 
prior to tuesdays marine announcement are performing noncombat 
roles such as medical services and water purification 
the marine reserve callup includes 824 personnel of which 633 
are from units with combat functions although all 824 will be part 
of a marine airground task force that itself is a combat unit 
those not counted by the marines as combat forces include 
translators interrogators truck drivers and military police 
all reserves called to active duty so far are on 90day tours 
williams said cheney has asked president bush to grant him the 
authority to extend those tours by an additional 90 days

supporters of the slain rabbi meir kahane 
shouted death to the arabs on tuesday and israeli reports 
said police suspected a jewish extremist already had retaliated by 
killing two elderly palestinians 
the day brought a second tragedy for kahanes wife libby when 
her father died after a long illness rabbi yacov blum had been 
unconscious and did not know of his soninlaws death 
police and army reinforcements were deployed around israel and 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to prevent violence but 
the increased security came too late to save two palestinians 
killed at about 6 am tuesday about two hours after kahane was 
slain in new york city 
israeli police said they suspected an israeli radical killed the 
palestinians and that the slayings may have been prompted by 
kahanes murder the national itim news agency reported 
israel television said police received warnings of death threats 
against israeli arab members of parliament and palestinian leaders 
in the occupied territories 
kahane was slain in new york monday night by a gunman believed 
to be of arab descent israel army radio said the man identifiedby police 
as el sayed a noseir 34 formerly lived in the occupied 
terrritories 
palestinians in israel said the name as given by police was not 
typical and might be said nasser or nasser elsaid 
the 58yearold kahane a former member of parliament and 
founder of the rightwing kach movement advocated the expulsion of 
all arabs from israeliheld territory 
the israeli foreign ministry said kahanes assassination was 
an unprecedented assault on an israeli political figure on 
american soil and urged the united states to increase security 
against terrorism 
state department spokesman richard boucher called the killing 
a despicable and cowardly act asked about a possible vendetta 
by kahane supporters he said we dont see this as a time for 
revenge now is the time for restraint 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar also decried 
kahanes killing and violence in the occupied territories he 
deplores these and all acts of violence said a spokeswoman 
nadia younes 
several israeli leaders linked kahanes murder to his 
controversial views 
faisal hussein a palestine liberation organization supporter in 
jerusalem appealed for calm saying violence and calling for 
violence will lead nowhere 
he said tuesdays killings in the west bank raised concerns 
about the security of our people 
at least two israeli arab members of parliament abdel wahab 
daroushe and mohammed miari left jerusalem for their homes in 
northern israel for fear of reprisals daroushe said police told 
him of the threats 
tuesdays parliament session began with a minute of silence for 
kahane but only about 30 of the 120 lawmakers were present 
kahane supporters warned of possible revenge attacks 
noam federman a kahane spokesman declined to say if the kach 
movement was behind killings of the two palestinians on tuesday 
but he told israel television that i dont rule out that after 
the murder of rabbi kahane jews will rise up and will honor his 
memory and will attack arabs 
david ben dor a kach leader told a news conference at kachs 
jerusalem headquarters that kahanes ideas will survive 
whoever thinks that today rabbi kahane and the kach movement 
have been destroyed has made a great mistake ben dor said 
he spoke beside kach flags their yellow fields centered by a 
black jewish star and a clenched fist about 50 supporters milled 
about some shouting death to the arabs 
the crowd was hostile to journalists at one point throwing 
chairs at reporters an israeli television crewman was beaten by 
kach supporters and one sprayed tear gas in his face he was 
hospitalized 
villagers said the killings in the west bank village of lubban 
sharqiya near nablus occurred at about 6 am they said a man 
wearing civilian clothes drove into the village in a white car 
bearing israeli license plates 
the man stopped and opened fire with a uzi submachine gun the 
villagers said killing mohammed alkhatib 65 who was riding his 
donkey to harvest olives from his grove the gunman then drove on 
stopping a second time to kill miriam khassan 60 outside her 
house the villagers said 
israel radio police reporter moshe nussbaum said that before 
news of the west bank killings was broadcast an anonymous caller 
speaking hebrew told him to check in one of the villages near 
nablus two arabs were killed there 
the deaths raised to 773 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians in the nearly 35month palestinian 
uprising an additional 294 palestinians have been killed by fellow 
arabs fiftyone israelis have died in the violence

meir kahane preached that for jews to survive 
they had to change the worlds perception of the jew as patsy a 
passive victim 
to this end he launched the jewish defense league in new york 
1968 and led it in sometimes violent highvisibility 
confrontations against antisemitism 
most jewish organizations condemned his philosophy and tactics 
the jdl picketed and created disturbances at performances of 
soviet singers and dancers during the days moscow blocked jewish 
emigration the young militants staged sitins at the offices of 
columbia artists management which booked the tours of soviet 
companies 
then came a darker escalation jdl members were convicted of 
bombings of the offices of amtorg the soviet trading company in 
1971 and sol hurok another booker of russian talent in 1972 a 
secretary died in the hurok bombing 
jdl members also admitted planting dynamite at the soviet 
diplomatic residence at glen cove on long island in 1971 
while he was arrested many times on charges relating to 
disorderly protests kahane never was convicted of personally 
participating in a bombing 
in july 1971 two months before he moved to israel kahane was 
given a fiveyear suspended sentence and fined 5000 on a federal 
conviction of conspiring to manufacture explosives 
judge jack b weinstein sentencing kahane and two teenage 
members of the jdl admonished that it is not permissible to 
substitute the bomb for the book as the symbol of jewish manhood 
he ordered kahane to have nothing more to do with guns or bombs 
but kahane jubilant at having avoided prison told reporters 
outside the courtroom that he planned to buy rifles for all his 
followers for self defense and proclaimed the motto every jew a 
22 
news organizations during those days frequently received 
anonymous calls claiming responsibility for violent acts against 
perceived antisemitism the callers would sign off with the jdl 
slogan never again a reference to jews dying in the 
holocaust 
official spokesmen for the jdl however had a formula comment 
in which they denied the deed but said the jdl sympathized with the 
motive 
a decade later during one of his frequent visits from israel 
kahane told a washington reporter we bombed the russian mission 
in new york the russian cultural mission here the soviet trade 
offices 
he said the bombs put soviet jews on page 1 our violence was 
a very wellthoughtout political movement he said 
going against the grain was part of kahanes nature 
kahane son and grandson of rabbis from what is now israel was 
born aug 1 1932 and raised in flatbush in the home of the 
brooklyn dodgers the young kahane rooted for the new york yankees 
he said growing up as a yeshiva student in a mixed neighborhood 
meant i had fights regularly over my yarmulke skull cap and 
then afterwards id drink beer with them once you did it it 
was over once you fight and you get bloodied if you bloody back 
then youre ok 
the slaughter of europes jews during world war ii was always in 
the forefront of his thoughts but he accused mainstream jews of 
forgetting the lesson 
to turn the other cheek is not a jewish concept he insisted 
when organizing the jdl do not listen to the soothing anesthesia 
of the establishment they walk in the paths of those whose 
timidity helped to bury our brothers and sisters less than 30 years 
ago 
he said in an interview in 1971 id rather be respected 
feared and safe than loved with eulogies 
to counter the view of jews as patsies he ran an ad in the new 
york times with a photo of armed young members and a caption is 
this any way for nice jewish boys to behave the text of the ad 
said it was 
kahane claimed membership of 14000 unsympathetic observers 
conceded that kahanes message had appeal to high school and 
college youths but maintained actual membership was only in the 
hundreds

president bush awaited midterm election 
results in the privacy of the white house on tuesday choosing to 
remain on the sidelines after campaigning extensively for scores of 
republican candidates 
ending a sixday political trip bush and his wife barbara 
returned in early afternoon after voting in houston their dopted 
home city 
the first couple voted at a polling place in a nursing home on 
the west side of houston a few blocks from the houstonian hotel 
where a suite of rooms serves as the bushes legal voting 
residence 
asked by reporters as he was waiting on line to vote if he cared 
to make a prediction bush said good way to go to jail 
theyre trying to get you arrested mrs bush joked to her 
husband 
politicking is prohibited in polling places 
however bushs chief of staff john sununu whose abrasive 
tactics in dealing with congress are blamed by some white house 
staffers for contributing to bushs decline in popularity had no 
hesitancy in discussing politics 
sununu said he was sticking with his prediction made on a 
television talk show on sunday that republicans would lose no more 
than one senate seat and between four and 12 house seats 
while some republicans distanced themselves from bush for his 
wavering stand on budget and tax issues sununu defended the 
campaign support provided by the white house 
the motivation factor the energizing the campaign those are 
all pluses sununu said 
you cant make a winning campaign out of a campaign that 
couldnt win anyway and you cant cause a campaign thats on a 
landslide to lose but what you can do is help in those marginal 
races and thats what if youre doing it right you focus on 
he added 
over the past year and a half bush attended 115 campaign events 
in 35 states and raised nearly 90 million for republicans for the 
last two weeks he has been campaigning virtually nonstop 
however he saw his popularity and his appeal as a campaigner 
to other republicans drop sharply in october because of the 
budget debacle 
sununu suggested bush had decided against making any public 
statements on politics on election day 
after voting bush again ignored reporters questions and 
quickly stepped into his limousine i dont want them to get me 
for loitering so ill go on he said

a navy warship intercepted and diverted from 
the northern red sea a germanflagged cargo ship carrying chemicals 
not listed on the ships manifest the pentagon said tuesday 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said he did not know what kind 
of chemicals were aboard the red sea europa when it was diverted 
last friday by the crew of the cruiser uss biddle 
the pentagon said it could not say where the cargo ship had come 
from or where it was headed 
the presence of a shipment of chemicals in the vicinity of iraq 
is especially sensitive because of international concerns about 
iraqs chemical warfare capabilities 
rabbi abraham cooper associate dean at the simon wiesenthal 
center in los angeles said his group was alarmed at the disclosure 
of a germanflagged ship carrying undocumented chemicals in the red 
sea 
he said us authorities should be investigating the incident in 
view of evidence that german companies in the past have supplied 
iraq with chemicals used to manufacture chemical weapons 
the biddle is part of a multinational naval force in the red sea 
and persian gulf area that is enforcing the un trade embargo 
against iraq commercial ships carrying goods to iraq in violation 
of the embargo or whose cargo includes items not listed on the 
ships manifest are routinely forced to divert 
williams said the diversion of the red sea europa was the 16th 
since the embargo was put in place last august following iraqs 
invasion of kuwait

as americans voted at home on 
tuesday the us army was practicing war games the marines were 
testing night vision goggles the navy was enforcing trade 
sanctions on iraq and the air force was flying sorties along the 
kuwaiti border 
in other words it was just another day in saudi arabia 
true army spec everett thornton 22 of alexandria la 
discussed the senatorial race in north carolina over breakfast and 
army maj steve fernell 38 of kansas city mo remembered seeing 
a picture of dianne feinstein the democratic candidate for 
governor of california 
but for most servicemen in operation desert shield squared off 
against iraqi president saddam husseins forces it was just 
tuesday not election day and that meant more training to prepare 
in case of war 
elements of the armys 82nd airborne division the first 
american unit to arrive in saudi arabia following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait took to the firing range for drills with 
machine guns rifles shotguns grenades antitank rockets and 
trench warfare 
at one air base us f15 fighters took off in pairs heading 
north toward the kuwaiti border and at a saudi port small us 
coast guard patrol boats were enforcing security 
i did not realize it was election day said capt michael 
wills 27 of wapakoneta ohio with the armys 12th aviation 
brigade who was on the tarmac at an airbase there are a lot of 
other things to talk about here 
the main topic he said is probably the man across the 
border 
the consensus 
hes crazy 
army lt kevin klutz said he had no idea that it was election 
day were more concerned about the mission here 
the military distributed about 100000 applications for absentee 
ballots among the 220000 us troops in the gulf and a handful of 
gis voted by fax servicemen could also send away for their own 
ballots 
the judge advocates office in the army forces central command 
which ran a threeweek get out the vote blitz had no figures 
on how many servicemen actually got absentee ballots and voted 
even on election day army staff sgt patrick jewell of santa 
barbara calif was hoping to vote 
they say were going to get the opportunity to vote we 
havent got the ballots yet but im sure we will he said 
some thought the elections would affect the policy toward the 
gulf others thought international pressure would be more 
important 
but enlisted men have never been avid voters 
said army pvt 1 scott lynch of downing town pa with the 82nd 
airborne its only senators and congressman and all of that so 
its really not that big a deal to us we have more important 
things to do definitely more important things to do

the angel island immigration station was 
dubbed the ellis island of the west but chinese immigrants 
detained there remember it more as a prison than a gateway to 
freedom 
the island was a land of fear not hope for the chinese who 
often gave false names and lied about their histories to escape the 
immigration center that closed 50 years ago monday 
the island marked another anniversary tuesday the 140th 
anniversary of its establishment as a military base 
today angel island is part of the golden gate national 
recreation area under the national park service the island three 
miles north of san francisco is the largest island in san 
francisco bay 
him mark lais father was among the first group of chinese 
processed at the station 
like of a lot of people my father had to lie about who he was 
and where he came from lai said monday he never talked about 
angel island i found out about it after his death when i was going 
through his papers 
the lies were necessary because strict immigration laws such as 
the chinese exclusion act of 1882 allowed entry from china only to 
merchants scholars tourists and children of us citizens 
chinese laborers and peasants with dreams of opportunity in 
america were barred 
the chinese exclusion act wasnt repealed until 1943 
lais father bing lai said he was born of a chineseamerican 
a story that couldnt be discredited since birth records were 
destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire in san francisco 
bing lai who died in 1976 also dropped his real surname mark 
i guess he always had a fear that he would be caught and 
discovered by immigration and then sent back to china said him 
mark lai coauthor of a book about angel island 
some 175000 chinese who came to the united states between 1910 
and 1940 spent time on angel island 
the station was closed in 1940 after a fire that destroyed part 
of the twostory wooden buildings that housed as many as 300 
chinese immigrants at a time 
the buildings which are being restored also carry evidence of 
the frustration some immigrants felt on the island riots sometimes 
broke out to protest the food quality and confined quarters 
this place is called an island of immortals one anonymous 
poet wrote but as a matter of fact the mountain wilderness is a 
prison the bird plunges in even though it sees the open net 
because of poverty one can do naught else 
john yeehall chin who was 16 years old when he arrived at angel 
island said his first month in america was disheartening but he 
was glad to escape the poverty of his life in china 
they told me america was wealthy beautiful a wonderful 
country but when i came here i was alone on the island and i was 
scared all the time until i knew they would let me go said chin 
82 of san francisco 
chins immigration application was accepted after authorities 
questioned him for three hours a routine interrogation that could 
result in deportation if immigrants gave the wrong answers 
i remember i got out one week before the fourth of july 
chin said i jumped up and down and went to a chineseamerican 
picnic i was very happy it was worth the pain

portauprince haiti ap leading haitians on tuesday 
welcomed the announcement that people linked to a brutal 
dictatorship were barred from the presidential race the move made 
a leftist priest the frontrunner 
the electoral council on monday night disqualified 10 of the 26 
declared presidential candidates from running in the dec 16 
general election the ruling had been expected 
the council said the 10 failed to comply with filing procedures 
and were barred based on technicalities under the election law 
they included claude raymond and dr roger lafontant two 
officials of the oppressive duvalier family regime that ruled haiti 
for 29 years 
the council said lafontant wasnt cleared by the government 
auditing office on his handling of public funds while serving as 
minister of the interior and defense it also said he didnt 
provide a birth certificate 
raymond a former army chief of staff was disqualified because 
he didnt register until after the oct 21 filing deadline 
there was no immediate reaction from any of the disqualified 
candidates 
i foresee a relatively normal unfolding of the electoral 
process now said jeanclaude bajeux a human rights activist and 
leader of the congress of democratic movements a socialist party 
many haitians feared possible retaliation by duvalier supporters 
and they jammed stores monday night to stock on supplies there 
were no incidents as of tuesday afternoon 
when 12 duvalierists were barred from running for president in 
1987 dozens of people were killed on election day armed men in 
collusion with the army killed at least 34 voters 
raymond has been publicly accused of participating in that 
massacre he has never been charged 
lafontant ran the duvaliers private paramilitary militia the 
tonton macoutes who terrorized this poor caribbean nation of 6 
million people 
theres an outstanding arrest warrant charging lafontant with 
conspiring against national security but it has never been served 
the duvalier dictatorship ended in february 1986 when 
jeanclaude duvalier son of the late francois papa doc 
duvalier fled to exile in france 
but political turmoil and violence have continued despite 
duvaliers fall the interim government of president ertha 
pascaltrouillot appointed in march is the fifth since duvalier 
was ousted 
although other major candidates qualified none appears to have 
the pull of the rev jean bertrand aristide an oustpoken critic of 
haitis dictatorships 
he has stirred the impoverished masses from the pulpit with 
impassioned sermons in 1988 the roman catholic salesian order 
dismissed him from the order alleging his sermons provoked 
violence 
his surprise candidacy appeared aimed at stopping duvalierists 
and was announced under the slogan operation torrent to block 
the path of macoutes 
dr louis roy head of the council of state that rules alongside 
the provisional government said aristides campaign may lose 
momentum with lafontants disqualification 
but he remains the leading contender because he enjoys the 
backing of the impoverished masses roy added his candidacy 
upset everyones calculations and he cannot be gotten around 
other major candidates who qualified were marc bazin a former 
world bank official silvio claude a former preacher and louis 
dejoie jr a businessman 
it was expected the electoral council would disqualify 
duvalierists from running based on the 1987 constitution which 
bars criminal supporters of past dictators from running for office 
until 1997 
the election campaign officially opens wednesday and closes dec 
14 
about 800 observers from the united nations and the organization 
of american states will monitor the vote

bishop cahal b daly a fierce 
critic of the ira and other guerrilla groups was appointed roman 
catholic primate of ireland on tuesday and said he will continue 
his outspoken campaign for peace in his native northern ireland 
pope john paul ii named daly as spiritual leader of 37 million 
catholics in ireland and northern ireland daly succeeds tomas o 
fiaich who died in may as the archbishop of armagh and primate of 
allireland 
my continuing concern will obviously be to work for an end to 
the violence which has afflicted both our communities for two 
disastrous decades daly told a news conference shortly after the 
announcement 
refusing to give in to discouragement or to despair we must 
continue to believe in peace to pray for peace to speak peace to 
make peace by being ourselves men and women of peace 
as the voice of the catholic church in belfast as bishop of 
down and connor daly has been a vigorous advocate for the catholic 
minority in the north but a foe of the irish republican army 
the ira daly said two years ago is a question of sheer evil 
and we have got to face that evil and have no truck with it 
supporters of the ira which is rooted in the catholic 
community regard daly as an apologist for british rule the ira is 
waging a guerrilla war to drive the british from 
protestantdominated northern ireland and merge the province with 
the irish republic 
irelands anglican primate robin eames said he had the highest 
respect for dalys intellectual gifts his courage and 
integrity 
peter brooke the highestranking british official in northern 
ireland said daly was respected for his resolute condemnation of 
violence his concern for individual wellbeing and his 
longstanding efforts to bring about reconciliation 
at 73 daly is the oldest prelate appointed to the armagh post 
in 170 years he must submit his resignation when he turns 75 the 
normal retirement age for bishop although the pope need not accept 
it immediately 
he is the 114th successor to st patrick dalys last six 
predecessors were made cardinals 
daly enthusiastically joined in ecumenical ventures with 
anglican and presbyterian leaders in northern ireland but he also 
vigorously defended catholic schools against those who criticized 
them as perpetuating old divisions 
he was a defender of faith in a land where religions often are 
badges of lethal political differences 
in his letter to a northern protestant published in 1979 
daly wrote 
irish catholics and irish protestants can and must help one 
another to stay faithful to christ in a world where more and more 
people walk away from him in that world it is imbecilic to 
suppose that protestantism would gain through catholicisms loss 
or vice versa only postchristian secularism and materialism 
will flourish if either of our faithcommunities declines 
born in 1917 in loughguile north of belfast daly was ordained 
in 1941 he earned a doctorate in divinity and did postgraduate 
work in philosophy at the sorbonne and the college de france 
from 194667 he lectured on scholastic philosophy at queens 
university in belfast then was appointed bishop of ardagh and 
clonmacnois in central ireland 
daly suffered a heart attack in 1982 but recovered and was 
appointed that year as bishop of down and connor 
books he has written include violence in ireland and christian 
conscience and justice the work of peace

the 12nation european community on 
tuesday approved a plan for moderate reductions in farm subsidies 
resolving an impasse that had threatened to scuttle next months 
world trade talks 
the proposal calls for trimming government payments on major 
farm crops by 30 percent over 10 years starting in 1986 some cuts 
have already been made 
the community had failed to agree in six previous attempts 
the plan now will be presented to negotiators in the uruguay 
round talks an ambitious fouryear effort by about 100 nations to 
overhaul the world trading system those talks are being held under 
the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum 
that advocates freer world trade 
after two days of bargaining the european trading blocs 
agriculture and trade ministers endorsed a carefully worded 
proposal that sought to ease fears of some governments that the 
reductions would badly hurt their farmers 
french agriculture minister louis mermaz who had been holding 
up the agreement described the outcome as excellent 
mermaz said the proposal will enable the european comunity to 
start the negotiations with a united front with an excessively 
dynamic position 
the community is the last major player to put its offer on the 
bargaining table having missed an oct 15 deadline for submitting 
positions for the final round of negotiations which will begin in 
less than a month 
it was unlikely though that the offer would be warmly received 
by the united states and other nations which have demanded much 
greater reductions in the communitys costly farm support programs 
the bush administration wants its trading partners to slash farm 
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent 
over a 10year period starting in 1991 
but italian trade minister renato ruggiero cautioned tuesday 
it would be a grave error on the part of our trading partners to 
judge that this position is not one of great openness and 
ambition 
france and germany had held up the agreement by insisting on 
guarantees that the cuts would not be too severe 
in the end the ministers adopted a list of assurances that 
promised not only to compensate farmers for income losses but to 
make sure that cheaper imported goods would not push homegrown 
products off the market 
it also pledges to limit the impact of the reductions on poor 
regions in the community and to soften proposed cuts in supports 
for olive oil and other products grown in mediterranean countries 
after long negotiations we got very good improvements said 
german agriculture minister ignaz kiechle 
mermaz said we have to look the americans straight in the 
face we are not going to buy from them what we make ourselves 
frans andriessen the communitys top trade official conceded 
that some of the guarantees adopted by the ministers will not 
make it easier to negotiate but at least we are in a position to 
start 
agriculture is one of 15 areas under discussion in the world 
trade negotiations which began in 1986 in the uruguayan resort of 
punta del este 
the final week of bargaining which is to end the round opens 
dec 3 in brussels 
the united states is among nations insisting however that 
agriculture holds the key to liberalizing trade in other areas 
including textiles manufactured goods and services such as 
telecommunications and banking argentina threatened to walk out of 
the round if deep cuts are not made in farm subsidies

truffles the ugly fungi prized as a 
delicacy by gourmands have been tainted by a fraud scandal 
authorities on tuesday said four companies that handle the bulk 
of truffle sales in france have been implicated in a scheme to 
defraud wholesale buyers 
the culprits allegedly used walnut juice to stain lightcolored 
summer truffles so they appeared to be the more coveted and more 
expensive dark winter truffles 
the case has been turned over to prosecutors in the southern 
town of carpentras after an investigation by a government consumer 
fraud agency 
summer truffles sell for about 36 per pound compared to 164 
per pound for winter truffles the fraud allegedly involved several 
tons of truffles 
truffles grow just under the surface of the soil they can be 
found by a person using a stick but more commonly pigs or trained 
hounds are used to sniff them out

united press international laid off more 
emloyees tuesday a day after company officials said the news 
service faced liquidation unless remaining workers accepted a 
90day pay cut of 35 percent 
there have been some further dismissals in various departments 
of upi said spokesman milt capps they were in various places 
throughout the system these dismissals have been effected over the 
past couple of weeks some of those as late as today 
he declined to give numbers 
upi officials on monday said the 83yearold news service will 
have to be liquidated nov 16 unless employees represented by the 
wire service guild accept 90day salary cuts managers and other 
nonguild workers already have been told they must accept similar 
cuts 
company officials said pay concessions by the unioncovered 
employees would provide the news service more time to seek a buyer 
although pieter vanbennekom upi executive vice president 
cautioned that approval of the pay cut would not guarantee upi 
will be successfully sold

tens of thousands of high school students around 
france poured into the streets tuesday a day after 130000 youths 
joined nationwide marches to demand better education and improved 
security on campus 
the largest protests tuesday involved 8000 students in 
besancon 6000 in toulouse and 4000 each in reims and vannes 
police reported there were smaller marches in marseille nancy 
metz belfort dijon nevers and mulhouse 
no violence or arrests were reported although a police officer 
directing traffic away from the march in marseille suffered minor 
injuries when accidentally struck by a car 
two police unions representing 35 percent of the uniformed 
officers denounced orders issued to riot police monday in paris to 
avoid confrontations with protesters 
scores of youths went on a rampage along the march route 
wrecking businesses and hurling projectiles that injured 13 people 
including five policemen police made several arrests but 
generally avoided using force 
one union statement said policemen were scandalized by the 
passive attitude of public officials and warned that 
troublemakers would be encouraged to take advantage of police 
restraint 
its unacceptable that those in charge of the security of 
citizens including the demonstrators should transform the police 
into mere bystanders said another union statement 
protests have spread nationwide since starting three weeks ago 
in the lowincome suburbs north of paris where a student was raped 
in a school lavatory and several teachers and students were 
assaulted 
the students are demanding more teachers repairs to crumbling 
high schools and more security guards on crimeridden campuses in 
ghetto neighborhoods 
students around the country marched monday as the national 
assembly debated the socialist governments proposal to increase 
education spending by 9 percent to the equivalent of 49 billion 
student leaders have criticized this as inadequate although it 
outpaces the overall budget increase of 48 percent 
education minister lionel jospin managed to have assembly debate 
delayed until next week while he pursues dialogue with the student 
movement which is split into moderate and hardline leftist 
factions 
conservative opposition parties proposed tuesday that the 
socialist government sell off stateowned industries to finance 
school renovations

kuwait accused jordan on tuesday of 
breaking un sanctions by trucking food across its border into 
iraq and asked it to stop 
mohammad abu alhassan kuwaits ambassador to the united 
nations warned jordan it could face the same sanctions as iraq if 
it failed to halt shipments of forbidden goods 
he told a news conference that sanctions are not working mainly 
because the iraqi government does not care for the suffering of 
its own people and is diverting all food and equipment to the 
army 
whatever iraq has now is sufficient to run the army for quite 
a long time he said 
the un security council is considering new resolutions 
including one that would impose economic sanctions on countries 
breaking sanctions on iraq hassan said 
kuwaiti refugees have reported seeing jordanian trucks loaded 
with food all over the captured emirate 
the ambassador said humanitarian food shipments are not barred 
but a mechanism exists for determining what food is being sent on a 
humanitarian basis 
this mechanism has not been followed by jordan in their 
supplying of food to iraq therefore whatever food is supplied to 
iraq it is in violation of security council resolution 661 
which authorized sanctions hassan said 
asked if other countries were violating the sanctions he said 
there were some violations by yemen shortly after the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and there has been some smuggling from 
iran that is not condoned by the iranian government 
he said the number of kuwaitis fleeing their homeland was 300 to 
350 on monday and is increasing because of iraqi atrocities and 
because the iraqis are giving food and gasoline only to iraqi 
citizens 
no kuwaiti wants to become an iraqi he said 
the ambassador said kuwaiti students are undergoing military 
training in the united states britain egypt saudi arabia and the 
persian gulf states because they want to participate in the honor 
of liberating their country 
he said he had no exact figures on how many were being trained

americans held at strategic targets in iraq 
will be able to send messages and receive care packages under an 
agreement announced tuesday by the red cross 
the first phase of the program involves message exchanges 
between the 106 hostages and their families said stephen richards 
the red cross executive vice president 
after a cycle of messages has been completed the red cross 
working with its sister organization the iraqi red crescent will 
arrange for the shipment of packages including such items as drugs 
food clothing paperback books and toiletries 
some hostages and their families have been able to communicate 
through letters shipped in and out of iraq by the state department 
which is serving as a clearing house in addition iraq has allowed 
a few hostages to telephone home 
the red cross agreement only covers the men at strategic sites 
not all the americans held against their will in iraq and kuwait 
he said 
richards who just returned from baghdad said the red cross is 
also seeking permission to have a medical team visit the hostages 
to check on their physical and mental condition 
the red cross a neutral agency has not been involved in 
efforts to gain the release of the hostages which richards called 
a governmental responsibility 
the united states has demanded the hostages unconditional 
release 
representatives of the iraqi red crescent say the hostages are 
faring adequately richards said 
they felt their general health and nutrition were 
satisfactory he said but their psychological wellbeing would 
be substantially improved were they able to send regular messages 
to and from their families 
the state department welcomed the red cross agreement saying 
it would make the hostages lives easier 
on monday department spokesman richard boucher said reports 
from iraq are that many detainees are losing weight eating poorly 
and are frequently cold as the winter approaches 
doris whatley of shreveport la said her husband donald is 
doing alright he is getting food even though what he gets is 
the same old thing 
mrs whatley has received several letters from her husband who 
is kept at a strategic site near baghdad the state department has 
passed 408 letters to hostages and has received 269 back for their 
friends and family 
he is optimistic that he is going to come home mrs whatley 
said of her husband 
the red cross message exchange program is expected to get under 
way in about 10 days each cycle will take about two weeks 
the hostages will be handed short forms to write messages those 
will be shipped to the united states through jordan by the red 
cross 
then the family members will be allowed to write responses 
which in turn will be delivered to the hostages the iraqi red 
crescent officials will serve as the couriers inside iraq

from his native brooklyn to the rockstrewn 
hills of the israelioccupied west bank rabbi meir kahane preached 
a violent doctrine of jewish power 
in new york he railed at blacks and in israel he advocated the 
mass expulsion of the palestinians on monday in new york at age 
58 he was slain by an assassin police said was believed to be of 
arab descent 
kahane who founded the jewish defense league in new york was 
both revered and reviled in israel the establishment both liberal 
and conservative shunned him as a racist but his small band of 
followers worshiped him 
a prophet has died kahane aide herbert sunshine said at the 
jerusalem headquarters of the rabbis antiarab kach movement 
kahane was an advocate of racial discrimination and 
apartheid said palestinian saeed kanan he became a victim of 
his own slogans and mottos 
the bearded blackhaired rabbi made his name with brutal 
hottempered rhetoric 
american blacks were guilty of jew hatred he said arabs were 
dogs jews who ignored this were lemmings another holocaust was 
imminent he declared and made his symbol a clenched fist under 
the slogan never again 
although a relatively small number of israelis supported kahane 
in elections in private conversations many would agree with his 
views his message of jewish force struck a sympathetic chord in 
the country founded largely in response to the holocaust and 
surrounded by arab enemies even a recent poll conducted among 
soviet immigrants who just arrived in israel showed that 98 
percent of them were ready to vote for kahane 
asked how he would expel arabs from israel he replied 
picture arabs putting on the radio one morning and hearing the 
new minister of defense is meir kahane when they hear that 
theyll pack themselves 
the notion of becoming israels defense minister was pure 
fantasy in three runs for election he got into israels 
parliament only once by himself and was finally barred from 
running in 1988 because of his blunt antiarab racism 
kahane founded the militant jewish defense league to protect 
elderly jews against muggers but it was later accused of planting 
bombs in a terrorist campaign against arabs and soviets 
he was born martin david kahane on aug 1 1932 the son of a 
rabbi in brooklyns flatbush section and took the hebrew name meir 
when he became a rabbi 
he grew up during judaisms most dreadful years the full 
horrors of the nazi holocaust were becoming known and a relative 
was shot to death by arabs in palestine 
at 15 kahane was arrested for throwing tomatoes at british 
foreign minister ernest bevin a foe of jewish statehood it was 
the first of his many arrests in the united states and israel 
kahane represented the undissipated anger at the holocaust 
there was no way that his anger and his fury could actually be 
expressed except through this way of seeing the jews as either 
vulnerable or fighting commented zev chafits an americanborn 
israeli writer 
in 1957 he won a law degree and an masters degree in 
international relations and was ordained a rabbi but he lost his 
first rabbinical post for enforcing orthodox jewish law too 
strictly on his queens congregation 
he became a sportswriter went to israel in 1962 and left 
defeated mocked for his arrogance and his stuttering efforts to 
learn hebrew 
journalist robert i friedman wrote in the biography the 
false prophet that kahane became an fbi informer infiltrating 
radical groups such as the john birch society even as he cruised 
new yorks east side bars 
friedman says that in 1966 a fashion model named estelle donna 
evans jumped from a bridge and died after kahane married with four 
children broke off their affair 
the new york times did an expose on the sensational aspects of 
kahanes career in 1971 at that time he was leading the jewish 
defense league heading marches against black politicians and white 
liberals whom he accused of pandering to blacks 
kahane soon widened his attacks to include the soviet union for 
its treatment of jews rightwing israeli politician geula cohen 
says she urged him to take up the cudgel against the soviets and 
friedman says that yitzhak shamir now israels prime minister 
also encouraged kahanes antisoviet radicalism 
kahane moved to israel in 1971 to a circumspect welcome from 
the right wing mrs cohen says she told him that here we have 
the israeli army and we dont need you to deal with the arabs 
on the one hand he was a foreign implantation he didnt 
acclimatize he didnt have roots in the political zionist sense 
he didnt fit in mrs cohen said 
on the other hand kahane articulated the gut feelings many 
israelis fear to say aloud fear of the arabs a sense of 
isolation a yearning for quick clearcut solutions 
kahanes message the one that got him elected in 1984 seemed 
simple enough to some i want to remove the arabs including 
israeli arabs from the entire land of israel 
this meant expelling not only the 17 million palestinians but 
israels 800000 arab citizens 
this plus the kach movements thuggish tactics proved too much 
even for the hardliners in 1988 kahanes candidacy was 
disqualified under a specially enacted law against advocating 
racism 
the rabbi took his antiarab campaign to the streets an attack 
against jews would bring out his followers carrying kahane on 
their shoulders and shouting death to the arabs 
thousands would join his hardcore supporters at kach marches 
either out of conviction or curiosity 
during such a march in july 1989 after a palestinian killed 
16 jews by steering a bus off a highway kahane had his final 
runin with israels establishment 
for calling arabs a cancer spreading in our midst he was 
arrested and charged with sedition at his death the case still 
awaited a decision in the courts

the white house held up an announcement about 
a proposed historic site in vancouver wash to hurt the 
reelection chances of democratic rep jolene unsoeld her campaign 
charged tuesday 
unsoeld a freshman democrat targeted for defeat by the 
republicans won passage of the measure before congress adjourned 
late last month 
the white house press office finally confirmed at 5 pm est 
tuesday that the president had signed the measure 
unsoelds campaign was upset by the failure of the white house 
to announce whether president bush had signed or vetoed legislation 
that would have authorized an 18month study of a proposed historic 
reserve chronicling the birthplace of the pacific northwest 
we suspected they would hold it to the last minute but 
holding it past the deadline is a little ridiculous this appears 
patently political said dan evans unsoelds chief of staff 
the practical effect of their nonannouncement is to deny 
jolene an accomplishment story evans said 
david kalbaugh assistant to the executive clerk in the white 
house executive clerks office confirmed tuesday that bushs 
deadline for signing the bill expired at 1201 am 
unfortunately due to the presidents travel there has been no 
announcement kalbaugh said when the president returns there 
will be some sort of announcement from the white house press 
office 
bush returned to the white house tuesday afternoon 
evans said the bill had been on the presidents desk since oct 
24 
the bill will launch an 18month study into the feasibility of 
creating a 300acre fort vancouver national historical reserve on 
the banks of the columbia river across from portland ore 
vancouver and surrounding clark county were viewed as a critical 
election battleground by both unsoeld and republican bob williams 
the study calls for a fivemember commission to report to 
congress by 1992 with recommendations on establishing the reserve 
under management of the national park service 
the park service already operates a wooden replica of fort 
vancouver home to the original hudsons bay company trading post 
on the site 
the study would determine whether to add the vancouver barracks 
the newly restored officers row the columbia river waterfront and 
the pearson airpark the oldest continually operating airport in 
the nation

behind the flags and bunting and mechanized curtains in schools 
and churches and government buildings americans voted on tuesday 
then time and again they declared disgust with the government 
they were electing 
you have to kind of hold your nose and vote this time said 
john kirley a semiretired consultant voting in dallas his 
sentiments were widely shared by voters around the country 
from outward appearances the election was another page from a 
civics textbook voters streamed into a mennonite church gymnasium 
in fresno calif a recreation center in cape canaveral fla a 
housing project lobby in minneapolis a school cafeteria in new 
york city 
they punched computer cards and pulled oldfashioned cranks 
they participated in democracy 
but beneath the surface ran a disturbing streak of cynicism 
about the federal budget about the us involvement in the persian 
gulf and perhaps most sharply about the dismal state of political 
campaigns 
in northern michigans rural benzie county people filed into 
the benzonia township hall to cast their ballots exchange some 
small talk and sample township clerk pat meads orange twists and 
sticky buns 
precinct worker art fleetwood kept up a running banter about 
monday nights snow and this falls bow hunting season for deer 
anything but politics 
but when talk did turn to politics the people of benzie county 
were as disgusted as voters anywhere 
kick them all out one man said as he walked out the door 
start over his wife chimed in 
family physician bob camp looked over the sample ballot posted 
on the wall 
if there was a place on here for no one i would have voted 
a straight ticket he said i am thoroughly disgusted i am 
more than that i am one step beyond disgusted 
six hundred miles away in new york city wind blew leaves into 
swirls outside the brick school building where 5yearold emma 
rosenberg had just voted for the first time with some help from 
her mother debbie 
she voted for the environment said debbie rosenberg who 
had let emma pull the lever for a vote on new yorks environmental 
quality bond act 
it was thrilling for a 5yearold but her mothers smile 
vanished when she was asked if she was satisfied with the slate of 
candidates on the ballot 
no whos satisfied she said nobodys satisfied right 
now 
a few minutes later precinct worker tousette g sefman stepped 
outside for a cigarette as a black woman she said she felt 
especially obligated to exercise her right to vote but she too 
was disgusted with her government 
i think maybe a parliamentary system might be better ms 
sefman said 
turnout was heavy as usual at the cape canaveral recreation 
center where nearly half the voters are retired many of the 
others are employed at the kennedy space center or its offshoots in 
the aerospace industry 
the common theme throw the bums out 
theres nothing right today from the banks to the sampls to the 
war to the budget grumbled real estate agent john jones 54 
im going to do what i can to change it 
jones said he voted against the incumbents its the first 
time in my life i ever felt so strongly about it he said 
in braintree mass dr earl hoerner voted against the entire 
democratic state ticket which was heavily laden with incumbents 
throw the guys out he said as he left his polling booth 
further up the atlantic coast at cape elizabeth maine the mood 
of the voters was as foul as the weather rain fell in winddriven 
sheets outside cape elizabeth high school where equipment operator 
skip ingalls voted 
i watched the news last night and they described the nota 
none of the above ingalls said thats how i feel like voting 
in several instances 
these are the people who bothered to vote for every one of 
them there was at least one other qualified citizen who abandoned 
that right 
and there were a few rays of sunshine voters who still 
believed or who were too young to be jaded 
at evergreen state college in olympia wash students trickled 
into a polling station set up in the lobby of a lab building there 
were no signs of disillusionment among these voters still fresh to 
the power they wield in a democracy 
i havent lost faith yet said les bergsman 21 in his 
third year as a voting adult 
campus billboards were pasted with fliers proclaiming dont 
vote revolt the fliers declared that voting is a form of 
social suicide and urged a sort of militant apathy to show 
contempt for a corrupt government 
bergsman wasnt buying it government has its problems he said 
but that is what voting is for you do what you can to uncorrupt 
it bergsman said by not voting you support a corrupt system 
you leave it in the hands of those corrupt

democrats bid tuesday to fortify their majorities in congress 
and challenged republican control of four key governorships 
highlights of a midterm election punctuated by the autumn stirrings 
of voter discontent 
voters were still in line at the polling places in many states 
as the first returns came in they showed republican sen dan coats 
leading in indiana and sen mitch mcconnell ahead in kentucky a 
race where democrats had harbored hopes of an upset 
with 34 senate races on the ballot democrats took aim at 
republican incumbents jesse helms in north carolina mark hatfield 
in oregon and rudy boschwitz in minnesota in hopes of padding their 
current 5545 majority 
the house of representatives was securely in democratic control 
as it has been since the eisenhower era all 435 seats were on the 
ballot although most attention clustered around 29 races without 
an incumbent 18 of them currently in republican hands 
among 36 statehouse races republican governorships in 
california texas florida and illinois were at risk probably the 
biggest prizes of the year the gop hoped for victories that would 
protect their influence in drawing boundaries for house seats that

president zhelyu zhelev appealed for calm 
tuesday but students ignored his pleas to end a strike and workers 
threatened to cut off the gasoline supply if bulgarias government 
did not resign 
finance minister belcho belchev meanwhile said economic woes 
could topple the government of former communists now members of 
the renamed bulgarian socialist party 
prime minister andrei lukanov has had his hands tied by 
parliament which refuses to back his economic reforms last week 
he said he would resign if the 400seat legislature did not approve 
his program his socialists hold 211 seats and the main opposition 
group 144 
the 10000 workers at bulgarias main petrochemical plant 
threatened to strike thursday if lukanov does not quit the state 
bta news agency reported 
the strike at bourgas would halt the flow of already rationed 
gasoline and paralyze the country 
lukanov said after meeting plant management that the government 
would use all legal measures to ensure continued flow of fuel 
supplies bta said 
in a statement carried by the news agency the government said 
it would not yield to ultimatums but was open to dialogue 
belchev said price rises were imminent but that meager supplies 
were unlikely to improve bta said that will be the end of the 
government it quoted him as saying 
zhelev the former opposition leader appealed to students who 
occupied sofia university on monday to end their sitin strike his 
spokesman valentin stoyanov said on state radio the students 
refused 
bta said students also occupied the technical university in the 
pollutionplagued city of ruse on the romanian border and the 
medical academy in sofia 
it was not clear how many students were participating they are 
demanding the socialists accept blame for past communist mistakes 
and responsibility for the current crisis 
stoyanov said the students legitimate demands must be 
achieved with legitimate means 
such actions do not help the democratic process in bulgaria 
but destroy it because they create social tensions and unwarranted 
mistrust between the political forces stoyanov quoted zhelev as 
saying 
as the political forces are carrying out consultations on the 
formation of a new government it is very important that the 
citizens maintain peace and calm in the country 
the socialists reiterated tuesday they back a coalition 
government but vice chairman alexander tomov said it must 
reflect the realities in parliament 
lukanov heads an allsocialist government because the main 
opposition alliance the union of democratic forces refused to 
govern with the former communists 
on monday udfs floor leader in parliament stoyan ganev said 
his 17party alliance wanted to form a udfdominated government 
with the opposition holding the prime ministers office and key 
ministries

an experimental program that ties welfare 
benefits to teenagers school attendance has resumed after a judge 
lifted an order suspending it because poor attendance records 
caused unfair penalties 
we think it will be a better program and were upbeat said 
david blaska a spokesman with the state department of health and 
human services which oversees the learnfare program 
blaska added that the state would pursue an expansion of the 
program to younger children 
learnfare which docks the welfare benefits of families whose 
teenagers skip school was suspended in milwaukee county during 
the summer the court order suspending the program applied only to 
milwaukee county where the bulk of the program is carried out 
us district judge terence evans last week lifted the 
suspension he had earlier imposed after state and milwaukee school 
officials reached an agreement to ensure better attendance records 
would be kept 
the agreement includes the assignment of 16 workers to verify 
attendance of truants before penalties are imposed 
milwaukee is where the action is where so much is needed and 
the program is part of it blaska said getting the injunction 
lifted is a lift to our spirits 
the programs supporters claim learnfare discourages truancy and 
will help break the cycle of poverty critics say the experiment 
penalizes the poor 
among the safeguards state and school officials have added is a 
verification process that includes notices to all parents thy are 
told their childrens attendance is being monitored and that 
truancy can result in cuts in aid to families with dependent 
children benefits 
families will also be contacted by case managers to make sure 
the student is actually enrolled and to set up interviews to 
explain the sanctions before any penalties are imposed 
other provisions include 750000 in new state funds to create 
alternative education programs for milwaukee school dropouts 
i think its a monumental step toward remedying the situation 
of inaccurate information said willie little director of 
community relations for milwaukee public schools 
more than 13000 milwaukee county teenagers are subject to 
potential sanctions families of about 12 percent of the students 
had their payments docked in june the month before the program was 
suspended 
the program resumed immediately after the judges ruling but 
welfare benefits for violators wont be cut until february to allow 
time for the changes to be implemented blaska said 
state officials said they would pursue an expansion that would 
allow them to apply the sanctions to welfare families with children 
between ages 6 and 12 
the expansion would cost about 4 million a year and increase 
the number of students monitored statewide from 27000 to 70000 
blaska said the earliest it could be instituted is late 1991 he 
said 
the federal government has already granted the state permission 
to expand the program to elementary students and the wisconsin 
legislature is expected to consider it in january 
we hope to catch truancy before it becomes a chronic 
problem blaska said its also easier to implement when the 
child is younger and more amenable 
under the proposed expansion sanctions against families with 
children between ages 6 and 12 would be more lenient the families 
of violators would not be penalized if they agreed instead to 
attend regular counseling with case managers 
milwaukee public schools officials say they are uneasy about the 
expansion and fear it may become an unnecessary administrative 
headache since elementary schools have a 95 percent attendance 
rate 
wed have to evaluate the current program before we decided if 
we support the expansion of learnfare he said if its going 
to get kids in school and keep them in school then we would 
absolutely support it

the council of europe on tuesday admitted hungary as 
its first member from the former communist east bloc 
the council known for its human rights achievements is the 
oldest postworld war ii body promoting european cooperation 
it is certainly a great day for me and for all hungarians to 
be admitted into europe and the council of europe foreign 
minister geza jeszenszky of hungary told a news conference in the 
17thcentury barberini palace in central rome 
he said membership in the council of europe is an additional 
protection for the newborn democracy in hungary 
jeszenszky explained that if hungary did not maintain high human 
rights and democratic standards it would be forced to leave the 
41yearold council 
he spoke hours after he and council secretarygeneral catherine 
lalumiere signed documents admitting hungary and committing it to 
the councils human rights treaty 
when the time came hungary was bold enough to open a hole in 
the iron curtain ms lalumiere told council ministers gathered 
around the table in the giltedged room 
the leaders and indeed the people have contributed so much to 
bringing the division of europe to an end 
the ministers then watched on tv as the red white and green 
hungarian flag was raised along the other 23 members flags at the 
council of europe offices in strasbourg france 
czechoslovakia and poland are expected to join the council of 
europe soon like hungary they made a dramatic peaceful switch 
from communist dictatorship to democracy 
the soviet union yugoslavia and bulgaria have observer status 
and romania and albania may become observers soon 
tuesdays signing came at the start of a daylong meeting by 
council of europe foreign ministers 
during the session they invited the soviet union to sign the 
councils treaty on cultural exchanges they also condemned iraqs 
detention of hundreds of foreigners since its invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 
in a statement the ministers agreed that unity of action 
would present the best chances for the unconditional release of all 
the hostages the declaration was an implicit criticism of 
european politicians who have traveled to baghdad to win freedom 
for their fellow citizens 
the council of europe has produced 130 international treaties 
it is best known for the european human rights convention and 
european court of human rights whose rulings are binding on 
council members 
hungary applied for council membership a year ago when reform 
communists were still in power a government dominated by the 
centerright hungarian democratic forum was formed last summer 
after the first free multiparty elections in four decades 
the council is seeking to increase its influence in human rights 
issues and possibly develop a parliament bringing together the 
united states europe and the soviet union

one of those 25 people to have died in bekkersdal outside 
johannesburg occurred monday when a man was shot by soldiers 
police said the troops opened fire when the man came at them with a 
knife 
most of the deaths are believed linked to a feud between student 
groups who disagree on whether to boycott yearend standardized 
school exams many black students demand boycotts of the tests to 
protest conditions in black schools police say the violence began 
when those students tried to prevent others from taking the tests 
schools have been empty this week many workers have stayed 
home businesses have been closed and some families have fled the 
area in search of safety 
police patrolled the township tuesday following clashes the 
previous day that left seven people injured and houses in flames 
authorities said they confiscated two ak47 assault rifles from the 
house of a man who belongs to the pan africanist congress a black 
opposition group no new violence was reported tuesday and police 
did not have a breakdown for which days the deaths had occurred 
the yearend school tests determine whether students advance to 
the next grade or gain admission to universities last year 42 
percent of black high school seniors nationwide passed the final 
exam compared to a pass rate of more than 95 percent for white 
students many blacks blame the disparity on the whiteled 
government which spends about five times as much to educate a 
white pupil as a black pupil 
more than 800 blacks have died since august in factional 
fighting in the black townships around johannesburg most of the 
battles have been between supporters of the african national 
congress and the inkatha freedom party the two largest black 
opposition groups

iraq on tuesday promised to free 108 hostages none of them 
american and insisted anew its foreign guests are 
welltreated secretary of state james a baker iii pressed us 
allies about their willingness to go to war 
the baghdad government was keeping an eye on tuesdays midterm 
elections in the united states it claimed any slippage in 
republican support would reflect a lack of public support for 
president bushs persian gulf policies 
the american people will ask him why he is sending their 
sons to be killed in the arab desert and he will reap the fruits of 
his mistake said iraqi information minister latif jassim 
in the latest hostage releases iraqs official news agency said 
77 japanese nationals would be freed in response to an appeal from 
former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone it also said 20 
italians five swedes two germans two portuguese and two 
australians would be allowed to leave 
it did not say when the captives would be freed but some had 
already begun to assemble at a baghdad hotel 
they were among thousands of foreigners trapped when iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 some had been held at strategic sites as 
human shields against attack 
iraq has since freed hundreds of captives but western 
governments have expressed growing fears that iraqs saddam hussein 
is successfully using the hostages to divide the alliance facing 
him 
baker meanwhile was seeking to strengthen the antiiraq 
coalition he is in the mideast to assess support for stronger 
steps against iraq including a possible military strike 
he met tuesday in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
but there was no immediate word on the outcome egypt has sent 
thousands of troops to join the multinational force assembled in 
the gulf 
us troops make up the bulk of the force which numbers about 
300000 the pentagon said tuesday the us troop deployment in the 
region had reached 230000 and was still growing 
in a sign of the escalating us military commitment the marine 
corps said it was calling up more than 600 reservists from eight 
states for combat roles up until now the more than 34000 
reservists called to active duty have served in support roles 
while in egypt baker also met with chinas foreign minister 
qian qichen china is a permanent member of the un security 
council and its support would be needed for a unsanctioned 
military strike against saddam 
qian did not explicitly approve sending troops into action 
well still have to wait and see he said but us officials 
said on condition of anonymity that his comments were an indication 
at the very least the beijing government would not veto a un 
resolution to authorize the use of force to liberate kuwait 
plo chairman yasser arafat who has tried to act as a mediator 
in the gulf crisis said prospects for peace are improving as the 
world considers the consequences of an allout conflict 
war will be disastrous and catastrophic this is the worlds 
oil center just imagine what a disaster and a catastrophe it will 
be arafat told reporters in baghdad 
saudi arabias foreign minister however reminded iraq on 
tuesday that the united nations has not restricted the use of 
military force to liberate kuwait 
we would like a peaceful settlement but that option is in the 
hands of the iraqis said the foreign minister prince saud 
kuwait accused jordan of breaking un economic sanctions by 
trucking food across the border into iraq mohammad abu alhassan 
kuwaits ambassador to the united nations said at a news 
conference in dhahran saudi arabia that jordan it could face the 
same sanctions as iraq if it failed to halt shipments of forbidden 
goods 
at the united nations four nonaligned members of the security 
council drafted a plan calling for the simultaneous withdrawal of 
iraqi forces from kuwait and foreign military forces from the 
region the measure sponsored by colombia cuba malaysia and 
yemen was given little chance of passage 
iraqs freeing of its japanese hostages comes as japanese 
lawmakers are considering a plan to send troops to the gulf in 
noncombat roles however the measure has prompted strong protests 
in japan and its prospects for approval look dim japan said it had 
not altered its gulf policy in order to win the hostages freedom 
despite the european communitys disapproval of individual 
hostagefreeing missions such trips are becoming increasingly 
common 
former west german chancellor willy brandt met tuesday in 
baghdad with german hostages and was to meet saddam on wednesday 
former danish prime minister anker jorgensen arrived in jordan and 
planned to travel on to iraq when he obtained a visa and former 
new zealand prime minister david lange was reported en route to the 
gulf 
last weekend belgiums foreign minister mark eyskens 
criticized western pilgrims for courting saddam in an effort to 
free their citizens 
iraq has been expressing fears that the united states will use 
the hostages as a reason for a military strike on tuesday it 
offered its latest assurances that the guests as it calls the 
captives are being well treated 
the official iraqi news agency quoted an unidentifed trade 
ministry spokesman as saying the detained foreigners held are 
receiving the same supplies as iraqis 
a day earlier state department spokesman richard boucher had 
said reports indicated many detainees were losing weight and eating 
poorly 
also the red cross said iraqi officials have agreed to allow 
americans held at strategic sites to send messages home to their 
families

a strong earthquake struck west of the 
aleutian islands on tuesday there were no immediate reports of 
injuries or damage 
the quake which hit at 1114 am measured 69 on the richter 
scale said bob hammond of the alaska tsunami warning center in 
palmer 
it was centered about 150 miles west of attu island about 1250 
miles southwest of anchorage 
the earthquake was felt at shemya air force base near attu in 
the sparsely populated aleutian chain but was not large enough to 
generate a tidal wave also called a tsunami officials said 
moderate to strong earthquakes are commonplace throughout 
alaska 
the 1964 good friday earthquake centered in prince william 
sound measured 85 on the richter scale it generated large waves 
that devasted several coastal communities and killed 114 people as 
far south as oregon and hawaii 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 6 on richter scale can cause severe damage

the former governor of rhodesia sir 
humphrey gibbs who vigorously opposed the white minority 
governments declaration of independence has died his family said 
tuesday he was 87 
gibbs died monday from influenza complications family members 
said 
gibbs born in london settled in the former british colony as a 
farmer in 1928 
appointed governor by queen elizabeth ii in 1959 he served for 
10 years the last four as a recluse in government house after he 
tried unsuccessfully to fire the cabinet of prime minister ian d 
smith over the independence rebellion against the british crown 
gibbs steadfastly supported britains contention that the 1965 
declaration to entrench white rule was illegal 
smith retaliated by appointing his own representative to the 
queen ordered the media to stop referring to gibbs as governor and 
cut off electricity water and telephones to government house 
but smith did not eject the defiant governor evidently fearing 
retribution from britain if the rebellion failed 
the cabinet meanwhile continued to pledge loyalty to the 
british monarch until 1969 when it decided to transform rhodesia 
into a republic 
gibbs resigned his post returned briefly to a heros welcome in 
britain and then retired to his 6500acre farm in rhodesia where 
he lived alone 
smiths socalled officer administering the government clifford 
dupont moved into government house but was never recognized by the 
british government or the queen 
gibbs was a guest of honor when robert mugabe led rhodesia to 
independence as zimbabwe in 1980 after waging a sevenyear 
guerrilla war 
funeral arrangements were incomplete and a list of survivors was 
not immediately available

prime minister margaret thatcher on tuesday moved 
forward the annual vote for her conservative partys leadership 
giving her foes only eight days to mount a challenge to displace 
her as prime minister 
the sudden resignation thursday of deputy prime minister sir 
geoffrey howe underlined divisions within the governing party and 
prompted speculation that a challenger might try to oust mrs 
thatcher in the annual party election 
the leader of the conservatives the party with the majority in 
parliament automatically becomes prime minister under party 
rules the leadership election could have been held as late as dec 
5 four weeks after the opening of parliament 
but mrs thatcher on tuesday approved nov 8 as the date of the 
opening of nominations nov 15 for the closing of nominations and 
nov 20 as the election day sharply reducing the time for a 
challenge to be organized 
last year a challenge by sir anthony meyer who was thought to 
have no real chance to win was the first since mrs thatcher 
became party leader in 1975 meyer won 30 votes to mrs thatchers 
314 
mrs thatcher must call the next general election by mid1992 
in glasgow scotland the confederation of british industry the 
main employers organization warned earlier tuesday that the 
embattled government risked losing power through divisions over 
britains role in europe 
this conference has a message to our friends in the 
government directorgeneral john banham told the confederations 
annual meeting before it is too late remember what every 
single person in this hall knows a board that is divided is ripe 
for takeover 
the conservative party is funded largely by big business 
including members of the confederation 
her robust rejection at an oct 26 european community summit 
of plans for political and economic union has split the thatcher 
government which was already in deep economic trouble 
opinion polls indicate the government is 12 to 21 points behind 
the opposition labor party which is funded by labor unions and 
feared by big business 
banham whose organization reported last month that british 
industry is now in recession said failure to control inflation 
now running at 109 percent was the major disappointment of the 
1980s 
the confederation supports the british government idea of a 
european community currency and the 12 currencies of member states 
circulating simultaneously 
the idea has been rejected by the 11 other ec countries that 
agreed at the last summit to set up a single central bank by 1994 
and possibly introduce one currency by 1997 
we must be seen to be part of the new europe banham said in 
his keynote address isolation uld be a catastrophe for british 
business

the postal service delivered about fourfifths 
of overnight mail on time in its first test by an outside 
consultant a performance the postmaster general said tuesday earns 
the agency a low b 
mail intended for overnight delivery arrived on time 8061 
percent of the time during a threemonth test period that ended in 
midseptember the accounting firm of price waterhouse reported 
about as low a b as you can get thats how i would 
characterize it postmaster general anthony frank said following 
the monthly meeting of the services board of governors 
while the national rating was just over 80 percent performance 
varied widely from place to place with larger cities such as new 
york dragging down the average 
overnight delivery of mail destined for the big apple was on 
time just 4694 percent of the time the lowest share anywhere in 
the 50 states 
top rated for overnight mail was kansas city mo with 9406 
percent of overnight mail arriving on time 
in addition to the performance figures frank said that the 
postal rate increase scheduled for next year including a 30cent 
stamp is tentatively scheduled for feb 3 
while the recent budget settlement signed by president bush will 
cost the postal service 47 billion over five years frank said he 
hopes not to have to raise rates again until 1994 or 1995 
previously he had said he did not expect another rate hike until 
1996 but the cost of the budget settlement will mean more 
sooner as far as rates go he said 
price waterhouse conducted the delivery test by mailing 425000 
pieces of mail to 5000 recipients in 286 zip codes across the 
country the mail included letters post cards and large flat 
envelopes some with typed addresses and some hand written 
in addition to the 8061 percent performance for overnight mail 
7438 percent of items intended for second day delivery arrived on 
time and mail designated for threeday service was on time 8111 
percent of the time 
overnight second and threeday service depend on distance the 
mail has to travel 
a small share of mail took four five or more days to arrive 
an outcome that clearly annoyed the postmaster general 
maybe you can make a case for being a day late but you 
cant make one for being two three or four days late frank 
said promising an attack on that problem area 
the postal services southern region was tops in overnight 
delivery at 8402 percent on time followed by the eastern region 
at 8383 percent the west finished third at 8139 percent followed 
by the central region at 7962 percent and the northeast at 7112

a leading theologian from the 
dutch reformed church confessed to the sin of apartheid tuesday an 
unusual public statement from a member of the church that long 
supported the racist policy 
the statement made at a conference of south african church 
leaders was not an official church confession but the theologian 
willie jonker said he felt he could speak for himself as well as 
the dutch reformed church 
jonker went before conference delegates and said i confess 
before you and before the lord not only my sin and guilt and my 
personal responsibility and structural wrongs that have been done 
to many of you but vicariously i dare also to do that in the 
name of the dutch reformed church of which i am a member 
the dutch reformed church is the main church of the afrikaners 
the dutchdescended whites who dominate the government it has 
branches for whites blacks and people of mixed race and has been 
isolated in south africa for its support of segregation 
the black and mixedrace branches oppose apartheid the white 
branch has backed off its argument of past decades that the bible 
supports apartheid but it has not confessed to the sin of 
apartheid it also has not moved to merge with the other church 
branches 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu accepted jonkers confession 
the confession is not cheaply made and my response is not 
cheaply made he told applauding delegates 
nearly 300 delegates from about 90 churches are attending the 
conference at rustenburg 62 miles northwest of johannesburg the 
meeting has brought together churches long divided by apartheid 
that now hope to reach agreement on the role of the church in a 
future south africa 
two small churches that support apartheid the afrikaans 
protestant church and the reformed church declined to attend

the peacetime army is a healthy alternative to 
civilian life say military researchers who found that soldiers in 
1986 died at half the rate of their civilian counterparts 
but one professor says choosing a year of peace for such a study 
may obscure the realities of serving a nation that goes to war 
about once a decade 
army researchers compared death rates among all 781000 soldiers 
to civilian counterparts of the same age race and sex in 1986 
the study published in wednesdays journal of the american 
medical association did not give actual death rates however the 
lead researcher said in a telephone interview that soldiers overall 
died at a rate of 109 per 100000 while comparable civilians died 
at a rate of 215 per 100000 
the greatest disparity was for homicides almost six times less 
common among soldiers than civilians followed by smaller army 
rates of deaths cause by disease and suicide the researchers 
reported 
the most striking difference was among black men who died in 
homicides almost 12 times less often in the army than in the 
population at large the homicide rate among black soldiers was 9 
per 100000 compared with 100 per 100000 for black civilians 
said lead author joseph m rothberg a mathematician in military 
psychiatry at walter reed army institute of research 
women in the army who comprised 102 percent of soldiers died 
at 78 percent the rate of civilian women of the same age black 
women soldiers died at 39 percent the rate of comparable civilians 
but white women soldiers died at 139 percent the rate of white 
women civilians of the same age 
a large component of the elevated death rate among white army 
women was due to their suffering more than 2 times as many fatal 
accidents as civilian women the same age but the researchers could 
not say why 
there are a number of factors that determine the probability 
of death for any individual and theyre different for the army 
than for civilian life said rothberg 
most important is the screening of army volunteers who must 
have high school degrees and are healthy enough to pass a physical 
exam rothberg said in a telephone interview tuesday from bethesda 
md 
he also said the army provides housing food meaningful work 
and lots of fresh air and exercise it controls substance abuse 
and regulates firearms he said 
everybodys told how to live their life and how to stay 
healthy in civilian life its the individuals option he said 
sam sarkesian a political science professor at loyola 
university in chicago said he believed the study could give a 
skewed picture because it reflects peacetime mortality yet he 
noted weve been involved in a war virtually every 10 years 
since the end of world war ii 
even in nonwar years members of the military die violently 
such as in the 1983 beirut bombing when 237 marines were killed 
in the 1985 gander newfoundland airplane crash when 248 died 
and in the 1989 panama invasion when 23 lost their lives 
from 1945 on if youd put all those together and compare it 
to the equivalent in civilian life i think youd get a totally 
different picture sarkesian said 
but charles moskos a sociology professor at northwestern 
university in evanston said most of military life is peacetime 
a peace year is more normal than a war year 
still its a sad commentary on america when military service 
is healthier for black youths than civilian life said moskos 
head of an international group of 600 military social scientists

creation of a democratic system that would not need foreign forces 
to protect it 
the group called the national revolution and struggle front in 
the arab peninsula sent a fourpage manifesto by fax outlining its 
demands to the associated press in nicosia 
the group gave little information about itself it said only 
that it was based in the arab peninsula the line indicating where 
the fax originated was scratched out on every page 
the statements lack of specific detail and the wording of some 
of its demands indicated that it might be iraqi propaganda 
the group said the alsaud family which has ruled saudi arabia 
since king abdul aziz ibn saud unified the kingdom in 1932 should 
be replaced by a constitutional democracy and the country be 
renamed the arab peninsula 
citizens should be guaranteed the right to form trade unions and 
political organizations and there should be free speech and a free 
press the statement said none of these is allowed in saudi arabia 
now 
the statement demanded that foreign troops in saudi arabia be 
sent home and that the country pursue a policy of nonalignment 
more than 250000 troops most of them american have been sent to 
the country since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the group said it wanted to reinforce links with the arab world 
and give greater support to the palestinian cause 
the wealth from the saudi oil industry should be invested in 
national agricultural and industrial projects less connected to 
foreign powers the statement said

four nonaligned members of the security 
council drafted a plan tuesday urging simultaneous withdrawal of 
iraqi forces from kuwait and of foreign military units from the 
region 
the conciliatory proposal was given little chance of passage in 
the 15member council but will prolong negotiations over an 
expected usbacked measure to distribute iraqi assets now frozen 
to victims of iraqs aug 2 invasion and occupation of kuwait 
the four sponsors colombia cuba malaysia and yemen met 
with general assembly members in hopes of attracting dozens of 
endorsements that could be used to try to pressure reluctant 
security council members 
the plan came as us secretary of state james a baker iii 
visited the middle east seeking support for stronger un action 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen met baker in egypt tuesday and 
signaled chinas willingness to go along with a un resolution to 
authorize the use of force to liberate kuwait us officials said 
china is one of the security councils five permanent members 
and can veto a council decision 
the council has passed 10 antiiraq resolutions since kuwait was 
invaded including measures to establish a trade embargo and 
establish an air and sea blockade to enforce it 
a multinational force of about 300000 troops has been arrayed 
against iraq following the invasion including about 230000 us 
servicemen 
tuesdays proposal asks establishment of an allarab un 
peacekeeping force to maintain order in kuwait after the 
simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the 
region 
it demands immediate iraqi withdrawal from the emirate and says 
all previous un sanctions on baghdad would then be lifted it 
says damage claims would then be heard before the world court 
the resolution urges prompt compliance with other outstanding 
security council resolutions including those relating to the 
conflict in the middle east in particular the palestinian 
question 
iraqi president saddam hussein has tried to link the kuwait 
issue with israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip and west bank 
which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war 
the united states and other western nations say iraq should pull 
out first without conditions 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
would press on with a harsher resolution against iraq one source 
expects a us proposal within two or three days to attach 
frozen iraqi assets 
the security council also is expected to take up the issue of 
the israelioccupied territories and how to safeguard palestinians 
there the palestine liberation organization is proposing that the 
security council send unarmed un observers to the territories 
but israel has rejected the idea 
the council was scheduled to meet wednesday on the plo proposal 
new violence in the gaza strip has dramatized the issue

republican sen mitch mcconnell on 
tuesday turned back democrat harvey sloane who had hoped a ripple 
of antiincumbent sentiment would grow into a wave and wash his 
opponent out of office after a single term 
with 81 percent of precincts reporting mcconnell had 383710 
votes or 53 percent to 345710 or 47 percent for sloane 
heading into the election sloane didnt appear to have 
benefitted much from voter anger against congress and mcconnell 
was favored to win a second term 
in polls conducted by the louisville courierjournal 
mcconnells support eroded from 53 percent to 44 percent between 
september and late october but sloanes support stayed relatively 
constant at 33 percent in september and 34 percent in october and 
undecided voters grew from 14 percent to 22 percent 
sloane a nonpracticing physician and former louisville mayor 
had a relatively meager campaign bank of about 2 million to 
finance commercial attacks on mcconnell and so began using 
increasingly harsh language in his appearances at times sloane 
called mcconnell a liar sham and hypocrite 
mcconnell responded with an advertising blitz paid for with more 
than 5 million in campaign funds that depicted sloane as a 
freespending liberal who couldnt manage government when he was a 
mayor and county executive 
all four democrats in kentuckys congressional delegation had 
opponents only one of the three republican congressmen had 
opposition

dade county blacks including students teachers 
and bus drivers boycotted schools tuesday as a protest against 
what community leaders call a series of racist affronts 
boycott leaders encouraged participants to use their time to 
vote and turnout at the polls soared in black neighborhoods 
many predominantly black schools in the nations fourthlargest 
district had only 20 or 30 percent attendance and 72 percent of 
the school bus drivers stayed home creating long delays for 
students who did not boycott district spokeswoman joan moye said 
even teachers who did not honor the boycott wore black ribbons 
showing support for the action 
i think its having a tremendous effect said the rev 
victor curry whose church held a teachin for boycotting students 
and teachers all across the county we are hearing that teachers 
are not reporting to school as well as bus drivers and students 
james fleming associate superintendent of schools confirmed 
that large numbers of black students and teachers joined the 
boycott 
blacks account for 33 percent of dades students and district 
absenteeism on tuesday was 30 percent he said 2500 teachers also 
honored the boycott along with the districts bus drivers most of 
whom are black 
it totally crippled the transportation system fleming said 
but we can understand and empathize with the frustration people 
must feel and their need to express that 
about 1000 protesters carrying signs reading stop racism 
now and keep the pressure on showed up for a noon rally in 
front of school district headquarters 
dade county elections officials reported that based on initial 
voting patterns tuesday morning projected black turnout was 80 to 
90 percent in contrast to the countywide figure of 67 percent the 
black turnout raised dades total projected turnout from a 59 
percent initial estimate to almost 64 percent said david leahy

octavio visiedo a cubanamerican as schools superintendent black 
leaders had supported tee s greer a black administrator who had 
previously acted as interim superintendent they complained that 
greer not only had more experience but unlike visiedo has a 
doctorate 
this is an issue of racism and the time has come to face it 
said the rev richard dunn a boycott organizer 
school board members would speak only in general terms about 
their reason for choosing visiedo who has overseen a massive 
building program for the district 
he does address the needs of the whole community school 
board member and visiedobacker betsy kaplan said 
the school district did not condemn the boycott saying only 
that the staff was working to take care of the students who 
attended classes were going to cope with it ms moye said 
dunn said visiedos appointment was only the latest in a series 
of incidents including the snub of south african antiapartheid 
leader nelson mandela by the countys cubanamerican mayors in 
june and violent police repression of a black demonstration 
outside a store after a fight between a haitian customer and the 
shops cuban owner 
tuesdays school boycott received wide support from parents and 
students 
i dont like what they did so i decided not to come to 
school said joseph small a student at edison high i told my

the government on tuesday declared 
obsolete two provisions of the 1955 state treaty that gave austria 
its postwar independence following 10 years of occupation by the 
four world war ii allies 
the move could signal a revision of austrias neutral status 
which is hindering austrian attempts to become a full member of the 
european community 
the provisions ban the purchase of missiles germanmade 
armaments and german civilian planes and restrict the restitution 
to german citizens of property held by nazi germany in austria 
the state treaty was signed on may 15 1955 after arduous 
negotiations with moscow it provided for withdrawal of soviet and 
all allied troops five months later as part of a tacit agreement 
with the kremlin austria enacted a law guaranteeing this nations 
permanent neutrality 
neutral status has come increasingly into question with the 
unification of neighboring germany and the collapse of communist 
rule in eastern europe 
leaders of the major parties say austria will cling to its 
neutrality but several foreign officials and legal experts argue 
this would preclude austrias attempt to join the 12nation ec 
austria apparently did not seek prior formal approval to cancel 
the two provisions from the states which signed the 1955 treaty 
the united states the soviet union britain and france 
chancellor franz vranitzky said there had been contacts on the 
issue with the four nations and those governments will be 
officially informed of the move the soviet government said in a 
memorandum that being mindful of the changed situation in 
europe and contacts with the other allies and austria it did not 
object to the decision the soviet news agency tass reported 
when us ambassador roy huffington took up his duties here at 
the end of september he said washington would approve changes in 
the state treaty following prior consultations with austria

thousands of mourners some vengeful some 
crying never again thronged a brooklyn synagogue tuesday to 
bid farewell to the assassinated meir kahane and to pledge to carry 
on the radical rabbis antiarab war 
his alleged killer a moslem who immigrated from egypt in 1981 
and took us citizenship last year lay in critical condition in a 
manhattan hospital police said he had no links with terrorist 
groups 
there will be revenge we believe in revenge said sol 
margolis president of kach international the us arm of kahanes 
extremist party which advocates the ouster of arabs from 
israeliheld territory 
kahane was gunned down monday night while addressing a zionist 
group at a manhattan hotel police said kahane was taking questions 
from the crowd when the gunman stopped 4 feet from him and fired a 
357caliber weapon 
the israeli government appealed forpeace as police and army 
reinforcements spread out in israel and the occupied territories to 
head off revenge attacks the deaths two arabs on tuesday were 
linked to kahanes slaying 
the fear of retribution in new york prompted steppedup security 
at the un missions for israel saudi arabia and egypt el al 
israel airlines offices and several jewish newspapers said police 
commissioner lee brown 
the alleged gunman a 30000ayear city maintenance man was 
shot in the neck by a us postal police officer who spotted him 
fleeing the hotel 
the suspect identified by city officials as elsayyid a 
nosair 35 of cliffside park nj was in critical condition 
hospital officials said he was charged with murder attempted 
murder assault criminal possession of a weapon and of a defaced 
weapon and unlawful imprisonment police said 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli said he believed the gunman 
acted alone nosair had no previous criminal record and no links to 
any terrorist organizations borrelli said 
nosairs wife caren and three children were staying with 
relatives in brooklyn mrs nosair provided no clues about her 
husbands motives borrelli said police searched nosairs 
apartment 
until four months ago the family lived in jersey city where 
nosairs former neighbors described him as a quiet intellectual 
man with no involvement in political organizations in the citys 
400strong moslem community 
they were just a basic family said laurajean banks 36 
i couldnt believe it was him because he was so quiet 
nosair was carrying three new jersey drivers licenses with 
different addresses when he was arrested said jersey city police 
deputy chief john mcauley 
thousands of people jammed a synagogue in brooklyn and spilled 
onto a fourlane highway for the funeral of the 58yearold kahane 
his body was to be flown to israel for burial wednesday 
it is possible for the heart to well up and cry for the 
horrible loss our nation has suffered rabbi moshe tendler of 
yeshiva university said as thousands cheered outside young israel 
of ocean parkway synagogue 
rabbi herbert bomzer a longtime friend and leader of the 
synagogue where the service was held said kahane was always 
welcome there many synagogues barred kahane because he sanctioned 
violence 
rabbi meir kahane was a friend a leader a fighter a writer 
a thinker he was a spokesman for the defense of jews all around 
the world bomzer said 
the militant jewish defense league founded by kahane in 1968 
has been linked by the fbi to various acts of violence including a 
1972 firebombing that killed one person and injured 13 others 
the loudest applause came when bomzer proclaimed that kahane 
was a strident voice calling never again the slogan used by 
kahane in reference to the holocaust 
tell all arabs dont sleep so quiet tonight margolis said 
we are jews we are religious jews and we dont buy that crap of 
turning the other cheek there will be hell to pay for this 
affront 
asked if he was threatening arabs margolis said i use simple 
english and i wont elaborate beyond this 
police had no official crowd estimate the synagogue holds about 
1000 people thousands more clamored to get near the building and 
loudspeakers were set up so those outside could hear the service 
occasional fights were broken up by an estimated 200 police 
officers who were there to control the crowd 
moderate voices called for calm 
this is not the time to be speaking of revenge it is the time 
to be speaking of peace and reconciliation said rabbi marc d 
angel president of the rabbinical council of america 
the guilty person should be tried and punished under our 
laws said rabbi irwin groner president of the rabbinical 
asembly but we urge that no further violence be perpetrated 
this will only lead to more violence and bloodshed 
the new yorkborn kahane who moved to israel in 1971 and served 
four years in israels parliament until his extremist party was 
banned was struck by a single bullet in the neck and died an hour 
later at bellevue hospital 
the postal officer and a bystander at the hotel also were 
wounded they were in stable condition bellevue hospital 
spokeswoman brenda rivera said 
in an interview with a miami radio station sunday kahane said 
he feared he would be killed by a jew not an arab said radio host 
danny tadmore 
he said i dont have a problem with the arabs i have a 
problem with the jews tadmore said tuesday and if 
somebodys ever going to kill me its going to be a jew not an 
arab 
department of general services spokesman john beckman said 
nosair has been a city employee since 1988 israel army radio 
reported that nosair once lived in the occupied territories 
state department spokesman richard boucher called the killing 
a despicable and cowardly act 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar also decried 
kahanes killing and violence in the occupied territories he 
deplores these and all acts of violence said a spokeswoman 
nadia younes 
state assemblyman dov hikind who represents the rabbis old 
brooklyn neighborhood said kahane didnt want police protection 
he said that when his turn would come when god called him no 
one could prevent it said hikind

sen bill bradley an immensely popular 
democrat who often is mentioned as a presidential contender was in 
a dead heat tuesday with his republican challenger christine todd 
whitman 
with 52 percent of precincts reporting bradley had 506494 
votes or 50 percent to 505904 votes or 50 percent for mrs 
whitman 
republicans did their best to tar bradley and his fellow 
democrats with the brush of gov jim florios unpopular tax hikes 
florio wasnt on the ballot 
a star ledgereagleton poll released last week showed bradley 
leading mrs whitman by a 36point margin mrs whitman is a former 
president of the state board of public utilities and a member of a 
prominent new jersey republican family 
the florio tax package has provided most of the fodder for gop 
campaigning throughout the state but with president bush embracing 
a variety of higher taxes on the federal level in late october the 
tax issue became a more ambiguous issue for both parties 
there are two open congressional seats among the states total 
of 14 but neither contested race was expected to alter the 
political balance of the delegation there are seven democratic 
congressmen and six gop representatives in new jersey with one 
seat the one abandoned by florio vacant

gov mario cuomo breezed to a third term over 
splintered republican opposition tuesday maintaining his standing 
as a leader of the democratic party and potential presidential 
candidate for 1992 
while cuomo has consistently maintained that he has no plans 
to run for president and no plans to make plans democratic 
leaders said a reelection victory would increase interest in him 
hell be under more pressure than hes ever been under 
before robert strauss a former democratic national chairman 
predicted last week 
cuomos opposition included millionaire economist pierre 
rinfret the republican challenger who was an unknown in new york 
politics six months ago and conservative party nominee herbert 
london 
with 19 percent of precincts reporting cuomo had 389863 votes 
or 49 percent to 193809 votes or 24 percent for rinfret and 
181166 votes or 23 percent for london 
in the final two months of the campaign the outspoken 
underfunded rinfret spent almost as much time bashing prominent 
republicans as he did attacking democrat cuomo rinfrets paltry 
campaign war chest reflected gop displeasure 
with rinfrets campaign in shambles republicans scrambled to 
produce enough loyal voters to keep london from finishing second 
by finishing third the gop could lose its secondrow ballot spot 
in new york elections for at least the next four years 
also threatened by a possible low republican turnout was gop 
control of the state senate 
a marist college institute for public opinion poll released last 
week had cuomo the choice of 61 percent of those surveyed with 
rinfret and london tied for second place at 11 percent each 
of new yorks 34 congressional members 21 democrats and 13 
republicans five ran unopposed and the others were favored to win 
reelection 
on staten island voters decided whether to start a process that 
could lead to secession for the smallest of new york citys five 
boroughs 
meanwhile cuomo asked voters statewide to approve a 2 billion 
environmental bond act that would provide 800 million to buy land 
and 625 million for garbage problems

voters were a gloomy bunch with little faith 
in congress or the nations future according to an election day 
telephone poll 
nearly threequarters of those questioned tuesday in the abc 
news voter poll said the economic outlook was getting worse and the 
nation was on the wrong track an overwhelming majority of those 
with dim views were democrats 
the poll respondents rated the deficit and the persian gulf 
standoff the nations most important problems their top few very 
important voting issues included the federal budget iraq taxes 
and the national economy 
the poll suggested that recent republican waffling over taxes 
and the federal budget has reinforced the perception that the gop 
is the party of the rich 
twothirds of those questioned said the democratic party was 
best for the poor while 79 percent including 37 percent of 
the republicans said the republicans were best for the rich 
looked at by income groups 66 percent of voters making less 
than 15000 a year said they voted for democrats the democrats 
also were favored by those making up to 49000 among those making 
more than that the vote was about evenly split between the two 
parties 
the voters in the survey also were evenly split on which party 
they said could be trusted on future problems 
but there was broad bipartisan support for president bushs 
policies in iraq 69 percent total including 45 percent of the 
democrats about the same percentages said they would support us 
force if it is needed in the gulf 
bushs approval rating may be lower than it once was but the 
abc poll suggests people are more than three times as fed up with 
congress 
a full 57 percent of those questioned said they approved of 
bushs performance but only 18 percent said they approved of the 
way congress was doing its job 
in addition 77 percent said congress needs fresh ideas 
rather than experience 
despite their negative view of congress however 62 percent 
said they approved of their own house members performance and 
when push came to shove more than half 55 percent said they 
voted to retain their current congressman or woman 
in a very early peek at the 1992 presidential race bush came 
out substantially ahead of an array of democrats who conceivably 
might run but doubts about vice president dan quayle persisted 
with only 44 percent of those questioned saying he was qualified to 
be president 
the abc poll was based on interviews with 661 people who had 
already voted or who indicated in replies to several screening 
questions that they were going to vote the polltakers warned that 
telephone polling sometimes overstates turnout since some people do 
not make it to the voting booth 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 45 percent

a defense lawyer on tuesday attacked 
the credibility of a woman who claims she suddenly remembered 
watching her father molest and kill her best friend 20 years ago 
during a second day of crossexamination defense attorney 
douglas horngrad pointed out variations in eileen 
franklinlipskers story since she first claimed the resurfacing of 
a repressed memory last year 
horngrad demanded to know why she changed her story after 
telling relatives the memory surfaced while she was under hypnosis 
ms franklinlipsker has acknowledged telling family members months 
later that she lied about the hypnosis to make her story more 
believable 
horngrad suggested ms franklinlipsker changed her story 
because she learned hypnoticallyinduced memory would not stand up 
in court 
by that time you knew that hypnoticallyinduced testimony was 
inadmissible in california horngrad asked 
no i dont think so ms franklinlipsker said 
george franklin sr 51 was charged with killing 8yearold 
susan nason after his daughter told police she had suddenly 
remembered the sept 22 1969 attack he pleaded innocent to the 
charges 
ms franklinlipsker now 29 claims her father threatened to 
kill her if she told anyone about the crime she testified the 
memory flooded back last year as she looked at her own young 
daughter and details of the crime emerged in subsequent months 
nasons body was discovered in a ravine three months after she 
was reported missing a bloodstained rock was discovered nearby 
on tuesday horngrad also questioned ms franklinlipsker about 
when and how the memory resurfaced 
ms franklinlipsker testified she first recalled the murder in 
january 1989 and told a therapist about it five months later 
saying the memory had recently resurfaced 
horngrad asked her why it took her so long to discuss the memory 
with a professional is five months recent he asked 
i would say that if i had a 5monthold memory of a 
20yearold murder thats very recent she replied 
on monday ms franklinlipsker recounted details of the slaying 
and recalled that when she was 11 her father pinned her down on a 
table as his best friend raped her 
like the alleged murder franklinlipsker testified the memory 
of the rape remained repressed until recently

a reform plan that cut workers 
compensation benefits by 30 percent was struck down tuesday by a 
judge who said it was cluttered with unrelated unconstitutional 
provisions 
the state will appeal the circuit court ruling and the law 
enacted earlier this year will remain in effect until the outcome 
of the appeal 
the law was challenged by the florida aflcio and other unions 
they argued that 150 provisions of the law violated the florida 
constitution mainly denying an injured workers right to appeal 
lost benefits in court 
judge lewis hall did not declare that provision 
unconstitutional but said the law improperly dealt with workers 
compensation issues in violation of the constitutions requirement 
that parts of a law be relevant to a single subject 
how many subjects can you put under that broad an umbrella 
hall asked in his ruling 
hall said sections of the law setting up foreign trade offices 
had little to do with workers compensation and could have given 
lawmakers a way to justify their votes on the bill which was 
supported by business but opposed by workers groups 
other provisions violated separation of powers requirements by 
giving the governor judicial authority through his appointments to 
a commission set up to decide workers appeals he said 
in essence theres so much in there that it reduces the 
accountability of the legislator because he can always say he voted 
for the good part and not necessarily for the bad part hall 
said 
deputy attorney general mitch franks said he disagreed with 
halls reasoning on the single subject and separation of powers 
issues 
state aflcio president dan miller was elated with the ruling 
even though the state said it will bypass other courts and ask the 
florida supreme court to hear the appeal 
i think its a great victory for injured workers in this 
case miller said if the supreme court upholds this decision 
well revert back to the law that was in effect in 1989 its not 
perfect but its fairer than what the legislature passed 
the legislature enacted the comprehensive reform to reduce 
skyrocketing workers compensation insurance rates paid by 
businesses by up to 25 percent 
the reduction was achieved by slashing workers benefits by 
about onethird under the 1989 law for example the fringe 
benefits of an injured worker were included in the amount used to 
figure his workers compensation such fringe benefits were removed 
from the formula under the new law

democrats on tuesday won two more years in 
control of the senate as incumbents showed their strength in the 
most closely watched contest conservative sen jesse helms was 
leading in his battle against democrat harvey gantt in north 
carolina 
democrats seemed assured of at least 51 seats another senate 
majority after results showed 12 of their incumbents had won and 
several others were leading including several who had been 
targeted by the gop 
republican incumbents showed similar strength however and it 
appeared the gop would hold on to all three seats where their 
senators were retiring 
democrats had hoped to improve on their 5545 majority anywhere 
they could but especially in north carolina early returns and 
exit polls however suggested helms would survive 
the race between helms and gantt captured national attention not 
only because it was close but because the candidates represent 
such extremes 
helms is a national symbol of rightwing politics and the 
senates most diehard opponent to civil rights legislation helms 
ran campaign ads accusing gantt who is black of favoring racial 
quotas and taking advantage of minoritypreference rules for 
personal gain 
gantt is an unapologetic liberal and racial trailblazer the 
first black admitted to clemson university during the campaign he 
blamed helms for the poor state of north carolina education and the 
states environmental problems 
polls were kept open late in heavily black durham county after 
voting machines there broke down 
another democratic challenge fell short in kentucky where 
firsttime sen mitch mcconnell beat off former county commissioner 
harvey sloane 
but in new jersey gop challenger christine todd whitman a 
virtual unknown in her first statewide bid put a scare into 
democratic sen bill bradley she was close behind him in the 
polls 
and in one of the open senate seats rep robert smith defeated 
former sen john durkin in new hampshire keeping that seat in the 
gop column 
democratic incumbents claiborne pell in rhode island carl levin 
in michigan and paul simon in illinois won surprisingly easy 
victories over wellfinanced republican house members sen j 
james exon dneb beat former republican rep hal daub 
other incumbents of both parties won with ease 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee won unopposed thad cochran rmiss and david pryor 
dark also won without opponents 
sen alan k simpson rwyo the senates deputy minority 
leader won easily 
other senior incumbents returned to office were strom thurmond 
rsc at 87 the senates oldest member howell heflin dala 
john warner rva david boren dokla pete domenici rnm 
william cohen rmaine and jay rockefeller dwva 
nunn was one of several possible future presidential candidates 
seeking reelection to the senate tuesday others who won 
reelection were sen al gore dtenn and phil gramm rtexas 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan handily won a third term and sen 
joseph biden ddel who ran for the democratic presidential 
nomination in 1988 also won 
indiana republican incumbent dan coats who was appointed to the 
senate seat vacated by vice president dan quayle won his bid for 
election on his own over democrat baron hill 
sen john kerry dmass whose second term appeared threatened 
at one point because of voter discontent crushed developer jim 
rappaport 
in hawaii incumbent daniel akaka was trying to hold for the 
democrats a seat his party has controlled since statehood but 
republican rep pat saiki was running even in preelection surveys 
to akaka who was appointed to the senate last spring following the 
death of sen spark matsunaga 
another threatened senate institution was mark hatfield rore 
who has served four terms hatfield appeared a shooin until 
businessman and scientist harry lonsdale running as a democrat 
tapped into voter discontent with politicians 
democrats also used the antiwashington theme in kentucky south 
dakota and minnesota as they went after gop incumbents republicans 
used the same tactic in massachusetts 
in iowa incumbent democrat tom harkin was leading in his bid to 
become the first democrat in that state ever reelected to the 
senate 
chances that tuesdays 34 senate elections would produce a major 
shift in the chambers current 5545 partisan split appeared slim 
there was virtually no chance the republicans would take over or 
that the democrats would gain enough seats to assure an override of 
every veto issued by bush 
but even a change of one seat could weaken or strengthen 
president bushs position for example the senate recently failed 
to override his veto of the 1990 civil rights bill by a single 
vote 
the north carolina race was easily the most costly senate 
contest in the nation at last report two weeks before election 
day helms had spent 108 million and gantt 46 million both 
candidates were getting most of their money from out of state 
if the democrats succeeded in adding seats they would get their 
biggest margin since the 5941 majority they held from 1979 until 
1981 the last two years of the carter administration 
california could get a new senator as a result of tuesdays 
election but the seat would not change parties if republican sen 
pete wilson were to beat democrat dianne feinstein hed resign 
from the senate and appoint his successor 
in the district of columbia jesse jackson won election as a 
nonvoting shadow senator to lobby congress for statehood

police used a bulldozer 
tuesday to flatten a blockade of trees furniture and other debris 
an indian group erected across a roadway used by loggers and 
arrested more than 60 protesters 
no violence or injuries were reported as royal canadian mounted 
police removed the 4monthold blockade though some protesters 
were led away shouting and kicking 
theyre putting up some resistance police sgt peter 
montague said we were expecting that 
while indians chanted and beat drums the officers escorted at 
least 63 protesters to a nearby checkpoint and handcuffed them with 
plastic restraints before being put aboard chartered buses 
montague said those arrested would have to sign notices 
promising to appear in court before they would be released 
the mount currie indians band set up the 3foottall barricade 
on an unpaved road about 85 miles north of vancouver on july 12 to 
show support for mohawk indians in their standoff with police at 
oka quebec 
after the oka standoff was resolved the group decided to 
maintain its blockade to draw attention to its land claims 
the british columbia supreme court on monday gave police power 
to make arrests if necessary to remove the blockade 
indian affairs minister tom siddon said he would meet with chief 
fraser andrew of the mount currie indian band on wednesday to try 
to persuade the indians to honor and abide by the decision of the 
courts 
siddon said he would urge the group to settle its land claim 
through the normal negotiation process 
loggers who often use duffey lake road have been hurt by the 
blockade logging contractors and their crews have had just a few 
days of work since the blockade went up said contractor peter 
staehli 
trucks began rumbling down the roadway again after the blockade 
was dismantled tuesday 
terri john a spokeswoman for the lilwat peoples movement 
vowed monday that the group would not recognize the order and would 
peacefully resist police orders to move 
the indians would continue to resist the bc supreme 
court injunction because they have no jurisdiction over the indian 
nation she said 
the blockade was a series of mounds of earth some teepees and 
old couches stretching 330 feet across a dirt road nestled in a 
large meadow beneath thew snowcapped coast mountains 
many protesters had lived in tents at the site since the 
blockade began

filter tip the sneering gangster takes a puff on a coffin nail 
television with its power to inform and entertain also has aterrible 
power to persuade cajole and educate what does it say 
about smoking glad you asked 
we wanted to assess the prevalence of smoking on television 
and we wanted to look at who it is that is smoking and the message 
that is being given said patricia madden coauthor of the study 
of smoking on primetime television 
she and georgette l overby are researchers at the prevention 
research bureau in berkeley calif one of a dozen state and 
federally funded centers for social and biomedical reasearch on 
alcohol and other abused substances 
the foundation of their experiment is the cognitive social 
learning theory developed by the sociologist albert bandura and 
others it is in essence the kid with a stone theory of social 
behavior 
if the kid sees somebody toss a stone through a window the kid 
is likelier to do the same thing if the behavior is rewarded and 
somewhat less likely to do it if nothing happens 
if the tosser is a highstatus role model someone who is 
powerful attractive competent a hero for example the kid is 
more likely to imitate the throwing than if the tosser is an 
unattractive lowstatus model 
got it funny it all seemed so clear when andy of mayberry 
was on 
ms madden said the researchers collected 139 hours of 
routine fiction network primetime programming in the fall of 
1989 and ended with a sample of 70 prime time shows hours and 
halfhours comedies and dramas 
university of californiaberkeley students then scanned the 
programs using a kitchen timer and the vcrs pause button to check 
for smoking at minutebyminute intervals 
once a smoking act was seen the viewers noted the context 
of the smoking the status of the characters involved in the 
smoking and how they reacted to it the observers also checked for 
embedded antismoking messages 
the results were more surprising than you might expect 
the scales are still tipped toward the prosmoking message 
ms madden said the study found an average 2 minutes of smoking 
per hour with antismoking messages in little more than 
threequarters of a minute per hour 
youd have to watch two hours to see an antismoking 
message ms madden said 
smoking occurred in 53 percent of all programs and 41 percent of 
all episodes in the sample while antismoking messages occurred in 
39 percent of all programs and 20 percent of all episodes 
crime shows had more smoking on them and the smokers tended 
more often to be bad guys 
we were encouraged by the fact that smoking does not tend to 
be glamorized any more on television ms madden said and we 
would like to see scriptwriters weave more antismoking messages 
into their plots 
where antismoking messages were involved the majority of 
smokers and the people who reacted negatively to smoking were 
adult white male plotrelated characters the study found 
overall we had 129 smokers in our sample and 35 characters 
who reacted negatively to smoking ms madden said this could 
be anything from waving away the smoke to actually saying something 
to the character about their smoking 
in addition 
the negative reactors were more affluent than smokers 
likelier to be good guys and positive role models 
smokers usually were guest characters and bad guys with low 
role model potential 
fully 15 percent of smokers were under age 18 
as a public health professional i would not advocate the 
total elimination of smoking on television ms madden said 
i would like to see more of the consequences shown 
consequences ranging from someone asking a character to put out a 
cigarette to medical shows with episodes on cancer and 
emphysema 
 
elsewhere in television

the time has come for some very patient families 
who saved their money bided their time and never lost faith that 
someday they might be able to afford a house 
through most of a decade their vision could be only perceived 
dimly prices soared and interest rates stayed high and the market 
was full of eager buyers to whom price seemed no object it was a 
sellers market 
those were tough times for people with limited incomes and that 
included millions of families in many months popular indexes of 
affordability showed the typical family couldnt even qualify for 
the typical singlefamily house 
how things have changed home prices are dropping in many areas 
in some neighborhoods the for sale sign on the front lawn has 
become almost as common as the mail box on a post 
interest rates seem to be on a steady course lower a survey of 
125 primary mortgagemarket lenders showed rates on a 30year fixed 
rate mortgage have dropped steadily to 1017 percent and on a 
oneyear adjustable rate to 817 percent 
moreover while some banks might be cutting back on lending to 
businesses many banks are aggressively seeking borrowers who offer 
homes as collateral 
at the same time affordability has soared the median home 
price measured by the national association of realtors was down to 
94300 in september from 97100 in august while the national 
median income rose 
those changes put the associations affordability index at 1109 
in september one of the highest in recent years in the mid1980s 
it had fallen well below 100 meaning the typical family couldnt 
afford the typical house 
translated the september index meant a family earning the 
national median income of 35239 in that month had 1109 percent 
of the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 
80 percent of a medianpriced home 
it has been six to eight years in many sections of the country 
since such favorable buying conditions existed a long time in 
terms of the economic cycle and one that probably led some 
wouldbe buyers to give up the search 
many buyers did remain patient however recognizing that the 
most certain thing you can say about the economy is that it is 
cyclical rising and falling and rising again and that the real 
estate cycle is even more pronounced 
the coalescing of favorable factors however does not make a 
perfect market for buyers in the nature of things a shrinking 
economy means less job security and more uncertainty and the 
latter is unusually high today 
prudent shoppers take that into consideration of course but 
they realize also that no investment is without risk included in 
their assessment of risk will be the cost of renting vs buying and 
relative tax benefits 
in a market of sluggish sales these tax benefits are one of the 
more convincing sales inducements being used by real estate agents 
deductibility of interest on mortgages you might say is the 
common persons only loophole 
prudence also dictates that buyers have a reserve of funds for 
emergencies of course but also to pay for the various items that 
may accompany the purchase of a home furniture drapes lawn 
mower washing machine and more 
perhaps it isnt a perfect market for buyers it never is and 
it is even conceivable that better buys might lie ahead but those 
who for years have postponed buying a house can at least begin 
looking and planning now

emperor akihito formally assumes the worlds oldest 
hereditary throne monday in lavish ceremonies that also may be an 
important rite of passage for postwar japan 
no other monarch has ascended the chrysanthemum throne under the 
constitution enacted in 1945 
for the first time a japanese emperor is to be enthroned as 
merely a national symbol as stipulated by the constitution imposed 
by the us occupation after japans surrender in world war ii 
most japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial 
role of their new emperor a remarkable break with the past the 
late emperor hirohito akihitos father was enthroned as a living 
god and was the object of fanatical devotion 
even the official name the government has given akihitos reign 
achieving peace reflects a desire to move away from the 
turbulent times of hirohito who died of cancer early last year 
the monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century but the japanese 
public associates it most closely with hirohitos 60year reign in 
that period japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the 
emperor suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation then 
rose to become an economic superpower 
akihito 56 became emperor immediately after his fathers 
death but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and 
the growing of sacred rice for a coronation rite 
during the interval akihito has tried to create a softer more 
open image for the often aloof royal family insisting on fewer 
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people 
with the title san a term of respect similar to mr or mrs in 
english 
reflecting the different times in which they were raised 
akihito is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his 
father and has pledged to protect the constitution along with 
the people 
empress michiko the first commoner to marry a future japanese 
monarch is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal 
household in large part by providing akihito with a family life 
similar to that of common japanese 
she broke tradition for example by making clear that her 
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers 
although the palace remains distant to most japanese opinion 
polls indicate it has wide public support few however still see 
their monarch as a god 
government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the 
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age they also have 
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly monthlong rites 
however creating widespread concern that the new era might 
actually represent a step backward in time 
royalty heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150 
nations will be in tokyo when akihito announces his accession on 
monday 
the main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace an 
oasis of greenery in central tokyo built in the late 19th century 
on the site of a former samurai castle 
akihito will ascend a 20foottall throne on a threelayered 
dais of black lacquer beneath an octagonal roof adorned with 
golden mirrors and phoenixes 
prime minister toshiki kaifu will stand before the throne as 
akihito in a reddishbrown kimono with a design of paulownia 
trees bamboo and mythical animals reads an address announcing his 
accession 
kaifu will lead the japanese among the 2500 guests in three 
rounds of banzai a traditional cheer for long life to 
conclude the 30minute ceremony 
officials say akihito will read his announcement in colloquial 
japanese unlike hirohitos use of stilted classical language most 
japanese cannot understand 
to reflect the postwar constitutions emphasis on popular 
sovereignty kaifu will lead the banzai cheers from a point level 
with the throne instead of descending several steps as his 
predecessors did 
an official in the prime ministers office told reporters a 
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced 
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because thats the way foreign 
dignitaries are received 
aside from such cosmetic adjustments akihitos coronation is 
expected to be much like those held since his greatgrandfather 
assumed the throne in the middle of the last century 
in what many critics of the government see as a snub to the 
constitution about 25 billion yen 17 million in public money 
will be spent on a rite steeped in shinto japans state religion 
until 1945 
in that rite to begin 10 days after the main coronation 
ceremony akihito will step back into the world of myth for a 
communion of fresh rice with the sun goddess from whom the 
imperial line is said to have descended and all the gods of heaven 
and earth 
opponents say public funding violates the constitutional 
separation of church and state the kaifu administration argues 
that the money is not being used to promote religion but to 
preserve an important cultural tradition 
critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes 
during its 1200 years of existence it was ignored for more than 
200 years beginning in the late 15th century 
in response to questions about whether holding the daijosai or 
great food offering ritual is intended to restore livinggod 
status to akihito and future emperors nobuo ishihara the deputy 
cabinet secretary replied 
i am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period 
who claimed that through performance of the daijosai the emperor 
assumed a divine nature however the government is not in a 
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does 
not 
police have begun japans largest security operation mainly 
because ultraleftist radical groups have said they will disrupt 
the ceremonies a bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last 
week at a tokyo police dormitory killing one officer and wounding 
six other people 
late last month 26000 tokyo police officers were mobilized for 
security in the capital and at least 6000 more will be brought in 
before the main ceremony nearly 45 percent of the total coronation 
budget of 123 billion yen 946 million is being spent on 
security 
a highranking national police agency official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the extraordinary security was 
justified because leftist radicals are planning to attack the 
palace with explosive rockets 
he said police believe one group has devised mortarlike weapons 
with a range of nearly four miles 
along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries including 
prince charles of britain and vice president dan quayle the police 
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation 
akihito and empress michiko are to ride in a convertible in the 
30minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal 
residence at akasaka palace 
oficials say about 7000 officers will line the threemile 
route

clad in white robes reserved for the holiest 
ceremonies emperor akihito will complete his accession to the 
throne by communing with the shinto gods in a room bathed in 
flickering torchlight 
palace officials say the communion part of an enthronement 
ritual more than 1200 years old has become an integral part of 
imperial succession and is an important aspect of japanese culture 
it also has given rise to heated constitutional debate and 
allegations that the government seeks to revive the living god 
status of former monarchs 
members of the leading opposition party the socialists plan to 
boycott the rite the head of the japan federation of bar 
associations has questioned its constitutionality and the national 
christian council of japan has collected nearly 80000 signatures 
on a petition against it 
the ceremony to begin just after dark nov 22 and end before 
dawn is known as the daijosai or great food offering ritual 
about 900 japanese dignitaries will gather for the ceremony at a 
special complex of buildings recently completed on the grounds of 
the imperial palace in central tokyo no foreigners are invited 
among the guests will be prime minister toshiki kaifu speakers 
of both houses of parliament the chief justice of the supreme 
court and the cream of japanese society 
ancient court music will be played as the guests are seated in 
two large tents a procession of chamberlains and palace officials 
clad in traditional kimonos will escort the emperor to one of two 
ceremonial halls 
in a lanternlit inner chamber well away from the sight of the 
guests akihito will be assisted by two female attendants as he 
begins the rite 
sitting on a bamboo floor covered with rush matting he will 
pray and offer newly harvested and polished rice to the sun 
goddess from whom the imperial line is said to have descended 
he then will join all the gods of heaven and earth in a 
communion of rice rice wine and produce from all over japan 
including squid abalone and chestnuts 
just after midnight the ceremony will be repeated in the other 
hall 
relatively few details of the mystical ceremony were known to 
the public until earlier this century 
because each of the inner chambers contains a stylized bed 
scholars have argued that at one time the rite may have involved 
the emperor symbolically having intercourse with the sun goddess 
thus becoming one with the divie 
palace officials say the bed represents the place where the gods 
rest until summoned for the communion 
iwao miyao deputy head of the imperial household agency which 
supervises palace affairs told reporters recently that prayers 
offered by previous emperors indicate the rite is not intended to 
bestow divine status on the monarch 
miyao quoted a prayer by emperor gotsuchimikado in 1466 that was 
an appeal to the sun goddess for peace abundant crops and 
blessings on all the people both high and low 
he said that prayer and two others had for some reason or 
other become known outside the palace miyao refused to divulge 
what akihito will say because such matters are intended 
exclusively for the deities 
akihito is to be the first monarch enthroned under japans 
postwar constitution written while japan was administered by 
allied occupation forces after world war ii 
although the charter redefined the role of the emperor from that 
of sacred sovereign to a largely symbolic one akihitos 
daijosai will be essentially the same as those of his father 
grandfather and greatgrandfather 
critics consider this important since the content of those 
rites was strongly influenced by those who wanted to restore 
imperial rule and build a national cult of emperor worship 
the cult was used later to rally the nation to war 
opponents also point out that the late hirohito the new 
emperors father renounced his divinity in 1946 they claim 
akihitos daijosai amounts to a retraction of that historic 
decision

bulgaria is more democratic a year after 
a politburo coup ousted stalinist leader todor zhivkov but it also 
is a divided nation heading for economic disaster 
many bulgarians were taken by surprise when zhivkov fell nov 
10 1989 after 35 years in power dissidents and ordinary people 
celebrated but there has been little cause for rejoicing since 
exhorting bulgarians into the streets of sofia the fledgling 
opposition forced talks in january with the governing communists 
who hurriedly began implementing reforms after zhivkov was thrown 
out 
in june as a result of the negotiations bulgaria held its 
first free elections in 58 years instead of solving the nations 
problems however the elections seemed to create more 
the communist party now called the socialists became unique 
among former masters in the soviet bloc by winning at the polls 
the stunned opposition union of democratic forces accepted the 
result but has seemed unable to live with it 
little has been accomplished in the 400seat parliament where 
theformer communists have 211 members and the opposition alliance 
144 
it required six weeks for the assembly to chose a president 
former udf leader zhelyu zhelev and longer to approve an 
allsocialist government 
endless argument by deputies of the opposition alliance and 
divisions among the former communists have made it impossible to 
pass legislation on foreign investment selling state companies and 
other economic and political reforms udf members refuse to support 
premier andrei lukanov or join a socialistled coalition 
although polls indicate the udf would win if elections were held 
now many bulgarians are critical of the oppositions conduct in 
parliament frustration fear and tension have increased in the 
streets 
a mob burned the governing partys headquarters in september 
after smashing windows and demanding the communist red star be 
removed from the roof 
the charred walls and the empty mausoleum next door that once 
housed the embalmed body of communist founder georgi dmitrov 
removed and reburied in july symbolize the collapse of stalinism 
bulgarias economy seems about to collapse with the old regime 
and sofia is preparing for a bleak winter 
harvests were ruined by the driest summer in 32 years meat 
cheese milk and even bread are rationed and prices of available 
goods rise steadily 
power cuts to factories and homes are routine industrial 
production is down 30 percent from last year 
life is hardest for pensioners and the poor 
these food lines these prices this is death for older 
people said maria ivanova 64 waiting in a chill rain for a 
store to open 
we are eight people at home said stefka savova 61 who had 
waited three hours to find only milk and rationed bread available 
we have a 2monthold baby there and they give us just five 
cartons of milk i dont have sausages meat or cheese 
mrs savova a retired nurse with a monthly pension equivalent 
to 14 said she had thought zhivkovs fall was the beginning of a 
brighter future 
we expected things to get better and they have gotten 
worse she said i can do nothing only walk through the 
streets and cry 
legislators share the sense of helplessness 
parliament is incompetent and rather weak said dragomir 
draganov a reformminded deputy for the newly named socialists 
instead of either uniting to govern or splitting into into 
orthodox and reformist parties he said the socialists have become 
a deadlocked hybrid of stalinists and social democrats 
on the other side the the 17party union of democratic forces 
is united only in wanting the former communists out of power 
political polarization and the coming winter create perfect 
conditions for every populist draganov said and a succesful one 
could liquidate even the small gains we have made on our way to 
democracy 
petyo bluskov editor of a new businessoriented weekly 168 
hours expressed the public impatience 
what kind of moral respect can deputies win if they argue 
for a week over what their salaries should be he said 
opposition refusal to support the governments muchneeded 
economic reform program or accept anything less than the 
leadership of a coalition government threatens to dash hopes of 
economic recovery 
until the stalemate is resolved foreigners have little reason 
to invest in bulgaria a nation of 9 million with an obsolete 
industrial plant that relied on now vanishing supplies from old 
east european trading bloc 
you know why you cant find beer in bulgaria now film 
director angel wagenstein asked not because there is no beer 
not because there are no btttles we lack the tiny piece of plastic 
inside the metal caps which came from some other part of eastern 
europe 
the persian gulf crisis has been a serious blow 
iraq used to pay installments of its 13 billion debt to 
bulgaria in oil that has ceased and soviet supplies which must be 
paid for with hard currency starting next year are getting scarce 
bulgaria cannot afford to pay the higher prices on the world oil 
market and stopped payments on its 11 billion foreign debt in 
may in september international creditors agreed informally that 
debt payment resume only late next year

eight years ago a folk music group 
from neighboring greece came to this ethnic greek village in 
southern albania the audience waited hours in burning heat but 
neither smiled nor applauded 
a witness said the people turned out to demonstrate ethnic 
identity but dared not show emotion in the albania of stalinist 
dictator enver hoxha 
hoxha died in 1985 and by oct 26 1990 things had changed 
foreign minister antonis samaris of greece was welcomed like a 
20th century messiah when he visited gorandsi and nearby 
derviciani another ethnic greek settlement thousands of people 
surged past uniformed and secret police simply to touch or smile at 
him 
albanias communist rulers have given hints of reform and are 
gradually losing control of the 32 million citizens they repressed 
for half a century 
startling evidence of the change came in july when thousands of 
albanians sought refuge at foreign embassies in tirana the 
capital and were allowed to emigrate 
outside pressure has grown for improvements in human rights 
particularly from the 2 million ethnic albanians in neighboring 
yugoslavia 
if it wants to rejoin europe as it says albania must lift the 
ban on religion imposed in 1967 allow free speech and honor its 
promise made before the mass emigration of passports for all 
wishing to travel abroad 
an illustration of the communist leaderships dilemma was the 
samaras visit to a minority albania says numbers 80000 and greece 
by including all the greek orthodox faithful puts at more than 
400000 
trucks blocked the road to gorandsi samaras stopped his 
motorcade and insisted on his scheduled visit to 1000 people who 
awaited him in the dusk 
men from the sigurimi the albanian secret police were 
sprinkled liberally through the crowds in both villages 
in derviciani a senior albanian official threatened to expel a 
greek journalist who was handing out greeklanguage books to 
children 
a woman identified by greeks as veronika kallas emboldened by 
the rare presence of foreigners defied secret police to slip a 
visa request to a greek journalist she said her husband was in 
jail for trying to flee albania 
it shows you have not forgotten us an excited teenager 
said as the crowd showed samaras the former greek orthodox church 
of gorandsi now a dilapidated storehouse with a faded cross etched 
in the stone portal donkeys grazed in the yard 
a woman gestured her eagerness to pray jars with burnedout wax 
on window sills of the warehouse attested to continued reverence 
for the church 
officials contend religion always was alien to albanians that 
the moslem roman catholic and greek orthodox faiths were imposed 
by occupying outsiders over the centuries recently however the 
authorities removed religion from a list of antistate propaganda 
after religion was outlawed many churches and mosques became 
storehouses or ruins only a few are preserved as historical 
monuments 
albania was the only european nation not to sign the 1975 
helsinki agreements on european security and cooperation which 
include comprehensive human rights provisions 
it now wants to join the conference on security and cooperation 
in europe which resulted from the helsinki accords 
albania may have little idea of what such membership entails it 
has isolated itself from the west for two generations broke with 
moscow in 1968 and with china in 1976 
i tell government officials that joining helsinki means 
nongovernment organizations have the right to come here and ask 
why is this church or mosque closed and to get an answer said 
a foreign official speaking on condition of anonymity they 
simply dont understand what that means 
samaras criticism of the host countrys human rights record 
delivered at a conference of balkan foreign ministers in tirana 
was omitted from albanian media reports 
officials were clearly unnerved by having to deal with the 105 
foreign journalists allowed in for the conference and gently urged 
the last eight to leave to do so before their visas expired 
government secrecy makes it virtually impossible to verify 
numerous rumors of human rights violations 
reports of border shootings or torture often arise in greece or 
yugoslavia both have an interest in painting albania darkly the 
greeks because of their minority in the country and the yugoslavs 
because of the restive ethnic albanian majority in serbias kosovo 
province 
kosovos albanians are far freer than citizens of albania 
despite being stripped of provincial autonomy by serbia hunger for 
crossborder contacts is increasing and hundreds of people a day 
apply for visas at the yugoslav consulate in tirana 
in may acknowledging international pressure for the first time 
the albanian leadership published figures indicating only 35 
political prisoners were held 
aleks lasuari a tirana university legal expert told reporters 
the death sentence is reserved only for severe crimes and that 
only three or four people are executed each year 
how deputy foreign minister sokrat plaka handled the samaras 
trip is an example of the governments quandary 
first he insisted to a reporter that those in the enthusiastic 
crowd around the visitor were complaining that greece was not 
issuing enough visas minutes later he pointed at the smiling 
faces and said you see people are happy here in albania

joel chaiken changes diapers cleans house and 
is the chief caretaker of his toddler son he does everything the 
other mothers in his bronx neighborhood do his problem is hes not 
a mother 
thats why he was banned from a local mothersinfant group 
which deemed his male persona non grata 
chaiken 32 tried to join the riverdale neighborhood house 
support group last october when his son benjamin was 7 months 
old 
i thought basically it was a place to go during the day and 
meet new people a place to find out about baby care to find out 
real information the kind your pediatrician cant give you a 
place for benjamin to socialize and a place for support to a 
certain extent 
instead he found a closed door 
chaiken is trying to pry it open by filing what is believed to 
be a precedentsetting discrimination suit the state division on 
human rights recently decided chaikens case has merit and has 
ordered a public hearing 
we found enough reason to believe he was treated differently 
because he was a man said felicia clavell of the state agency 
some in riverdales uppermiddle class neighborhood some 11 
miles north of midtown manhattan say thats the way it should be 
there are mothers and there are dads and hes not a mother 
said caryl malka 33 boiling the argument down to basics 
i would feel very uncomfortable talking about personal things 
in front of him the twotime mother and former group member 
said its not a play group its not just about the semantics of 
scheduling or diapering its women getting together and talking 
about very intimate things and a man joining the group would really 
change that 
chaiken agrees but he doesnt think thats negative 
i think it would change for the better once they learn a real 
man could be understanding and compassionate their own 
relationships might change 
women dont have a monopoly on emotional support and 
compassion toward others said chaikens wife sue ellen dodell 
who encouraged her husband to file the complaint 
gender equality is important to the couple thats evident in 
the surname they chose for their child it isnt one name or the 
other or a hyphenated version but an equal combination of the two 
chaidell 
its also evident in the chaikendodellchaidell familys 
toystrewn living room littered with everything from a diapered 
baby doll to pickup trucks 
chaiken said they decided at conception that he would give 
up his 37000ayear engineering job to care for their child 
dodell 35 is a lawyer for the city 
his wife suggested he join the group after seeing an 
advertisement in a local paper inviting mothers with babies up to 
1 year old to come and relax with a cup of coffee and enjoy 
each others company while they care for their babies 
the ad said topics included easing the transition into 
parenthood new routines infants sleeping and eating habits 
talking to your pediatrician and choosing child care 
chaiken attended an open house and told social worker etty 
barshai who runs the group that he was interested in joining 
she said it was full and that i should check again in january 
chaiken said 
the center limits the group to 10 members there were four in 
the group the semester chaiken applied 
he said he continued asking questions about the group but i 
got the feeling she was uncomfortable 
the next day chaikens wife called to ask about joining and was 
told sure theres spots open why dont you come in for an 
interview when he confronted ms barshai she told him the 
group was only for mothers 
as a woman dodell said i understand some may feel 
uncomfortable at first but i think they should just give him a 
chance and see i really think they could benefit from his 
perspective 
but that she said is the emotional side of the issue 
legally she believes the center is plain wrong its a place 
of public accommodation and joel should be permitted in the group 
period 
riverdale neighborhood house is a nonprofit center that receives 
city and state funding for a variety of educational and support 
programs 
the state human rights agency agrees and will argue chaikens 
viewpoint at an as yet unscheduled hearing clavell said 
they placed an ad and said come one come all join us but 
when mr chaiken took them up on the offer they said oh no you 
have to be a woman when you invite the public that includes 
men clavell said 
donald cohn a vice president at the center and an attorney at 
the highpowered park avenue law firm of webster amp sheffield 
insists there was no discrimination 
he took advantage of other programs at riverdale house and he 
was invited to participate in other programs cohn said this 
one was just not appropriate for him 
after the hearing an administrative law judge will make a 
recommendation and state commissioner of human rights douglas white 
will issue a final order the case may take longer than a year to 
resolve 
chaiken realizes the decision will come too late to benefit 
benjamin who at 19 months old is already happily ensconced in a 
toddlers group albeit not at neighborhood house chaiken said he 
was allowed to join the toddler group at the center but was already 
committed to a different program 
so why are we fighting on were fighting on because this 
issue really has to be resolved said chaiken its really to 
help future fathers who stay at home so they wont have to go 
through this battle dodell added 
besides they said the decision may come in time for child no

outside contractors are demanding payment up 
front and city employees are being urged to write on both sides of 
their memos to save paper as philadelphia totters on the brink of 
insolvency 
and if the city doesnt pay certain bills that are due its out 
of toilet paper 
strangely there is no panic among city workers they say they 
have felt all along a bailout will come from somewhere before the 
paychecks stop and they must decide whether to work on faith alone 
as mayor w wilson goode said he expects them to 
employees said in interviews they and their colleagues feel that 
after tuesdays elections for governor and state lawmakers 
wednesday will be citysaving day 
until the election is over the democrats and republicans are 
looking at that rather than the crisis said john j shaw head 
of the police union after the election they will look for 
solutions and try to float the city again 
officials expect the cash to run out sometime next month 
besides the immediate cash flow problem officials also project a 
207 million deficit at the end of the year and an even bigger one 
the next year 
department heads are busy turning on immediate costcutting 
moves such as turning off office machines that use up paper 
supplies and electricity while crafting contingency plans for the 
day the checks bounce 
contractors and suppliers are demanding payment for new work up 
front and businesses like toilet paper suppliers wont deliver 
until back balances are paid 
just monday episcopal community service said it was cutting off 
services to new aids patients because the city has paid nothing on 
a 300000 june contract 
its a terrible choice to make said the rev gilbert avery 
who is in charge of the service which provides home meals and 
transportation to and from doctors offices for up to 100 people 
the 25000 city workers have organized no outside job pools 
resume services or other emergency plans for themselves many say 
they have considered the situation but see no reason to get too 
excited 
ive done most of my christmas shopping under the 
circumstances said deputy sheriff donald sicura 
the police the street cleaners even the auditors who add the 
numbers in city hall cling to the belief that philadelphias fiscal 
crisis will be resolved before december 
their faith is undeterred by goodes repeated denial that no 
secret rescue plan is in place and he has repeated his feeling that 
city workers should come to work even after the cash runs out in 
september city employees began finding letters in their pay 
envelopes that said the city would be unable to meet its payroll 
starting sometime in december 
the philadelphia inquirer reported last week that a secret plan 
already had been worked out and would be unveiled after tuesdays 
election goode again flatly denied any such plan 
and he reiterated his claim that no fullscale state bailout is 
necessary 
whatever pain were feeling now every other city will go 
through the same pain goode said in a recent interview and 
were going to recover faster and first and be stronger longer in 
my view 
philadelphia does not have a problem that is beyond the means 
of its politicians to solve he maintained 
not many believe the mayors denial saying its all just 
politics 
in the meantime in addition to costsaving measures and delayed 
payments to outside suppliers and contractors overtime has been 
cut off in most departments 
seasonal workers at fairmount park were laid off a month early 
the workers normally stay on until winter to help with trash 
removal and help plant the citys yearly allotment of 60000 to 
70000 bulbs 
in the courts 17 new judicial clerks missed a payday in 
september after the city finance director ruled they arrived after 
the citys hiring freeze sept 21 the clerks hired at salaries 
between 22000 and 25000 were kept on only after negotiations 
between city officials and court administrators 
leon walker 55 a court officer for 13 years is one of the few 
city workers who would say he has made plans to deal with a pay 
stoppage 
well the thing is i done paid my rent a month in advance 
he said last week as he ate his lunch on a bench outside city hall

a city that today is mired in debt litter 
and social ills will become the envy of other major cities in the 
years ahead mayor w wilson goode says 
goode looked at philadelphias financial crisis with optimism 
during a rare oneonone interview recently and maintained 
philadelphia is even now moving into position as a role model 
whatever pain were feeling now every other city will go 
through the same pain goode said and were going to recover 
faster and first and be stronger longer in my view 
however goode said longterm solutions are still to be worked 
out and until they are the city will continue to try to borrow 
enough to avoid going broke 
state involvement so far has been little more than a shadowy 
presence partially because of tuesdays elections for governor and 
the legislature 
despite republican campaign statements to the contrary 
philadelphia does not seek or expect a state bailout the mayor 
contends he also said he knows of no plan by gov robert p casey 
to provide one 
instead goode is looking for a little help from the state like 
changes in tax laws rather than a wholesale takeover 
philadelphia does not have a problem that is beyond the means 
of its politicians to solve he maintained 
he was also optimistic about loan opportunities investors 
shunned the citys attempt to borrow 375 million in september and 
goode would not say by what means the city would try to borrow in 
coming days 
to say that might mean that the people who are working with us 
might very well decid not to do it at this point he said 
the borrowing would be the first of a threepart solution goode 
said the other parts are to erase this years deficit and create a 
sound budget for the next fiscal year 
the process could be influenced by democrat caseys reelection 
bid against republican auditor general barbara hafer and contests 
for half the seats in the state senate and the entire state house 
the senate in harrisburg has 27 republicans and 23 democrats 
the house has 103 democrats 99 republicans and an empty seat 
if the democrats keep control over the state house and can 
gain control over the state senate and if bob casey is reelected 
by a mandate margin then i think that philadelphia stands in my 
opinion to gain a great deal from those elections goode said 
if casey wins and the power structure is unchanged in the house 
and senate i think it will be more difficult to get a consensus 
as to how best to deal with our problem he said 
if hafer wins the democratic mayor said he expects a stalemate 
one twist to the citys woes is that goode prevented by the 
city charter from seeking a third term next year is drawing some 
of his most visible support since the 1985 armed standoff with the 
move cult and the police bombing of their headquarters that killed 
11 people including five children 
several businesses and nonprofit institutions have prepaid 
taxes and about 400 people attended a rally on his behalf at a 
church 
i think there are a lot of people out there who feel ive 
become a victim of uncontrollable circumstances and therefore want 
to help me morally financially and governmentally to solve the 
problems goode said

the nations largest trash hauler 
seeking to avoid costly court battles has agreed to pay several 
customers 195 million to settle civil claims of price fixing 
waste management inc denied wrongdoing in reaching the 
settlement subsidiaries from california to new york had been 
targeted in federal antitrust investigations and in several 
markets where criminal charges were not brought the parent company 
faced civil action said spokesman william j plunkett 
our decision was made to avoid certain protracted and costly 
litigation plunkett said on monday 
the plaintiffs were never able to develop any information even 
suggesting antitrust conduct beyond the local markets to which our 
settlement monies will be distributed plunkett said 
we refused as a matter of principle to consider any payments 
to a nationwide class because we vigorously denied that there was 
any impropriety of that scale 
the suit was brought by a group of customers led by cumberland 
farms inc a canton mass convenience store operator waste 
management based in oak brook said the settlement received 
preliminary approval monday in us district court for the eastern 
district of pennsylvania 
the lawsuit contended that subsidiaries of waste management and 
browningferris industries the secondlargest trash hauler in the 
country conspired to fix prices for containerized waste disposal 
waste managements settlement money will be distributed in 13 
markets where antitrust investigations had been conducted the 
plaintiffs agreed to abandon all other claims against waste 
management 
officials at cumberland farms could not be reached for comment 
antitrust investigations resulted in criminal charges in seven 
markets against waste management subsidiaries 
in december 1989 two subsidiaries of waste management pleaded 
guilty to federal pricefixing charges in california and paid fines 
totalling 15 million 
in october 1987 subsidiaries of waste management pleaded guilty 
to similar charges in toledo ohio and the company paid 1 million 
in fines 
units of waste management also were convicted in 1984 in federal 
district court in atlanta of price fixing there 
the settlements applied to cases in toledo memphis tenn 
jacksonville orlando and dade and broward counties fla 
phoenix atlanta rochester ny three counties in southern

prudentialbache securities inc is laying off 
at least twothirds of its investment bankers and the head of its 
investment banking division has resigned from that post a 
published report said today

its 180 investment bankers the brokerage firm is effectively 
ending its fouryear effort to become a major investment bank

said prudentialbache was expected to settle several pending 
disciplinary cases with the new york stock exchange 
a spokeswoman for the firm eleanor mascheroni said she wasnt 
able to comment on the report of personnel moves and said it was 
premature to comment on the disciplinary cases 
in its story on the planned layoffs the journal said james f 
crowley has resigned as head of investment banking at the firm but 
will continue as a senior officer 
prudentialbache spent heavily four years ago to shore up its 
investment banking business and become one of the nations biggest 
investment banking firms by 1989 the brokerage had been geared 
toward small investors 
but the journal said prudentialbache chairman george ball said 
in an internal memorandum on oct 22 that the firm needs to cut 
1991 costs by 100 million and singled out the investment banking 
department

42nd on wall street in total value of completed deals such as 
mergers spinoffs and stock repurchases and was in the top 20 in 
the number of completed deals according to securities data co 
the journal and the times each reported that one of the cases 
the firm is expected to settle with thew nyse is related to a 
securities and exchange commission action the firm settled last 
year in which it was censured for incorrectly monitoring about 200 
million in customers securities 
prudentialbache has said that customers werent harmed by the 
monitoring problems

the united auto workers chrysler bargaining 
council has approved a new contract with the automaker that 
includes a 35hour workweek for workers at a minivan plant 
the new union contract includes a provision that will allow the 
35hour workweek for 3500 workers at chryslers st louis minivan 
plant 
that is a plum we were very happy to pluck off the tree uaw 
president owen bieber said monday certainly it is something we 
would look at with great delight in the future 
the unions chrysler bargaining council voted overwhelmingly 
monday to submit the tentative contract reached last tuesday for 
rankandfile ratification among about 63000 hourly and salaried 
chrysler workers that process is expected to be completed within 
two weeks 
last may at the uaws bargaining convention bieber and other 
union officials said they planned to negotiate nearly identical 
terms for each of the big three contracts 
the contract is similar to uaw agreements signed last month with 
general motors corp and ford motor co in all more than 450000 
active workers are covered by uaw agreements with the big three 
chrysler has been looking for ways to boost production at its 
st louis ii and windsor ontario minivan plants for more than a 
year the minivan is chryslers hottestselling vehicle more than 
300000 have already been sold this year 
a year ago the company and the uaw leadership tried to get 
members of local 110 to accept a scheduling scheme that would have 
included three crews working two shifts boosting production by 
about 20 percent 
the workers overwhelmingly rejected that idea saying it ate 
into their overtime that concern could be wiped out by the 35hour 
week for 40 hours of pay 
the tentative agreement will let the 3500 workers at the st 
louis ii plant vote to change their scheduling plan within 120 days 
of contract ratification 
otherwise in july 1991 the factory will change to a 
threeshift operation monday through friday with two ninehour 
production shifts on saturdays if the company chooses the saturday 
shifts will be paid at the full overtime rate 
elsewhere the chrysler contract contains many of the same 
provisions as the gm and ford agreements including a commitment to 
guarantee full pay for employees laid off for more than 36 weeks at 
factories closed because of slumping sales 
gm committed about 41 billion and ford said it would pay up to 
16 billion for the same program chryslers commitment is about 
659 million

a federal judge in atlanta has been chosen to 
hear a consolidated lawsuit alleging collusion and pricefixing 
among several of the nations air carriers and their computerized 
fare network 
the suit formed when 31 claims filed across the country were 
consolidated friday in us district court for the northern 
district of georgia alleges that the airlines signal fare changes 
to each other agree on price increases and threaten fare cuts via 
computer 
defendants in the case are usair northwest delta continental 
united twa and american airlines and the washingtonbased computer 
clearinghouse that links them airline tariff publishing co they 
deny wrongdoing 
the suit charges that as a result of the alleged collusion 
passengers are forced to pay artificially high ticket prices 
anyone who purchased a plane ticket since 1987 could potentially be 
a party in the suit 
the case was assigned to us district judge marvin h shoob 
when a panel of federal judges from around the nation decided 
friday that atlanta was easily accessible to all parties in the 
suit 
if shoob certifies the lawsuit as a class action a decision 
expected early next year the plaintiffs could number in the 
millions 
it could be the largest civil litigation ever in the history 
of atlanta if not the largest in the united states said w 
pitts carr the atlanta attorney who filed the first suit here last 
july 
in 1988 150 million tickets were sold so that would give you 
a rough idea of the possible magnitude of this case he said 
there are literally tens of millions of people or companies who 
are potential class members 
the defendants deny any collusion 
delta denies totally the allegations concerning our 
participation in any conspiracy to fix prices said edward b 
krugman one of the airlines attorneys 
the suit asks for undetermined damages that could be tripled 
under federal antitrust laws it also asks that the airlines be 
restrained from further violation of antitrust laws and that the 
computer network be restructured so as to discourage future 
collusion among airlines

the european community commission said 
tuesday it was satisfied that imports of an organic solvent from 
the united states would not threaten the trade blocs chemical 
industry 
in a statement the commission said that us manufacturers of 
the solvent called propan1ol would no longer have to set a 
minimum price on their product in the 12nation trade bloc 
propan1ol is used as a solvent in the printing and 
pharmaceutical industries and as an intermediary agent in the 
manufacture of pesticides 
following a complaint from the council of the european 
federation of chemical industries the commission began an inquiry 
into whether foreign manufacturers were dumping propan1ol on the 
european market at unjustifiably low prices in 1983 
us producers including eastman kodak co and union carbide 
corp subsequently agreed to set a minimum price on the chemical 
for five years ending in 1989 
at the end of 1988 the council asked the commission on behalf 
of ecs sole propan1ol maker basf ag of germany to investigate 
again the impact of the imports on free trade 
the commission concluded that imports of usmade propan1ol 
had been cut by nearly half over the fiveyear period to 4428 
metric tons in 1989 from 8738 tons in 1983 and no longer 
constituted a threat to ec manufacturers 
the profits made by the plaintiff industry have risen to a 
level where they must be considered satisfactory the commission 
said

wall streets leading commodity markets gave 
economically battered new york a welcome respite today promising 
to stay in the financial center after threatening to leave for a 
cheaper bigger home in new jersey 
the decision by the four exchanges which trade items ranging 
from crude oil to cocoa to gold was announced after an allnight 
bargaining session with new york city and state officials who gave 
the exchanges a generous package of tax breaks land and other 
incentives to build a new home here 
it is clear this is a longterm investment in the economic 
future of our city that we believe is worth making mayor david 
dinkins told a news conference this vote in the confidence of 
the future of our city is so very important 
the announcement is a relief for the city which is confronting 
an overall economic decline incited by a devastating recession on 
wall street that has persisted since the stock market crash three 
years ago 
thousands of people have been laid off in the financial 
district which also is home to the new york and american stock 
exchanges moreover the city is once again facing a looming 
financial crisis of its own reminiscent of the dark days when it 
verged on going broke in the 1970s 
the four commodity exchanges on the other hand have been 
straining to expand in order to compete with rival exchanges in 
chicago and elsewhere the new york commodity exchanges employ 
about 12000 people a figure that is expected to rise sharply in 
coming years in the battle for domination of that business they 
had threatened to leave the city unless they could work out an 
attractive deal to move into bigger quarters 
dinkins said exchanges generated more than 13 billion in 
economic activity annually and produce 165 million a year in city 
and state taxes even with all the abatements he said the overall 
package will not significantly affect the citys own budget crisis 
under the deal new york state and city will provide a total of 
145 million in incentives for the four exchanges to relocate from 
their cramped quarters at the world trade center to a new building 
to be constructed on an empty plot nearby to be completed in four 
years 
the total cost of the project was not determined officials 
said but the new trading floor alone is expected to cost of 225 
million the new site will triple the size of the exchanges total 
floor space to 12 million square feet 
the heads of the exchanges told the news conference theyll 
recommend to the membership that they move to the new site 
the exchanges had considered moving to the harborside financial 
center in jersey city nj their decision to remain in new york 
was unanimous 
although we seriously considered a move to jersey city we 
believe that the longterm needs of the exchanges wil be best 
served by staying in new york city the exchange leaders said 
at our new home in the heart of new yorks financial district 
the exchanges will have the space the flexibility and the 
stateoftheart technology we sorely need 
jersey city mayor gerald mccann was not immediately available 
for comment the citys offices were closed for election day and 
the mayor did not return a message left on his home telephone 
answering machine 
members of the exchanges will be asked to ratify the decision in 
december if they fail to do so the exchanges will remain at the 
world trade center 
the exchanges involved are the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
inc established in 1882 and the worlds leading market in those 
commodities the commodity exchange inc established in 1933 and 
the worlds most active metals market the new york cotton 
exchange established in 1870 and the worlds only raw cotton and 
citrus market and the new york mercantile exchange established in 
1872 and the worlds dominant energy market

tonights primetime election specials on the 
cbs and nbc television networks wont be sponsored although abcs 
coverage will have commercials 
the onehour nbc special and cbs two hours of election night 
coverage in prime time will be carried as sustaining or 
unsponsored representatives of both networks said 
this means the cbs and nbc broadcasts wont be counted in the 
current november ratings sweeps one of four key ratings 
periods each year that help network affilliates set their local 
advertising rates 
both nbc and cbs will use the time however to promote shows 
theyre broadcasting as the sweeps period continues this month 
nbc acted after cbs decided against seeking sponsorship for its 
election night program said an nbc executive who asked not to be 
identified it took that step because of the tight primetime 
ratings race of all three networks this season the executive said 
if nbcs coverage was sponsored and included in nielsen ratings 
low viewing levels the networks expect on election night might pull 
down nbcs overall ratings average for this week 
nbc again is first in primetime ratings this season but its 
margin over secondplace cbs is small 
according to ratings averages for the season through last 
sunday nbc has a 133 ratings average cbs a 130 and abc a 125 
each ratings point represents 931000 homes

several months ago bob israeloff sat down with 
the president of a long island hightech manufacturer who was 
looking for a new auditor 
the account would have generated 75000 a year in fees for 
israeloff trattner amp co a midsized accounting firm but after 
carefully reviewing the companys financial statements he turned 
the executive down 
it wasnt the first time a potential client sent up red flags in 
israeloffs mind like a growing number of accountants he was 
worried that doing business with the company might result in 
malpractice charges 
lawsuits targeting accountants filed by businesses challenging 
audits or shareholders claiming to have received faulty financial 
information are on the rise and the threat of litigation is 
having a chilling effect on the profession 
according to a recent survey by the new york insurance broker 
johnson amp higgins four out of five certified public accountants 
have cut back on the services they provide the poll of 500 
accountants nationwide also showed that 56 percent have ceased 
doing business with clients considered at high risk for 
initiating lawsuits and 98 percent ask clients to sign protective 
contracts before work begins 
allen berger a partner in chicagobased blackman kallick 
bartelstein said his firm declined an invitation to bid on 
auditing a savings and loan the thought of having your name in 
the newspapers just wasnt worth the return he said 
while sampls top the list of businesses being shunned the survey 
showed many accountants are steering clear of startups and 
companies considering initial public offerings as well 
fear of litigation comes at a time when accounting firms are 
squeezed for cash laventhol amp horwath the nations seventh 
largest accounting firm recently said it was under so much 
financial pressure that it was cutting the pay of its nearly 3500 
employees by 10 percent for three months 
philadelphiabased laventhol blamed the cuts on a deteriorating 
economy but the firm also has been hurt by unfavorable settlements 
and judgments only some of which were covered by insurance 
stemming from lawsuits challenging the quality of its audits 
laventhol went to trial last month in north carolina over the 
auditing of jim bakkers ptl ministry the suit which also named 
deloitte amp touche charged the firms oversaw a secret bank account 
that was used to pay bakker and others millions in bonuses the 
trial is still under way 
deloitte has had its own problems this summer the firm agreed 
to pay interregional financial group an audit client 1975 
million to end a 1986 lawsuit challenging its audits 
experts say some private settlements have reached the 
100million mark and more may be on the horizon federal 
regulators have brought nearly 1 billion in suits against major 
firms that audited failed thrifts 
time was when accountants pretty much accepted whoever walked 
in the door and didnt think much about liability problems said 
israeloff executive partner of the long island firm that bears his 
name 
but today because of the economy the sampl fiasco the 
depressed real estate market plaintiffs are striking out against 
accountants all over the place he said 
israeloff turned down the long island hightech maker after 
discovering the company had had two auditors in the past three 
years longterm relationships with accountants are the norm 
in addition it was a public company which increases the odds 
of outside parties suing you because financial statements are 
more widely circulated israeloff said many suits are brought by 
third parties who relied on accountants work when making 
investment decisions 
finally the company was not particularly healthy if a 
company is not doing well unfortunately people are going to blame 
the auditors even though we have nothing to do with how the 
company is run he said 
indeed jim williams who is representing deloitte in the ptl 
trial has said his client was not in the crystal ball business 
nor should it have been 
shareholder attorneys have little empathy arthur abbey a new 
york lawyer who specializes in suing accounting firms told the new 
york times earlier this year that in these very rough times 
accountants are very often the ones who know or should know 
whats going on abbey did not return calls to the associated 
press 
the key to avoiding lawsuits is screening clients carefully 
said philip zimmerman of the new york firm paneth haber amp 
zimmerman 
without revealing how many times his firm has been sued since it 
was formed 25 years ago zimmerman said he has settled only five 
cases and has won many more none of which had gone to trial 
scott rhine of the boca raton flabased firm rhine johnson amp 
co said his firm has been able to lessen our risk by becoming 
nicheoriented the firm evolved away from auditing to 
specializing in tax services 
accountants blame the plethora of lawsuits on a perception that 
they have deep pockets the corollary though undocumented is 
that not having insurance may be the best protection against 
litigation 
they dont want your house they want money one accountant 
said of those who sue professionals 
suits targeting accountants are expected to increase as the 
recession deepens malpractice insurance provides cpas with an 
essential comfort level but it comes at a high price 
in the mid1980s israeloff was paying about 30000 a year for 
7 million in coverage today hes shelling out 200000 for 5 
million in coverage and his deductible has risen considerably 
liability insurance usually is a firms no 3 cost behind 
compensation and rent annual premiums can consume up to 5 percent 
of a firms total fees and perhaps as much as 25 percent of 
partners pretax profits 
most accountants say they will need increased insurance 
protection in the coming years and clients ultimately will pay for 
it 
accountants may be growing more wary of their clients but no 
one suggests that the day will come when a company will find itself 
unable to secure an auditor there is always someone willing to 
take on the job 
but accountants do agree that the best firms probably wont take 
on the riskiest work

the thought of being held liable for the deeds 
of others is enough to make anybody nervous when it comes to 
tempermentally conservative accountants theyre shivering in their 
boots 
because most state laws require accountants and their firms to 
operate as private partnerships they are deprived of the limited 
liability enjoyed by corporations that puts a partners personal 
net worth on the line every time a lawsuit is filed 
it would not be unheard of under current law for a certified 
public accountant in texas to be held accountable for an audit 
conducted by a partner in his firms boston office a partner the 
texas cpa may not have known 
most practicing accountants would consider the risk of legal 
liability one of the largest concerns facing the profession and 
themselves individually said bob mednick a partner in arthur 
andersen amp cos chicago headquarters and chairman of the american 
institute of certified public accountants legal liability 
committee 
under general partnership laws if the assets of the 
partnership are not sufficient to satisfy a judgment then the 
plaintiff can go after the personal assets of individual partners 
including those who dont even know the plaintiff is a client 
mednick said 
the issue is becoming more critical as lawsuits against 
accountants mount arthur bowman who publishes an atlantabased 
industry newsletter estimated that partner income fell 25000 
from an average 135000 at laventhol amp horwath because of rising 
litigation and settlements 
members of the aicpa will soon be asked to vote on amending the 
groups code of professional conduct to allow accounting firms to 
function as limited liability corporations 
ballots are to be mailed out early next year to the groups 
300000plus membership although about 50 percent work for 
corporations the government or in academia and therefore are 
unaffected by the liability issue it is widely anticipated the 
vote will pass 
but a favorable vote will only serve as ammunition to be hurled 
at lawmakers who will have to amend their own state statutes to 
permit the change mednick said 
hopefully this vote will act as a catalyst to achieve change 
at the state legislative level he said even after laws are 
changed it would be up to individual accountants and firms to 
comply 
no matter how unfavorable state laws appear they only mirror 
accountants own creed decades ago long before litigation became 
an issue accountants instituted a professional code that held them 
personally liable for their work 
accountants vouch for the accuracy of financial statements used 
by the public and the thought was that we want to tell the 
public we stand by our work all the way down to our personal 
assets mednick said 
in these litigious times that desire has come back to haunt 
them 
like banks that have had to establish reserves to cover bad 
third world loans some accounting firms are setting aside funds to 
pay for the uninsured portions of any judgments against them

londons stock exchange confirmed tuesday it was 
investigating more than a dozen suspected bear raids in which 
stock manipulators illegally profit by spreading malicious rumors 
about companies 
it is certainly true that there have been a growing number of 
complaints said a stock exchange spokeswoman who was not 
identified in accordance with exchange practice 
what we have to do is investigate to see if there is a 
foundation in those allegations she said 
polly peck plc and peninsular amp oriental steam navigation co 
are among the companies whose share trading is being investigated 
by the exchange company and exchange sources said anonymously 
polly pecks administrators declined to comment although 
chairman asil nadir has blamed his companys recent spectacular 
collapse on false rumors polly peck which owns the del monte 
fresh fruit and sansui hifi businesses is now in the hands of 
courtappointed administrators after its share price plummeted 55 
percent in one day 
peninsular amp oriental said it had no comment other than that 
recent rumors about the shipping and property company have been 
false the companys shares fell sharply two weeks in october on 
rumors that the company was selling new stock to sha with the rumor that 
the chairman has been 
assassinated or has died it certainly has an impact on the 
companys shares nadir said 
while such rumors existed the market also was disturbed by the 
news that nadir was interviewed by the serious fraud office the 
same day and that the fraud office had raided a nadirlinked 
company the previous day 
nadir who has denied any wrongdoing said it was common 
knowledge that illegal bear raids go on constantly and that it 
was more than a suspicion

zenith electronics corp said tuesday it 
received a 1 million grant from the state of illinois to develop 
new manufacturing processes for highdefinition television 
monitors 
the grant from the illinois technology challenge grant program 
will augment zeniths 50 million commitment to hdtv the emerging 
television technology on which the last us consumer television 
maker is betting its future 
highdefinition television featuring picture clarity like 35mm 
photographs and sound like that of compact disks is perceived as 
the future of the television industry 
zenith is competing with larger and betterfinanced foreign 
manufacturers to develop an hdtv system that it hopes will be 
chosen as the us standard 
zenith based in this chicago suburb said in a statement that 
the grant will support its development of manufacturing technology 
for the companys patented flat tension mask picture tubes for 
computer monitors and eventually for hdtv sets 
zenith said foreign companies are building or recently completed 
six largescreen color picture tube plants in the united states 
the company said it plans to leapfrog over the foreign 
competition with new production processes 
in august the defense department said it would give zenith more 
than 1 million in research funds for flat tension mask technology 
with military applications 
zeniths bid to succeed through hdtv is regarded by many 
analysts as a long shot the company lost money four of the last 
five years and rolled up a net loss of 268 million from 
continuing operations through the first nine month of 1990 
zenith also faces a possible takeover bid by new jersey 
manufacturer nycor inc nycor recently disclosed it owns 82 
percent of zeniths common stock and said it is considering 
acquiring the company

the european community late today 
approved a plan for modest cuts in government farm payments 
breaking a nearly monthlong deadlock that had threatened the 
collapse of world trade talks 
agriculture and trade ministers of the 12nation trading bloc 
endorsed a carefully worded proposal that sought to ease fears of 
many governments that their farmers would be severely hurt by the 
reductions 
what we have offered is a very considerable proposal said 
british agriculture secretary john gummer after two days of 
bargaining 
the proposal will now be presented to negotiators in the uruguay 
round talks an ambitious fouryear effort to overhaul the world 
trading system 
the agreement came after a second day of bargaining among the 
ministers agonizing over a way to remove one of the most emotional 
obstacles to easing world trade tensions the generous subsidies 
paid to european farmers six previous attempts to find a solution 
ended in failure 
at issue was a proposal to pare subsidies on farm crops by 30 
percent over 10 years starting in 1986 some reductions have 
already been made 
the trading bloc was under international pressure to resolve the 
dispute which has threatened the outcome of the uruguay round of 
negotiations an ambitious fouryear effort to overhaul the world 
trade system 
agriculture is one of 15 areas under discussion in the trade 
negotiations which began in 1986 in the uruguayan resort of punta 
del este 
but the united states australia argentina and others insist it 
holds the key to liberalizing trade in other areas including 
textiles manufactured goods and services such as 
telecommunications and banking argentina has even threatened to 
walk out of the round if deep cuts are not made in farm subsidies 
on monday the 14 nations of the cairns group led by australia 
said if no real progress were made in the agriculture talks by 
midnovember they would have to reassess their position on the 
final round of bargaining set to get under way in early december 
in brussels 
us trade representative carla hills said she hoped the 
european community will heed the cairns groups call to negotiate 
fundamental agricultural reform 
the success of the uruguay round now hangs in the balance 
she said monday in geneva 
the new ec proposal will be be submitted to the trade talks as 
the communitys opening position in the final round of bargaining 
the community is the only participant that has not yet put its 
offer on the table the deadline was oct 15 
the bush administration wants its trading partners to slash farm 
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent 
over a 10year period starting in 1991 
the uruguay round is held under the auspices of the 100nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and an accord for 
freer world trade

soybean futures prices fell to their lowest 
levels in eight months tuesday on the chicago board of trade as 
signs of slack demand and large yields prompted selling and 
profittaking 
wheat futures ended slightly higher corn was slightly lower 
a survey of grain analysts revealed that most experts expect the 
agriculture department to raise its 1990 us soybean crop estimate 
thursday from last months projection of 182 billion bushels 
the private estimates averaged 184 billion bushels but at least 
one respected firm memphisbased sparks commodities inc expects 
a harvest of 19 billion bushels 
don roose an analyst with us commodities inc in des moines 
iowa said further selling was prompted by sluggish export sales of 
us soybeans and by technical chartbased factors 
i do think the overall psychology in the market is bearish 
roose said weve got an overabundant amount of bearishness 
coming at us right now 
at the close soybean futures were 7 cents lower to 1 cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in november at 576 a

financiallyailing continental airlines yanked 
the honolulutokyo leg of its houstontokyo route from a list of 
assets it may sell saying tuesday that the hardwon route is too 
important to put on the block 
the decision came just days after continental president hollis 
harris told local business leaders the airline may have to sell 
some international routes and possibly implement layoffs to cope 
with skyrocketing fuel prices 
harris said then that one plan under consideration was selling 
continentals air micronesia the carriers pacific service 
operation air micronesia holds the authority to fly from honolulu 
to tokyo 
but continental said monday it had decided not to slll that leg 
which began service four months ago 
we decided against it because it is of great importance here 
in our hometown continental spokesman art kent said tuesday 
kent noted that local business and civic leaders worked with 
airline officials for 24 years to get direct air service between 
houston and tokyo there are a large number of businesses here and 
the potential for industrial growth is very important 
the route also ferries japanese vacationers to one of hawaiis 
prime holiday spots 
harris said last week that the honolulutokyo route might 
have to be included in asset sales but after further 
consideration we decided that this direct service is just too 
important to our community and to continental so we decided to 
take it off the block kent said 
jim kollaer president of the greater houston partnership noted 
that the route helps foster business with japan about 125 japanese 
companies do business in the city 
although continental can fly under its own authority from 
houston to honolulu air micronesia holds the governmental 
authority to fly from honolulu to tokyo the most lucrative leg of 
the trip 
continental officials have negotiated with air micronesia and 
received approval to separate the honolulutokyo route from any 
future sale of the partnership 
the carrier also said it has been reviewing several options for 
dealing with monthly fuel bills which have risen substantially 
since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 continental said its october bill 
was 70 million more than it paid in july 
last month continentals board of directors considered filing 
for bankruptcy protection because of the rising fuel bills the 
result of the continuing persian gulf crisis but it opted to sell 
off assets and undertake other measures to remain afloat

kellogg co which has seen 
privatelabel brands take a bite out of sales of its most popular 
cereals is making its latest price increase a bit easier for 
consumers to swallow 
the worlds largest cereal maker said tuesday it has raised 
prices on most of its products an average of 37 percent but is 
exempting corn flakes for the second straight year and frosted 
flakes two of its biggest sellers 
because those cereals and some smaller brands were omitted from 
the increase the net price increase is about 28 percent kellogg 
spokesman richard lovell said tuesday the increase took effect 
saturday 
william e lamothe kelloggs chairman and chief executive 
officer told industry analysts last week that since 1987 
privatelabel versions had increased their market share to 62 
percent from 36 percent largely at the expense of corn flakes 
frosted flakes rice krispies raisin bran and froot loops 
lamothe told the analysts that in response to very competitive 
conditions including competition from unbranded products wed be 
very conservative in our increases lovell said 
over the last couple of years kellogg has seen its market share 
dip from about 41 percent to 38 percent of the approximately 7 
billion readytoeat domestic cereal industry the industry has 
been relatively flat this year after a few years of hefty sales 
growth analysts said 
kelloggs increase is well below the average 59 percent 
increase rival general mills inc announced oct 19 however 
analysts noted kellogg raised its prices an average of 22 percent 
last spring while general mills last increase was in november 
1989 
ralstonpurina co which makes about half of all cereal sold to 
private companies for sale under their own labels also is gaining 
ground with such novelty childrens products as teenage mutant 
ninja turtles and batman cereals said john c maxwell jr cereal 
analyst for wheat first securities of richmond va 
but maxwell said minneapolisbased general mills is in the 
best position for the 1990s with the popularity of oatbased 
cereals such as cheerios still on the rise 
if it doesnt say bran or oats on the label people arent 
buying maxwell said unless kellogg develops new products to 
offset the decline in older brands theyre going to be in 
trouble 
however lamothe told analysts last week that new products 
because of their increased cost and riskiness probably would not 
be a key to regaining market share 
analyst edward eyring of argus research corp in new york said 
his company recently has taken a more bullish view of kellogg and 
thinks the relatively conservative price increase is a step in 
the right direction 
we think kellogg has untapped potential he said we have 
confidence that the company will be able to successfully tap the 
international market for cereals as it intends to do and weather 
the competitive pressures that private brands are putting on it

the european community late tuesday 
approved modest cuts in government farm payments breaking a nearly 
monthlong deadlock that had threatened to end world trade talks 
the agreement was reached on the communitys seventh attempt to 
endorse the proposal the plan would pare subsidies on major farm 
crops by 30 percent over 10 years starting in 1986 some 
reductions have already been made 
its unlikely though that the offer will be received warmly by 
the united states and other nations the bush administration wants 
its trading partners to slash farm income supports by 75 percent 
and export subsidies by 90 percent over 10 years starting in 1991 
but italian trade minister renato ruggiero cautioned it would 
be a grave error on the part of our trading partners to judge that 
this position is not one of great openness and ambition 
the plan will now be presented to negotiators in the uruguay 
round talks an ambitious fouryear effort by 100 nations to 
overhaul the world trading system 
the community is the last major player to put its offer on the 
bargaining table it missed an oct 15 deadline for submitting 
positions for the final round of negotiations which begin next 
month 
the proposal endorsed tuesday by ministers from the 12nation 
trading bloc seeks to ease fears that the nations farmers would be 
hurt severely by the subsidy cuts 
the plan includes assurances to not only compensate farmers for 
income losses but also to assure that cheaper imported goods will 
not push homegrown products off the market 
it also pledges to limit the impact on poor regions in the 
european community and to soften proposed cuts in supports for 
olive oil and other products grown in mediterranean countries 
after long negotiations we got very good improvements said 
german agriculture minister ignaz kiechle whose country along with 
france had been balking at bigger cuts we can say to our farmers 
that they will have compensation for the 30 percent reductions 
french agriculture minister louis mermaz described the outcome 
as excellent 
we have to look the americans straight in the face we are not 
going to buy from them what we make ourselves he added 
british agriculture secretary john gummer whose government had 
been opposing french and german efforts to weaken the plan said 
there was little change in the original proposal 
but he said the communitys drawnout discussions indicated that 
further cuts would be very hard to negotiate 
it is clear from the negotiations that the european community 
does find reductions in support extremely difficult he 
told reporters 
the trading bloc was under international pressure to resolve the 
dispute agriculture is one of 15 areas under discussion in the 
trade negotiations and the united states australia and argentina 
insist it holds the key to liberalizing trade in other areas from 
textiles and services to telecommunications and banking 
argentina has even threatened to walk out of the round if deep 
cuts are not made in farm subsidies 
on monday the 14 nations of the cairns group led by australia 
said if no real progress were made in the agriculture talks by 
midnovember they would have to reassess their position on 
the final bargaining round 
in delaying the agreement the french and german governments 
voiced different concerns 
germany whose government is worried about the farming coalition 
in dec 2 elections insisted on compensatory measures to make up 
for any income losses to farmers 
france the ecs chief farm exporter argued the plan could 
lower trade barriers so much that cheaper imported goods could 
flood the trading bloc 
the uruguay round is held under the auspices of the 100nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and an accord for 
freer world trade

american workers productivity climbed at the 
fastest pace in two years during the julyseptember quarter but 
hours worked fell the government said tuesday in a sign that the 
economic slowdown is forcing businesses to make do with fewer 
employees 
the good news is that productivity is up the bad news is 
were in a recession said economist michael k evans a 
washingtonbased consultant 
in the third quarter nonfarm productivity output per hour of 
work advanced at a 16 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate 
compared with the previous threemonth period it was the third 
straight quarter in which productivity improved from the previous 
threemonth period and the best pace since the julyseptember 
quarter of 1988 
productivity rose 03 percent in the second quarter fell 13 
percent in the first quarter and dropped 25 percent in the fourth 
quarter of last year 
however the number of hours worked edged down 01 percent in 
the third quarter the first decline in more than four years 
economists say this shows that employers are coping with economic 
sluggishness with layoffs hiring freezes and limits on overtime 
whats happened here is that in 1989 the economy was very 
weak but business optimism was still strong and businesses didnt 
lay off people evans said productivity has picked up because 
they are laying off people who should have been laid off last 
year 
despite the improvement productivity is still well below the 
level needed to significantly boost americans living standard 
according to most economists 
its better but subpar said economist allen sinai of the 
boston co 
increased productivity or getting each worker to produce more 
during each hour of work is vital to increasing the nations 
standard of living without inflation 
nonfarm productivity is increasing at an average annual pace of 
02 percent so far this year compared with a 07 percent decline 
for all of last year 
since 1982 productivity growth has averaged 16 percent a year 
better than the 12 percent average in the 1970s but far worse 
than the 25 percent annual gain posted from 1947 to 1967 
sinai said manufacturing where productivity leapt at a 56 
percent annual rate in the third quarter compared with 26 percent 
for all of last year is making impressive gains however 
productivity growth in the service sector which accounts for a 
much larger share of the economy remains dismal he said 
a fundamental improvement in education increased investment in 
new technology and better roads and other public infrastructure are 
needed in the long term to improve services productivity sinai 
said 
in the meantime the squeeze of a recession will force 
services to do more with less but thats a painful way to 
get productivity growth up he said 
meanwhile hourly labor costs a major indication of inflation 
for businesses shot up 45 percent in the third quarter that was 
an improvement over the 5 percent rate in the second quarter but 
still worse than the 32 percent increase for all of 1989 
unit labor costs a key gauge of future price inflation rose 
28 percent in the third quarter compared with 47 percent in the 
second quarter unit labor costs averaged 39 percent in the 1989 
total business productivity including farming rose 19 percent 
in the third quarter

standard amp poors corp lowered its ratings 
tuesday on about 17 billion in debt issued by harcourt brace 
jovanovich inc the publishing and insurance giant 
the ratings agency said business setbacks last year in the 
companys flagship elementary reading program hobbles growth for 
the firm and a heavy debt service commitment due in 1993 
increases chances that the company will have to undergo a debt 
restructuring or sell assets before then 
the agency said it was lowering its ratings on 200 million in 
senior unsecured notes to ccc from bminus and on 15 billion in 
subordinated debt to cccminus from cccplus 
under the agencys ratings system debt with a ccc rating is 
seen as predominantly speculative with respect to its ability to 
pay interest and repay principal according to the terms 
a debt rating is one of the features that determines the price 
of a bond in the marketplace 
harcourt based on orlando fla took on a heavy debt load in 
may 1987 when it underwent a restructuring and paid a special 
dividend that effectively warded off a hostile takeover bid from 
british media baron robert maxwell 
harcourt said in a statement it was disappointed by the agencys 
ratings action but pointed out that the agency noted that 
harcourts operating profit had resumed growth 
harcourt said it was making adequate capital investments to 
produce a competitive elementary reading program in 1992 and 
noted that it recently hired the investment firm smith barney 
harris upham amp co to explore alternatives for dealing with 
harcourts heavy debt 
for the first six months of the fiscal year through june 30 
harcourt lost 949 million or 147 a share on revenue of 6254 
million it lost 1587 million or 277 a share on revenue of 
570 million a year earlier

multinational military force in saudi arabia will soon attack iraqi 
troops in occupied kuwait 
randolph donney chief commodities analyst with the pegasus 
econometric group in hoboken nj said some observers expect an 
offensive to be launched as soon as this weekend 
he said the rally was fueled by signs the soviet union may be 
willing to send troops to the region to bolster the un force and 
by perceptions that secretary of state james a baker iii was 
laying down the ground rules for an attack during his visit to 
us allies in the middle east 
other analysts cited the views of some military strategists that 
a military strike would best be launched in november before the 
desert winter sets in 
there are lot of things coming into play and i think youre 
getting a little bit of a war scare there donney said gold is 
often viewed as a safe investment haven in times of international 
crisis 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc 
linked further buying to signs of firming demand for gold at the 
recent low prices and to positionevening ahead of fridays 
expiration of december gold options on the commodity exchange 
oil futures ended mostly higher on the new york merc where 
warrelated buying interest was tempered by ideas that oil supplies 
might not tighten as much as previously thought in the event of 
middle east war 
after the close the american petroleum institute reported that 
us supplies of crude oil rose by 5 million barrels last week 
surprising market analysts who had expected a decline of up to 2 
million barrels 
light sweet crude oil settled 43 cents lower to 67 cents higher

cents a pound and all pork belly contracts soared the 2 
centsapound limit on signs of slow slaughter rates and ideas the

pork contracts snow and cold could further slow the movement of 
hogs to market

november at 8790 cents a pund 
soybean futures prices fell to their lowest levels in eight 
months on the chicago board of trade as signs of slack demand and 
large yields prompted selling and profittaking wheat futures 
ended slightly higher corn was slightly lower 
a survey of grain analysts revealed that most experts expect the 
agriculture department to raise its 1990 us soybean crop estimate 
thursday from last months projection of 182 billion bushels 
the private estimates averaged 184 billion bushels but at least 
one respected firm memphisbased sparks commodities inc expects 
a harvest of 19 billion bushels

the dollar rose tuesday on concerns about the 
middle east crisis and on technical buying by traders adjusting 
their positions in advance of the results of the days elections 
gold prices moved sharply higher largely on technical factors 
currency traders bought dollars aggressively on news that the 
us might send more troops to the middle east and on speculation 
about unrest in the soviet union 
the marine corps said it was calling up more than 600 reservists 
from eight states for combat roles in the persian gulf meanwhile 
clashes continued among several ethnic groups in the soviet union 
the dollar tends to rise in times of political uncertainty 
overseas because it is generally seen as a relatively safe 
investment furthermore crude oil is bought and sold in dollars 
so if an outbreak of war in the middle east sends oil prices 
skyrocketing there will be more demand for the us currency 
in addition analysts said traders were buying dollars to hedge 
their positions pending the outcome of tuesdays election with its 
potential to redistribute political power by carving up key 
election districts 
just that uncertainty makes people cover up their short 
positions said karen gibbs a currency analyst at dean witter 
reynolds inc 
in earlier overseas trading the dollar was little changed 
because of market fears of a us recession and anticipation of 
subsequent cuts in us interest rates 
a reduction in interest rates dampens demand for us 
investments and therefore sends the dollar downward 
the dollar rose against the japanese yen in new york closing at 
12815 yen up from late mondays 12655 in overnight trading in 
tokyo the dollar fell to 12720 yen from 12735 yen monday and in 
london it was quoted at 12725 yen 
the british pound fell to 19657 in new york from 19740 
monday and in earlier london trading sterling fell to 19635 
from late mondays 19675 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with mondays late 
rates included 14927 german marks up from 14850 12545 swiss 
francs up from 12505 50055 french francs up from 49810 
112100 italian lire up from 111600 and 116295 canadian 
dollars up from 115875 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late mondays 
prices included 14875 german marks down from 14880 12505 
swiss francs unchanged 49885 french francs down from 49875 
16768 dutch guilders up from 16765 111675 italian lire up 
from 111625 and 11609 canadian dollars up from 11586 
gold rose sharply in domestic trading climbing 710 a troy 
ounce to 38660 on the commodity exchange in new york republic 
national bank of new york later quoted a bid of 38560 up 695 
analysts said gold rose on unconfirmed rumors of a large middle 
eastern buy order 
in earlier trading in london gold rose to a late bid price of 
38025 a troy ounce up from 37725 late monday in zurich the 
metal rose to a closing bid of 37950 up from 37630 late 
monday 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 420 to close at a bid

oil prices meandered in slow trading tuesday and 
finished mixed depressed on the one hand by evidence of ample 
supply and declining demand boosted on the other hand by 
speculation about persian gulf war 
the market is divided equally between fundamentals and middle 
east concern said bob baker a trading strategist at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
on the new york mercantile exchange the key market for 
petroleum futures contracts the december delivery price of 
benchmark light sweet crude rose 67 cents a barrel to 3263 but 
the price for oil to be delivered through later winter months 
closed lower 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale home 
heating oil for december delivery rose 192 cents a gallon to 8638 
cents laterdelivery month contracts also rose 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for december delivery rose 21 cent 
a gallon to 8775 cents while laterdelivery months were 99 cent 
higher to 50 cent lower natural gas for december delivery fell 
02 cent per 1000 cubic feet to 2383 while laterdelivery 
months all rose slightly 
the oil market has been transfixed on developments in the 
persian gulf since iraqi leader saddam husseins forces seized 
kuwait three months ago inciting world condemnation a trade 
embargo and a usled military expedition into neighboring saudi 
arabia 
crude prices went from about 20 a barrel to more than 40 but 
have since retreated into the 30 range largely because no shots 
have been fired and other oil producers have filled the vacuum 
caused by the absence of kuwaiti and iraqi crude 
moreover demand for petroleum has fallen since the crisis 
began putting further pressure on prices to fall many oiltrading 
strategists agree that the only thing propping prices at current 
levels is what they call a war premium 
in the past there was fear that if we did drift into war 
prices would take off said peter beutel an oil analyst with 
pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj at this stage 
people are saying on one hand we have plenty of oil but on 
another hand were going to have to deal with saddam hussein sooner 
or later 
some traders said business was slow tuesday because of the 
impending release of weekly figures of us energy supplies and 
production from the american petroleum institute a washington 
trade group 
the statistics released after trading finished for the day 
showed stocks of crude oil and gasoline rose in the week ended nov 
2 vs a week earlier while the supply of home heating oil remained 
steady the figures also showed crude imports increased to 59 
million barrels a day from 51 million barrels a day the previous 
week 
the figures substantiated the view that the nations energy 
supplies remain plentiful and that foreign exporters have 
alleviated any shortfall caused by the gulf standoff 
in another sign of easing pressure on prices the american 
automobile association reported tuesday that the average price of 
selfserve regular unleaded gasoline fell 3 cent per gallon last 
week to 1377 it was the first weekly drop since a 2 cent 
decline sept 18 
aaas survey based on a nationwide spot check of stations 
still shows the average price of gasoline has increased 302 cents 
since aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait

an atlanta federal judge will hear a consolidated 
lawsuit alleging collusion and pricefixing by some of the nations 
major airlines and their computerized fare network 
the suit was formed when 31 claims filed nationwide were 
consolidated friday in us district court for the northern 
district of georgia it alleges the airlines use computers to 
signal fare changes to each other agree on price increases and 
threaten fare cuts

passengers are forced to pay artificially high ticket prices 
the defendants are usair northwest delta continental united 
twa and american airlines and the washingtonbased computer 
clearinghouse airline tariff publishing co 
the case was assigned to us district judge marvin h shoob 
after a panel of federal judges decided atlanta was most accessible 
to all parties in the suit 
if shoob certifies the suit as a class action a decision thats 
expected early next year the plaintiffs could number in the 
millions customers who purchased a plane ticket since 1987 could 
potentially be a party to the suit 
in 1988 150 million tickets were sold so that would give you 
a rough idea of the possible magnitude of this case said w 
pitts carr the atlanta attorney who filed the first suit here last 
july there are literally tens of millions of people or companies 
who are potential class members 
the defendants deny the charges 
delta denies totally the allegations concerning our 
participation in any conspiracy to fix prices said edward b 
krugman one of the airlines attorneys 
spokespeople for united usair and northwest declined comment 
continental also declined comment but spokesman art kent added 
we have gone on record before as saying there is no price 
collusion and we set our prices according to the market 
the suit seeks undetermined damages that could be tripled under 
federal antitrust laws it also asks that the airlines be 
restrained from further violation of antitrust laws and that the 
computer network be restructured so as to discourage future 
collusion among airlines

the staff of the national labor relations 
board is bringing additional charges of unfair labor practice 
against greyhound lines the board announced tuesday 
the charges result from complaints by the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions whose 6000 drivers went on strike in march 
over wages and job security issues the company contends they no 
longer have jobs because the bus line has hired replacements 
jerry m hunter general counsel of the board said he has 
authorized the nlrbs milwaukee office to file additional charges 
in 16 cases around the country the new charges will allege that 
greyhound unlawfully fired strikers because of union activities 
coerced employees through the throwing of rocks at strikers by 
company guards threatened strikers and refused to provide the 
union with information he said 
the new charges will be consolidated with the original complaint 
filed by the milwaukee office at hunters recommendation that 
complaint filed in may accused greyhound of putting its final 
bargaining proposal into effect before a breakdown in talks and 
said the strike was the result of an unfair labor practice 
if the general counsel prevails before the fivemember board 
the original complaint could result in an order to reinstate the 
strikers with back pay 
still other accusations against the company by the union remain 
to be investigated and will require postponing a hearing before an 
administrative law judge on the original complaint from nov 29 to 
jan 15 
in dallas liz dunn a spokeswoman for the company said 
greyhound had not seen the original complaint but greyhound 
fully expects to prevail when we have an opportunity to present the 
case 
she said the new charges would not affect the filing of a 
reorganization plan with a bankruptcy court later this month the 
company has been operating under court protection from creditors
