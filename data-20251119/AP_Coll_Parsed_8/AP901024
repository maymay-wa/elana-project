a judge who admitted being married to two 
women at the same time was suspended wednesday by the oregon 
supreme court 
multnomah county district judge robert kirkman will be suspended 
with pay effective monday pending a final decision by the court 
the supreme court action came after the oregon judicial fitness 
commission unanimously recommended he be removed from office for 
premeditated and calculating criminal misconduct 
during the commissions disciplinary hearing in september 
kirkman 47 admitted he was married to two women at the same time 
he also admitted he had shown his second wife a forged divorce 
decree before he married her 
kirkman showed jane kingsbury his second wife the forged 
divorce decree in 1984 they were married in april 1987 by 
kirkmans boss judge donald londer 
later that year the marriage was annulled after kingsbury 
learned that kirkman was still married to his first wife sue 
it was not very smart going through the ceremony and it was 
not very smart to ask judge londer to perform the ceremony 
kirkman admitted in september 
kirkman and kingsbury remarried the following january shortly 
after his divorce from his first wife was final 
based on kirkmans admissions the commission found that he 
forged a court document that he falsely represented on a marriage 
license that he was divorced and that he remarried while still 
married to his first wife 
to his credit judge kirkman admitted that he knew his 
behavior was wrong and illegal when he committed it the 
commission found 
the supreme court said a hearing to make a final ruling probably 
will be held in januay possible sanctions range from reprimand to 
removal from office the commissions findings are only advisory to 
the supreme court 
judge kirkman has conducted his personal life in a way that 
has brought discredit and dishonor both to himself and to the 
judicial system the judicial fitness commission said 
kirkmans attorney said he would ask the supreme court for a 
lesser penalty 
naturally we are quite disappointed said garr m king who 
represented kirkman at the commission hearing

grounded four months by hydrogen 
leaks atlantis has been declared fit to fly and is being readied 
for a secret mission to put a satellite in orbit reportedly to spy 
on iraq 
nasa found the shuttle free of dangerous leaks during a fueling 
test wednesday and almost immediately began working toward a nov 9 
or 10 launch 
frankly we expected the system to be tight we put a lot of 
work into it said nasa deputy administrator jr thompson 
were looking forward to a good launch 
it was welcome news for the space agency which has come under 
fire in the past halfyear because of shuttle trouble the hubble 
space telescopes flawed mirror and communication problems with the 
venusorbiting magellan spacecraft 
atlantis military mission the fifth shuttle flight this year 
will carry five astronauts and a satellite that civilian experts 
said will spy on iraqi forces the mission originally was scheduled 
for july but was delayed by leaks discovered in june 
launch director bob sieck said small amounts of hydrogen escaped 
during the test into atlantis engine compartment and around a 
17inchdiameter valve between the orbiter and external tank the 
site of earlier problems but he said the leaks were well within 
allowable limits 
nasa had replaced atlantis external tank some fuel lines and 
seals in the valve to try to stop the leaks 
its always nice to have a successful test under your belt 
sieck said that just leaves one more to go and thats columbia 
we think weve got that one 
columbia grounded by hydrogen leaks since may will undergo a 
more extensive fueling test next week nearly a dozen tv cameras 
will be mounted in the engine compartment to help track any leaks 
columbia could lift off with the astro observatory as early as 
december if the shuttle passes the test sieck said since the last 
launch attempt workers have replaced a crushed seal and tightened 
joints 
i hope we can get two more off this year i believe we can 
thompson said if we can accomplish all that as you look back on 
it i think it would have been a good year 
nasa stopped trying to launch columbia after four tries and 
instead got discovery up on oct 6 with a satellite that will study 
the suns poles 
discoverys mission ended a 5month grounding of the fleet the 
second longest in shuttle history

the street kids of lima are called 
piranhas for the amazon fish that can strip a swimmer of flesh 
in minutes they swarm over victims in packs snatching wallets 
purses and jewelry 
freddy lives in university park downtown lima his clothes are 
torn and dirty he has a long deep red cut on his right ear but 
no open sores on his face like some of the others 
he is 11 years old like the other kids freddy sniffs glue to 
get high or quiet his hunger 
hundreds of children roam the garbagefilled streets of lima 
willing even to sell their bodies for enough to buy some food and 
glue without help most probably will die soon or end up in perus 
infamous prisons 
many of the kids have venereal disease some have aids and all 
of them have some kind of skin infection said dwight ordonez 
head of a project called ninos de la calle street kids that is 
trying to help 
peru is in its worst economic crisis and thousands of children 
hustle a living on the streets of lima a city of 7 million 
children of 5 or 6 hawk cigarettes shine shoes or wash cars 
most go home at night even if home is only a shack 
for the hundreds of piranhas there is no home they live in 
parks plazas on the river bank behind the government palace 
packs of them roam la parada a huge food market frequented by 
drug dealers and prostitutes and kennedy park in miraflores a 
district of nightclubs and luxury shops 
the city operates five youth shelters there are several 
orphanages and the police have two juvenile detention centers but 
the number of children on the street indicates the old system 
doesnt work 
ninos de la calle is part of the private usfinanced center 
of information and education for the prevention of drug abuse it 
takes a different approach because we are convinced the normal 
way of working with street kids fails said ordonez 30 who has 
a masters degree in psychology 
he said the traditional way is to confine the children beat 
them and impose overly strict rules 
ordonez said ninos de la calle homes are like ponds next to a 
river where the piranhas can swim in stay awhile and swim out 
house rules are fairly simple no stealing fighting breaking 
things drugs or sex 
ninos de la calle has two homes and is building a third about 
55 boys have continuing contact with the group 
the project was born in june 1989 ordonez and other team 
members spent three months in the streets studying homeless 
children and were horrified by what they saw 
limas street kids all boys and aged 10 to 16 run in 
looseknit gangs of 30 to 50 ordonez said all sniff glue he 
said and about 10 percent smoke pasta basica semiprocessed 
coca leaf from perus amazon jungle 
project workers won the confidence of the boys who generally 
are aggressive and antisocial by organizing soccer games 
once exposed to the homes set up by ninos de la calle many 
decided to stay they even chased away other piranhas who tried to 
lure them back onto the street with promises of drugs 
the homes biggest attraction seems to be a sense of belonging 
to a group where someone cares 
ordonez said most of the boys were from poor families but 
divorce and abuse drove more of them into the streets than poverty 
what they need more than anything else is to talk but its 
what they do least said eduardo villanueva 29 a psychologist 
who has been with the project since it began 
one of villanuevas boys at miraflores house is carlos a lanky 
16yearold with a shy smile when they first met villanueva said 
carlos was always high on glue and had trouble speaking 
when i was sick they helped me carlos said of ninos de la 
calle when i wanted to leave they invited me to stay 
after two months at miraflores carlos has begun attending a 
nearby public school where he is about five years behind other 
boys of his age he said he wants to learn accounting and work in a 
bank

alicia crews is a black republican but not for 
long president bushs veto of a civil rights bill was the last 
straw for her 
it was a very needed bill said ms crews who has been a 
gop voter for nine years she plans to change her affiliation to 
the democrats 
what was the message of the veto to her that there isnt a 
visible slavery but theres still a mental slavery ms crews 
31 said as she headed home from work here tuesday briefcase in 
hand 
a sampling of black voters around the nation found some 
defending bushs decision to kill the legislation that he said 
would impose racial hiring quotas more often however they echoed 
ms crews disappointment or said blacks would take their anger at 
bush to the polls 
hes lost all the black vote said mike ward who works at a 
cabinetmaking business on atlantas martin luther king drive 
ward had been undecided in georgias upcoming gubernatorial 
election but now hes inclined to vote democratic 
heavy black turnout helped democrats win midterm congressional 
election victories when ronald reagan was president and bushs 
veto may send more blacks to the polls nov 6 black observers 
predicted 
its one of the many things that shows us that we must vote as 
a group to show our support bernard george said at a democratic 
rally tuesday night in new bern nc 
cindy turrentine also at the rally said she had mixed feelings 
about the veto theres a misconception that the civil rights 
movement is there to set quotas she said 
nonetheless the veto will help galvanize the black community 
she said 
i think our race in north carolina will push them out even 
more ms turrentine said her reference was to the us senate 
contest between incumbent republican jesse helms and democrat 
harvey gantt who is black 
greater black turnout is likely elsewhere too because of the 
veto said wayne bryant the majority leader of new jerseys state 
assembly 
folks really do feel threatened said bryant a black 
democrat we fought these battles in the 1950s and here we are 
fighting them again just before the 21st century 
paul hubbard president of new detroit inc a coalition of 
business and community leaders in the motor city said he was 
surprised bush would have the nerve to veto something like that 
in 1990 and i think voters will show their feelings at the 
polls 
i think for the people on the fence it would change their 
mind they would vote democratic added hubbard who is black 
sen eddie bernice johnson one of the few blacks in the texas 
legislature agreed 
im hoping that every minority affected by this bill will 
find it very important to go to the polls and vote their 
conscience said ms johnson a democrat i sure hope this will 
send a message of political distaste to the entire republican 
party 
bill chappell chairman of the georgia black republican council 
said he doubts the presidents veto will have a major impact on 
elections two weeks hence though it could hurt the gop among 
blacks in the long term 
im very disappointed that he vetoed the bill understanding 
all the implications and complications of it chappell said 
keith butler a black detroit city councilman who has met with 
bush to discuss civil rights legislation doubted most blacks would 
turn against the president 
i think african americans are going to remember that george 
bush has made more appointments of african americans than any other 
president butler said the issue is not whether or not the 
president wants a civil rights bill because hes put forth one of 
his own it deals with methodology 
i think democrats want to find a way to embarrass him just 
before the election butler said i think the democrats are not 
acting in the interest of black people theyre acting in the 
interest of getting votes for themselves 
waiting at an atlanta subway station the day after the monday 
veto 22yearold air force reservist bryan robinson said bushs 
action would not stop him from voting for republicans in next 
months elections i think there should be ways of keeping 
discrimination out of the workplace but i dont think quotas 
are the answer 
along the subway platform other black riders were split 
many like 50yearold franklin harris saw in bushs veto an 
erosion of the national commitment to civil rights its not just 
for black its for white and all lowincome people that put a 
hurt on all of us he said 
henry thornton 20 said hed continue voting for gop 
candidates im not really into black vote white vote i look at 
the platform he said 
nell harris who has sometimes voted for republicans in the 
past said now id think twice about it

george willig scaled them tightroper phillippe 
petit walked between them now a promoter wants to send michael 
andretti danny sullivan and friends racing around the twin towers 
of the world trade center 
the vast office complex is the hub of the proposed new york 200 
a grand prix auto race that would be run on the notoriously bumpy 
and congested streets of the financial district 
at first blush it sounds absurd admits matthew scheckner 
director of the citys sports commission and an advocate of the 
race people are worried that mario andrettis going to be 
shaking the orange juice out of their glass in the morning 
at second blush it still sounds absurd 
for three days in july a 13mile course would be roped off 
around the citys two tallest buildings streets where traffic 
usually crawls partly because there are so many potholes partly 
because there are so many vehicles would be taken over by about 
30 indianapolis 500class race cars moving at up to 220 mph 
but earlier this month enticed by the promoters promise of 
funds for neighborhood projects a community planning board 
endorsed the race which has been run in recent years in new 
jerseys meadowlands 
the promoter frank yodice of motormarketing international 
admits it will take some work to convert the world trade center 
into a racetrack streets must be graded and paved safety walls 
and fences installed bleachers and pedestrian bridges erected 
a pit area would be set up along the curb on church street near 
the startfinish line the staging area where cars are parked would 
be on the trade centers plaza at the base of the 110story 
towers 
manhattans community planning boards are notoriously resistant 
to change but board no 1 endorsed the race by a vote of 2112 
the vote apparently was influenced by yodices promise of 350000 
for community projects about 345000 more than the board now 
has 
board member harold donohue compared the majoritys action to 
selling indulgences 
after they heard 350 grand i think my colleagues would have 
let them drop an atomic bomb down here 
donohue says he voted against the race because of the 
inconvenience it would cause but that some board members viewed 
the vote as a referendum on the internal combustion engine 
one is patricia dillon who rides a bicycle to work and does not 
even own a car 
an auto race glorifies the automobile she said its the 
wrong signal to be sending with air pollution getting worse and a 
war over oil about to start 
scheckner the sports commission director just chuckles over 
objections you say auto racing in lower manhattan and people 
say no but were not going to be running down wall street these 
are wide streets 
races are held in monte carlo paris and detroit he 
continued and indy cars burn methanol which is cleaner than 
regular gasoline 
benefits to the city he adds include a 36 million economic 
infusion and leave behinds such as newly paved streets 
the streets are not all the race would polish he added this 
is a time we could use a morale boost and nothing makes new york 
city look as good as sports on television 
the 200mile race would be held on sunday with qualifying and 
practice on friday and saturday downtown traffic is relatively 
light on weekends in july but on friday theyd be shutting down 
the streets of the worlds financial center said donohue 
the race still must be approved by other city officials 
including the mayor and friday racing is expected to be a key 
issue yodice says he hopes for a running next july but may have 
to settle for 1992

the 24th divisions battle 
kings man 155mm howitzers but the only weapons used in anger are 
flyswatters the enemy for many is a clock that moves too slowly 
people keep telling lies that morale is high said spec 
chris hernandez of san antonio texas playing cards with friends 
who nodded assent theyre only fooling themselves morale is 
low 
a sampling of the 200000 soldiers and marines deployed under 
operation desert shield to confront iraq suggests a classic 
military malaise troops with no idea of when new orders might 
come want to get back to their lives 
some have been in the blistering northeastern saudi desert for 
more than two months preparing for a battle that might never come 
the desert weather is cooling down but the sand remains 
fouling equipment jamming weapons and fraying tempers 
but many are still anxious to fight marine sgt marco 
rodriguez a 23yearold aircraft mechanic from santa barbara 
calif left no doubt 
ill come home in one of two ways the big parade or in a body 
bag he said i prefer the former but ill take the latter 
lack of enthusiasm however seemed more common 
field commanders like lt col stephen lutz of the 3rd 
battalion 41st field artillery the battle kings scrounge 
videos books volleyballs and games to help their troops get by 
were thinking about this every day lutz said of growing 
morale problems we try to provide some relief and outlet for the 
soldiers 
sgts steve coles of pittsburgh pa and ty mcwhorter of 
wichita falls texas werent convinced by the efforts they spent 
last christmas in panama on operation just cause this year they 
figure theyll miss out again 
all the goodies we dont want them coles said we only 
want one thing to go home and thats speaking on behalf of 
everyone 
mcwhorter nodded gravely his daughter was born 17 months ago 
just before desert training then came panama and more desert 
training and then saudi arabia 
like most others coles and mcwhorter acknowledged desert shield 
was made up of volunteer service people like many others however 
they said that if they werent going to fight they had no business 
sitting around in the desert 
spec darnell thompson of akron ohio said his daughter was 
born in early october and the news from the red cross took 10 
days to reach him he had been due for discharge soon but emergency 
orders extended his stay for six months 
were not prisoners and shouldnt be held against our will 
he said 
four soldiers playing cards broke in to condemn the long 
uncertain wait 
william curtis 22 of kelso wash was barechested against the 
heat revealing a snarling tiger tattooed on his right shoulder on 
the left was a heart with the names of his three children a fourth 
child is due anytime 
if my wifes going to read this tell her i love her he 
said 
my question is why are we here said spec anthony zipperer 
of ruskin fla kuwaits such a little country its not a 
democracy if this isnt for oil why are we fighting 
he laughed and added i wont tell you what i really feel 
ive only said what i can get away with 
another shouted i dont see why i should fight for 
constitutional rights that are denied to me

a man who builds execution machines for states 
with the death penalty already under fire for his views on the 
holocaust and questionable business tctics now faces charges that 
he is a fake as an engineer 
fred a leuchter jr was arraigned in malden district court 
tuesday on a charge of fraudulently practicing engineering the 
state division of registration made the charges after being 
notified by a jewish group that leuchter holds only a bachelors 
degree in history from boston university 
leuchter pleaded innocent the case was continued to dec 11 and 
leuchter was released on his own recognizance 
leuchter a resident of malden a northern suburb of boston 
designs and builds death machinery for states that allow capital 
punishment including tennessee new jersey delaware illinois and 
missouri 
he drew fire after writing a report claiming that gas chambers 
at some death camps couldnt have been used to kill hundreds of 
thousands of prisoners the report has been used as ammunition by 
some antisemitic groups 
the 192page report stemmed from leuchters appearance as a paid 
expert at the may 1988 trial of revisionist publisher ernst zundel 
in toronto zundel was charged and later convicted of knowingly 
disseminating false information in his booklet did six million 
really die 
as part of his defense zundel wanted scientific proof that the 
gas chambers never existed in the leuchter report end of a 
myth leuchter said the gas chambers at auschwitz birkenau and 
majdanek were technically incapable of the systematic gassing of 
thousands of people 
the report was reprinted in europe and britains house of 
commons condemned it as a fascist publication 
after business dealings with leuchter alabamas assistant 
attorney general in july sent a memo to all capital punishment 
states questioning leuchters credentials and warning that his 
views were unorthodox 
in the memo alabama assistant attorney general ed carnes 
alleged that leuchter would routinely offer his services as a 
technical advisor to states conducting executions 
if his offer was spurned leuchter would then offer to testify 
on behalf of death penalty foes that the states execution machines 
would not work properly carnes said 
what he has done is make money on both sides of the fence 
said carnes i think leuchters neither a credible witness nor a 
credible expert i would never use him in a court of law again 
in a telephone interview from his home leuchter called carnes 
charges lies and said he would take legal action against him 
he said holocaust groups had pressured states to not do business 
with him 
the jewish groups have effectively put me out of business 
leuchter said they are doing the same things the nazis did 
interfering with my right to free speech and to earn a living 
leuchter said the states engineering license requirements are 
designed to protect the public from poorly constructed buildings 
and do not apply to his work since it is done out of state 
while admitting he had only a history degree leuchter said he 
had acquired the math and science skills necessary in college to be 
an engineer 
the bottom line is that anyone who goes to college has the 
necessary math and science which i do leuchter said ive 
worked as an engineer for 25 years im not some johnny come 
lately 
leuchter said he was not antisemitic and only meant to show 
that gassings did not occur at the three camps he researched not 
that the holocaust did not occur 
these charges are ludicrous some of my best friends are 
jewish leuchter said though he declined to name any 
the state began investigating leuchter last april after being 
contacted by holocaust survivors and friends in pursuit of justice 
based in albany ny 
shelly shapiro the groups director said is dangerous 
because he gives a scientific front to those who would deny the 
holocaust he provides them with what they think is expertise on 
gas chambers we set out to show that he is no expert on gas 
chambers and no engineer

democrat john durkin says republican rival 
bob smith is an ineffective threeterm congressman who doesnt 
belong in the senate bumbling bob he calls him the 
abominable noman 
but durkin a former us senator will need more than his acid 
wit to regain his place in congress 
smith leads in the polls and has raised nearly 1 million five 
times the amount in durkins war chest 
the conservative smith says he is a proven performer in congress 
who represents new hampshires interests well he led a successful 
fight to defeat a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise and 
he favors a tightwad approach to federal spending 
the candidates are vying for the seat being vacated by 
republican gordon humphrey who decided to retire from congress and 
run for the state senate 
durkin 54 has lost ground in the polls since the sept 11 
primary he blames negative advertising by smith portraying him as 
a liberal big spender when he was a senator from 197580 
i think people know i can be a pain he says but i do 
stand up and try to take a stand 
do they want a feisty mick wholl speak up or bob smith whos 
afraid 
his challenge is great in a state where the highestranking 
democrat is the state senate minority leader 
smith has the backing of new hampshires republican hierarchy 
and the white house president bush attended a smith fundraiser 
tuesday in new hampshire 
smiths advertising expenses this year 200000 are more 
than the 167000 durkin has spent on his entire campaign 
he has seized on the abortion issue with a 30second television 
ad telling smith to keep your hands off the rights of my 
daughters and the women of new hampshire 
smith opposes legal abortion unless the life of the mother is in 
danger but he has said he would support exceptions for rape and 
incest victims if it meant enactment of federal antiabortion 
legislation 
durkin can beat smith if he convinces undecided prochoice 
voters to make abortion their decisive issue says dick bennett 
president of the american research group polling firm in 
manchester 
twothirds of new hampshires voters are prochoice according 
to a private poll by the becker institute inc of sudbury mass a 
poll by bennetts company after the primary showed that durkin led 
smith 21 among those favoring abortion rights 
durkin says his daughters convinced him to switch to prochoice 
smith calls durkin a flipflopper on the issue who cant be 
trusted 
my prolife stand is not a matter of convenience its a 
matter of conscience says smith 
durkin also has tried to capitalize on the issue of campaign 
contributions from political action committees 
durkin who took pac money in his losing 1980 senate reelection 
campaign refuses to take it now and claims the system has changed 
and corrupts politicians 
he says smith who has raised half his money from pacs has made 
himself beholden to special interests 
the charges are absolutely ridiculous responds smith 
smith also counters that durkin takes money from the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee which receives pac money 
the issue here is not pac money in general smith said 
the issue here is the utter hypocrisy of taking pac money and 
saying youre not 
durkin calls it ridiculous to compare the two kinds of 
contributions 
durkins attacks on smith over pac money include his taking 
1000 from a player in the savings and loan scandal at the same 
time smith was calling for tougher penalties for violators 
theres a real serious question here durkin said is it 
corruption is it cynicism is it inattention to detail is it 
stupidity any one of them render bob smith unfit for a sixyear 
term in the united states senate

the un embargo against iraq is beginning to 
squeeze the iraqi occupation forces in kuwait but there is no 
evidence of even a partial iraqi withdrawal from the tiny emirate 
administration and military officials say 
pete williams chief spokesman for defense secretary dick 
cheney said tuesday that iraq is making some adjustments to 
its military operations in and around kuwait as a result of the 
embargo which has been in effect since aug 6 four days after 
iraq invaded its neighbor 
williams said us authorities believe the iraqi military is 
suffering shortages of tires and other materials he cited iraqs 
recently imposed rationing of civilian supplies of gasoline as an 
indication that the whole nation including its military is 
threatened by the sanctions 
as time goes by the sanctions continue to have effect it 
becomes harder and harder to support that military force as the 
embargo restricts the shipment of spare parts and supplies 
williams told a news briefing 
iraq has about 430000 forces in kuwait and southern iraq 
bolstered by 3500 tanks the spokesman said those pentagon 
estimates have not changed for several weeks but williams said he 
could not comment on whether iraqs buildup appeared to be over 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
told reporters in saudi arabia on tuesday that the iraqi army 
remains very solidly in kuwait he said he saw no evidence that 
iraq was moving forces away from the saudi border 
williams said us military authorities believe the iraqi army 
remains capable of quickly launching an offensive strike into saudi 
arabia even though it has spent more than two months digging in 
and fortifying defensive positions 
he indicated that iraqi armored units are deployed behind a 
shield of antitank ditches earthen mounds and minefields designed 
to stop an attack from saudi soil 
williams also disclosed that the pentagon was considering 
starting a new wave of troop deployments to the persian gulf area 
such a move would take operation desert shield beyond the 240000 
personnel currently planned 
williams said more than 210000 us troops now are in and 
around saudi arabia that is 10000 more than the last official 
count issued by cheney on oct 13 
williams said powell was consulting in saudi arabia with us 
and saudi officials on the possible need to expand desert shield 
deployments which president bush ordered on aug 7 
powell will report his recommendations to cheney after returning 
to washington on thursday williams said 
then those decisions will be made on whether additional forces 
need to be sent or not williams said so i dont want to 
signal that the deployment is nearly complete thats a decision 
that will be made in part this week by gen powells visit 
powell was attending a north atlantic treaty organization 
meeting in brussels today 
williams said it had been planned all along that us troop 
requirements in the gulf would be reassessed once the initial round 
of deployments was nearing completion 
us ground forces in saudi arabia now include four army 
divisions three marine corps expeditionary brigades an air 
defense artillery brigade a mechanized infantry brigade and an 
armored cavalry regiment also in the gulf area are more than 500 
aircraft and 55 ships including aircraft carriers and a 
battleship 
an army source speaking on condition of anonymity said it was 
possible that powell would recommend reducing the american force in 
the region depending on military estimates of iraqs troop 
strength and other factors

three times in the last 18 months astronauts 
flew jets dangerously close to other airplanes and a government 
agency says fatigue and outmoded nasa equipment were at fault 
the three incidents that the safety board has investigated 
could have been averted by a second crew member said the 
national transportation safety board the safety board therefore 
believes that nasa should require an additional flight crew member 
aboard all t38a flights 
astronauts who are rated among the best pilots in the world 
use the highperformance t38s for training and as transportation 
to and from meetings and public appearances 
because the t38a is a highworkload airplane the safety 
board believes that a type of shortterm fatigue may develop which 
results in a decreased amount of attention available for all of the 
tasks associated with controlling the airplane navigating and 
communicating with air traffic control the ntsb said 
in the first incident on may 15 1989 shuttle commander david 
m walker a navy captain flew his plane within 100 feet 
vertically and 700 feet horizontally of a pan am jetliner with 176 
people on board the distances were calculated by radar 
the pan am crew could make out the tail number on the 
airplane tim borson an ntsb investigator told the board members 
at a hearing tuesday 
the airliner had just taken off from dulles international 
airport en route to paris and walker was arriving in the washington 
area to be congratulated the next day by president bush for 
completing a successful shuttle mission 
although none of the nasa pilots was identified in the ntsb 
report to nasa administrator richard truly walkers involvement 
was known he was suspended from t38 flights for 60 days in july 
and replaced as commander of a space shuttle mission scheduled for 
next year the suspension has ended and walker once again is in 
line for a space flight but probably not until at least 1992 
both ntsb and the national aeronautics and space administration 
said the system which encourages pilots to report near misses also 
protects their privacy the two unidentified flyers reported the 
incidents involving them 
the second of the nearcollisions occurred on sept 17 1989 
over texas when a nasa pilot returning from edwards air force base 
in california flew 2000 feet below his assigned altitude and 
conflicted with a piper cheyenne the ntsb said radar showed 
one plane 1400 feet above the other and three miles to the side 
the pilots did not see one another 
on may 6 over kentucky a nasa jet was told to fly at 37000 
feet but apparently thought he was assigned to 27000 as the t38 
descended said ntsb it came within 1500 feet vertically and 
three miles horizontally of an eastern airlines dc9 
such separations are classed as nearmisses because of the 
speeds involved at supersonic speed aircraft can travel more than 
1100 feet a second 
the safety board said the t38s communications equipment was 
outdated and far from stateoftheart 
dan brandenstein chief of the astronaut corps said in houston 
that we have realized the avionics have come a long way since the 
t38 was developed 30 years ago he said one of the planes is 
being modified with a view of upgrading the entire fleet 
the ntsb recommended that the upgrading be accelerated and that 
another flyer occupy the back seat in the twoseater aircraft to 
aid the busy t38 pilot brandenstein said we strive to make that 
happen but that it isnt always possible 
in all three cases investigated by the ntsb the pilots were 
flying below their assigned altitude when the nearmiss incidents 
occurred ntsb said the t38s lack the means to alert pilots when 
they are out of their assigned altitude and that the pilots do not 
write down their instructions as others do 
the changes are needed ntsb said in a letter to truly to 
reduce the potential for human error 
truly called the ntsb report thorough and constructive and 
said nasa would consider all of the recommendations 
there were two other incidents in 1989 and two in 1986 the ntsb 
said without giving any detail

deficitreduction talks between the white 
house and congressional leaders neared a crisis late tuesday as 
democrats prepared to bring a budget to the house floor likely to 
contain a taxtherich plan that republicans oppose 
democrats said they hoped to keep budget negotiations alive but 
they were ready to force a vote on a 250billion deficitcutting 
bill containing the controversial tax package as early as 
wednesday 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority 
leader bob michel rill met with president bush at the white 
house for nearly two hours tuesday night to plan their next steps 
theyre going to talk about whether to blow these budget 
talks all up one republican official who demanded anonymity 
said before the session 
afterward a spokeswoman for michel said the meeting with bush 
was inconclusive 
the potential blowup raised the specter that bush would allow 
the government to shut down after midnight wednesday night when 
federal authority to spend money technically expires 
until now the president had indicated that with continued 
progress in the budget talks he would sign yet another emergency 
bill providing money for the government for a short period 
democrats looking gloomy huddled in the capitol afterward 
they said they did not believe a major problem had cropped up in 
the negotiations 
we will try to keep negotiations going said house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif but the hour is late 
and we still dont have an agreement 
i do not view this as a crisis point said house speaker 
thomas foley dwash 
the problem arose as the two sides appeared to be nearing final 
agreement on a 250billion deficitreduction measure that would 
boost the gasoline tax by about a nickel raise taxes on alcohol 
and tobacco and cut medicare spending and other benefit programs 
the budget democrats were preparing to bring to the house floor 
seemed likely to contain a measure that would impose a 75 percent 
surtax on millionaires 
republicans and bush oppose that plan which they fear would 
allow democrats to boast that the president dramatically increased 
income tax rates 
instead they prefer limiting deductions the wealthy may 
itemize 
but after a day of closeddoor meetings house democratic 
leaders proved unable to drum up support among rankandfile 
lawmakers for a compromise without a surtax that would limit 
deductions for the wealthy 
the two parties agree that in addition the incometax rate on 
the wealthy would also be increased to 31 percent from its current 
28 percent 
the longrunning fiscal struggle held center stage as the 101st 
congress labored to complete its work 
but in the last days before national elections other 
politically charged issues neared a final vote 
the senate delayed an attempt to override the presidents veto 
of a civil rights bill the president claims the bills antijob 
discrimination provisions would lead to hiring quotas 
a toughening of clean air laws was expected to go to a final 
vote on wednesday or thursday 
a new spending bill was needed to keep the government in funds 
after midnight wednesday 
bush campaigning in new england wouldnt say whether he would 
sign such a bill but put the blame for the situation on the 
democraticcontrolled congress he said he was so frustrated by 
congress inability to do anything i dont know what im going 
to do 
bush called on republicans to put selfinterest aside and 
support a compromise budget but at the democratic caucus many 
legislators remained dissatisfied 
we asked for a show of hands on support for the package and it 
was right down the middle 5050 said rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the ways and means committee thats not 
good not good at all 
senate democrats greeted the wouldbe budget compromise much 
more warmly after meeting with them senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said he expected a majority would support the 
proposal 
the proposed compromise democratic leaders brought their members 
tuesday contained no surtax instead it limited deductions for 
people earning 100000 by about 3 percent and limited them even 
further by about 5 percent for people earning 1 million 
yearly 
but just days after the house approved a budget that would put 
heavy new taxes on the rich many of the chambers democrats felt 
the new plan didnt go far enough 
more than half the people felt the tentative outline was too 
great a retraction from what the house adopted that the strong 
flavor of progressivity would be heavily diluted said rep jim 
moody dwis 
others seemed ready to compromise 
of all the alternatives on the table right now none are worse 
than nothing said rep jim slattery dkan 
democrats said the meeting proved that either more republican 
votes had to be found or the plan would have to be changed to 
democrats liking 
dole said late tuesday that republicans had offered to support 
an alternative phasing out the personal exemption for the 
welltodo currently all but the wealthiest taxpayers are 
entitled to the 2050 exemption 
dole said another option was to simply drop the idea of limiting 
deductions and forego the revenues that the proposal would raise 
depending on how tightly deductions are limited dropping the idea 
completely could cost about 30 billion over five years 
then we could blame the democrats for not getting the 
savings dole said 
no final decisions have been made on how deeply to cut medicare 
or how high to raise the gasoline tax house democrats said they 
wanted medicare reductions to be no more than about 43 billion 
over the next five years about 4 billion short of what 
republicans prefer 
the gasoline tax increase seemed to be set at about 5 cents or 6 
cents per gallon it is now 9 cents 
the two sides seemed willing to increase the wage cap below 
which medicare taxes are deducted to 125000 up from its current 
51300 
the 250billion budgetcutting bill is the keystone of a plan 
to reduce red ink by 500 billion over the next five years the 
rest of the savings would come from defense cuts and 
lowerthanexpected interest payments on the federal debt

the state of missouri has withdrawn 
from the nancy cruzan righttodie case removing a major obstacle 
to her parents attempts to remove their comatose daughters 
feeding tube 
the health department and the director of the staterun missouri 
rehabilitation center where the 33yearold woman lies were 
dropped from the case tuesday upon the signing of an order by 
probate judge charles teel 
the request was made last month by missouri attorney general 
william webster 
his office had fought the cruzan family all the way to the us 
supreme court which in june blocked removal of the feeding tube in 
its first righttodie ruling 
the legal questions previously raised by the state have been 
answered by the missouri and us supreme courts webster 
spokeswoman mary jenkins said in explaining the states withdrawal 
the only other party to the case when joe and joyce cruzan of 
centerville go to court nov 1 in another attempt to remove their 
daughters feeding tube will be ms cruzans courtappointed 
guardian thad mccanse and he previously sided with the family 
ms cruzan has been in a vegetative state at the rehabilitation 
center since a 1983 car wreck her body is rigid her hands and 
feet bent into claws she breathes on her own and at times her 
eyes are open and move randomly 
in its ruling the us supreme court said missouri could keep a 
patient on life support in the absence of clear and convincing 
evidence the person would want to die 
the cruzans say they now have such evidence and will present it 
at the hearing in front of teel 
in august they told the judge that three people would testify 
they talked with ms cruzan about her wishes regarding 
lifesustaining treatment she left no written instructions about 
what she would want done under such circumstances 
bill colby attorney for the cruzans said that despite the 
states exit we still need to prove our case through clear and 
convincing evidence we still have an uphill battle but i think we 
have far more than clear and convincing evidence now 
colby would not name the witnesses but said they are all 
people who worked with her two talked about the forced feeding of 
severely handicapped children and the third talked at length about 
the quinlan case 
he was referring to the 1976 new jersey supreme court ruling 
that allowed karen ann quinlans family to remove her respirator

on the whole president bush clearly would 
rather be back traveling to world capitals than pounding the 
campaign trail in this time of high voter skepticism toward 
incumbents and soon he will be 
bush already weakened by his wavering stands on taxes and the 
budget deficit and facing the first resignation of a cabinet 
member will crisscross the nation between now and election day 
stumping for republican candidates 
he will visit at least 14 states including hawaii 
but aides say the president once a tireless campaigner is 
wearying of being battered daily on domestic issues and is looking 
forward to the postelection period when he can once again focus 
his energies on foreign policy 
even some of bushs sternest critics on domestic policy have 
complimented him for conducting foreign policy with a steady hand 
and bush as he speaks at one gop fundraising event after 
another seems to come alive as he moves from gloomy accounts of 
the mess in washington to speaking on the persian gulf 
his voice rises his sentences become crisper and the applause 
often merely polite on budget declarations becomes thunderous 
and sustained as he rails against iraqs saddam hussein 
when this ordeal is over saddam must pay for the pain and 
the hardship he has caused the world will hold him accountable 
just as it held adolf hitler accountable in the wake of the 
destruction of world war ii bush said at a gop fundraiser in 
stamford conn on tuesday night the line got him some of the 
hardiest applause he had received in days 
bush plans a series of foreign trips beginning soon after the 
midterm elections to paris and other european capitals to saudi 
arabia to meet with us troops to mexico and to five south 
american countries and all by the end of this year 
and early next year a far east trip is being seriously 
discussed maybe to japan and perhaps with stops in australia on 
the way 
bushs campaigning in rainy new england on tuesday saw one of 
those days that suggest much of the fun has gone from the campaign 
trail for the veteran campaigner and onetime chairman of the 
republican national committee 
the president earlier had invited republicans to blame me 
for unpopular electionyear stands and by and large they have 
for instance 
at his first stop in burlington vt the gop congressional 
candidate he was there to help get reelected rep peter smith 
told the audience at the outset that he didnt agree with bushs 
veto of a civil rights bill or his reluctance to tax the wealthy 
at his second stop in manchester nh the candidate didnt 
even show up rep bob smith who is running for the senate 
couldnt break himself away from the budget and other pressing 
business in washington instead his wife mary jo spoke in his 
place 
at his third stop a reception for gop house candidate gary 
franks in waterbury conn bush found himself on the defensive at 
a picturetaking session both on the budget and on his veto of the 
civil rights act franks who is black supported bushs veto but 
many other black republicans do not 
at his fourth and final stop a dinner for connecticut gop 
gubernatorial candidate john rowland in stamford conn the 
candidate gave bush backhanded praise saluting him for making 
tough decisions every day some good some bad 
meanwhile back in washington reports circulated and were not 
denied by bush or his aides that labor secretary elizabeth dole 
the administrations highestranking woman was quitting 
that only complicated the domestic scene for bush 
in waterbury he made his frustrations with the continuing 
budget stalemate clear 
citing a raucous caucus on the democratic side where they 
couldnt agree on anything he fumed i dont know whats 
happening down there 
asked whether he would once again sign a stopgap spending bill 
to keep government operating if no budget agreement is reached by 
midnight tonight the president was at a loss for words 
in the past he had vowed never to sign another such temporary 
measure only to sign one after the other 
well have to wait and see what happens before i can make a 
decision on what im going to do bush said but i feel the 
frustration that i think people all across this country feel about 
congress inability to do anything

the soviets are withdrawing koreans and 
filipinos are protesting and costs in japan are enormous but the 
united states says any reduction of its big troop presence in asia 
will be slow and limited 
critics accuse the defense department of looking for new threats 
now that the soviet union has begun major pullouts of troops ships 
and aircraft east of the ural mountains 
backers of a strong us force say it will prevent any country 
from dominating the region and ensure that the worlds richest 
trade routes remain open 
in february defense secretary dick cheney announced a 10 
percent cut in asianbased troops over three years and the latest 
round of planned bases closings includes nine small facilities in 
south korea and one in japan 
a us military spokesman in hawaii lt col thomas boyd said 
very few soldiers actually have been removed from asia to date 
were still in the stage of deciding whos going to be 
moved he said 
cheney says the bulk of american forces will stay 
i think our presence in the western pacific is in everybodys 
interest he said in a speech last month it dampens down the 
enthusiasm others might feel if in fact the united states wasnt 
there in terms of their desire to move in and fill the vacuum 
the united states now has 50000 military personnel in japan 
44400 in south korea and 14800 in the philippines an additional 
25800 are on ships of the japanbased us 7th fleet 
the main justification for a big us presence in asia has 
shifted from one of defense against soviet aggression to a role 
that a defense department report describes as regional balancer 
honest broker and ultimate security guarantor 
noting that crosspacific trade totals more than 300 billion a 
year 50 percent more than useuropean trade the report says 
it is in our own best interest to help preserve peace and 
stability 
other justifications include continued racial and ethnic 
tensions unresolved territorial disputes advancing weapons 
technology continued arms sales and illegal drug trafficking 
critics say asians can protect themselves 
since the cold war is over and a soviet invasion is no longer 
credible military officials in the us have been scrambling to 
find new enemies and threats to justify maintaining extensive 
military forces in the pacific said a report by the private 
center for defense information 
the center led by retired senior military officers long has 
been critical of us military buildups around the world it issued 
successive reports in recent months calling for us troop 
withdrawals from japan korea and the philippines 
the key exception to official support of the us presence among 
americas asian allies has emerged in the philippines where talks 
are to resume next month over the two largest us foreign bases 
clark air base and subic naval base 
president corazon aquino has called for an orderly 
withdrawal of us forces despite the thousands of jobs and 
hundreds of millions of aid dollars linked to the bases philippine 
foreign secretary raul manglapus said his country wants to take 
over clark next year and also is seeking reductions at subic 
us negotiator richard armitage said the era of a big us 
military presence is ending but he spoke only of a phasedown not 
a phaseout 
even before the talks the united states began looking for other 
sites and has received an offer for more access to singapore 
meanwhile the us goal is to get japan to pay more of us 
forces expenses and south korea to both pay and assume a leading 
role in its own defense over the next five to 10 years 
critics in south korea including student demonstrators say the 
us military poses an obstacle to reunification with communist 
north korea 
in contrast to the us reluctance to withdraw the soviets are 
cutting forces by 40 percent in asia 
us officials confirm that moscow is removing 50 ships from the 
pacific and withdrawing from the former us base at cam ranh bay 
vietnam soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov said soviet facilities 
will be replaced by mosquitoes and grasshoppers 
three soviet air regiments already have been removed and 11 more 
are scheduled to leave a us military report said 
the report cautioned however that soviet planes and armaments 
are being modernized and bomber and strategic interceptor units 
remain unaffected by the restructuring

dairy farmers processors and food chains are 
being squeezed one way and then another by advocates and critics of 
a synthetic hormone designed to boost a cows milk production 
at the center of the storm is bovine somatotropin or bst a 
synthetic hormone that can boost milk production by 10 percent to 
25 percent 
the food and drug administration next year is expected to 
approve the chemical also called bgh or bovine growth hormone 
for commercial use 
critics of the hormone contend that it taints milk harms cows 
and threatens to open the floodgates to surplus production that 
will depress prices and wash out thousands of struggling dairy 
farmers 
one of the severest bst critics has been jeremy rifkin of the 
foundation on economic trends a washingtonbased advocacy group 
that often is involved in consumer issues 
rifkin recently announced a national campaign to boycott bst and 
those dairies companies and grocery chains that dont go along 
with the antihormone movement 
the national milk producers federation which has not taken an 
official position on the issue is telling members about some of 
the forces that will be at work in the coming months 
with the tide of scientific evidence running against their 
health safety arguments bst foes have turned to picket and boycott 
threats to achieve their goals the federations newsletter said 
this week 
the rifkin plan includes letters to companies asking for support 
for the bst boycott and urging them to sell only bstfree milk and 
dairy products even if the fda gives the chemical a clean bill of 
health 
in december the foundation plans to issue a pure milk 
advisory newsletter that rifkin said will identify those 
companies that have pledged to accept and sell only pure and 
natural milk free of the synthetic hormone 
the advisory he said will include a list of companies that 
intend to accept or sell milk from hormonetreated cows 
those companies will be subject to selective picketing and 
boycotts by grassroots farm and consumer organizations in local 
communities around the country the foundation said 
but the dairy federation said a number of farm and food 
organizations have alerted members to the dangers of the coming 
campaign over the hormone 
the international dairy foods association told members they 
are under no obligation legal or otherwise to respond to the 
foundation letter the dairy newsletter said the dairy 
industry coalition has also expressed its opposition to milk and 
dairy products becoming a pawn in the biotechnology controversy 
meanwhile the agriculture department says us dairy production 
is increasing and that surpluses are expected next year 
in 1991 milk and dairy product prices will fall sharply from 
a year earlier according to a report this week by the 
departments economic research service significant surpluses of 
both cream and skim milk are expected milk production is projected 
to grow 1 percent to 2 percent next year largely on the strength 
of late1989 and 1990 returns 
overall the agency said the farm price of milk in 1991 is 
expected to be down 2 to 3 from this years average of around 14 
per 100 pounds 
 
washington ap veterinarians help farmers with their 
livestock and city people with their pets from lizards to ponies 
they also are important for the protection of the nations food 
supply says shelton pinkerton president of the american 
veterinary medical association 
many consumers are aware that veterinarians in private 
clinical practice are involved in production agriculture working 
with farmers and ranchers to develop and maintain healthy 
wellnourished properly housed economically productive herds and 
flocks he said tuesday 
but what most people are unaware of is the work that 
veterinarians do in the public sector pinkerton told the american 
association of food hygiene veterinarians 
the fact that most of the public is unaware of your role is 
not because of ignorance on the part of the public but rather 
because of your skill and good work which unfortunately results in 
your being taken for granted he said we expect safe 
wholesome food and we have safe wholesome food 
pinkerton said that one measure of the confidence and security 
people have in the us food supply is the level of media 
attention that develops in those rare occasions when there is a 
problem that affects the public 
 
washington ap preliminary tests of cotton plants genetically 
engineered to destructive insects have been encouraging the 
agriculture department says 
the departments agricultural research service this summer 
conducted the first field tests of the cotton plants developed by 
monsanto co of st louis the agency said tuesday 
test plants called transgenic were inserted with a gene from a 
different organism bacillus thuringiensis or bt a commercially 
available natural bacterium 
the gene enables bt to make a protein toxic to many caterpillar 
species and the transgenic plants make a similar protein 
usda scientists said the transgenic plants caused caterpillars 
to have a fatal case of indigestion often after eating only a 
bite or two of the leaves or bolls 
the engineered cotton plants still must undergo extensive 
testing but officials said the new technology could help reduce 
the use of chemical pesticides reducing production costs for 
cotton farmers

a group of former house members say they have 
created a grassroots organization to counter the proisraeli lobby 
which they say has too much clout on capitol hill 
but israels supporters in congress say the groups aims are 
misguided and pose serious danger to longterm us strategic 
interests 
board members of the newly formed council for the national 
interest disagree 
what we in the movement think is that the government of 
israel exercises too much influence over the country the united 
states and particularly in congress said david bowen the 
councils executive director a former college professor with 
degrees from harvard and oxford universities bowen resigned from 
the house after 10 years in 1983 
the idea for the council came from paul findley a former gop 
congressman from illinois who wrote a book about the proisraeli 
lobby entitled they dare to speak out in his book findley 
claims he was targeted by the proisraeli lobby because of his 
stands on middle east policy 
plain ordinary americans saw damage being done to our 
institutions findley said in a telephone interview 
other board members of the group include former reps pete 
mccloskey rcalif john anderson rill and martha keys dkan 
anderson ran for president as an independent in 1980 
the council was created in a year when israels aid package 
the largest given to a foreign country has been questioned by 
senators including sen robert byrd dwva chairman of the 
senate appropriations committee 
yet israeli aid in fiscal 1991 has remained at roughly 3 
billion along with benefits worth hundreds of millions more the 
senate voted 971 to add 700 million worth of american arms to the 
package for israel 
israels backers on capitol hill said they doubted the group 
would have much success because its objectives were suspect 
this is the same old group over and over and i have a strong 
belief that it is antisemitic said rep larry smith dfla a 
solid supporter of israel 
the council said its goal is to promote peace in the middle 
east which it says the united states can achieve only by following 
an evenhanded policy in the region most harmful policies arise 
from our unusual relationship with israel the group said 
it supports placing conditions on further aid to israel a 
negotiated settlement to end the arabisraeli conflict and 
selfdetermination for palestinians within a palestiian state 
so far the group has had little impact on capitol hill its 
main project has been a resolution seeking to force israel to open 
palestinian universities in the west bank and gaza strip the 
resolution has yet to clear either chamber 
specifically mccloskey said the group hopes to counter the 
american israel public affairs committee the proisraeli lobbying 
group 
we are trying to take on aipac headon mccloskey said in a 
telephone interview we want members to hear the other view and 
we want them to hear it from the community level 
the proisraeli lobbys leverage stems mainly from political 
action committees bowen said he said proisraeli pacs contributed 
about 5 million to candidates in the 1988 election campaign 
toby dershowitz an aipac spokeswoman said the public affairs 
committee would have no comment on the council 
the council was actively launched about six months ago so far 
it has about 2000 members nationwide far short of its goal of 
12000 
fundraising efforts have also been limited bowen said with a 
budget of several hundred thousand dollars most of the money is 
raised from small contributors including arabamericans the 
council said no money comes from foreign sources

memorizing the 258 words of the future 
farmers of america creed was a high school ritual for generations 
now the creed is being rewritten to reflect a changing industry 
and not everyone is happy about it 
the new one leaves some of the old standards that we live by 
out of it said joel janke north dakotas ffa adviser who 
learned the creed as a high school student in the early 1950s 
he is disturbed by the dropping of such passages as i believe 
in less dependence on begging and more power in bargaining and 
the promise of playing square with those whose happiness depends 
on me 
janke added they want to get the farm part out of the creed 
and out of the terminology they want to get to the agricultural 
standpoint 
that reflects the increasingly diverse needs of the 386000 ffa 
members nationwide organization officials say 
members now are going into agricultural marketing research 
law horticulture forestry and other occupations said bill stagg 
a spokesman at the organizations alexandria va headquarters 
the proposed new creed is up for a vote next month at the 
national ffa convention in kansas city 
the ffa was founded in kansas city in 1928 to develop young 
farmers memorizing and delivering the creed is part of training in 
leadership and public speaking for the groups members 
with sentences as long as 56 words though reciting it can be 
tough its six sentences average 43 words each the proposed 
rewrite has 205 words in 12 sentences averaging 17 words each 
the current creed was adopted in 1930 and revised slightly in 
1965 the latest proposed statement written by ffa member shriley 
sokolosky of oklahoma represents the first significant rewrite 
when the ffa was founded almost al of the membership 
intended to farm in one way or another that is no longer true 
stagg said 
to take this into account the groups name was changed two 
years ago to the national ffa organization while the acronym was 
kept it no longer officially stands for future farmers of america 
the first clause of the current creed i believe in the 
future of farming is replaced by i believe in the future of 
agriculture 
the old creed i think is kind of behind the times said 
chad dotzenrod president of the north dakota ffa 
the current creed didnt connect with me it seemed like it 
was too much for the farmers dotzenrod said his father is an 
electrical contractor he added and i never had any animals or 
raised any crops 
while he doesnt care for the proposed new creed janke believes 
a wholesale revision is inevitable 
were more than farming were agriculture agribusiness 
agriscience he said 
the national ffa organizations biggest chapter is in 
philadelphia janke added and farming doesnt mean a whole lot 
to those kids

a dawn compromise on financial aid to 
displaced workers ended the last battle in crafting a clean air 
bill acceptable to congress and president bush 
congressional democrats wanted the 250 million program for 
workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution control 
requirements but the white house had balked fearing the measures 
cost could not be controlled 
the massive legislation the first overhaul of federal clean air 
laws in 13 years was approved monday by congress after months of 
tradeoffs and compromises it calls for a broad range of new 
pollution controls to reduce smog acid rain and toxic chemical 
releases by the end of the decade 
its impact may be felt especially among miners of highsulfur 
coal many who could lose their jobs as utilities switch to other 
fuels to meet new acid rain requirements this prompted the push 
for worker assistance 
by early monday all the major issues in the nearly 700page bill 
had been resolved between the house and senate but the section 
providing help for unemployed workers especially coal miners 
remained a threat to the legislation 
sen robert byrd dwva had threatened to filibuster if the 
provision already approved by the house was removed from the 
bill supporters of the legislation worried that such a tactic 
could induce opponents of the bill to mount a fatal attack in the 
final days of the congressional session 
senior white house aides also made clear that the survival of 
the aid program which was worked into the house bill by rep 
robert wise dwva could prompt a veto by president bush 
it was nearly dawn monday when roger porter the presidents 
domestic policy adviser floated a compromise through sen john 
chafee rri a member of the senate negotiating team designed 
to defuse the dispute 
chafees proposal was quickly accepted 
they were looking to be accommodating said wise of the 
white house compromise we got substantially what we 
wanted he noted the dollar amount 250 million over five years 
was the same as in the original proposal 
the white house has declined to endorse the compromise publicly 
saying its language still has to be studied in detail but a white 
house source acknowledged that the worker assistance issue no 
longer is a matter of concern 
that shouldnt be surprising said a congressional source 
involved in the discussion they wrote it the compromise we 
watched them use the typewriter 
under the compromise workers who lose their jobs because of the 
new clean air requirements would get 26 weeks of additional 
financial assistance after unemployment compensation runs out 
similar to wises original provision 
but rather than go to all workers benefits would be restricted 
to those who could show financial need and money would be strictly 
administered by the labor department through the states with 
worker benefits no longer automatic cost could be contained 
administration officials explained

republican fife symington easily foiled evan 
mechams bid to reclaim the governors seat from which he had been 
ousted 
but the gop millionaire is up against a tougher foe in terry 
goddard the former phoenix mayor who wants to keep the governors 
seat in democratic hands polls consistently have showed symington 
trailing goddard 
democrat rose mofford the former secretary of state inherited 
the governors job in 1988 after the impeachment of her republican 
boss mecham she decided not to run for a full term 
symingtons biggest advantage over goddard is in voter 
registration since there are nearly 100000 more republicans than 
democrats in arizona 
but the fiveway primary left the gop badly split 
conservatives especially those who supported mecham seemed 
reluctant to join the symington camp there even was a shortlived 
effort to find a conservative to run as an independent 
max hawkins a former top mecham aide is waging a writein 
campaign for governor that may attract conservatives who otherwise 
would vote for symington 
mecham has done little to bring the warring gop factions 
together and gave the republican nominee a lessthanwarm 
endorsement 
as ive said many times goddard will be a 100 percent 
disaster fife will be only an 80 percent disaster he said 
president bush is expected to make an appearance for symington 
before the election but analysts doubt it will have much effect on 
the campaign 
recent polls show bush losing popularity both nationally and in 
arizona and such endorsements are of declining and almost 
minimal value in any case said phoenix political consultant bob 
robb 
symington began his generalelection campaign by labeling 
goddard a taxandspend liberal and himself a goldwater 
conservative 
but as the campaign wore on the labels wore thin 
symington has a very long row to hoe but that the gop 
candidate is doing what he needs to do says robb 
what he needs to do robb says is find fault in goddards 
record during six years as mayor of phoenix 
symington accuses goddard of being a professional politician who 
will raise taxes 
goddard meanwhile boasts that the city budget was balanced 
each of the six years he was mayor and that there was only one 
general tax increase 
he has challenged symington to disclose information about his 
dealings as a phoenix developer to show who owns fife 
symington 
other key campaign issues have played to goddards advantage 
analysts say 
goddard is prochoice on abortion while symington has switched 
positions several times during the campaign now symington says he 
believes abortion should be an option up to the point when a fetus 
is viable outside the womb 
what he has managed to do is alienate both sides says 
arizona state university pollster bruce merrill 
both symington and goddard favor a state holiday to honor the 
late civil rights leader martin luther king jr an issue that will 
be on the nov 6 ballot 
but merrill said goddard probably stands to gain the most if it 
passes which recent polls show is likely voters who favor the 
holiday also support goddard by about a 31 margin polls indicate 
mecham was impeached by the state house and convicted by the 
senate of misusing money from supporters and interfering with a 
police investigation of an alleged death threat by one of his 
aides

proponents of the strategic defense initiative 
remain cautiously optimistic that lastminute changes in the 1991 
defense bill will give new life to the embattled antimissile 
program 
its an improvement rep jon kyl rariz a member of the 
house armed services committee said tuesday a lot of it will 
depend on the spirit in which its applied 
the house planned today to consider the 288 billion 
authorization bill setting military spending ceilings for the 
fiscal year that began oct 1 the legislation calls for a nearly 
2 billion cut in president bushs request for sdi barely keeps 
alive the b2 bomber program and slashes troop levels 
action on the defense blueprint comes a week after house and 
senate bargainers worked out a compromise from differing bills 
passed earlier by the two chambers 
the road from that announced agreement to todays expected 
approval has been rocky 
shortly after lawmakers agreed on the military package defense 
secretary dick cheney said he would recommend a presidential veto 
in light of the bills restrictive language on the sdi budget 
provision on base closings and sharp reductions in troop strength 
congressional staffers and pentagon officials worked throughout 
the weekend and monday to reach a compromise finally settling on 
changes that in some cases give cheney greater authority and won 
his backing for the bill 
the bill slashes 18 billion from bushs proposal of 47 
billion for sdi commonly known as star wars 
the cut represents 700 million less than congress spent on star 
wars last year and reflects the increasing belief on capitol hill 
that although the pentagon envisions early deployment sdi will 
largely exist as a research program 
initially the bill divided spending on sdi into five separate 
programs and imposed limits on each categorys budget the language 
was modified to win cheneys approval 
its not as rigid in terms of preventing the sdi office from 
transferring money from one category to another pentagon spokesman 
pete williams told reporters tuesday 
only congress interpretation of the language will determine 
whether the programworks kyl said oversight must be in a 
spirit of cooperation not finding fault but making it work he 
said 
lastminute changes in the legislation also provide cheney with 
added flexibility on troop cuts negotiators agreed on a reduction 
of 100000 from the 21 million troops worldwide added to the bill 
was authority for the defense secretary to limit the cut to 80000 
based on the us military buildup in the persian gulf 
pentagon and congressional officials also changed details in the 
provision setting up an independent commission to recommend 
military bases for closing or realignment the revisions have no 
impact on the overall concept 
in other legislative developments tuesday the house voted to 
spend 193 billion this fiscal year to operate the commerce 
justice and state departments including more money for savings and 
loan prosecutions and the drug war the bill was approved 37740 
and was sent to the senate 
the total spending in the bill is 529 million less than the 
amount appropriated for the three departments last year and 681 
million less than requested by bush 
the bill provides 85 billion for the justice department 
including 105 million in various divisions for savings and loan 
investigations and 694 million for the drug enforcement 
administration dea spending is 146 million more than last year 
but 6 million less than requested by the president

the 1990 farm bill described by one house 
member as the child nobody wants is on its way to the senate for 
final approval 
the house voted 318102 tuesday to accept the revisions made in 
their original bill by a housesenate conference committee 
most of those speaking in favor of the bill said they were sorry 
about the changes in farm support required by deficit reduction 
mandates 
we have a farm bill child said rep pat roberts rkan 
we would like some other kind of child we dont want to claim 
parentage we have to take the responsibility and move ahead 
after the house and senate passed their original bills budget 
negotiators decided that farm spending over the next five years 
would have to be reduced by 136 billion to assist in cutting a 
total 500 billion from the federal budget 
that left the conference committee with the job of adjusting 
subsidy programs to cut farm spending during the next five years to 
408 billion 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas said 
all the members of the agriculture committee thought the cut was 
too great since farm spending is less than one percent of the 
overall budget 
the bush administration which originally sought even greater 
cuts in agriculture was blamed for the bite 
it is a bad bill said rep david nagle diowa who voted 
against it it is a bad bill for american farmers and was 
handcrafted by the administration 
the administration of george bush and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter in my judgment has worked to lower farm prices in 
america said rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the 
agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains 
in my judgment it has been a disgrace what has happened to 
rural america this bill tries to put a stop to it its a 
meager attempt but it is the best we could do under the 
circumstances he said 
the bill directs farmers to reduce subsidized acreage by 15 
percent on condition congress passes the expected budget cuts 
still being negotiated by the house and senate 
in addition to the subsidy programs the farm bill establishes 
new environmental practices for farmers sets up national standards 
for organic farming and revises agricultural trade policy 
it offers programs for minority farmers and dying rural 
communities establishes new methods for preserving forests and 
streamlines the procedures for delivering food aid abroad 
de la garza said cuts in farm support could be renegotiated if 
economic conditions change during the fiveyear life of the farm 
bill 
nothing is permanent in legislation he said we dont 
know what is happening at gatt but that might necessitate some 
changes 
us officials negotiating the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade have been trying to get other countries to reduce the 
subsidies they place on exports if successful us agricultural 
sales internationally could change dramatically the talks are 
expected to be completed in december 
meanwhile we will have some 136 billion worth of cuts which 
are painful unjust and unfair but we are being responsible as i 
said we would be said de la garza

the senate ethics committee unable to make a 
decision to dismiss or advance cases against the keating five 
senators will instead hold a postelection hearing that will keep 
the inquiry alive for all those under investigation 
the committee decision ignored for the present its special 
counsels recommendation that the investigation be dismissed 
against sen john glenn dohio and the only republican in the 
probe john mccain of arizona 
mccain branded the decision to do nothing now and hold 
hearings starting nov 15 an act of political cowardice 
glenn pronounced himself disappointed 
dropping mccain would have left only three democrats under 
investigation among the five senators who assisted charles h 
keating jr a major political donor and the sampl owner who 
presided over the nations costliest thrift collapse the delay 
cost republicans a valuable campaign issue 
the committee special counsel robert s bennett also proposed 
that the investigation be continued against three democrats alan 
cranston of california donald w riegle of michgan and dennis 
deconcini of arizona 
the ranking committee republican sen warren rudman of new 
hampshire said the three democrats and three republicans on the 
panel voted without gaining a majority of four on every possible 
combination and permutation that would have advanced or dismissed 
the investigation 
but the committee was unanimous he said in ordering the 
factfinding hearing that panel chairman howell heflin dala 
said could take 10 days 
heflin said the committee expected to complete its work and 
report to the senate by dec 31 
cranston issued a statement saying the public is entitled to 
get beyond the malicious rumors and selective leaks and to know 
all the facts i see this as an opportunity to achieve the public 
vindication i know i deserve 
mccain called the committees refusal to act an outrage that 
will lead to allegations of a cover up of findings that proposed 
his exoneration 
riegle said he was bound by a committee requirement not to 
discuss the case but said its impossible to respond adequately 
to false charges and inaccurate and misleading characterizations 
glenn said he was disappointed by the ethics committees 
decision not to make a decision he said he has no hesitancy in 
appearing at the public session but added i dont see how that 
helps the committee make up its mind 
all five senators have denied any connection between keatings 
money and their help for the irvine califbased thrift which was 
seized by the us government in april 1989 at a potential cost to 
taxpayers of more than 2 billion 
documents recently obtained by the associated press and others 
indicate that cranston deconcini and riegle had more extensive 
relationships with keating than they previously acknowledged 
for example the documents show that cranston wrote keating to 
thank him for a 250000 contribution to a cranstonbacked voter 
registration project and at the same time expressed his pleasure 
that keating met with the top thrift regulator to plead his case 
about lincoln 
and they reveal how deconcini assisted keating in his effort to 
have former top thrift regulator edwin j gray removed from the 
examination of lincoln 
keating who ran lincoln and its parent company american 
continental corp of phoenix was indicted sept 19 in california 
on state criminal fraud charges the indictment was related to sale 
of 250 million in highrisk bonds to depositors from lincolns 
branches bonds that became worthless when american continental 
went bankrupt

democratic senatorial nominee hugh parmer 
says us sen phil gramm received an illegal gift and vowed to 
file a complaint with the senate ethics committee if no one else 
does 
gramms spokesman larry neal said the charge was laughable 
and that parmer should resign from the race 
now that he has abandoned all hope of winning he wants to 
spend the last few weeks smearing the senators reputation neal 
said 
parmer said gramm bought lakefront property near corsicana in 
1983 for below market price and at below market interest rate this 
deal constituted a gift that gramm did not report on his public 
financial statements parmer said 
in addition parmer said gramm bought the land from dr louis 
gibson who then was director of first republic bank of corsicana 
parmer said the bank had a political action committee in washington 
that lobbied members of congress 
it is illegal for members of congress to receive gifts from 
persons with a direct interest in legislation before congress

of belfast police headquarters said in a statement

near londonderry 65 miles northwest of belfast 
the british domestic news agency press association quoted 
unnamed sources in the security forces as saying the two attacks 
appeared to have been coordinated

a senate showdown over the threatened northern 
spotted owl turned into a debate over the future of the pacific 
northwests oldest forests and a vote of confidence in the 
endangered species act 
the owl is an indicator species as it goes so goes the 
forest sen albert gore jr dtenn said tuesday night 
on a 6234 vote the senate rejected an attempt to circumvent 
the endangered species act so northwest logging could continue 
regardless of the impact on the rare bird 
republican senators in oregon and washington pushed the plan to 
help soften the economic blow on communities expected to be hit 
hard by dramatic reductions in timber harvests as a result of 
federally mandated protection of the owl 
gore and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine led 
the charge against oregon sen bob packwoods amendment to the 
interior appropriations bill 
the senate also voted 5244 to reject an amendment to the bill 
by sen wyche fowler jr dga to reduce roadbuilding funds for 
the forest service by 100 million from a planned 196 million 
timber companies rely on public funds to go up to the top 
steep slopes the older growth places of scenic beauty fowler 
argued roadbuilding expense caused the forest service to lose 
365 million on timber sales last year he said 
western senators contended the amendment would gut logging in 
their states mill towns into ghost towns thats what the fowler 
amendment creates in my state said sen mark hatfield rore 
the fish and wildlife services decision to declare the owl a 
threatened species in june sounded a warning that within our 
lifetime an entire ancient ecosystem may be lost forever 
mitchell said 
forest service biologists have determined the owl is on the road 
to extinction unless logging is banned across millions of acres of 
the northwests oldest forests 
the government predicts logging reductions to protect the owl 
will cost the northwest tens of thousands of timber jobs by the end 
of the decade 
experts estimate about 3000 pairs of the secretive 20inch 
owls survive in the oldgrowth forests of oregon washington and 
northern california 
packwoods amendment to the interior appropriations bill would 
have eased the criteria required to convene the endangered species 
committee 
that cabinetlevel panel commonly referred to as the god 
committee has the authority to overrule the acts protection of 
wildlife if it determines the economic consequences of such 
protection is too severe 
i hope we have not reached the point where the holy grail is 
science and only science and nothing else counts packwood said 
in a senate floor speech 
the endangered species committee chaired by the secretary of 
interior has met only twice in the 17year history of the 
endangered species act once in a dispute over the snail darter and 
tennessees tellico dam 
a final vote on the interior appropriations bill which includes 
controversial funding for the national endowment for the arts is 
expected later this week

lawmakers angry at the bush administrations 
hideandseek call for new taxpayer dollars for the savings and 
loan bailout are moving to approve only a fraction of the billions 
being sought 
the house banking committee voted tuesday to slash to 10 
billion the administrations request for 57 billion to continue 
the bailout through the 1991 fiscal year that began oct 1 
both democrats and republicans on the panel suggested congress 
should deny any new bailout money in view of bushs assertion a 
year ago that never again would taxpayers be tapped for it and 
treasury secretary nicholas bradys refusal to testify why that has 
changed 
but warned by regulators that the bailouts total costs might 
swell an additional 300 million in the next three months without 
the funds the committee voted just enough money to keep the 
program going through february 
the more you give them the more they are going to squander 
complained rep toby roth rwis who suggested not approving any 
new funds 
here we are at the 11th hour subjected to the old squeeze 
play 
the senate banking committee two weeks ago approved the 
administrations request for 57 billion but congressional and 
administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they dont expect it to ever reach the senate floor for a vote 
instead they said the house is likely to pass its committees 
version within the next two days and send it to the senate senate 
leaders would then attach the house version to another bill 
possibly one toughening penalties for sampl fraud through a 
parliamentary maneuver that would allow senators to avoid a 
recorded rollcall vote on the issue 
administration officials had warned in recent months the 50 
billion that bush sought and got from congress a year ago would not 
be enough after contending then it be more than ample over the 
summer brady suggested another 40 billion to 80 billion might be 
needed 
however the administration never submitted a formal request for 
the money until brady wrote the chairmen of the house and senate 
banking committees two weeks ago saying virtually all of the 
original 50 billion had been spent 
the bailout will virtually cease within the next two months 
unless additional funds are provided he warned leaving hundreds 
of insolvent thrifts still operating and losing federally insured 
deposits 
house democrats joined by some republicans insisted that 
administration officials make a pitch for the new money in public 
hearings and before tv cameras to share more of the political heat 
for the swelling sampl problem 
brady refused several requests to testify just two weeks before 
an election in which polls show the sampl crisis contributing to 
voter antipathy toward officeholders lawmakers were irked even 
more when they learned that brady was posing for photographers 
rather than appear at one scheduled hearing 
the administration should have been here rep charles 
schumer dny said just prior to the house panels vote tuesday 
this is going to be a long haul on the savings and loan bill and 
everybodys going to have to do some heavy lifting 
the house panels chairman rep henry gonzalez dtexas said 
further money to keep the bailout going beyond february will not 
occur until secretary brady and other officials of the 
administration appear in fulldress oversight hearings

sen jesse helms will try to slip a new 
antiobscenity noose around the national endowment for the arts 
when the senate begins debate today on the emotional issue of 
federal support for artistic works that some view as offensive 
helms a conservative north carolina republican is leading the 
fight to impose explicit new curbs on the neas grantmaking 
powers he is opposed by a bipartisan group of senators who favor 
having the courts decide whether neasupported works are obscene 
on monday night helms introduced a proposal to forbid the arts 
endowment to spend federal funds on any works that depict or 
describe in a patently offensive way sexual or excretory 
activities or organs 
the ban proposed by helms omits any mention of obscenity by 
name apparently to satisfy objections by opponents of such curbs 
that the nea has no business making judgments about obscenity 
at midday today the senate planned to start seven hours of 
debate on the helms amendment and a rival plan backed by sens 
orrin hatch rutah and claiborne pell dri that would 
penalize grant recipients who are later convicted of violating 
obscenity laws 
the proposed helms ban if approved would replace a laundry 
list of antiobscenity curbs that congress slapped on the nea a 
year ago the bill up for senate action today would renew those 
restrictions extend the endowments life through next september 
and trim its proposed 175 million budget by 5 million 
the current ban forbids nea support for works that may be 
considered obscene including but not limited to depictions of 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts and which when taken as a 
whole do not have serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value 
that helmsinspired ban was approved amid an escalating 
political controversy over nea grants for exhibitions of works by 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano which 
helms and other conservative lawmakers denounced as obscene and 
sacrilegious 
the senate bill also would allow nea chairman john e frohnmayer 
to continue his requirement that grant reipients sign a 
nonobscenity pledge the pledge has caused widespread protests in 
the arts community and resulted in three federal lawsuits 
challenging the pledges constitutionality 
by contrast the house voted last week to boost the endowments 
171 million budget to 180 million outlaw frohnmayers pledge and 
omit any explicit antiobscenity restrictions 
the house bill says only that obscenity lacks artistic merit is 
not protected speech and shall not be funded 
the house voted overwhelmingly to scrap the current obscenity 
ban and instead to require the nea to recover its money from any 
grant recipient whose works are later ruled obscene by the courts 
a similar compromise was contained in a separate bill approved 
by the senate labor and human resources committee by a 151 vote 
with strong bipartisan support but helms effectively blocked floor 
action on that measure 
differences between the house and senate bills will have to be 
reconciled by negotiators from both chambers before a final nea 
bill is enacted

the senate has passed legislation to upgrade 
security at airline and airports including directing the 
government to develop guidelines for warning passengers of 
terrorist threats 
but rather than face a possible veto it amended the bill 
approved by the house last week to give the bush administration 
more flexibility in making airlines buy and use explosive detection 
devices that have been widely criticized for their inaccuracy 
the federal aviation administration wanted to make airlines 
acquire 150 of the thermal neutron analysis devices at a total 
cost of 175 million and deploy them at 15 international airports 
in the united states and 25 abroad 
but a test of the device last april at new yorks jfk airport by 
a presidential commission that investigated the 1988 bombing of pan 
am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland showed that it could not 
detect the amount of plastic explosives used in that bomb 
the bill approved in the senate on tuesday now goes back to 
the house which is expected to approve the senate changes and send 
it to the white house

a federal appeals court has invalidated a 
federal communications commission decision that allows american 
telephone amp telegraph co to discount longdistance packages for 
large corporations 
the us circuit court of appeals here held tuesday that the fcc 
did not fully examine whether the customized longdistance services 
atampt offers its larger corporate clients violated the 
communications act 
the appellate court ordered the fcc to review its 1989 decision 
on the socalled tariff 12 services offered by atampt whose 
longdistance operations are subject to government regulation 
atampt started offering the longdistance packages to companies 
such as general electric co ford motor co and dupont in 1988 
several of atampts longdistance competitors including mci 
telecommunications inc and us sprint challenged the 
arrangements 
we have the impression that there is a certain air of 
unreality about this case said the court opinion the fcc one 
way or another will undoubtedly permit atampt to compete effectively 
against its competitors in the large user market if that is what is 
really involved here but we are obliged to insist that it do so by 
turning square corners of administrative law

the house has passed and sent to president 
bush a bill that would ban the use of largescale drift nets in 
us waters up to 200 miles offshore and their use by american 
fishing fleets anywhere in the world 
on a voice vote the house dropped its own version of the 
legislation and agreed to adopt a bill approved earlier this month 
by the senate that also would require bush to seek an international 
ban on driftnet fishing 
the nets which can extend up to 40 miles around have been 
blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins other sea mammals 
and birds caught in their paths as they are dragged through the 
water to trap commercial fish 
the bill expands the 1976 magnuson fishery and conservation act 
to include previously exempted tuna in government controls over 
commercial and sport fishing within 200 miles of the us 
coastline 
the legislation also requires the government to develop 
standards that tuna canners would have to adopt in order to label 
their product dolphin safe 
some companies according to lawmakers have adopted the 
dolphin safe label in response to boycotts by environmentalists 
even though they continue to purchase tuna known to have been 
caught in nets responsible for dolphin deaths

a new device that opens blocked fallopian tubes 
with a tiny balloon can offer a simpler and cheaper method for 
helping infertile women become pregnant doctors reported today 
however the technique is designed for a particular type of 
blockage present mong only 10 percent of the estimated 1 million 
american women who have blocked fallopian tubes 
the procedure which requires neither surgery nor general 
anesthesia is similar to the use of balloons to open the clogged 
arteries of heart patients according to the report in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
the balloon is mounted on a flexible tube called a catheter and 
threaded through the womb into one of the fallopian tubes which 
connect the uterus to the ovaries once the balloon is in place 
doctors inflate it to open the passage 
dr edmond confino the studys lead author and director of 
education in obstetrics and gynecology at mount sinai hospital 
medical center in chicago said the procedure could reduce by 
twothirds the cost of treating women with blockages who now 
usually choose between microsurgery or testtube fertilization 
the procedure is expected to cost a third as much as testtube 
fertilization which totals about 6000 succeeds about 20 percent 
of the time and results in only a single pregnancy microsurgery 
in which the patients abdomen is opened typically costs up to 
10000 confino said 
a surgeon not involved in the study said he believes the 
technique offers no significant advantages over still another 
method simple catheterization simple catheterization uses the 
flexible tube itself to clear the blockage 
im not against the technique its just another variation 
said dr rafael valle associate professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at northwestern university medical school in chicago 
confino said the balloon device is superior to regular 
catheterization because it causes far fewer puncture wounds and 
provides longerlasting results 
the device is designed to treat proximal tubal occlusion or 
blockage of a tube near the point where it enters the uterus 
it isnt designed to treat the much more common distal tubal 
occlusion which is blockage farther up the tubes where they pick 
up the egg from the ovary this type afflicts 90 percent of the 
women with blocked fallopian tubes 
the balloon procedure called transcervical balloon tuboplasty 
is awaiting food and drug administration approval in tests the 
procedure opened one or both tubes in about 135 of 150 women and 
about 45 conceived confino said 
confino said the study covered the first 77 subjects all of 
whom had proximal blockage seventyone of them had one or both 
tubes cleared six couldnt be cleared 
in 13 of the 77 after doctors cleared the proximal blockage 
they found distal blockage that could not be cleared the report 
said among the remaining 64 subjects 22 became pregnant within a 
year it said 
seventeen had normal deliveries five miscarried one patient 
had a pregnancy that developed outside the womb and had to be 
ended 
in two cases of the 77 the tuboplasty procedure punched a 
pinpoint hole in the wall of the fallopian tube but no 
complications resulted the researchers said

bob guccione and penthouse magazine have been 
ordered to pay more than 4 million to a former pet of the year who 
said she was forced to perform hardcore sex acts and sleep with 
two guccione associates 
sexual slavery was not part of her job description supreme 
court justice elliott wilk said in finding that the magazine 
publisher made sexual demands on marjorie thoreson as a condition 
of employment at penthouse where she worked from 1973 to 1980 
his cold and calculating use of sexual coercion forced her 
to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body the judge 
said tuesday 
thoreson 37 testified during the 1989 trial that guccione 
forced her to perform hardcore sex acts in a pornographic movie 
and used her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a 
hotelcasino he owned in atlantic city 
she said guccione also ordered her to carry on an affair with 
his financial adviser so he would move from england to the united 
states she said she severed the relationship because it appeared 
the adviser was going to leave his wife and children 
thoresons lawyer murray schwartz said she cried when he 
called her in california with the news 
this decision is for all the women like her who may have 
suffered at the hands of guccione schwartz said he has 
finally been held accountable 
penthouses lawyer jeffrey daichman called the award an 
outrage and said he will appeal 
he said that thoreson had a relationship with guccione before 
she was employed by penthouse but during the time of her 
employment there was no sexual relationship between her and 
anybody associated with penthouse 
at the trial guccione testified that thoreson was a potential 
marilyn monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime 
gucciones only evidence to contradict thoreson was his word 
wilk noted the judge who heard the case with no jury added i 
do not believe him 
wilk awarded thoreson 60000 in compensatory damages and 4 
million in punitive damages the judge said the amounts were based 
on gucciones 150 million personal worth and penthouses market 
value of about 200 million 
thoreson originally from st paul minn approached guccione 
in 1973 at age 20 she sent him nude photos of herself and a 
letter 
at the time she was living in california where she was working 
as a cocktail waitress and topless dancer did some modeling and 
took acting lessons she also had several minor brushes with the 
law the judge said 
guccione said in a statement tuesday that penthouse presented 
evidence that thoreson was a former prostitute drug abuser and 
threetime felon who had violated her probation 
thoreson said she told guccione she wanted to be an actress he 
signed her to a personal management contract changed her name to

stock market investors are fearful of another steep drop after 
recent consecutive gains in the nikkei wednesday mornings drop 
was the first since monday 
they were getting reluctant to buy any more in such a short 
period of time said kazuyuki suzuki a trader with daiwa 
securities co 
suzuki said the market was also suffering from a lack of fresh 
news to stimulate investors buying interests 
on the foreign exchange the dollars rise was accelerated by 
selling by institutional investors once it passed the 128yen 
level dealers said 
the dollar has risen 273 yen in the last three trading days 
after a 13day slide of 1355 yen 
the speed of the dollars drop against the yen combined with 
market fears of intervention triggered the dollars recent 
upswing dealers said 
some dealers said the dollar may have hit bottom and could rise 
back as high as the 129yen range while others said it is too 
early to determine whether the weakdollar trend has reversed 
because investors are still wary of the us federal budget and the 
middle east 
the situation favoring the strong yen has not changed the 
dollars fall to the 123yen level was much too rapid traders were 
nervous about selling but did it anyway because everyone else was

barry brakeshoe schwartz got 
the bums rush when he tried to catch a bus from the los angeles 
freight yard to the hobo club meeting 
the buses wouldnt pick us up because we were too dirty 
schwartz explained so he took a 21 cab ride to the bar where the 
club meets in beverly hills 
schwartz a video maker from oakland represents a new breed of 
hobo parttime wanderers with jobs credit cards and gasp 
automobiles 
the 4000 members nationwide of the hobo club share their 
freightcar forefathers grimy fashion and yen for unauthorized 
rail travel but little else 
hobos are known as people without very much money said 
sheri hometown doyel 23 who did her thesis on rail riders 
while attending the university of california at los angeles and 
here we are in beverly hills drinking 3 and 4 beers its 
ironic 
hobo culture is serious anthropological stuff and there is 
something very american about it doyel said 
people think hobo they think homeless she said its not 
the same thing 
the first hobos were said to have been unemployed men who rode 
the rails seeking work after the civil war hobo lore has it the 
originals carried hoes for field work hence the name hoe boy 
in the old days it was need and desperation said garth 
bishop of los angeles publisher of the hobo times newsletter 
most of the young people now do it for a weekend for a vacation 
adventure 
the use of monikers like freight train george and 
minneapolis jewel became part of the subculture the nicknames 
precursors to truckers citizensband radio handles were 
intended to obscure a hobos background but they have come to 
describe characteristics of the hobos themselves 
dont make the mistake of calling them tramps or worse bums 
hobos claim they are honest guys and gals who work when they can 
not like the petty criminals they call tramps bums are well 
bums 
the railroads say some of their ranks are transients and all 
of their wanderlust is illegal 
its hardly glamorous said cathy westphal spokeswoman for 
the atchison topeka amp santa fe railway co our equipment was not 
meant for the transport of human beings 
westphal said the world of illegal rail travel also is populated 
by people who would just as soon slit your throat as look at 
you 
and she said yuppie hobos set a poor example for children 
i cant tell you how many children get their legs cut off 
trying to hop moving trains she said 
hobo club members agreed there may be some danger they refer 
to train wheels as salami slicers but it isnt enough to stop 
them 
danger is going 70 mph without a seat belt said greta 
shred 27 a filmmaker and electrician from san francisco 
several club members have never even been on a train bishop 
said membership is automatic with an 18ayear newsletter

2 live crew took the stage in their first 
show since they beat an obscenity rap and came off too tame for 
many fans 
it wasnt as nasty as they wanna be said kelly jackson 20 
of cincinnati 
about 850 fans attended the concert tuesday at the 1300person 
capacity ritz music hall 
police observed the performance and said they found nothing 
wrong no arrests were made during the adultsonly noalcohol 
show 
on saturday the rap group whose music contains references to 
oral and anal sex and violence against women was acquitted of 
obscenity over a show held after a judge pronounced their album 
as nasty as they wanna be obscene 
on tuesday band leader luther campbell wearing an american 
flag bandanna took the stage with the advice if you dont like 
what we sing dont bring your ass in the house 
the band often stopping short of finishing the lyrics instead 
pointing their microphones toward the audience which responded by 
shouting the dirty words 
some fans thought the 50minute show was too brief and that the 
rappers were unable to express themselves as explicitly as they did 
before their trial 
it was too limited in what they could say said peter adams 
25 of indianapolis 
campbell performed several numbers with the top of his jeans

buttocks exposed

wisconsins tourism director was suspended 
for arranging a promotional article in a sexually explicit japanese 
magazine 
development secretary robert trunzo announced tuesday he ordered 
richard matty suspended without pay for seven days after consulting 
with gov tommy g thompson 
i see no merit in promoting our state in a publication with 
sexually explicit material that most people in wisconsin would find 
personally offensive and which is degrading and insensitive to 
women trunzo said in a letter to matty 
use of the magazine is inconsistent with our departments 
commitment to the states equal opportunity and affirmative action 
policies trunzo said 
the governor suggested disciplinary action trunzo said 
he was furious 
matty and other state tourism officials arranged to promote 
wisconsin in the magazine hoseki trunzo said a reporter and 
photographer for the magazine visited in 1989 touring the state 
with knowles and ran a 12page article in february 
matty said he did not have time to review a copy of the magazine 
before publication of the promotion 
i was acting on the recommendation of our foreign office that 
it was a popular wellread and good promotional tool for 
wisconsin he said 
trunzo said he also expected to discipline two other state 
tourism officials including the director of the wisconsin office 
in tokyo 
the disciplinary action was not the first against matty 58 
since he was appointed by thompson in 1987 matty was suspended for 
three days last year and agreed to pay 6957 to settle a sexual 
harassment complaint by a former employee

months ago president bush was talking the 
talk but in the language of the civil rights movement talking 
the talk must be accompanied by walking the walk and now 
bush is seen as walking the wrong the way 
civil rights leaders bitterly accused the president of betrayal 
for vetoing as expected a major antidiscrimination bill monday 
bush said the measure would have led to hiring quotas something 
sponsors dispute 
coretta scott king widow of martin luther king jr said 
tuesday the president had pandered to those who profit from 
discrimination she said the veto demonstrates racist attitudes 
among those who call the shots in the white house 
how far we have regressed since the days when a courageous and 
principled president supported civil rights legislation and 
challenged the nation to a higher standard of equality she said 
referring to president lyndon johnson who signed the civil rights 
act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 
civil rights leaders criticism for the veto ended a relatively 
peaceful period in the relationship between the white house and 
minorities 
we dont have to read his lips anymore said the rev joseph 
lowery president of the southern christian leadership conference 
the atlantabased civil rights group founded by king his lips 
have spoken loud and clear 
a few months ago he was talking the talk said rep john 
lewis dga once a king aide he met with people he said good 
things it was a breath of fresh air for the civil rights 
movement but lewis said bush walked the wrong way 
the civil rights forces will continue to talk and negotiate 
if not about this bill about something else lewis said but 
there is a rift there will be a schism because his action was 
very divisive 
the senate planned an override vote today on the measure which 
would effectively overturn six us supreme court decisions that 
have made it harder for women and minorities to prove job 
discrimination twothirds majorities in both the senate and house 
are required to override a veto 
bush predicted tuesday that congress would uphold his veto 
i feel pretty good i think were in good shape he said in 
waterbury conn where he was campaigning for gary franks a black 
republican congressional candidate who also opposed the bill 
asked what signal his veto sent to minorities the president 
said i think it sends a signal that we are for civil rights and 
are opposed to quotas 
he added i do what i think is right and i think ill have 
strong support across racial lines 
in chicago eugene dibble a black businessman and republican 
fundraiser was distressed 
it makes me very uncomfortable to have these two or three 
pictures of president and mrs bush sitting on my desk dibble 
said i dont know what to say when someone black comes in here 
and asks me how could you support the man who vetoed civil 
rights 
in washington jesse jackson said the veto was a call to a 
return to massive direct action he said that could include 
street demonstrations and other forms of nonviolent protest 
jackson accused bush of a closeddoor policy and he has a 
closedmind policy he is betraying the american dream

a us senate promise to link 
military aid to conduct by both the salvadoran government and the 
rebels could speed up peace talks that resume early next month 
some salvadoran leaders say 
the senate last week halved the 85 million aid package and 
promised to cut aid altogether if the rightist government of 
president alfredo cristiani were to withdraw from peace talks 
if the rebels fail to demonstrate good faith in negotiations 
or launch a major offensive the slashed 425 million would be 
restored 
on tuesday the rebels launched their second hitandrun attack 
on a military headquarters in week 
but their two homemade mortartype bombs fell about 500 feet 
short of their intended target the downtown defense ministry 
killing two children and wounding two women 
six days earler similar homemade mortars were used in an attack 
on the main air force base on the capitals eastern edge 
the 11yearold civil war has claimed the lives of about 72000 
people 
amnesty international today reported a significant upsurge in 
the number of killings by armysupported death squads the 
londonbased human rights group said 45 people were killed by death 
squads in the first seven months of 1990 more than during all of 
last year 
justice minister oscar santamaria called fridays senate vote to 
halve military aid the result of successful incursions by the 
fmln in washington 
he was referring to the leftist rebel farabundo marti national 
liberation front which has waged war against a succession of 
usbacked governments 
its not as if we dont need the aid because those fighting 
the system those in the fmln are still waging their battle 
santamaria said monday 
but santamaria head of the government delegation to peace talks 
with the rebels also emphasized that the us move provides an 
incentive to the fmln to contribute more to the success of the 
peace process 
rebel and government negotiators are scheduled to resume peace 
talks nov 4 in mexico 
peace talks have bogged down on the issue of the future role of 
the armed forces the rebels demand a drastic purge and reduction 
of security forces that would culminate in the demilitarization 
of salvadoran society 
the government says it is in favor of weeding out negative 
elements from the army but it rejects a wholesale purge 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez roman catholic auxiliary bishop 
of san salvador told a news conference on sunday that the aid cut 
gives rise to signs of hope because it is a recognition that 
peace cannot be constructed with arms 
he said the congressional move makes the peace process more 
viable 
juan jose martell a leader of the leftist popular social 
christian movement said the reduction and conditioning of the aid 
is a positive message to both sides in the conflict 
but the defense minister col rene emilio ponce said the cut 
in aid constituted a negative signal to everything that 
represents the countrys institutionality and a positive signal to 
the belligerent adventure planned by the fmln it would prolong the 
conflict 
many of the civil wars deaths have been blamed on rightwing 
death squads operating in cooperation with the military several 
military officials have been charged in the murders last year of 
six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
people are just fed up with this thing sen christopher 
dodd dconn said after the friday vote referring to the 
millions of dollars in us aid sent to el salvador over the past 
decade

contemporary american writers ernest hemingway 
f scott fitzgerald and eugene oneill made the grade so did women 
authors jane austen willa cather george eliot and virginia woolf 
but 18th century english novelists henry fielding and laurence 
sterne arent as great as they used to be say the editors of the 
newly revised great books of the western world 
fieldings tom jones and sternes tristram shandy were 
dropped from the newandimproved version the works of 60 new 
authors were brought into the fold with such minds as plato 
aristotle and homer 
the volumes include the writings of historians philosophers 
scientists theologians and others from ancient greece and rome 
medieval and modern europe and the americas 
its been 38 years since encyclopaedia britannica inc published 
the original set featuring 74 authors and 443 works including 
books essays and plays 
the chicagobased publishing company said it was time to give 
recognition to new writers and a second chance to some who were 
passed over the first time 
its not that it was outdated said robert p gwinn 
chairman of encyclopaedia britannica but basically the world is 
changing and we thought we needed to include 45 new authors who 
made significant contributions in the first half of the 20th 
century 
four authors were dropped from the earlier collection which 
included no women or 20thcentury authors the revised set features 
130 authors and 517 works totaling 37000 pages in 60 volumes 
the idea for the original 54volume set came from mortimer j 
adler an author and philosopher who has served as a member of 
britannicas board of editors since its inception in 1947 now hes 
the projects editor in chief 
he and a team of editors and consultants from abc newsman hugh 
downs to science fiction writer isaac asimov were the final 
judges 
we werent searching for the archaeological monuments of the 
past adler said these works are still contemporary what 
makes them great is that you cant exhaust them you can read them 
again and again and still learn something from them 
not everyone believes the list is all that great 
the volumes include mostly european and a few american authors 
said reginald gibbons an english literature professor at 
northwestern university 
i dont see many latin american and african american 
authors gibbons said i think thats very disappointing its 
a good list but its not a great list 
if theyve only just gotten around to adding the names of jane 
austen and virginia woolf he said then they must be taking a 
terrifically cautious approach to education i think thats 
wrong 
also dropped from the list fouriers analytical theory of 
heat and apollonius of pergas on conic sections 
prices for the set range from 1399 to 1899 depending on the 
type of binding

a prominent central asian writer has become the 
first person to quit president mikhail s gorbachevs advisory 
council a move symbolic of frustrations with the stagnation of 
soviet reform efforts 
chingiz aitmatov a writer from kirghiz once touted as a 
candidate for the nobel prize in literature confirmed in an 
interview tuesday that he is leaving the presidential council to 
become ambassador to luxembourg 
rumors of aitmatovs appointment to the diplomatic post had 
caused a sensation in the soviet press 
the prestigious council which gorbachev created this year as an 
alternative to the politburo is one of the most important of the 
newly established or reformed soviet political institutions 
young people want to be involved in politics but i really 
dont care about it said aitmatov 62 looking worn and tired 
during an interview in his office 
he said that his appointment to luxembourg has the blessing of 
the president gorbachev and awaits only the agreement of the 
luxembourg government 
although he said he was not a pessimist he was generally 
downbeat about the future of the soviet union in keeping with the 
gloom that has gripped the country with the onset of winter and the 
apparent failure of what had promised to be a bountiful harvest 
aitmatov dismissed people who say the total collapse of the 
soviet empire would be good 
it is a sick organism but a living one he said 
fragmentation and disorder inside this organism would not benefit 
anyone inside or outside the country 
aitmatov said his duties on the presidential council included 
ethnic problems but otherwise he declined to shed much light on 
the inner workings of the council one of the most important of the 
newly created or reformed soviet political institutions 
gorbachev created the council earlier this year as an 
alternative to the politburo the party body that formerly made 
important national decisions 
the list of members reads like a westernstyle cabinet 
including the ministers of defense foreign affairs and interior 
the state planning chief and the head of the kgb security police 
aitmatov is one of two novelists on the body and the only 
representative from mostly moslem central asia the other writer is 
valentin rasputin a leader of the ecological movement from siberia 
and a russian nationalist 
the most famous son of kirghizia aitmatov was catapulted to 
world literary fame in the early 1980s by his play ascent of mount 
fuji and a novel the day lasts more than a hundred years that 
expressed the frustrations of the soviet union before gorbachevs 
reforms 
this month aitmatov published an epilogue to his novel 
recounting the suicide of the hero after he is arrested on 
political charges 
aitmatovs departure from the presidential council and the 
country symbolize new frustrations born of the apparent failure of 
gorbachevs reforms to improve living standards or to shake the 
communist bureaucracys grip on power 
the kirghiz legislature is considering a sovereignty resolution 
like those approved by nearly all of the 15 soviet republics 
including russia said aitmatov 
but for the time being we central asiass cant leave 
russia he said citing the economic ties that he said now are 
more important than cultural and religious differences 
the four central asian republics of kirghizia uzbekistan 
turkmenia and tadzhikistan are generally more rural and poorer than 
the rest of the soviet union

armysupported death squads already have killed 
more people in el salvador this year than during all of last year 
amnesty international said today 
between january and early august 45 people were reportedly 
killed by death squads in the central american country compared to 
40 in 1989 said the londonbased human rights group 
amnesty said killings torture and disappearances have 
continued in el salvador despite a un agreement on human rights 
signed july 26 by the government of president alfredo cristiani and 
the guerilla farabundo marti national liberation front 
bodies of victims have been found mutilated some with their 
faces completely destroyed and others with signs of having been 
brutally tortured victims have been shot dead on the streets or in 
their homes the amnesty report says 
the nobel peace prizewinning group detailed several killings 
including an agricultural cooperative member slain aug 1 at work 
and a union member who was taken from his home by two men in 
civilian clothes july 23 his body was found the following day 
amnesty said its information on the death squad killings came 
from former members of the security forces among other sources 
amnesty said its sources and other information including 
testimonies by former members of the military suggests that those 
responsible for these actions death squad killings are linked to 
the armed forces 
athe report says four apparent death squad killings that 
occurred in the days following the un accord suggest that those 
responsible are continuing to operate with the confidence that they 
will not be punished 
amnesty said cristianis government had acknowledged reform was 
needed and that the security forces sometimes committed 
excesses but the government has denied involvement 
however the extent and nature of the abuses and the fact that 
human rights violations have been committed with almost total 
impunity under this and previous government has left little doubt 
of official complicity amnesty said 
the rights organization said it was also concerned about reports 
of rights abuses linked to the rebels 
the report on el salvador is based on findings by amnesty 
delegates who visited the country in april 
the report contains 34 recommendations including making full 
investigations into violations strengthening the office of the 
attorney general and ensuring its independence and protection for 
judges and witnesses involved in human rights cases 
about 72000 people have been killed in the 11yearold civil 
war 
the two sides began ceasefire talks in may and are scheduled to 
meet nov 4 in mexico 
after the un agreement the government spoke out publicly 
against torture and established rights training courses amnesty 
said the government revised detention guidelines and established a 
24hour office to provide information on detainees the report 
says

a selfproclaimed expert on the death penalty and 
builder of execution machines was charged with posing as an 
engineer after a jewish group incensed by his views on the 
holocaust revealed he held only a history degree 
fred a leuchter jr 47 was arraigned tuesday on a charge of 
fraudulently practicing engineering he pleaded not guilty and was 
released on his own recognizance the offense carries up to 90 days 
in jail and a 500 fine 
leuchter a resident of suburban malden designs and builds 
electric chairs gallows and lethal injection machines for states 
with the death penalty including tennessee new jersey delaware 
illinois and missouri 
he also has served as a technical adviser to states on 
executions 
leuchter came under fire after writing a report claiming that 
gas chambers at some nazi death camps could not have been used to 
kill hundreds of thousands 
he appeared as a paid expert at the 1988 trial in toronto of 
ernst zundel a publisher later convicted of knowingly 
disseminating false information in booklet questioning whether 6 
million jews perished under the nazis 
the state began investigating leuchter in april after being 
contacted by holocaust survivors and friends in pursuit of justice 
based in albany ny 
the group disclosed that leuchter held only a bachelors degree 
in history from boston university 
in a telephone interview leuchter said the states engineering 
license requirements are designed to protect the public from poorly 
constructed buildings and do not apply to his work since it is done 
out of state massachusetts has no death penalty 
while admitting he has only a history degree leuchter said 
the bottom line is that anyone who goes to college has the 
necessary math and science which i do ive worked as an engineer 
for 25 years im not some johnnycomelately 
shelly shapiro the holocaust groups director said the group 
argued that leuchter is dangerous because he gives a scientific 
front to those who would deny the holocaust he provides them with 
what they think is expertise on gas chambers 
we set out to show that he is no expert on gas chambers and no 
engineer she said 
leuchter said he was not antisemitic and added some of my 
best friends are jewish 
leuchter had also come under fire for his business practices in 
july alabama assistant attorney general ed carnes alleged that 
leuchter would routinely offer his services as an adviser to states 
conducting executions if his offer was spurned leuchter would 
offer to testify on behalf of death penalty foes that the states 
execution machines would not work properly carnes said 
what he has done is make money on both sides of the fence 
said carnes 
leuchter denied carnes charges and said holocaust groups had 
pressured states to not do business with him 
the jewish groups have effectively put me out of business 
he said they are doing the same things the nazis did 
interfering with my right to free speech and to earn a living

a man in a blue tolltakers uniform 
cheerfully greeted motorists made change and wrote receipts on a 
busy expressway for several hours before coworkers realized he was 
an impostor 
he was actually pretty good said richard gilkison who 
noticed when the stranger showed up bright and early to take 
15cent tolls at the crosstown expressway friday morning 
hed collect for an hour or two then take himself a little 
break he looked real professional waving a flag and everything 
crosstown officials are accustomed to vagrants who shove paper 
or clothing into automatic bins then run out to collect the 
blocked change said toll manager peter bond this man was a bit 
more open he said 
instead of jail police took the impostor to a homeless shelter 
they did not publicly identify him 
bond said the average daily take from each booth is about 265 
much of which is collected by tolltakers during rush hour he said 
he isnt sure how much money was collected during the friday 
morning shift 
its fascinating that he went to the trouble of wearing the 
uniform said laura blaine chairwoman of the tampahillsborough 
expressway authority he could have just asked for a job

sen richard lugar rind said today we 
are very close to conflict in the persian gulf and that people 
should not misinterpret recent developments as indicating peace is 
at hand 
the fact is that were headed toward conflict lugar a 
member and former chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee said during an interview on nbcs today show 
were headed toward conflict because saddam hussein is 
reinforcing as far as we can see his forces in kuwait shows no 
sign whatsoever of giving up anything and the united nations is on 
a collision course to make sure he does give it up lugar said 
he was asked about reports that the saudi defense minister 
prince sultan had raised the possibility iraq might gain territory 
in return for ending its occupation of kuwait 
i dont think the saudis are prepared to compromise lugar 
said i think the remarks were unfortunate for two reasons first 
of all they gave an impression to world markets that peace was at 
hand secondly it has raised once again questions as to how 
fragile the coalition of all the forces trying to undergird the 
united nations resolutions may be 
prince bandar the saudi envoy in washington denied his country 
had suggested that kuwait make a deal with iraq 
i think the possibility of armed conflict depends entirely 
upon our ability and willingness to bring it about lugar said 
i would hope that it would be perfectly clear to saddam 
hussein and to the rest of the world that we are very close to 
conflict if the iraqis dont move theyre likely to be pushed out 
peace is not at hand and that people would not misinterpret or try 
to misinterpret these small signs as they see them lugar said

a gathering of balkan foreign ministers 
that opened today is one more sign that albania europes most 
backward country is gradually cracking out of its stalinist shell 
the twoday meeting is only the second such gathering since 
world war ii and the first highlevel international meeting in 
tirana in decades 
albanias government virtually sealed the tiny country for 
years but has been seeking slowly to end its isolation 
the gathering opened with calls for closer cooperation in the 
region which in the past has been a powder keg of europe 
but differences immediately emerged with greece taking a swipe 
at albania on the treatment of its greek minority 
in his opening speech albanian president ramiz alia called for 
a zone of peace and security in the balkans greece turkey 
yugoslavia albania bulgaria and romania 
the meeting underscored dramatic changes in europe since the 
first balkans meeting in belgrade in february 1988 
the fall of communism in eastern europe has brought new 
freedoms but has also made for an upsurge in nationalist feelings 
especially in the balkans where the mix of of religions and 
ethnic groups has always been volatile 
yugoslavia where ethnic divisions are so fierce that the 
country may split apart is at odds with albania over the yugoslav 
province of kosovo an ancient heartland of the serbian republic 
bordering albania 
greece and turkey are traditional enemies divided today over 
the fate of cyprus 
albania and greece disagree over albanias alleged mistreatment 
of its estimated 400000 greek minority 
bulgaria and romania are quarrelling over crossborder 
pollution 
the serbs in yugosalvia want more rights for the ethnic serbs in 
romania 
and bulgaria greece and yugoslavia disagree over who really 
should control the territory known today as the southern yugoslav 
republic of macedonia 
bulgarias foreign minister luben gotsev supported by his 
greek counterpart antonis samaras proposed forming a secretariat 
in the bulgarian capital sofia to coordinate regional 
cooperation 
gotsev samaras and romanias foreign minister adrian nastase 
all urged measures to overcome the regions ethnic religious and 
historical differences 
bulgaria and romania proposed that a balkan summit be held next 
year romania urged that a code of conduct on ethnic matters be 
considered 
samaras apparently referring to albanias treatment of its 
greek minority asked the session can we call a country free if 
any man or woman in this country is not allowed to exercise fully 
their religious rights does this not also apply to political 
and economic rights 
in the wake of eastern europes revolutions albania has 
embarked on cautious domestic reform and moved to end its isolation 
abroad 
it restored diplomatic ties with the soviet union and is seeking 
the same links with the united states 
the balkan nation of 3 million people has also declared it wants 
to join the 34nation helsinki process albania was the only 
european nation not to sign the helsinki final act in 1975 
to be admitted albania is likely to have to take human rights 
reform further than it has to date 
on tuesday as diplomats and journalists arrived in tirana for 
the balkan meeting albanias communistrun daily published the 
draft of an election law that for the first time permits secret 
ballots and multiple candidacies for each of the 250 seats in the 
communistrun parliament 
however the draft stopped short of permitting any new political 
parties and a legal expert indicated alia does not intend to 
abandon oneparty rule 
there will be pluralism of opinions aleks luarasi told 
reporters but there wont be any party pluralism

simultaneous bomb attacks at 
two security checkpoints in northern ireland today killed six 
soldiers and left a civilian missing and presumed dead police 
said the ira claimed responsibility 
five men were arrested in the irish republic in connection with 
the predawn attacks which also injured at least 27 people six 
seriously police said 
police said in both cases the bombs were driven to the 
checkpoints by civilians acting under irish republican army threat 
one of the drivers an elderly man warned the soldiers at a 
checkpoint but not in time 
the ira claimed those forced to drive the bombs to the 
checkpoints were collaborators who had done construction work 
for the security forces 
a police spokesman in dublin said the five men were arrested 
just across the border from the checkpoint near londonderry 65 
miles northwest of belfast where five of the soldiers were killed 
and the civilian was reported missing 
the other soldier was killed at a security checkpoint in newry 
a village about 40 miles south of belfast police said 
prime minister margaret thatcher was said to be deeply 
shocked by the bombings 
hospital officials said the injured included six members of the 
security forces all of them seriously hurt 
both checkpoints are on the border between northern ireland and 
the irish republic the newry station is located on the main road 
between belfast and dublin both posts have been attacked by the 
ira several times in the past 
the missing civilian at londonderry was believed to be the 
driver of the car carrying the bomb police said 
at the newry checkpoint police said a 65yearold man drove up 
in a van jumped out and shouted theres a bomb in the van 
it exploded before police soldiers and the driver had time to 
get clear the driver suffered a broken leg 
police said both bombs exploded just after 4 am 
the ira claim of responsibility came in a statement to the 
british domestic statement to the british domestic news agency 
press association in belfast it warned that attacks would continue 
until britain abandoned its futile war in ireland 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of 
ireland under socialist rule 
in dublin the republic of ireland condemned the killings 
the people who carried out these savage murders stand 
condemned by the overwhelming majority of people on this island 
said prime minister charles haughey their actions are futile and 
serve no purpose other than to bring suffering and tragedy in their 
wake 
soldiers blanketed newry and the surrounding area in a huge 
security operation following the attack army helicopters flew low 
overhead and traffic headed for dublin was diverted 
paddy collins and his wife cara were awakened by the blast 
which shattered windows and blew the doors off hinges at their home 
about 1200 feet from the checkpoint 
there was an awful bang and blue lightening outside all the 
windows came in he said adding that three of the couples four 
children were asleep in the house and were covered with shattered 
glass 
we were afraid to go out but we heard soldiers running 
outside literally screaming they were frightened for their 
lives said collins

a potentially deadly bacterial cousin of toxic 
shock syndrome is on the rise targeting both children and adults 
scientists say 
researchers at a national microbiology conference said tuesday 
the illness is a severe streptococcal infection strep is 
frequently thought of as the cause of strep throat but in rare 
cases it can cause extremely serious infections such as the 
pneumonia that killed muppets creator jim henson in may 
three years ago researchers began to talk of toxic shock caused 
by strep not the staph bacteria linked to tampon use toxic shock 
is characterized by low blood pressure rash peeling skin and 
multiorgan infections 
researchers at the centers for disease control and in pima 
county ariz studied 128 cases of groupa strep infections in 10 
hospitals in the tucson area from 1985 to 1990 none of the 54 
cases from 1985 to 1987 resembled toxic shock syndrome but six of 
the 74 infections studied from 1988 to 1990 did 
the pattern is clear dr charles hoge of the cdc reported at 
the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and 
chemotherapy streptococcal toxic shock syndrome was 
significantly more likely to occur after 1988 
one of the six patients died for all the groupa strep 
infection patients in the study the death rate was 20 percent 
toxic shock syndrome gets its name from the toxins produced by 
the bacteria at fault lab findings from the arizona study suggest 
a toxin may also be the culprit in the serious strep infections 
hoge said 
three of the arizona toxic shocklike cases occurred in 
children and other researchers also reported waves of serious

see the significance brimmer said then he hit his head and 
said oh my god i had that hand grenade in there didnt i 
it isnt unlawful to have such items the detective said but it 
is against the law to represent them as genuine explosives

windows daubed antisaddam remarks on walls and shouted 
antisaddam slogans until guards forced them back into their rooms 
at gunpoint 
he did not say where the factory was located or when the 
incident happened 
others told of being moved from site to site as part of iraqs 
human shield policy 
syd mccann 52 said after iraqi troops stopped him from

the parent of united airlines bought a prized 
gateway to europe from cashstrapped pan am corp 
pan am agreed to sell most of its routes into london to ual 
corp in a 400 million deal the airlines announced tuesday 
the agreement accentuated recent moves by both companies one 
poised to grow with new routes and planes the other determined to 
reduce its huge losses 
ual bought pan ams cherished pacific routes five years ago for 
750 million and since has become a key airline in that part of the 
world 
pan american world airways pioneered world air travel more than 
a halfcentury ago but lost hundreds of millions of dollars during 
the past decade of heightened competition brought about by airline 
deregulation 
the agreement on the london routes came after fruitless efforts 
by pan am to find a merger partner or buyer for the airline 
ual will acquire pan ams routes into london from new york 
washington san francisco los angeles and seattle 
ual will also get unused pan am international routes originating 
in san francisco washington and london as well as gates hangar 
and office space at san francisco and washingtons dulles 
international airport two boeing 747 jumbo jets and spare parts 
the agreement will give united a dulles to paris route 
pan am said it will concentrate on one major european hub 
frankfurt germany as well as strengthen schedules to other 
european cities including oslo norway zagreb yugoslavia 
hamburg and nuremberg germany and amsterdam

leftist unions staged a nationwide 
strike today paralyzing public transportation and many businesses 
the military denounced the action as a communist bid to foment 
insurrection 
suspected communist rebels burned at least 17 vehicles to force 
drivers to join the strike and police said at least two people 
were slain and four injured in strikerelated violence police said 
earlier today that two other people had died in a bus attack but 
later said that report was mistaken 
at least 43 people were arrested including medardo roda leader 
of a militant transport union police said roda may be charged with 
sedition and other offenses linked to the violence 
crispin beltran chairman of the militant may first movement 
that called the strike went into hiding following reports he would 
also be arrested 
the strike crippled public transportation in manila and several 
provincial cities department stores banks hotels factories and 
other major enterprises closed or operated with skeletal crews 
it was unclear whether most absentees supported the strike or 
simply were unable to get rides to work 
the may first movement was demanding a 150 raise in the 
minimum daily wage a 42 percent increase 
officially the minimum daily wage in manila is 350 but a 
recent government survey shows 55 percent of businesses in the 
capital pay less minimum wageearners already are too poor to buy 
meat and inflation is running at 12 percent 
president corazon aquino had urged workers not to join the 
strike saying the nations fragile economy could not afford the 
wage increase 
we are not giving in to the 38peso demand a government 
spokesman adolf azcuna said 
speaking in a radio interview from his hiding place beltran 
said the work stoppage would continue thursday if the workers 
demands were not met 
the nationwide strike the most extensive since 1987 also 
marked the first time the communists had taken such an active 
visible role in a labor protest 
the chief of staff gen renato de villa denounced the strike 
as communistdominated and said the violence was the work of 
guerrillas of the communist new peoples army 
the rebels have decided to use this strike to promote their 
insurrectionary situation de villa told reporters 
leftist leader nathaniel santiago blamed the government for 
todays unrest 
this anger of our society is a natural reaction to the 
governments turning its back on the people and a realization that 
it is futile to deal with a government that is numb to the 
suffering of its people santiago said 
the strike appeared most successful in the capital and 
surrounding areas of central luzon island a longtime communist 
stronghold 
officials said about 20 percent of the labor department 
employees did not show up for work and most government agencies 
allowed employees to leave early 
among the firms shut down was atlas consolidated mining co in 
cebu the largest copper producer in asia where 10000 workers 
walked out schools and colleges in manila and surrounding 
provinces were also closed 
authorities at the us clark air base in angeles city north of 
manila imposed travel restrictions on base personnel for security

the national park service 
director has urged the chief of mca inc to sell its food and 
lodging concession in yosemite national park before mca is acquired 
by a japanese company 
park service director james ridenour told mca chairman lew 
wasserman that many park lovers are concerned that a takeover of 
mca by matsushita electric industrial co would put the concession 
in foreign hands 
ridenour suggested in a telephone call last week that mca sell 
the concession to a nonprofit or other group or to the park 
service itself the los angeles times reported in todays editions 
if the price is right the government would be interested 
said park service spokesman george berklacy 
mca owns the yosemite park amp curry co which operates lodgings 
restaurants and stores in yosemite under a contract that expires in 
1993 
early today three of the four roads into yosemite were closed 
by rockslides after a strong earthquake 
matsushita and mca are negotiating a possible purchase of mca 
which also owns universal studios record companies a film library 
and a television station 
what is driving this is these national parks are americas 
national treasures and while foreign owners have the right to 
invest in the united states that doesnt mean they should be 
buying up all of america said steven goldstein spokesman for 
interior secretary manuel lujan who presides over the national 
park service 
people identify yosemite with mom and apple pie 
goldstein said 
wasserman did not react immediately to the proposal goldstein 
said 
officials with matsushita mca and the curry co refused to 
comment on the proposal 
estimates of curry co holdings in the park range between 100 
million and 200 million

the government was so excited by rock 
carvings found in a national forest that it started building an 
interpretive center to explain to visitors how ancient people 
carved them as messages to spirits 
but when artist jeff kerker saw a magazine story about the 
petroglyphs he sent a message of his own to the us forest 
service the carvings were his handiwork and were only 15 years 
old 
i wasnt trying to fool anyone said kerker of bandon i 
was interested in how long it might take to make them all it took 
was one afternoon 
kerker said he had photos of the carvings in the siskiyou 
national forest to prove he made them 
the forest service was waiting to see kerkers evidence before 
deciding whether his story was true but enough of a question was 
raised that work was suspended on the interpretive center being 
built at daphne grove outside powers said spokeswoman patty burel 
there is the off chance we never will be able to tell since 
there is no exact science for dating petroglyph art like this 
she said right now everything is on hold 
the carvings were discovered in 1987 on three boulders along the 
south fork of the coquille river burel said one represented a 
fish but the others werent clear 
the carvings were taken to a forest service office for 
preservation and replicas were carved for the interpretive center 
a variety of archaeologists inside and outside the forest 
service examined the carvings and decided they were genuine burel 
said 
one reason was that the carvings had been eroded and another 
was that they were below the rivers high water mark 
that was important because the petroglyphs were considered to 
have spirits said janet joyer archaeologist for the siskiyou 
national forest when the water rose then the petroglyphs would 
be under water they were thought to transmit the peoples prayers 
down to the salmon people 
the salmon people lived underwater in human form when they 
were requested by human beings they took on fish forms and 
sacrificed themselves 
kerker said he had figured the water would erode the carvings 
from the soft stone and never thought anyone would discover them 
joyer said the development carries a good lesson 
this will be important for archaeologists a reminder that we 
must be conservative with things like this that are not dateable 
she said

labor secretary elizabeth dole praised for 
easing hostilities between the union movement and republicans 
during her nearly two years in office is resigning to head the 
american red cross officials say 
mrs dole the only women to head a department in the bush 
administration will be the first member of the presidents cabinet 
to quit when she makes the announcement expected today 
on tuesday president bush appeared to confirm her departure 
first reported by administration and congressional sources asked 
at a republican fundraiser in connecticut if mrs dole had 
resigned he replied only tomorrow 
when bush met with his cabinet today at the white house the 
labor secretary was not there 
mrs dole 54 called aflcio president lane kirkland on tuesday 
afternoon and told him she was stepping down to become president of 
the red cross said ken young kirklands top aide 
lane told her he was sorry that she was leaving and he had 
enjoyed working with her and that he thought shed done a good 
job young said she worked with us she was accessible and she 
clearly told her various departments to work with us and others 
at the labor department mrs dole worked to strengthen job 
safety programs and toughen enforcement of child labor laws she 
was also praised for her efforts to settle the bitter pittston coal 
strike in 1989 
but others criticized her low profile within the 
administration and complained that she was not a part of the white 
house policymaking process 
for instance white house chief of staff john sununu not mrs 
dole took the lead on last years minimum wage negotiations with 
congress labor officials complained 
there was no explanation for her reported decision to take the 
red cross job which pays 185000 a year cabinet secretaries make 
98400 
even before the official announcement there was speculation 
about a successor among those mentioned were constance newman 
head of the office of personnel management and rep lynn martin 
rill should she lose her bid for the senate in the nov 6 
election 
mrs dole wife of senate republican leader bob dole won praise 
from union leaders who had been rendered outcasts in the reagan 
administration 
its a genuine loss to the bush administration and to working 
people across the country said janice lachance a spokeswoman 
for the american federation of government employees it will be 
very very difficult to replace her 
she was very committed to her opendoor policy toward 
organized labor lachance said 
john peterpaul vice president of the machinists union offered 
a different view i dont think shell be missed by the workers 
of america he said shes been so low profile 
he expressed bitterness about mrs doles handling of the 
eastern airlines strike that started in march 1989 when the 
administration refused to appoint a presidential emergency board to 
intervene in the crisis 
as labor secretary mrs dole offered few new initiatives some 
union leaders argued that she was limited by what they perceived as 
a probusiness administration 
still she was credited with strengthening programs that unions 
felt went neglected during the reagan era in addition to her work 
on job safety and child labor laws she proposed mandatory seat 
belt use for all jobrelated travel and reviewed ways to help women 
advance in their careers and crack what she called the glass 
ceiling that stopped their upward mobility 
mrs dole got mixed reviews regarding labor disputes she and 
bush took a handsoff approach toward the eastern strike and the 
violent greyhound bus walkout earlier this year but she was lauded 
for her appointment of a super mediator to settle a bitter 
strike by appalachian coal miners against the pittston co 
for months rumors had been rampant that mrs dole would step 
down to seek political office some observers speculated that she 
would run in 1992 for the senate seat now held by democrat terry 
sanford of her native north carolina 
in an interview less than two months ago mrs dole indicated 
she was not yet ready to change jobs i have plenty of challenges 
right where i am she said 
her departure will leave us trade representative carla hills 
who also holds cabinet rank as the topranking woman in the 
administration 
mrs doles inclusion in the cabinet was seen as an effort on 
bushs part to mend fences with her husband a bitter and 
unsuccessful bush opponent during the 1988 presidential primaries 
mrs dole got her first cabinet post in 1983 when president 
reagan appointed her transportation secretary she resigned that 
cabinet job to work in her husbands 1988 presidential campaign 
a harvardeducated lawyer mrs dole has had a washington career 
that spans more than two decades she worked in the old department 
of health education and welfare the federal trade commission and 
president nixons commission on consumer interests

pakistanis turned out in unexpectedly 
small numbers today for a bitterly contested national election 
widely considered a referendum on the dismissal of benazir bhutto 
as prime minister 
at least four people were killed and 11 injured in disputes 
involving rival parties officials said and there were scattered 
reports of voter harassment intimidation and ballotbox theft 
the monthlong campaign claimed at least a dozen lives 
tens of thousands of heavily armed soldiers paramilitary troops 
and police patrolled throughout the country during the voting 
todays general elections were only the fifth in pakistan since its 
1947 inception and never before was the military deployed in such 
large numbers during polling 
about 50 million people were eligible to vote but election 
officias said turnout was light perhaps reflecting cynicism about 
the future of democracy in pakistan 
ms bhutto claims her aug 6 dismissal amounted to a 
constitutional coup by president ghulam ishaq khan and that 
abuse of power charges filed against her are baseless slander 
after casting her own vote in her ancestral hometown at larkana 
in southern pakistan the former prime minister predicted victory 
for her party 
we have turned the tables on them said ms bhutto who was 
unopposed in her bid for reelection to parliament if we win 
they will have no choice but to let us form the next government 
analysts predicted the vote would be close between ms bhuttos 
leftleaning pakistan peoples party and three smaller allied 
parties and the islamic democratic alliance a looseknit coalition 
of 18 parties united only by their dislike for ms bhutto and 
strained by individual ambitions 
voters in ms bhuttos hometown of karachi lined up outside 
polling booths three hours before they opened the longest lines 
were in the sprawling slum district of lyari where ms bhuttos 
jailed husband asif ali zardari 38 is a candidate 
lines also formed in parts of the eastern city f lahore the 
longtime stronghold of ms bhuttos opponents 
but at polling stations elsewhere officials reported turnouts 
ranging from 10 to 40 percent during the nine hours of voting no 
overall figures on the turnout were immediately available 
the government which is controlled by ms bhuttos foes filed 
a seventh abuse of power charge against her just hours before the 
polls opened today 
but the campaign to destroy the 37yearold ms bhutto 
politically may have backfired it halted the steady decline in her 
popularity and helped galvanize the disgruntled rankandfile 
within her party 
just hours before the polls opened a candidate of ms bhuttos 
rightwing opposition was gunned down along with five companions 
news reports said earlier this week several of ms bhuttos party 
workers were killed 
police refused to link the latest killing to the elections but 
the prime minister in the army backed caretaker government ghulam 
mustafa jatoi suggested that ms bhuttos party loyalists were 
involved 
the victim was contesting a rural seat in punjab province where 
60 percent of the countrys 102 million people live and where the 
outcome is expected to be decided he and his companions were 
killed by gunmen who fired on their vehicle during an 11thhour 
tour of his constituency 
in addition to charging ms bhutto and seven former cabinet 
ministers with abuse of power the caretaker government had her 
husband arrested on oct 10 for the alleged kidnapping and 
extortion of a pakistaniborn british citizen 
more than 1300 candidates are vying for 214 of the 217 seats in 
the national assembly the policymaking lower house of parliament 
that will choose pakistans next prime minister 
two independent candidates were elected unopposed while voting 
was postponed in one constituency because one of the candidates was 
shot and killed 
ms bhuttos leftleaning pakistan peoples party and three 
smaller parties faced the islamic democratic alliance a looseknit 
coalition of 18 diverse parties united only by their dislike for 
ms bhutto 
in a nation with a literacy rate of less than 25 percent voters 
placed their thumbprint next to their partys symbol ms bhuttos 
symbol is the arrow the islamic democratic alliance uses the 
bicycle 
most analysts doubted either side would emerge with an outright 
victory resulting in another shaky coalition government as fragile 
as the last 
whoever forms the next government will be forced by the 
constitution to share power with the president and the countrys 
most powerful institution the military 
at least 55 international pollwatchers monitored todays 
balloting and their assessment could affect hundreds of millions 
of dollars in vital economic and military aid from the west 
in december 1988 ms bhutto became the first woman to lead a 
modern moslem nation her accession to power followed the first 
free elections in pakistan after more than a decade of military 
rule 
but ms bhuttos stewardship was troubled and ishaq khan called 
her government pakistans most corrupt and incompetent ever when he 
dismissed her 
if found guilty on the abuse of power charges ms bhutto could 
be denied her seat in parliament and banned from politics for seven 
years 
she has insisted her government was competent and clean and 
called the president a liar cheater and dictator she said she 
would demand his resignation if she returns to power 
ishaq khan 73 was a stalwart of gen mohammad zia ulhaq who 
overthrew ms bhuttos father the late prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto in a 1977 coup zia ruled pakistan until his death in a 
stillunexplained plane crash in august 1988

at least 18 people were killed today in 
riots and by police nationwide during a strike called by a 
rightwing hindu party that is trying to bring down prime minister 
vp singhs government 
singh said he will prove on nov 7 that he can muster a majority 
in parliament despite the defection of the bharatiya janata party 
whether he can do so is questionable india could soon face new 
elections 
the government called a special oneday session of parliament on 
nov 7 the reports of violence during todays strike came mostly 
from small cities and towns in western and southern india where 
both hindus and moslems live 
the violence and the political crisis were precipitated when lal 
krishna advani president of bharatiya janata party was arrested 
at sunrise tuesday while leading a crosscountry caravan to build a 
hindu temple on ground now occupied by a 16thcentury moslem 
mosque 
five people died tuesday night in riots in the western state of 
gujarat and police shot to death one person today in ahmedabad the 
states largest city 
another nine people were killed today in riots and clashes 
between police and hindu demonstrators in jaipur capital of 
rajasthan state that lies between gujarat and new delhi united 
news of india reported 
one man was stabbed to death and three others died in clashes 
and police firing in the southern state of karnataka press trust 
of india said without elaborating it said two people were killed 
in police firing in west bengal state 
united news of india said two people were killed in police 
firing in the southern state of andhra pradesh 
the news agency described the clashes as communal violence 
a phrase that usually means hindumoslem clashes indian news media 
routinely avoid giving specific details in such cases contending 
that religious tension would only be heightened 
clashes stonethrowing and arson also were reported in bombay 
and other major towns 
in new delhi many stores were closed and the city government 
pulled its 4000 buses off the streets police stepped up patrols 
and reported making more than 400 preventive arrests 
such arrests are common in india where the law permits people to 
be held without charge if the authorities believe public safety is 
in danger 
news reports say as many as 50000 people have been detained in 
the last two weeks in potential trouble spots 
singh who took office nearly 11 months ago told reporters he 
would try to prove he has the parliamentary majority he needs to 
remain in power 
in the past his centrist national front relied on the support 
of the bharatiya janata party to pass legislation 
the prime minister said president ramaswamy venkataraman had 
agreed to call parliament into session within a week after oct 
30 
oct 30 is the date set by hindu holy men and political leaders 
to start constructing the temple on the site now occupied by a 
mosque in ayodhya 300 miles southeast of new delhi 
the ayodhya temple campaign has triggered violence that left 
more than 80 people dead in hindumoslem clashes earlier this 
month singh sought to resolve the mosquetemple dispute in court 
but hindu fundamentalists pressed ahead with plans to start 
building the temple 
advani ignored singhs pleas to call off his temple campaign a 
few hours after he was arrested his party withdrew its support for 
singhs government 
the bharatiya janata party or indian peoples party proclaims 
itself to be a nationalist organization that cannot deny the 
hindu nature of india eightytwo percent of indias 880 
million people are hindus 
moslems who make up 12 percent of the population fear the 
destruction or relocation of the ayodhya mosque would have a 
snowball effect on hundreds of other moslem sites across the 
nation

buildings charred

there were 223 fires during the threeday period that began two 
nights before halloween investigations last year led to nine 
arrests and prosecutions fire marshal donald robinson said

vaccinating pregnant women for flu helps protect 
their babies from the disease after birth is safe and could point 
the way to other such vaccines according to baylor medical school 
researchers 
thirteen women in a baylor college of medicine study were 
immunized against flu in the last trimester of pregnancy and each 
gave birth to an infant with high levels of antibodies to the 
influenza virus dr janet englund reported tuesday in atlanta at 
the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and 
chemotherapy 
the conference is sponsored by the american society for 
microbiology 
none of the mothers or infants had complications from the 
vaccine and while flu antibodies produced by the mothers body 
were imparted to children in the womb there was no evidence that 
the vaccine itself reached the fetus englund said 
maternal immunization to protect the infant during the first 
months of life appears to be safe and feasible englund reported 
maternal immunizations were performed by some physicians in the 
1960s but fell out of favor amid concerns over complications 
baylor researchers said their study shows protection can be safely 
passed along in the womb without passing along vaccine that isnt 
necessarily appropriate in the fetus 
researchers believe flu immunity passed from a mother to child 
lasts about four months providing crucial protection in the 
earliest stages of life englund said 
this is a model for other vaccines she said adding that 
vaccines against whooping cough and haemophilus influenza b hib 
disease a leading cause of meningitis might be used similarly 
those diseases kill large numbers of infants in developing 
countries 
wed like this to be a third world shot one that could be 
used to help the mother and the baby she said 
influenza vaccine is already recommended for pregnant women at 
highrisk of severe flu complications vaccines made with live 
viruses such as measles vaccine should not be given to pregnant 
women according to federal health officials 
the researchers gave a different vaccine tetanus to other 
pregnant women in a control group their infants showed signs of 
tetanus protection

israeli troops sealed the borders of the 
occupied territories today in an effort to curb a wave of bloody 
revenge attacks by arabs and jews 
an order from defense minister moshe arens banned the nearly 17 
million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip from entering 
israel after attacks on tuesday left two arabs dead and seven 
people wounded 
in jerusalem tensions over the killings of palestinians on the 
temple mount on oct 8 increased with the death today of a 20th 
arab victim 
police sources and family members said salim ahmad khaldi 18 
was apparently shot by an israeli civilian on a street near the 
holy site during the melee most of the other victims were killed 
when police charged the shrine which is holy to both arabs and 
jews 
hospital officials said another arab also died today of beating 
wounds suffered at the hands of israelis after he stabbed two women 
soldiers on tuesday in northern israel 
a general strike was called in arab east jerusalem and uprising 
activists ordered merchants in the main arab shopping streets and 
the narrow alleys of the old city to close 
in an interview on army radio arens denied that confining 
palestinians to the territories amounted to returning to the 1967 
border before israel captured the land we have to take the 
correct steps to ensure our control over this country and the 
safety of the citizens arens said 
he said he hoped palestinians would realize that persisting in 
these violent attacks will only increase the tragedy of the 
palestinian people 
defense ministry spokesman dan naveh said the order would last 
for several days and should not seriously affect the troubled 
israeli economy 
about 110000 palestinians work in israel and israel radio said 
jerusalem employment agencies got 20 times the usual number of 
calls for construction workers cleaners and other jobs filled by 
arabs from the territories 
at the erez crossing into the gaza strip thousands of 
palestinians arrived today in private cars taxis and buses many 
carried suitcases or makeshift bundles as they were loaded into 
buses and trucks to go home 
israel radio said at least 600 israelis in tel aviv called 
police to report the whereabouts of arab laborers who had stayed 
behind despite the order 
fear of palestinian attacks has gripped many israelis and the 
daily maariv published a guide today on how to defend against a 
knifewielding attacker interior ministry officials also reported 
brisk trade at israeli gun shops 
just hours before the closure order on tuesday israeli 
civilians fired on an arabowned car near the southern negev town 
of mivtahim killing maher alshaher 30 a gaza laborer and 
wounding his three cousins one seriously 
the army said the incident was being investigated by police 
responsibility for the attack was claimed by a previously unknown 
underground group eye for an eye in phone calls to israel 
television and radio 
the laborers who were returning from work in israel said they 
saw a civilian firing an israelimade uzi submachine gun at them 
from a jeep israels news agency itim said 
earlier tuesday a palestinian knifed two unarmed women soldiers 
and another arab bludgeoned two israelis with a hammer police 
said 
the knifing occured in kiryat tivon in northern israel when 
omar shawaneh 39 of the west bank village of silat elharithiya 
shouted allahu akbar god is great then stabbed two women 
soldiers who were hitchhiking 
police said shawaneh was captured by a group of soldiers and

rwanda today announced a ceasefire with 
rebels seeking to topple its government the belgian foreign 
minister said belgium promised to support an african force to 
monitor the truce 
hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting that 
started sept 30 when rebels predominantly refugees from rwandas 
minority tutsi tribe invaded from its northern neighbor uganda 
belgiums foreign minister mark eyskens said he was told the 
ceasefire began this morning but there were reports that the 
rebels had violated it 
eyskens told a news conference in nairobi that he learned of the 
truce in a telephone call from his rwandan counterpart casimir 
bizimungu 
rwanda in agreeing to the ceasefire accepted the rebel demand 
that both sides maintain their positions while officials pursue a 
negotiated end to the conflict eyskens said 
the rebel rwandese patriotic front has said its fighters cannot 
withdraw from the country because uganda has refused to allow their 
return 
belgium rwandas former colonial ruler has been leading 
international efforts to settle the conflict peacefully 
eyskens was joined at the news conference by belgian prime 
minister wilfried martens and defense minister guy coeme 
soon after the rebel invasion belgium sent several hundred 
troops to rwanda to protect its nationals and embassy but it has 
insisted the monitoring force be made up of africans 
we think it is the responsibility of the africans and the 
organization of african unity should play a major role said 
eyskens adding belgium would provide logistical and financial 
support to the force 
he would not disclose the size of the proposed force or say how 
much money the belgium force would cost 
france also sent troops to protect its citizens and embassy in 
the tiny central african country while zaire sent up to 1000 
soldiers who have been fighting alongside the rwandan army 
the rebels have insisted the foreign troops must leave rwanda 
before they would open peace talks they also have demanded rwandan 
troops stop killing civilians and the government release thousands 
of people arrested for allegedly supporting the insurgency 
it was not immediately known if the rebels were standing by 
those conditions 
ugandas president yoweri museveni on monday announced the 
rebels had told him they were ready to accept a truce

a coalition of business and political 
leaders wants connecticut residents to stop what theyre doing for 
five minutes thursday morning to think about drug abuse 
the group called drugs dont work has organized the moment 
of consciousness to last from 1055 am to 11 am its being 
promoted with radio television and newspaper public service 
announcements across the state 
for five minutes businesses will stop schools will stop 
tv and radio programming will be interrupted the television 
ads say were asking you to do one more thing in your life to 
fight substance abuse 
donald streater a recovered heroin addict who once worked on 
the us house select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
said a pause is a good symbol of drug abuse 
it would seem to dramatize what happens when one takes drugs 
everything stops and nothing gets done he said 
the event coincides with a nationwide effort in which antidrug 
organizations are asking people to wear red ribbons this week but 
william kauffman president of drugs dont work said the 
connecticut effort is unique 
we dont know of anyone in the nation who has tried to stop a 
state or at least make it pause kauffman said 
more than 1300 schools and businesses have agreed to 
participate representing more than 400000 of the states 33 
million residents organizers said 
in bethel town officials have proclaimed the moment of 
consciousness day and plan to ring church bells and turn on the 
lights of town vehicles 
at an allstate insurance office in farmington more than 100 
workers plan an antidrug rally 
william olds executive director of the connecticut civil 
liberties union criticized the effort for not placing enough 
emphasis on treatment and on fighting abuse of legal drugs like 
alcohol and tobacco 
i think some people would argue there are better ways to 
influence the public olds said but i cant think of an 
alternative 
programming on connecticut television stations will be replaced 
by a prerecorded message from abc anchorman peter jennings during 
the moment 
the message will include tollfree numbers viewers can call to 
register their commitment to fighting substance abuse or get 
information about drug treatment

albany ore democratherald on social security 
the government is in deep money trouble and the economy is 
headed for the basement so what does the united states do it 
raises the payments it makes to 40 million people getting social 
security checks whether they need the extra cash or not 
the boost in benefits was automatic at 54 percent its the 
biggest in more than eight years the increase is determined by the 
rate of inflation the worse inflation gets the bigger the 
increase thats good for those getting checks its bad for those 
paying the bill 
social security already takes more than 15 percent of the pay of 
working americans 
many people getting social security checks are well off and 
dont need the money but of course they take it theyre entitled 
to it by law they paid into the system when they were working and 
now theyre entitled to whatever they get whether they need it or 
not 
while this is going on our government is trying to decide on 
how much more each of us gets to pay in taxes to cover the 
uncontrolled spending of the federal government 
theres something perverse about a government that wants to 
raise taxes when it already takes from the earnings of struggling 
young people so that it can give more money to everyone over 65 
even those whose hefty incomes allow them to enjoy their senior 
years without money worries at all

the rapid city sd journal on the free market 
capitalism is a great tool for human progress but germany is 
proving that the free market is too free 
german companies have been prime contributors to iraqs military 
complex including its abilities to manufacture and deliver 
chemical weapons and its progress toward building nuclear weapons 
the german government needs to step in and bring those merchants of 
death to heel 
but we cant be smug or selfrighteous about this issue the 
united states supported iraq in its long war against iran 
overlooked its use of chemical weapons and urged other arab 
nations to help finance iraq and our nation has supported 
terrorism that suits our national purposes and profited handsomely 
by weapons sales that aid our balanceoftrade deficit problem 
the lesson here is that the free market has limits governments 
need to place sensible restrictions on death merchants

the providence ri journalbulletin on education 
there is a new buzzword in the air these days eurocentric it 
is used as both a description and condemnation of the standard 
curriculum in americas public schools 
like most educational fads the complaints about eurocentrism 
contain a modicum of truth but this is all too often accompanied 
by overheated and potentially destructive rhetoric 
everyone recognizes that the schools curriculum is based on the 
premise that americas political economic and cultural 
institutions are basically european in their origin and character 
but it is a sign of our peculiar times that this feature of the 
curriculum should be considered a cause for complaint rather than 
an obvious indeed inescapable reflection of historical 
realities

long beach calif presstelegram on 2 live crew 
they are among the most unsavory heroes of the constitution 
imaginable three rappers from florida whose most consistent theme 
is the celebration of abusive sex perhaps only the nazis and 
klansmen who march before the lincoln memorial more sorely test the 
nations commitment to free speech than do the lyrics of 2 live 
crew 
that is as it should be the first amendment was designed to 
protect those at the fringes as well as those at the center 
indeed even more so free speech always is most vulnerable when it 
is exercised outside the limits of conventionality there where 
nonconformist and antisocial ideas are likely to find their most 
vociferous proponents crusaders from the center find reason to 
attack in that context a group like 2 live crew with its brutal 
street verses and artless performances seems almost to be begging 
for the abrogation of its freespeech rights 
if so 2 live crew nearly got its way after a federal judge 
held that the groups album was obscene broward county 
successfully prosecuted a record store owner for selling it 
fortunately a related prosecution of the group for performing the 
songs in an adultonly nightclub was a laughable failure 
on oct 20 another broward county jury had no difficulty 
throwing the charges out 
together the rulings demonstrate the fundamental strength and 
the troubling weaknesses of the laws approach to obscenity and 
free expression even when confronted with essentially the same 
work in essentially the same community juries can differ in 
significant ways 
but what happens when as in florida the community itself 
isnt sure then the benefit must go to the alleged offender for 
too often wouldbe censors react to artwork simply because they 
dont understand it to which it must be said of censorship as of 
other criminal acts ignorance is no excuse

opposition groups today criticized the 
appointment of a new army chief who was accused of widespread 
torture during his days as a guerrilla fighter 
the new army chief maj gen solomon hawala was a guerrilla 
fighter for the southwest africa peoples organization or swapo 
in its 23year independence battle against south african rule 
swapo won elections last year and became the first government 
when namibia became independent from south africa on march 21 
while swapo was in exile hawala was accused of supervising 
systematic torture of swapo members suspected of spying on the 
organization 
namibias new democracy has been cited by foreign observers as 
an example of reconciliation but the democratic turnhalle 
alliance the official opposition said the appointment could 
rekindle bitter wartime rivalries 
it said hawala had been condemned by almost the whole world 
for his rotten human rights record and called his appointment 
as shocking and disgusting as it is despicable 
former swapo members detained by the organization say hundreds 
of dissidents and suspected spies were arrested and remain missing 
swapo has acknowledged that abuses occurred but says all 
prisoners were released 
president sam nujomas government defended its decision to 
appoint hawala as army chief a post that has been vacant since 
independence information minister hidipo hamutenya said south 
africa also had been guilty of abuses during the war 
hawala was traveling today and could not be reached for comment 
the national society for human rights a private group said the 
appointment of hawala was a clear indication that the swapo 
leadership approved of the torture killing rape and 
disappearance of so many innnocent namibians in exile 
a spokesman for the national society for human rights phil 
yanangolo said his organization was contacting amnesty 
international and other international human rights groups to 
register its concern 
yanangolo said that with hawala as the army chief the radical 
wing of swapo will have the upper hand in government 
the namibia patriotic front another opposition group also 
denounced the appointment the npf strongly feels that it is 
inopportune for mr halawa to be appointment to a high public 
office until his name is cleared it said

troops have arrested at least 40 more 
people for taking part in a buddhist boycott of the military 
government and the army is expanding raids on prodemocracy 
political parties sources said today 
twelve members of the opposition national league for democracy 
were arrested tuesday night after authorities searched its 
headquarters and district offices in rangoon party members said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the league overwhelmingly won a national election in may but 
the 2yearold military government of the prime minister gen saw 
maung has arrested its leaders and refused to turn over power 
the arrested league members included four members of its central 
executive committee also arrested were a member of the partys 
central work committee two divisional leaders and five youth 
members of the party the sources said 
sources contacted by telephone from bangkok said soldiers have 
been raiding temples in mandalay heart of the rebellion by 
buddhist monks and that the monks nearly 7weekold rebellion 
appears to be over 
monks were protesting government suppression of prodemocracy 
groups by refusing to hold religious services for soldiers in the 
mainly buddhist country such treatment is the equivalent of 
excommunication in burma 
the state radio said troops searched six more monastries in 
mandalay today seizing raw jade heroin weaponry and literature 
from illegal groups including the communist party 
on tuesday night burmese government radio said troops searching 
the masoyein monastery in mandalay found 34 rounds of rifle 
ammunition typewriters duplicating machines and antigovernment 
pamphlets mandalay is 350 miles north of the burmese capital 
rangoon 
the broadcast said people connected with the incriminating 
materials were detained indicating monks in the monastery had 
been arrested in the confrontation between segments of burmas 
clergy and the military government 
the sources in rangoon said 40 people were arrested but it was 
not immediately known how many were monks 
twenty monks were reported arrested on monday 
meanwhile political sources said raids on the headquarters of 
opposition political parties had been expanded nationwide and that 
a couple offices have been sealed 
troops have been going into national league for democracy 
offices all over the country one source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
it was not certain if all the offices of the prodemocracy 
parties had been searched but the raids were being made 
nationwide the source said 
they soldiers are looking for anything subversive he 
said adding that they were not damaging the offices they are 
just looking for any material that can be labeled incriminating 
 
the rangoon headquarters of the national league for democracy 
and the democratic party for a new society were raided tuesday and 
party documents were taken away sources said earlier also 
speaking anonmyously some regional offices of the two parties also 
were searched 
monks began their boycott in mandalay on sept 6 following a 
protest aug 8 in which four people including two monks were 
killed according to western diplomats in rangoon 
the boycott quickly spread to other areas including rangoon 
over the weekend troops ringed several monasteries and ordered 
the monks to end their boycott a group of 29 monks yielded to the 
ultimatum but others apparently continued their defiance

to the dismay of democrats president bush has 
compiled a long list of successful vetoes and in the process has 
rewritten the civicsbook definition of how to use them 
bush has wielded his veto pen 16 times and he has never been 
overridden in a congress ruled by democrats just as importantly 
the veto and threats of a veto have helped the president wrest 
compromises from reluctant lawmakers 
bushs winning streak remained intact today as the senate 
narrowly sustained his rejection of a major civil rights bill 
supporters of the measure conceded in advance that they lacked the 
twothirds majority needed to overturn the veto but they came 
close the vote was 6634 just one vote short 
of the many vetoes of president george bush this may well be 
the unkindest and ungentlest yet united auto workers president 
owen bieber complained tuesday 
over the last three decades only gerald r ford had a higher 
veto rate and he had a quarter of his vetoes overridden 
bush is using his veto power differently than many presidents 
who employed the veto simply to kill unwanted legislation or bills 
they deemed unconstitutional 
in large measure bush uses vetoes to force compromises from 
congress it is a tactic that makes the white house a player at the 
bargaining table as bills move through the house and senate 
he has wielded the veto much less as a public relations 
weapon much more as a quiet instrument of influence in the 
congress said american enterprise institute analyst norman 
ornstein 
richard nixon often used to veto bills at press conferences 
making a statement as much as anything else ornstein said 
george bush does it in a much more understated way 
in dealing with lawmakers bush has a big problem he has the 
smallest share of his own party members in congress of any newly 
elected president in history 
with a divided government bush does not have the clout to push 
a legislative program through congress yet there is enough gop 
strength to sustain his vetoes when republicans stick together 
when you have two houses against you you have no leverage 
the odds are heavy against you said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater so youve got to use a sledgehammer going in 
that says we wont accept this 
in his day ronald reagan coyly refused to say whether he would 
veto a bill bush does it all the time while also carefully 
spelling out options to make a bill acceptable 
you try to get as much change as you can before a bill is 
passed fitzwater said so by signaling early that youre going 
to veto you tell them they need to seriously consider 
compromise 
bush established the pattern with his very first veto democrats 
wanted to raise the minimum hourly wage to 455 over three years 
bush said that was excessive and threatened a veto congress 
approved the increase anyway and bush rejected the bill when he 
was sustained lawmakers and the white house struck a compromise 
tom cronin a political scientist at stanford university said 
the president is using his vetoes quite intelligently 
he doesnt try to use the veto in a meanspirited way he just 
sees it as an instrument to try to get people back to the 
bargaining table cronin said 
bush vetoed three appropriations bill to force the deletion of 
abortion funding from otherwise acceptable measures three other 
measures including one dealing with chinese students were 
rejected to prevent what he viewed as an erosion of presidential 
authority 
most recently bush vetoed a shortterm spending resolution and 
shut down the government to force progress on deficitreduction 
negotiations mondays veto of the civil rights legislation came 
only after months of negotiations between the white house and 
congress 
the president coupled his veto with a copy of a civil rights 
bill he would sign but civil rights advocates denounced it as a 
sham 
democrats routinely decry bushs vetoes but they havent been 
able to stop him 
early in the administration there was an understanding among 
bush senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority 
leader robert michel rill fitzwater said 
they agreed that the only way they would have any clout in the 
congress is if when it was called for they could hang together 
the spokesman said 
basically on most of these vetoes weve been able to hold 
together it gets more dicey when you cant hold all your 
republicans youve got to try to pick up some democrats

pushing aside complaints about its cost the 
house on wednesday approved and sent president bush a 287 million 
bill aimed at encouraging volunteerism and community service 
the compromise national and community service act passed the 
house on a 235186 vote the senate approved the agreement last 
week after it emerged from a house and senate conference 
rep gus hawkins dcalif the retiring chairman of the house 
education and labor committee said he had been assured bush would 
sign the bill 
but it was condemned by republicans who said it amounted to 
unwarranted spending at a time when congress is struggling with a 
tax bill and existing programs for children and the poor lack 
mone 
has the congress of the united states gone bonkers said 
rep steve gunderson rwis 
people wonder why the american public is upset with the 
congress of the united states ill tell you why theyre upset 
because they dont understand this kind of drunkenness with new 
bureaucracy and new spending he said 
rep mel levine dcalif said the bill would encouraging a new 
spirit of service among young people 
this bill at least for now signals a change from the me 
generation of the 1980s to a community service ethic i hope will 
pervade america in the 1990s he said 
the bill authorizes spending 62 million in the current fiscal 
year 105 million in fiscal 1992 and 120 million in fiscal 1993 
for national and community service programs 
a part of the measure is a 5 million authorization to begin a 
thousand points of light foundation to encourage volunteerism 
taking its name from bushs phrase for volunteers 
among the key elements 
a new parttime program encouraging community service by young 
people established through schools and community organizations 
such as the ymca or the united way it would encourage adults to 
volunteer in schools and communitybased service programs 
money would go in grants to state education agencies which 
would distribute it to schools and service groups 
an expansion of youth corps programs to increase fulltime 
service opportunities young people would be put in teams to work 
on projects cleaning the environment helping the hungry and 
homeless and aiding the poor some 60 conservation or youth corps 
programs now are operating locally 
a program to encourage colleges to make community service 
programs available to their students 
a greatly reduced version of a civilian national service corps 
proposed two years ago by sens sam nunn dga and chuck robb 
dva it establishes a test program providing 1000 for 
highereducation assistance or a home down payment in exchange for 
a year of parttime civilian service

a judge has ordered participants in the trial 
of seven sheriffs deputies accused of skimming drug cash not to 
talk to the news media after one lawyer brought up what prosecutors 
called an irrelevant issue 
us district judge edward rafeedie issued the gag order 
tuesday telling lawyers and defendants not talk to reporters about 
anything with a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing 
this proceeding 
the deputies are charged with conspiracy theft racketeering 
and tax fraud for allegedly stealing more than 14 million in 
confiscated drug money over a twoyear period they are all on 
suspension 
defense attorney harland braun who represents deputy daniel 
garner had told reporters his client would testify the cia used 
stolen drug money to covertly fund nicaraguan rebels in the 1980s 
he would not elaborate on how that related to the case 
braun made the same claim tuesday in filing a motion opposing 
the gag order rafeedie accused him of seeking to get inflammatory 
material on the public record 
prosecutors asked the judge to omit cia evidence about drug 
money saying it was irrelevant rafeedie did not immediately rule 
on the request but said he agreed in principle 
the governments chief witness testified tuesday that deputies 
were warned their homes would be searched by federal agents 
investigating the skimming allegations 
former sheriffs sgt robert sobel said he learned about the 
searches in 1989 and warned the deputies who were members of his 
narcotics unit 
i told everyone on the crew sobel said i told them i had 
just gotten information that someone was being worked and that 
they should be careful 
sobel also testified that members of the southwest task force a 
multiagency narcotics unit severely beat a drug suspect in 1987 
sobel who entered a plea bargain with prosecutors said he was 
allowed to retire from the force as a 20year veteran with a 1500 
monthly pension 
h pleaded guilty in march to conspiracy and tax evasion charges 
and faces a possible eight years in prison

china has pulled its economy out of a serious 
slump by pumping more funds into moneylosing state factories and 
building up inventories according to official statistics released 
wednesday 
industrial output grew 5 percent in the third quarter of the 
year from 1989s third quarter including a 75 percent jump in 
september a spokesman for the state statistical bureau zhang 
zhongji told a news conference 
chinese industry went into a slump last year after two years of 
reduced state credit and purchases millions of small factories 
shut down and even some large state factories furloughed portions 
of their work forces 
worried about possible social unrest the govenrment this year 
loosened limits on bank loans and resumed some construction 
projects 
zhang said the government spent 84 billion in subsidies to 
moneylosing factories and 42 billion in price subsidies to 
control inflation during the first nine months of the year 
inflation remains at about 2 percent and liberal economists 
have argued that the economy is healthy enough to resume the 
process of replacing central planning with market forces 
however top leaders in the ruling communist party remain in 
debate over the issue they have been unable to reach agreement on 
a key document setting forth the next five years economic program 
the government subsidies helped restart production but much of 
the new output simply went into warehouses zhang said state 
factories piled up inventories worth 253 billion by the end of 
september 50 percent larger than their inventories one year 
earlier 
overall profits at state factories fell 579 percent and 
profits at stateowned stores fell 737 percent zhang said 
onethird of all state factories actually lost money for total 
losses of 42 billion during the first nine months of the year 
zhang blamed sluggish consumer demand for the state sectors 
poor showing however earlier official reports have noted the tiny 
private sector and collectively owned factories in rural areas have 
consistently outperformed the state sector regardless of market 
conditions 
about 56 percent of the work force is officially classed as 
unemployed but western economists say the figure could be much 
higher 
despite these problems zhang said the economy is developing 
toward a more favorable direction he predicted increases in 
production and construction from october through december

supreme court justice david h souter 
apparently is getting along well with his new colleague thurgood 
marshall despite marshalls biting comment about souters 
appointment last july 
justice antonin scalia speaking to students at george 
washington law school tuesday said souter and marshall have 
established a good rapport 
they have met and theyre getting along theres no reason 
they shouldnt theyre both very likeable people scalia said 
when souter a previously obscure new hampshire judge was 
picked by president bush for the high court in july marshall 
hardly was enthused 
in a televised interview marshall said he had never heard of 
souter and said of bush i just dont understand what he is 
doing this last appointment is the epitome of what hes doing i 
think somebodys calling his shots 
scalia responding to a question after delivering his lecture 
said he also had not heard of souter prior to the nomination and 
thats not surprising 
if i had heard of him it would be extraordinary scalia 
said why would one expect federal judges to have heard of state 
supreme court justices if they are good judges there is no reason 
why they are not deserving of consideration for the supreme court 
souter who replaced retired justice william j brennan shook 
hands with marshall at the new justices swearingin ceremony on 
oct 9 they had met for the first time only moments before 
while describing himself as a moderate conservative souter has 
expressed a high regard for brennan and marshall both leading 
liberals 
according to souters close friend new hampshire lawyer tom 
rath souter has called marshall one of the giants of the 
century 
rath told reporters that souter believes thurgood marshall as 
a man as a person has made a tremendous contribution to this 
country

freed from a mudandrock prison humphrey 
the wandering humpback whale headed toward the sea thanks in part 
to the same song that lured him to open water during his famous 
visit five years ago 
as thousands of onlookers cheered the 40foot 45ton whale 
floated away tuesday from the shallows where he became beached a 
day earlier 
rescuers banged pipes to keep humphrey away from shore and 
played tape recordings of whale sounds the tapes amplified with 
special underwater equipment were of humpbacks feeding 
a coast guard vessel and a boat with volunteers from the 
california marine mammal center followed the leviathan as he made 
his way toward the sea they quit trailing him at dark 
two coast guard boats carrying volunteers from the center 
resumed looking for humphrey this morning but no one spotted him 
if hes not sighted i think it would be safe to say he went 
out to sea said petty officer bryan bender 
humphrey last was seen near the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge about five miles from where he had been beached and five 
more miles to the golden gate bridge 
at least hes headed in the right direction said center 
spokeswoman denize springer 
rescuers also played whale sounds to lure humphrey back to the 
pacific in the fall of 1985 after his celebrated 25day voyage 
through san francisco bay and other inland waters 
since then humphrey has been spotted in the ocean near san 
francisco every august or september biologists identify him 
through tail markings that show a unique pattern like a 
fingerprint 
on tuesday he drew a crowd of thousands to a cove near 
candlestick park where he lay beached beside rocks bearing a 
notrespassing sign 
marine biologists veterinarians and coast guardsmen nudged 
humphrey with their hands splashed him with buckets of water 
towed him with a harness and used an air compressor to suck mud 
from below him 
essentially we were trying to tease him off that mud rock 
said frank griffith of the marine mammal center 
theres no amount of human beings that you could put out there 
to push him off like youd push a car down the street if hes 
stuck on the bottom by mud suction you couldnt move him unless he 
puts some effort into moving himself 
as afternoon high tide rolled in humphrey budged a bit from the 
mud flipping his fins raising his tail and blowing water through 
his spout as the crowd cheered 
a short while later humphrey got stuck again but with more 
work he freed himself 
nearly 200 children from nearby bret harte elementary school 
watched humphreys return 
the children are very worried they wonder how he can survive 
they said we should all get together and push him said swaraj 
gujral a fifthgrade teacher i think he likes it here he went 
away but he left his heart in san francisco

a study has found no extra leukemia deaths among 
young people living near nuclear plants in france in contrast to 
reports from britain 
scientists studied cancer deaths between 1968 and 1987 among 
people younger than age 25 who lived near six nuclear power or 
reprocessing plants 
the researchers focused on populations living at distances of 
less than 31 miles 31 to 62 miles 62 miles to 81 miles and 
81 miles to 99 miles 
researchers found more deaths from hodgkins disease than 
expected but said the difference was not statistically 
significant 
the work is reported in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by researchers at the gustave roussy institute in villejuif 
france 
previous reports found more leukemia deaths than expected in 
people younger than 25 who lived near the sellafield nuclear 
reprocessing plant in england and the dounreay nuclear complex in 
scotland 
those results may be due to higher discharges of radioactive 
material than in france or other factors such as infections the 
french researchers speculated 
in september national cancer institute researchers said they 
found no extra cancer risk in or near counties with nuclear 
installations in the united states the study did not assess risk 
in more limited areas around the plants

older women can now get pregnant after menopause 
with the help of a method of testtube fertilization that bypasses 
one of the seemingly absolute barriers of biology 
with this technique doctors remove eggs from a healthy donor 
fertilize them in a lab dish with sperm and then implant them in 
the infertile womans womb 
its developers say the new method should allow healthy women to 
routinely get pregnant and give birth after the change of life 
even when they are in their 40s 50s and perhaps 60s 
the menopausal woman can have a family using this 
technology said dr mark v sauer of the university of southern 
california who was among the first to offer the method 
of course because the mother does not provide the egg she is 
not the genetic parent of her baby nonetheless after she receives 
the fertilized egg she undergoes a normal pregnancy and delivery 
sauers clinic charges 8000 for each fertilization in 
addition couples must pay 1500 to the egg donor 
this novel approach represents a way to circumvent the shutdown 
of the ovaries usually around age 50 that ordinarily represents 
the end of a womans reproductive life but not any longer 
the limits on the childbearing years are now anyones guess 
wrote dr marcia angell executive editor of the new england 
journal of medicine 
perhaps they will have more to do with the stamina required 
for labor and 2 am feedings than with reproductive function 
sauer reported his findings in thursdays issue of the journal 
it was the second report in two days offering the hope of pregnancy 
for infertile women 
in wednesdays journal of the american medical association 
doctors reported that a new device that opens blocked fallopian 
tubes with a tiny balloon can offer a simpler and cheaper method 
for helping some infertile women become pregnant than previously 
available 
the implantation technique reported by sauer has gone into 
widespread use among menopausal clients of fertility clinics across 
the united states during the past two years 
among the first treated was a 42yearold patient of sauer from 
el monte calif the woman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
lost the use of her ovaries after she underwent chemotherapy for 
cancer four years ago 
her testtube baby a girl was born eight months ago 
i didnt think i would ever be pregnant when my ovaries quit 
working she said i was so happy the baby seems like a 
miracle to me 
last week she received the fertilized egg of what she hopes 
will be her second child 
sauer said that up to 10 percent of women go through menopause 
naturally by age 40 in his report he described attempts to 
achieve pregnancy in seven women in their early 40s 
after giving the women hormone treatments to prepare their wombs 
for pregnancy doctors fertilized eggs from three donors and 
implanted them six pregnancies were established one ended in 
miscarriage and one was stillborn five normal babies were born 
including a pair of twins 
sauer said the success rate appears to be about three times as 
high as in ordinary in vitro fertilizations a technique that has 
become widely used during the past decade to help infertile 
couples typically eggs are removed from a womans ovaries 
fertilized outside her body and then put into her womb 
sauer said he believes the donated eggs work better because they 
come from young women at the peak of their fertility and because 
the recipients have not been hormonally stimulated to produce their 
own eggs 
it is possible that women approaching menopause could preserve 
their own eggs for implantation but freezing human eggs is still 
experimental and its unclear if it would work doctors said 
dr howard jones of eastern virginia medical school who 
performed the nations first successful in vitro fertilization 
said he has achieved pregnancies in 16 postmenopausal women over 
age 40 using the same techniques 
the key thing here is the donor eggs jones said the eggs 
are not as old as the mother the pregnancies behave according to 
the eggs rather than the mother 
sauer said the major limit to the technique is the health of the 
mother not her age women in their 50s who are free of heart 
disease diabetes and other ailments may still be good candidates 
for pregnancy and having children after 60 is possible though 
unlikely 
the technique reported in the journal of the american medical 
association is designed for a particular type of blockage present 
among only 10 percent of the estimated 1 million american women who 
have blocked fallopian tubes the procedure which requires neither 
surgery nor general anesthesia is similar to the use of balloons 
to open heart patients clogged arteries

a couple of police officers exasperated by 
drug dealing in their patrol area came up an idea they said closed 
some drug operations at least during the lunch hour 
officers mike sharp and brian blosmo started the lunch bunch 
last summer in neighborhoods where residents complained of drug 
dealing 
the uniformed officers pulled out lawn chairs and had picnic 
lunches on front lawns 
our first intent was for the drug dealers to see us sharp 
said 
sharp blosmo and other officers honored tuesday by the city 
council for the idea said suspected drug dealers did see them and 
closed up shop 
they shut the doors and closed the windows sharp said 
the officers said the lunches also provided a chance for 
neighborhood residents to interact with police 
it gave people an opportunity to come out and talk to us and 
find out that were not all that bad sharp said

the government offered a model 
for a new political system wednesday proposing a twochamber 
parliament that would allow some black rule but preserve 
substantial power for whites 
the report by the presidents council a body controlled by the 
governing national party could serve as the basis for the 
whiteled governments bargaining position in planned negotiations 
on a new constitution 
president fw de klerk has called for negotiations with black 
and white opposition groups on a new constitution that would end 
apartheid and give the black majority national voting rights 
he also has spoken of a system of checks and balances in 
which all citizens have equal voting rights but the different 
branches of government hold power over each other to prevent 
domination by individuals or groups 
under the model presented wednesday the two chambers of 
parliament would have equal power and major legislation would 
require approval from both 
one chamberwould be elected by voters throughout the country 
with all citizens having an equal vote 
at present most observers believe the african national congress 
would get the most votes under such a system 
the second chamber would be set up on an ethnic or regional 
basis the report said whites and other minorities would be 
assured a certain number of seats and would be able to exercise 
veto power on any major policy issue 
there was no immediate reaction from the anc or other 
antiapartheid organizations however they are certain to oppose a 
second chamber based on race most antiapartheid groups demand a 
simple oneman onevote system with no special concessions to any 
minority group 
the presidents councils report also recommended a bill of 
rights and the establishment of a national conflict management 
system to resolve disputes 
the council is a presidential advisory commission 
since may the government and the anc the largest black 
opposition group have been meeting to try to clear the way for 
fullscale constitutional negotiations 
de klerk has promised to dismantle the apartheid system of 
segregation and white dominance but he says a straight oneman 
onevote system would merely replace white domination with black 
domination 
during a visit to the netherlands de klerk said tuesday he 
would be willing to serve in a government headed by anc leader 
nelson mandela 
ill serve under any president elected under the new 
constitution de klerk said 
however he said any coalition between his national party and 
the anc was unlikely 
de klerk has until 1994 to draw up a new constitution or face 
another election under the current constitution which bars the 30 
million blacks from voting 
under apartheid the 5 million whites dominate politics and the 
economy the main institutions still segregated are neighborhoods 
public schools and the politics many other facilities have been 
integrated in recent years 
wednesdays report said partitioning south africa into separate 
black and white countries was a last resort only to be 
contemplated when all other options have failed 
the report acknowledged problems with the governments 
decadesold plans to establish 10 independent black homelands 
it said only one of the 10 was economically viable and none of 
the four that accepted nominal independence had established 
legitimacy 
the homelands which comprise 13 percent of south african 
territory were designed to give blacks political rights in tribal 
territory but prevent their participation in national south african 
politics four have been declared independent but only south 
africa recognizes their sovereignty

democratic congressional leaders said today 
they had dropped their demand for a surtax on the wealthy 
apparently clearing the way to a deficitreduction plan acceptable 
to president bush and most members of congress 
were going to get an agreement this week said house 
speaker thomas foley dwash today i hope this week im 
sure 
the deficitreduction plan coming into focus would according to 
one democratic leader 
raise the top incometax rate on the wealthiest americans from 
the current 28 percent to 31 percent 
phase out the personal exemption now 2050 per person for 
the welltodo while reducing the deductions they can claim by 3 
percent 
the income levels at which the exemption and deduction changes 
would apply had not been finalized but it appeared likely that 
deductions would be reduced for people earning more than 300000 
yearly 
the emerging deal also appeared to avert a possible partial 
shutdown of government services at midnight 
with the democrats shift congress seemed likely to approve by 
saturday a fiveyear measure raising taxes on gasoline by about 5 
cents a gallon while boosting levies on cigarettes alcohol and 
airline tickets 
projected increases in medicare spending would be reduced by 
somewhat more than 40 billion and other cuts would be made in a 
broad range of benefit programs including those affecting veterans 
and farmers 
of the dropped demand for a surtax on the wealthy foley said 
it appears this is not something the administration will 
support 
asked if the new proposalwas likely to contain the higher top 
tax rate the exemption phaseout and the deduction limitations 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said that may be 
the outcome 
just tuesday about half of the houses democrats indicated at a 
closed meeting that they preferred a plan placing a 75 percent 
surtax on people earning 1 million or more a year 
but on wednesday democrats said that with election day less 
than two weeks off they decided it was time for a budget agreement 
to be struck and for congress to adjourn 
members have a feeling its time to bring this congress to a 
close said one top democrat weve debated the issues for a 
long time the time has come for a decision 
put another way rep tom downey rny said its one thing 
to tax the peoples pocketbooks and its another thing to tax their 
patience 
oddly signs that democrats were ready to drop the surtax began 
surfacing even as some house republicans were indicating a possible 
softening of their own opposition its a possible house gop 
leader robert michel of illinois said of the surtax after a party 
caucus 
michel and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas went to 
the white house tuesday night for what gop sources said was an 
attempt to sell bush on the surtax today however dole spokesman 
walter riker said the visit had been held to discuss whether they 
should pull the plug on the whole process whether to break off 
negotiations 
in senator doles view the surtax is a dead issue riker 
said he said dole believes that the longer negotiations continue 
the greater likelihood there is of a package that relies more on 
tax increases and less on spending restraint 
the dispute over precisely how to put new taxes on the rich 
became the most difficult issue in the effort by lawmakers and the 
white house to pare 250 billion from the budget deficit over five 
years 
added to a package of cuts in military spending and interest 
expenses the deficit would fall by a total of 500 billion over 
that period 
instead of a surtax republicans proposed the limitation on 
deductions until this week that alternative had been supported by 
only about half the houses majority democrats 
proceeds from higher taxes on the wealthy would be used to 
moderate proposed increases in the gasoline tax likely about five 
cents rather than the nine cents passed by the senate and in 
patients medicare expenses 
lawmakers were under pressure from two deadlines with the nov 
6 elections less than two weeks away leaders want to adjourn for 
the year by the weekend and the governments authority to spend 
money for nonessential services expires at midnight 
bush has signed four stopgap spending extensions since the 
budget year began oct 1 he said tuesday he had not decided 
whether he would go along with a fifth in the absence of a 
deficitcutting agreement congress has yet to enact any of the 13 
annual appropriation bills for the new year 
bush campaigning for republicans in new england declared 
himself so frustrated by congress inability to do anything i 
dont know what im going to do he urged republicans to get 
behind a compromise agreement 
democrats were doing the same 
although bush has abandoned his campaign pledge not to raise 
taxes many gop allies in the house are sticking to theirs they 
want no part of any tax increase thus democrats were left with 
the choice of pushing through a deficitreduction package of tax 
increases and spending restraints whose basic outlines have been 
endorsed by bush or drafting their own plan and hoping for 
reluctant support from senators and the presiden 
tuesdays negotiations indicated democrats had abandoned hopes 
of winning support for a republicanbacked plan and are ready to 
move with their own 
any package likely to emerge from continuing negotiations will 
include tax increases on tobacco alcoholic beverages plane 
tickets and expensive cars furs and boats higherincome wage 
earners would have to pay more for medicare coverage retirees 
would have to pick up a bigger share of the cost of insurance 
covering doctors bills 
democrats had said a surtax was the preferable way to tax the 
wealthy because it is easily understood and would be clearly viewed 
as taking back a portion of national wealth that flowed to the 
richest americans during the last decade republicans insisted a 
surtax would be an invitation to special interests to begin 
petitioning congress for special exclusions and that within a few 
years the only recourse would be to pay for those exclusions by 
raising all tax rates

atlantis today passed a fueling test 
that found the space shuttle to be free of dangerous hydrogen 
leaks clearing the way for a november liftoff 
we have a very tight vehicle at the pad said nasa spokesman 
bruce buckingham there are no indications of any excess leakage 
of liquid hydrogen 
a small amount of hydrogen escaped into atlantis engine 
compartment but was well within allowable limits buckingham said 
no leakage was evident in fuel lines between the orbiter and 
external tank the site of previous problems 
we feel the leaks have been fixed buckingham said the 
engineers are very happy 
nasa began pumping liquid hydrogen into atlants new external 
tank early this afternoon six hours later than planned engineers 
needed extra time to evaluate a broken fuel line sensor and a small 
dent in another line which they decided would not affect the 
hourlong test 
atlantis like columbia has been grounded by hydrogen leaks all 
summer nasa plans to send atlantis on a classified pentagon 
mission around nov 9 or 10 a launch date will be set following a 
flight readiness review that begins monday 
columbia its astronomy flight postponed four times will 
undergo a fueling test monday 
nasa is counting on a successful outcome to maintain the 
momentum from discoverys smooth flight earlier this month and 
reduce mistakes by workers 
several mishaps occurred during the 5month gap between shuttle 
missions that ended with discoverys liftoff oct 6 with a 
sunexploring satellite 
for example technicians left a beam to bang around atlantis 
engine compartment when the shuttle was hoisted to an upright 
position on oct 3 two days later another beam crashed to the 
floor while being moved by a forklift 
i hate to say it but i think some of it has to do with the 
fact were not flying and were not paying as close attention as we 
should be said conrad nagel an official in charge of atlantis 
prelaunch operations 
when you have delays and problems and people are not in their 
normal routine of processing i think it has an effect 
nasa officials said they will try to launch columbia by the end 
of the year if mondays fueling test goes well or if any remaining 
leaks can be corrected quickly the shuttle was to have lifted off 
in may with an observatory 
i dont think anybody around here feels were on track until 
columbia flies after atlantis said keith hudkins chief of the 
shuttle orbiter program 
since atlantis leaks were detected in june nasa has replaced 
the external tank fuel lines and valve seals 
five days after the repairs were completed a 9foot aluminum 
beam left inside atlantis engine compartment crashed into about 25 
spots as the orbiter was being raised a small section of 
liquidoxygen plumbing had to be replaced 
to make sure no damage remained from the beam nasa pumped 
liquid oxygen into atlantis as part of todays test nasa officials 
said no traces of oxygen were found in the engine compartment 
in the oct 5 accident workers failed to secure a 60 to 
70foot beam that is part of a sling used to raise the orbiter and 
the beam fell about 8 inches inside the assembly building no 
injuries or damage were reported 
jb kump spokesman for lockheed space operations co nasas 
prime contractor for shuttle processing said disciplinary action 
is being taken against workers in both cases 
forrest mccartney director of kennedy space center said he met 
with workers last week and urged them to be a little bit more 
aware of what were doing 
columbias hydrogen leak which is much more extensive than that 
of atlantis is at least partly due to worker error two seals were 
crushed when they were installed improperly after the shuttles 
last flight in january

also were closed by rockslides 
no injuries were reported from the quake which was felt tuesday 
night from san francisco to nevada and shook up casinos and hotels 
in south lake tahoe and reno it registered a preliminary 58 on 
the richter scale according to the united states geological 
survey 
sixfoothigh boulders forced the closure of highway 120 on the 
west side of the park a threefoot section of the highway was gone 
and a retaining wall was lost 
its not a big pile of small rocks its a small pile of big 
rocks us park service ranger kelly mcclaskey said 
a rockslide half a mile away closed highway 140 into the park 
but that was expected to be cleaned up today ranger scot bowen 
said state highway crews also were clearing away a slide on 
highway 120 on the east side of the park a road from the south was 
unaffected 
the quakes center was in lee vining a town of 400 people 
northeast of yosemite national park in the sierra nevada and about 
190 miles southeast of san francisco said pat jorgenson 
spokeswoman for the us geological survey 
it was a rolling strong jolt and lasted about 25 seconds 
said robin bergmann a resident of manteca about 120 miles from 
lee vining 
we had lots of calls but no reports of injury said mono 
county sheriffs deputy suzanne sturdivant who said the quake 
lasted about 45 seconds 
elaine west a telephone operator at caesars in south lake

reported feeling dizzy but didnt immediately realize a quake had 
struck 
south lake tahoe is about 80 miles northwest of lee vining reno 
is about 40 miles north of south lake tahoe 
the richter scale is a measure of the magnitude of a quake 
according to ground motion every increase of one whole number 
represents a tenfold increase of magnitude a quake of 7 is capable 
of widespread heavy damage

factory orders for bigticket durable 
goods fell 17 percent in september the government said wednesday 
analysts said the report foretells a further production and 
employment slump in the industrial sector which already has lost 
500000 jobs since january of 1989 
it was another report indicating the economy is slowing down 
probably that were in a recession but probably indicating 
the recession will be mild said elliott platt director of 
economic research at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette a new york 
securities dealer 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last more than three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1249 billion last month 
transportation orders slid 68 percent to 328 billion with 
declines in motor vehicles more than offsetting an increase in 
aircraft 
the main message is that dealers are not ordering 1991 model 
cars said economist cynthia latta of drimcgrawhill in 
lexington mass 
durable goods orders have fallen three times in the last four 
months and commerce said the august decline was even steeper than 
previously reported down 08 percent rather than 05 percent for 
the year so far it said orders were off 05 percent compared to 
the first nine months of 1989 
durable goods orders are a key barometer of manufacturing 
industry plans for production a decrease in orders can result in 
production cutbacks and layoffs 
in fact the labor department reported earlier that 66000 
factory jobs were lost in september since reaching a 
postrecession peak in january 1989 the manufacturing sector has 
lost 500000 jobs 
the industrial sector is just muddling along said ms 
latta i expect industrial output to decline in the fourth 
quarter because of a lack of orders 
but samuel d kahan chief financial economist with fuji 
securities inc in chicago said that while the report reflects 
continued softness in the manufacturing sector it contains no 
confirming evidence that things will get worse 
he noted that excluding the transportation category orders 
inched up 03 percent 
orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods jumped 
63 percent to 382 billion but faled to regain a 99 percent 
loss in august while these orders often are a barometer of 
business plans to expand and modernize platt suggested that much 
of them may have come from overseas 
the strength in exports probably will be one of the factors 
that will keep a recession relatively mild he said 
orders for nonelectrical machinery rebounded 54 percent to 
225 billion from a 51 percent drop in august office and 
computing equipment had the largest gain 
but orders for electrical machinery fell 77 percent to 191 
billion after advancing 22 percent the previous month both 
communication equipment and electronic components were down 
sharply 
primary metal orders also declined down 08 percent to 114 
billion they had fallen 25 percent in august 
the oftenvolatile defense orders were off 96 percent to 76 
billion following a 125 percent increase the previous month 
excluding defense orders dropped 11 percent 
shipments of durable goods were down 30 percent to 1247 
billion losing a 28 percent advance in august unfilled orders 
were unchanged at 4995 billion following a 03 percent loss the 
previous month

tractors stood dusty and idle at a jerusalem 
construction site wednesday and a nervous jewish shopkeeper kept a 
steak knife near his cash register 
the scenes revealed an israel suddenly fearful of the arabs in 
its midst after a wave of attacks on jews the violence prompted 
the government to adopt the unusual tactic of sealing off the 
occupied territories 
roadblocks kept palestinians from the west bank and gaza strip 
out of israel while police swept out those left behind tel aviv 
police said they fielded more than 1700 calls from israelis 
reporting on the presence of arabs who should have stayed at home 
the closure ordered by defense minister moshe arens after a 
wave of arabjewish clashes virtually removed the backbone of 
israels bluecollar work force and disrupted many industries 
most israelis still shaken by the violence were not sure the 
ban would work 
people are afraid said charlie maman a grocer in pisgat 
zeev a jewish neighborhood wedged between two arab districts of 
jerusalem 
he showed a visitor the steak knife he put next to his cash 
register this is only to injure not to kill he added 
arab knife and hammer attacks have killed three israelis and 
injured eight more in the past four days 
on tuesday an arab was killed by gunshots in an apparent 
vengeance attack and another who stabbed and injured two unarmed 
women soldiers was beaten by civilians who caught him he died in 
the hospital wednesday 
the atmosphere of communal violence elicited a despairing 
reaction from zohar shemesh a jerusalem clothing store owner 
what are we going to do close them off will that work the 
solution is to get out of here to go abroad 
police minister roni milo said he hoped the closure of the 
territories would vacate some of israels more than 100000 
arabheld jobs for soviet immigrants 
lets not be ashamed that we want jewish labor in the state of 
israel he told parliament 
many construction sites stripped of their arab work forces 
were almost idle ironically they included housing projects being 
built for soviet immigrants who are pouring in at a rate of 20000 
a month 
aharon sapir deputy president of the construction union said 
the situation was grave 
we need a quick solution because the need for housing is 
urgent both for the immigrants and the population and we dont 
have the workers who can build sapir said in an interview 
professor moshe asimyonov of tel aviv university said that 
banishing the arabs would create an unsettling atmosphere and 
damage industry agriculture and construction but not irrevocably 
israel says the ban is for a few days until passions cool but 
if it becomes permanent asimyonov said the jobless arabs will 
oil the wheels of the intefadeh the 34monthold palestinian 
uprising 
many arabs complained that they were being penalized for the 
violence of others 
this is sheer starvation said shaher saad head of the 
workers union federation in the west bank 
after israel captured the west bank and gaza strip in 1967 it 
opened its borders and arabs became an inexpensive work force of 
street sweepers garbage collectors waiters cooks and 
construction workers 
but idealists anguished over the damage being done to their 
vision of a jewish state built and run by jewish labor now the 
idealists see their chance to reverse the trend 
baruch yonin an immigrant from leningrad said low salaries 
deter even immigrants desperate for work 
there is an absurd surrealistic situation here where arabs 
build houses for jews in the territories said yonin who came 
here seven months ago and works as a plumber on a construction site 
in israel 
jews need to build for jews he said but everyone has to 
hope to find something a permanent job with a good salary this 
job pays very little 
takehome pay on the site is about 650 a month well under the 
national average wage of 1000 
still since the closure of the territories jerusalems state 
employment office has been flooded with calls from employers 
looking for maintenance garage restaurant agriculture and 
supermarket workers

at least 29 people were killed wednesday 
in clashes between hindus and moslems and prime minister vp 
singh said he will seek a vote of confidence to see if his 
government can survive 
the deaths came during a nationwide strike called by the 
rightwing hindu party whose defection has jeopardized the future 
of the singh government 
singh said his minority centrist government would survive 
despite the loss of support from the bharatiya janata party but 
other members of the prime ministers janata dal party were less 
optimistic 
only a miracle can save this government said chandra 
shekhar a veteran politician and frequent antagonist of singh 
within the fractured janata dal 
singh called parliament to reconvene 10 days ahead of schedule 
on nov 7 and predicted he would muster the majority needed to 
keep him in power 
reports of violence during wednesdays strike came from 
throughout the country clashes in jaipur the capital of the 
western state of rajasthan accounted for 18 deaths united news of 
india said 
news reports suggested the violence was sparked by clashes 
between bharatiya janata party activists and moslem residents 
the general strike was called to protest the arrest of party 
president lal krishna advani on tuesday while he was leading a 
fundamentalist campaign to replace a 16thcentury mosque with a 
hindu temple 
the bharatiya janata or indian peoples party withdrew its 
support for singhs government ostensibly to protest the arrest 
and the governments vow to prevent the mosques demolition 
most of the deaths were the result of either stabbings or police 
shootings in dozens of towns in the states of rajasthan gujarat 
karnataka and andhra pradesh states which are predominantly hindu 
but have large moslem populations 
news reports said businesses shut down and traffic stayed off 
the roads in most parts of the country either in support of the 
strike or for fear of violence 
a curfew was imposed and army called out in several towns the 
reports said 
press trust of india and united news of india described the 
clashes as communal violence a phrase that usually means 
hindumoslem clashes indian news media avoid giving specific 
details in such cases contending that the normally strained 
religious tensions would only be heightened 
indias moslem population of about 105 million is the 
secondlargest in the world after indonesia but moslems comprise 
only 12 percent of the 880 million population hindus have an 82 
percent majority 
the news reports said about 50000 people have been detained 
across the country in preventative arrests such arrests are common 
in india where the law permits people to be held without charge if 
the authorities believe public safety is in danger 
the time has come for all secular forces to unite 
irrespective of party affiliations for the issues which are facing 
us today are larger than party consideration singh said in a 
statement 
the appeal was apparently directed at parliament members of the 
bharatiya janata party and the opposition congress party in the 
hope that some of them would vote for the government on nov 7 
singh needs the support of 261 members in the 522seat lower 
house of parliament at present he has the assured support of about 
200 members 
the bharatiya janata party has 86 seats 
singh who took office nearly 11 months ago said in his 
statement that in the meantime the government will work to stop 
the hindu fundamentalists from beginning their temple construction 
on oct 30 in ayodhya 300 miles southeast of new delhi 
at least 80 people were killed earlier this month in violence 
triggered by the temple campaign

the 70yearold soviet national trade union 
organization voted today to dissolve itself and to form a voluntary 
association of unions the state news agency tass reported 
the meeting in moscow coincided with a congress of miners 
occurring in the ukrainian city of donestsk to form the nations 
first independent trade union 
during their weeklong conference the miners plan to consider a 
national strike to enforce their economic and political demands 
the congress is an outgrowth of the nationwide coal strike that 
gripped the country in july 1989 
with president mikhail s gorbachev in attendance 2500 
delegates to the central council of trade unions meeting in moscow 
voted the council out of existence and formed an alliance of 
industrial and regional unions tass said 
the council was an umbrella organization of trade unions 
representing an estimated 140 million soviet workers 
it was not clear whether the miners union would be allowed or 
would want to join the newly reformed national trade union 
organization 
delegates to the national congress in moscow being held two 
years ahead of scheduled moved quickly to break with the communist 
economic system 
deputy chief vladimir scherbakov said the council increasingly 
lagged behind profound changes acute and complex processes of real 
life which inevitably prompted a crisis of trust in its 
structures he said the revamped organization would no longer 
demand a monopoly on workers loyalty 
tass said the decision to hold the official conference two years 
early was extraordinary no official reason was given but it 
appeared designed to coincide with the miners meeting in donetsk 
the open bidding for workers hearts in a country that once 
hailed itself as a workers paradise demonstrated the political 
importance that organizers place on bluecollar labor as the 
political and economic system opens up 
the miners strikes which started in the summer of 1989 began 
to protest working and living conditions and shortages of such 
basics as soap and medical care the miners quickly escalated their 
demands to include regional economic autonomy for the main mine 
regions such as the kuznetsk basin in siberia and the don river 
basin in the ukraine 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov persuaded the miners to return 
to work promising to meet most of their demands but most of the 
promises remain unfulfilled an issue that has spurred new strikes 
the strike committees meeting at their first conference in 
donetsk last summer demanded the promises be honored they also 
called for ryzhkovs government to resign and urged workers in 
other industries to cut their ties with the government and official 
unions 
the delegates at that congress proposed forming an independent 
trade union but postponed its actual formation until now to allow 
the new government of russian president boris n yeltsin to deal 
with the economic crisis

turned out to be a peter max silk screen worth 800 
maxs penciled signature on the print of a neoncolored man in a 
brightlyhued coat was obscured by the frame 
this may be the grand finale in the bargain department said 
lisa smith who got the last laugh on critics who dismiss flea 
markets and thrift sales as a dumping ground for junk 
smith found the print amid the bricabrac of tampas junior 
league thrift sale in september

congress should safeguard workers rights 
before employers begin widespread screening for genetic diseases 
sen albert gore jr dtenn said wednesday 
gore released a report by the office of technology assessment 
which showed that few us companies now require genetic testing of 
their employees and applicants but he said congress should move 
now before the practice becomes more widespread to head off 
discrimination against workers on the basis of genetic 
characteristics 
to a large extent there are few clear guidelines on how these 
tests can be used or how workers can be protected from having their 
rights violated said gore who requested the report 
genetic screening can help save lives by alerting an employer to 
a workers susceptibility to a particular occupational exposure 
the report noted 
but it expressed concern that employers might deny jobs to 
anyone whose tests show they are at risk of genetic disease and 
could prove a burden to a companys health insurance program 
genetic tests are available to detect sickle cell anemia cystic 
fibrosis huntingtons disease hemophilia duchenne muscular 
dystrophy and other diseases future tests could screen for such 
things as hypertension dyslexia alzheimers disease and cancer 
the report said 
the otas 1989 survey of the nations 500 largest companies 
produced responses from 330 companies twelve reported current use 
of genetic monitoring or screening and eight others said they had 
conducted these tests at some time since 1970 
a similar ota survey in 1982 elicited responses from 366 
companies with six saying these tests were in current use and 19 
indicating past use 
margaret anderson project director said it was not clear why 
more companies are not testing but she said cost ranging from 
200 to 980 a person is probably a factor

after an outofcourt settlement the supreme 
court has dismissed a case stemming from a 300 million lawsuit by 
a california woman who said the taiwanese government plotted her 
husbands 1984 murder 
the justices had been asked by lawyers for both sides to drop 
the case in which taiwans government had argued that american 
courts lack the authority to hear such a suit 
helen liu of daly city calif had contended in her suit that 
the government of taiwan formally named the republic of china 
carefully orchestrated a coverup of a terrorist plan and 
scheme to silence her husband henry liu 
gerard harper a lawyer for mrs liu said the supreme court 
case was dropped after mrs liu and the government of taiwan 
reached a settlement in which the government admitted no wrongdoing 
but paid her an amount of money 
harper said the size of the payment is confidential 
the high courts order dismissing the case was dated sept 28 
born in china henry liu fled to taiwan in 1949 he lived there 
until emigrating to the united states in 1967 and became a us 
citizen in 1974 
a historian and journalist liu had written several articles 
critical of taiwans government 
liu was gunned down at his home by members of the bamboo union 
an organized crime group based in taiwan gangleader chen chili 
confessed to plotting lius murder and implicated two government 
officials including wong hsiling director of taiwans defense 
intelligence bureau 
wong was convicted and sentenced to life in prison one of his 
aides chen humen was sentenced to 30 months in prison 
mrs lius suit said her husband began receiving threats in 
1973 and that his published works were confiscated and suppressed 
in taiwan 
the threats did not daunt liu who continued to endorse a 
return to democratic rule in taiwan mrs lius lawyers had told 
the high court he paid for those views with his life 
mrs lius suit was filed in late 1985 nearly a year after the 
criminal convictions stemming from her husbands murder 
taiwans government sought dismissal of the suit arguing that 
the act of state doctrine precluded us courts from pursuing mrs 
lius theory of a government murder plot 
a federal trial judge dismissed the suit but the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals reinstated it last december

two news organizations are challenging a 
judges decision to bar reporters from calling jurors who delivered 
a 125 million verdict against white supremacist tom metzger 
multnomah county circuit judge ancer l haggerty issued the 
ruling at the end of the trial late monday but said he would hold 
another hearing friday to consider the challenge filed by lawyers 
for the oregonian and kgwtv 
haggerty told reporters they would be held in contempt of court 
if they tried to interview jurors about the verdict against 
metzger leader of white aryan resistance his son john and 
others 
the metzgers were sued by the family of mulugeta seraw 27 a 
black man from ethiopia who was beaten to death by racist 
skinheads the jury decided that metzger incited seraws killers 
and was responsible for his death in november 1988 
before dismissing the jury haggerty asked jurors if any wished 
to appear at a news conference that evening he later told 
reporters that no jurors wished to be involved 
haggerty said he told the jurors they were free to discuss the 
case but that reporters could not call them 
charles hinkle attorney for the oregonian said the order 
violated state and federal constitutional free press guarantees he 
also said the order was invalid because it was not in writing and 
because reporters did not have a chance to be heard before it was 
issued 
portland lawyer elden m rosenthal who helped represent seraws 
estate said he thought the judges order was appropriate 
i think these jurors have gone far beyond the call of public 
service rosenthal said 
he said he felt jurors in a highly controversial case ought to 
be allowed to melt back into the population at the end of their 
service 
intense security required for the twoweek trial cost the 
portland police bureau almost 300000 in overtime but the full 
cost of security still is being calculated and wont be known for 
several days spokesman dave simpson said wednesday 
concern about violence stemmed in part from the bombing of the 
federal courthouse in san diego on sept 15 a previously unknown 
white supremacist group claimed responsibility and threatened 
further violence if the lawsuit against metzger were not dropped 
morris dees the southern poverty law center attorney who sued 
metzger received a letter the same day threatening him police 
said metzger received 20 death threat a day at his portland 
message center 
police maintained 24hour protection of dees rosenthal and the 
judge 
the portland police deserve bouquets dees said i mean 
ive had five or six guys around the clock since i hit this town 
two weeks ago 
metzger and his son spurned police offers and used their own 
bodyguards outside court said deputy chief dan noelle

the missouri court of appeals has 
expanded the power of police to make drug raids in response to an 
operation in which agents used mailorder records to nab more than 
100 accused marijuana growers 
the court tuesday overturned a decision by linn county circuit 
judge robert devoy who ruled that police had unconstitutionally 
searched the prairie hill home of lisa diane shuck as part of 
operation green merchant 
shuck and another resident of the house william phegley were 
charged in october 1989 with possession and production of 
marijuana the charges carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in 
prison 
police obtained the warrant using records showing phegley had 
bought hydroponic equipment which enables plants to grow in water 
from a company that advertises in high times magazine 
the new yorkbased magazine caters to marijuana growers and 
advocates legalizing marijuana 
police also presented evidence for the warrant that shuck had 
draped blankets over her windows and used four times more 
electricity than her neighbors 
officers found more than 70 marijuana plants marijuana seeds 
and growing equipment during the raid 
judges william e turnage and donald l manford said in the 
ruling the search was reasonable 
but judge robert w berrey warned in a dissent that police 
must be vigilant not to trample on our bill of rights to cure a 
momentary ill of our time 
if the majority should prevail no hydroponic horticulturist 
or african violet grower will be safe from unwanted intrusions 
berrey wrote 
jack lukehart shucks attorney said he would appeal the 
decision to the state supreme court

the editor of the communist party newspaper 
pravda facing a hostile staff and slumping circulation said 
wednesday he had offered to resign but was told by mikhail 
gorbachev and the politburo to stay on 
ivan t frolov who was appointed editor of pravda a year ago 
told a news conference that he offered to quit as a result of 
insulting remarks about him by pravda staff members 
frolov also released figures showing a stunning drop in the 
circulation of the newspaper that for decades was viewed as the 
most important in the country 
as of oct 1 pravda had received only 504000 subscriptions for 
next year a huge drop from its current circulation of 77 million 
the circulation drive originally scheduled to end oct 30 has 
been extended to nov 15 
frolov did not say what insulting remarks the staff had made 
but pravda employees have said they are dissatisfied with frolovs 
traditionalist views and his ties to hardline politicians 
the staffers voted three weeks ago to ask the partys central 
committee to review the newspapers leadership frolov has called 
the vote a minicoup attempt against him 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness 
other newspapers regularly publish articles on controversial 
political or historical themes or on popular culture 
although pravda has begun to print some articles critical of 
government officials and policies it has changed less than other 
periodicals and is one of the most orthodox communist newspapers 
its official owner is the party central committee and it 
regularly carries frontpage editorials praising and explaining 
party positions 
frolov attributed pravdas plummeting circulation both to an 
increase in its cover price which is rising from about 9 to 17 
cents and to its ownership by the party which is blamed by many 
soviets for the countrys disintegrating economy and political 
structure 
peoples attitudes toward pravda are connected with their 
attitudes toward the party he said 
frolov said he offered his resignation on tuesday to the partys 
highest bodies the central committee secretariat and politburo 
headed by gorbachev who is the party leader as well as president 
of the country 
i said i could not and did not want to work at this newspaper 
anymore frolov said 
he added that he raised the issue himself and received a 
negative response to his offer to step down 
i received full support from the politburo and the secretariat 
and of course i must and i will work at pravda he said 
frolov said he also received permission from the party leaders 
to set up a pravda association that could publish other newspapers 
sell advertising and start new ventures to raise profits and offset 
pravdas declining revenues 
he said pravda now makes a profit of about 18 million dollars a 
year but probably would become unprofitable if its circulation 
slipped below 5 million copies 
given the current status of the subscription drive it appears 
unlikely that pravda will reach the 5 million level but frolov 
said he was confident it would continue to be published and have a 
sufficient circulation to remain a worldclass newspaper 
pravda comes out seven days a week each issue is either six or 
eight pages long with no advertising

vandals are destroying 
geysers and hot springs in yellowstone national park by throwing 
boulders old shoes and other debris into the thermal channels 
officials said wednesday 
even the famous old faithful geyser has been hit 
in the most recent case someone earlier this month damaged the 
rustic group of geysers near heart lake in the southern part of 
the park by clogging them with rocks and kicking in their conical 
rims 
at least one of the geysers the rustic geyser vent has been 
reduced to a trickle and may never erupt normally again park 
officials say 
its just so senseless there could have been no reason to do 
it except to just destroy the area and we have no idea why someone 
would want to do that park spokeswoman marsha karle said they 
are irreplaceable and priceless treasures 
since the park was created in 1872 the curious occasionally have 
tossed logs and rocks into geysers to watch the debris blow 
skyhigh in the next eruption of steam and hot water from deep 
underground 
reports from the early days of yellowstone tell of others who 
have even taken axes to some of the thermal features to chip 
mementos and some people have carved their initials into the 
geyser cones of mineral deposits 
for as long as people have been around theyve been throwing 
things into old faithful and other thermal features karle said 
weve had trouble before with people throwing coins small rocks 
chicken bones rifle shells cigarette butts and bottles 
last may a billings mont man was fined 525 for throwing a 
chemical into the giantess geyser near old faithful 
while the force of erupting geysers sometimes ejects the debris 
karle said some become so plugged they wont erupt again 
park rangers do their best to retrieve garbage from the vents 
but most is too deep 
yellowstones thermal features are fragile and easily damaged 
walking on them carving or defacing them or removing souvenir 
pieces of formations destroys decades or centuries of intricate 
natural processes karle said 
the roughly 10000 geysers and hot springs that draw visitors to 
the nations oldest national park take many many years to build 
up and be created and just a few minutes for someone to destroy 
she said

president bush faces key decisions in the 
coming weeks that could signal whether he anticipates a lengthy 
standoff with iraqs saddam hussein or wants american forces 
prepared to attack 
among the questions facing bush 
whether to add more troops and firepower to the us deployment 
in the mideast now at 220000 and scheduled to peak at 240000 in 
three weeks 
whether to withdraw some units that are not essential to 
defending saudi arabia a decision which could serve to assuage 
growing public concern about the prospects of war without 
diminishing the forces defensive capabilities 
approving a pentagon troop rotation plan now in the draft 
stages that sources said should be ready for white house review in 
a week or so 
whether to use his authority to extend 90day reserve callups 
for another 90 days 
the us deployment reached a symbolic juncture wednesday with 
the arrival in saudi arabia of the final elements of the 11th air 
defense brigade from fort bliss in texas it was the last combat 
unit scheduled for deployment in the region pentagon sources said 
the only remaining troops scheduled to be sent to the area are 
in support units they should all arrive in the next three weeks 
bringing the total deployment to 240000 said the sources 
speaking on the condition of anonymity 
as of now were not planning for any additional buildup were 
planning to sustain the force that is present one of the 
pentagon sources said 
but gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
has discussed with ground commanders the possibility of changing 
the force size he is due back from saudi arabia late thursday 
if powell recommended and bush approved adding to the force 
pentagon sources said the likely additions would be heavy armor 
units from the united states europe or both such orders also 
would necessitate sending several additional support units into the 
region as well the sources said 
that would ratchet up the pressure on saddam and give the 
president the option of surprise if he decided to go on the 
offensive one of the sources said if a decision has been made 
to kick him out then adding to the force first would make it more 
efficient in terms of loss of life 
but barring some development in the crisis that would prompt 
united nations support for an offensive pentagon sources and 
military analysts think it far more likely that bush will tinker 
with the force but not dramatically signaling continued resolve 
to allow economic sanctions against iraq to take hold 
we would have to double the force there to make an offensive 
palatable from a military standpoint said lawrence j korb a 
former assistant defense secretary for manpower in the reagan 
administration i dont think that is very likely at all 
by bringing some nonessential units home bush could show 
that we are prepared to stay there for the long haul as long as 
he articulated the reasons for the moves korb said saddam is 
waiting to see how long we can hold both the support of the 
american congress and our un coalition together id set up a 
rotation plan but basically keep my troop level about where it 
is 
if powell recommends withdrawing forces the sources said the 
82nd airborne division the first ground unit to reach saudi 
arabia likely would be the first unit brought home 
such a move would not affect the defensive capability of the 
usled multinational forces the sources said but withdrawing 
the paratroopers would signal that we are going to hunker down 
and wait right along with saddam the source said 
the withdrawal of even a few thousand troops from the mideast 
could also help bush whom korb said is obviously not as popular 
as he was when he started this 
said one of the pentagon sources wed look good bringing some 
people home for christmas even if in the big scheme of things it 
didnt amount to much 
at the same time we have to be very careful about what kind 
of signal we send because perception is as important as reality in 
that part of the world and its easy for things to get confused in 
translation this pentagon official said whether the decision 
is status quo reduce or add the white house is going to have to 
explain that and ensure that the diplomatic signals that are 
connected with the decisions are properly read by saddam hussein 
the pentagon sources said draft rotation plans call for 
sixmonth rotations for most units which would mean the first 
largescale substitutions beginning in february some units that 
are harder to replace may have to spend more time in country than 
we or they would like one of the sources said 
the sequence of the rotations is still under discussion this 
source said we know the soldiers and families are waiting with 
bated breath but there are some very complicated questions to be 
resolved 
when heavy armor units are rotated the pentagon would have to 
decide whether to leave tanks and other equipment in saudi arabia 
or bring them home with the troops current thinking is to bring 
the equipment home a huge logistical headache because otherwise 
the troops would be unable to train at their bases for possible 
return to saudi arabia 
overall cutbacks in the military further complicate rotation 
planning for example the army alone has to plan for 11 million 
moves in the next 12 months in a force numbering just over 700000

the bush administration has put syria on 
notice it has a special responsibility to curb violence in 
areas of lebanon under syrian control the state department said 
wednesday 
with the us embassy in beirut closed the united states is 
assessing blame for the mounting death toll since gen michel aoun 
the last major christian holdout gave up his struggle against 
syrian forces 11 days ago 
the most recent prominent victim was dany chamoun a christian 
leader who also opposed syrian influence he his wife and two 
small children were slain in their beirut apartment last weekend 
no one has claimed responsibility 
we have seen the many press reports of atrocities carried out 
in east beirut since the surrender of gen aoun margaret d 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said we do not have 
firsthand knowledge which could confirm those reports however the 
reports themselves are enough to shock and horrify 
the us official added if these reports are true whoever is 
responsible the united states would condemn them in the strongest 
terms 
the bush administration had urged aoun to end his resistance 
aoun has taken refuge in the french embassy 
we have told the syrians they have a special responsibility 
given their control over parts of lebanon to ensure that such 
abuses do not take place in areas under their control ms 
tutwiler said reading from a prepared statement there is no 
ambiguity in the message we have sent to syria on this point 
syria which has influence over the lebanese government headed 
by president elias hrawi is a key arab ally of the united states 
in its campaign against iraqs occupation of kuwait some 4000 
syrian troops are in saudi arabia to help defend the kingdom 
against iraqi attack 
ms tutwiler said assistant secretary of state john h kelly had 
met with syrian ambassador walid almoualem here while edward 
djerejian the us ambassador to syria had met with foreign 
minister farouk alshara in damascus 
also the spokeswoman said kelly met tuesday and several times 
before then with the lebanese ambassador nassib lahoud

wojciech jaruzelski using the veto for 
the first time since he became president has rejected legislation 
that would have allowed foreigners to buy land in poland from the 
state 
the former communist party leader who became president in july 
1989 and will leave office after the nov 25 elections generally 
has not used his presidential powers to block the solidarityled 
governments reforms 
the land management law deeply divided parliament many 
lawmakers fear poland will be bought out by western investors 
particularly from neighboring germany who are attracted to the 
relatively low cost of polish property 
the state news agency pap which reported the veto did not say 
what specific objections jaruzelski raised 
the sejm the lower house of parliament initially rejected 
allowing the purchase of stateowned land by foreigners in late 
september however the senate passed a version of the bill that 
permitted sales to nonpoles if approved by the interior ministry 
that version was endorsed by the sejm 
senators argued that western investors would hesitate to 
establish badly needed new companies in poland if they could not 
have the security of owning their own property 
they also noted the anomaly that privately owned land can be 
sold to foreigners but governmentowned land cannot 
under the communist government that ruled poland from the end of 
world war ii until last year and in the economic upheaval that 
followed the communists dismissal few poles have accumulated 
enough capital to make large investments

president bushs unbroken string ofsuccessful 
vetoes is built largely around a strategy of using the veto as a 
club to force concessions from congress say white house officials 
and political analysts 
bush kept his record intact wednesday when the senate by a 
onevote margin upheld his veto of a major civil rights bill the 
white house hailed the vote and prodded congress anew to enact 
bushs version of the bill 
bush has issued 16 vetoes all have been sustained in the 
democraticcontrolled congress over the last three decades only 
gerald r ford issued vetoes more frequently and a quarter of his 
were overridden 
bush uses the power of the veto differently from many 
presidents who employed the veto simply to kill unwanted 
legislation and bills they deemed unconstitutional 
in large measure bush uses vetoes to force compromises from 
congress it is a tactic that makes the white house a player at the 
bargaining table as bills move through the house and senate 
he has wielded the veto much less as a public relations 
weapon much more as a quiet instrument of influence in the 
congress said american enterprise institute analyst norman 
ornstein 
richard nixon often used to veto bills at press conferences 
making a statement as much as anything else ornstein said 
george bush does it in a much more understated way 
in dealing with lawmakers bush has a big problem he has the 
smallest share of his own party members in congress of any newly 
elected president in history 
with such a divided government bush does not have the clout to 
push a legislative program through congress yet there is enough 
gop strength to sustain his vetoes when republicans stick together 
when you have two houses against you you have no leverage 
the odds are heavy against you said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater so youve got to use a sledgehammer going in 
that says we wont accept this 
in his day ronald reagan coyly refused to say whether he would 
veto a bill bush does it all the time while also carefully 
spelling out options to make a bill acceptable 
you try to get as much change as you can before a bill is 
passed fitzwater said so by signaling early that youre going 
to veto you tell them they need to seriously consider 
compromise 
bush established the pattern with his very first veto democrats 
wanted to raise the minimum hourly wage to 455 over three years 
bush said that was excessive and threatened a veto congress 
approved the increase anyway and bush rejected the bill when he 
was sustained lawmakers and the white house struck a compromise 
tom cronin a political scientist at stanford university said 
the president is using his vetoes quite intelligently 
he doesnt try to use the veto in a meanspirited way he just 
sees it as an instrument to try to get people back to the 
bargaining table cronin said 
bush vetoed three appropriations bill to force the deletion of 
abortion financing from otherwise acceptable measures three other 
measures including one dealing with chinese students were 
rejected to prevent what he viewed as an erosion of presidential 
authority 
most recently bush vetoed a shortterm spending resolution and 
partially 
shut down the government to force progress on deficitreduction 
negotiations mondays veto of the civil rights legislation came 
only after months of negotiations between the white house and 
congress 
the president coupled his veto with a copy of a civil rights 
bill he would sign but civil rights advocates denounced it as a 
sham 
democrats routinely decry bushs vetoes but they havent been 
able to stop him 
early in the adiinistration there was an understanding among 
bush senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority 
leader robert michel rill fitzwater said 
they agreed that the only way they would have any clout in the 
congress is if when it was called for they could hang together 
the spokesman said 
basically on most of these vetoes weve been able to hold 
together it gets more dicey when you cant hold all your 
republicans youve got to try to pick up some democrats

in a rare night attack israeli warplanes 
on wednesday bombed a suspected plo missile base in response to 
artillery attacks in israel and its selfproclaimed security 
zone reports said 
no casualty figures were immediately given by the palestine 
liberation organization or israeli military following the 20minute 
assault around the rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern port 
of tyre 
a plo communique said four aircraft dropped bombs and strafed 
positions manned by guerrillas from fatah the plos mainstream 
faction headed by yaser arafat 
it was the first israel air raid into lebanon since july 9 and 
the 15th this year israeli officials say they have attempted to 
avoid attacks in lebanon since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
it was also the first attack since syria a longtime israeli 
foe expanded its control in lebanon by helping government troops 
oust rebel christian gen michel aoun almost two weeks ago 
in israel the military command claimed the target was a 
terrorist launching pad for sovietmade katyusha rockets fired 
into israel the past two weeks 
the last of the rocket attacks was oct 16 when a barrage landed 
in northern israel causing no damage or injuries five days 
earlier six rockets landed inside israels security zone in south 
lebanon according to israeli reports 
rashidiyh is about 50 miles south of beirut and 10 miles north 
of the israeli border 
israel carved out the 440squaremile security zone in 1985 
during the withdrawal the bulk of its army from south lebanon 
following a threeyear occupation of the region 
previous israeli air raids have killed 20 people and wounded 62 
police said 
israels air force usually strikes in daytime but helicopter 
gunships often range into lebanon during night to rout guerrillas 
earlier wednesday the lebanese police said israeliaffiliated 
militiamen killed two guerrillas of the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god in a south lebanon firefight 
but the israeli army said members of an elite paratrooper 
brigade not militiamen of the south lebanon army killed the 
guerrillas 
a lebanese police spokesman who cannot be named under 
regulations said three other fighters of the shiite moslem 
hezbollah were wounded in the clash near the village of kfar 
houneh 
the battle occurred 15 miles north of the israeli border which 
is deeper into lebanon than normal for israeli troops seeking 
guerrillas 
the lebanese police spokesman said south lebanon army gunners 
later pounded the area around kfar houneh and hezbollahcontrolled 
villages of mashghara and maidoun 
hezbollah returned fire with salvoes of katyusha rockets he 
added 
he said a casualty report on the missile exchange was not 
immediately available

transportation secretary samuel k skinner on 
wednesday announced new standards to protect car occupants during 
sideimpact collisions saying the regulation would prevent 500 
deaths a year 
the action ends more than a decade of haggling over how 
manufacturers should reinforce cars to help riders withstand side 
collisions more people die that way than in any other kind of 
automobile wreck except frontal collisions 
its been a long time coming skinner said at a news 
conference outside the capitol he stood near a demonstration car 
with its drivers side crushed inward and a crash dummy seated 
behind the wheel in a graphic illustration of the danger of side 
collisions 
manufacturers must meet the new standards in 10 percent of their 
new cars by 1994es to 25 percent in the 1995 mod the minimum risel 
year and 40 percent in 1996 by the 1997 model year all new cars 
must comply 
the changes will boost the average cars cost by about 50 a 
small price to pay for the prevention of the immense loss of life 
and suffering as a result of these side impacts skinner said 
the regulation is designed to reduce deaths and serious injuries 
caused by chest and pelvic injuries about 8000 people die and 
24000 are hurt seriously each year in side crashes 
rance institute for highway safety said the regulation 
was a longoverdue first step but was inadequate because it 
excludes protections from head injuries 
a substantial proportion of the most serious injuries that 
occur in side impacts are head injuries said brian oneill the 
groups president

talks with militia leaders about withdrawing their forces from the 
city under a peace plan aimed at ending lebanons 15year civil 
war 
chamoun 56 and his family were gunned down at their apartment 
in beiruts eastern suburb of baabda on sunday no group has 
claimed responsibility for the slayings which were branded by both 
christian and moslem leaders as an attempt to derail the peace 
efforts 
chamoun leader of the rightwing christian national liberal 
party was a staunch ally of defeated rebel gen michel aoun his 
murder occured eight days after syrian and lebanese troops crushed 
aouns 11month mutiny in an eighthour assault that left 550 dead 
and more than 1200 wounded 
aoun has taken refuge in the french embassy he had opposed the 
peace plan because it provided no timetable for the withdrawal of 
syrian troops 40000 of whom are deployed in lebanon 
on wednesday black flags fluttered above the stone houses of 
the ancient mountain town of deir alkamar southeast of beirut as 
the four coffins were driven to the cemetery after a fourhour 
service 
chamoun his wife ingrid and their two sons tarek 7 and 
julien 5 were buried next to the tomb of his father former

once and for all

to spread state authority over the capital and its environs in 
line with a peace plan endorsed by parliament aug 22 
it did not set a deadline for carrying out the plan to create a 
militiafree greater beirut 
the army would be in charge of all streets and government 
utilities all militia offices and centers would be closed said

serious rejection of the greater beirut plan adding that it 
might be implemented as early as next week

syria on wednesday accused the united 
states of encouraging aggression by providing arms and money to 
israel 
it was the first time the government has criticized the united 
states since the two nations joined in the multinational military 
buildup to counter iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait syrias 
criticism while not jeopardizing the alliance underscores its 
fragility 
in making the criticism syria was reacting to a us 
announcement this month that it was providing israel with 
antimissile patriot missiles syrian officials are also apparently 
angry over reports that us officials had delayed a new un 
resolution to condemn israel for the killing of 19 palestinians by 
security forces this month 
in wednesdays remarks the government also called on arabs to 
thoroughly discuss us aid to israel it did not make a 
specific proposal but called for appropriate action by arabs in 
response 
the criticism came in the official syrian arab news agency 
which said it was quoting an authoritative source such 
commentaries are usually made by a ranking member of the syrian 
goverment or the ruling baath party reflecting official stance 
syria has committed up to 15000 troops to the multinational 
military buildup in the persian gulf it was the first time that 
the united states and syria a spearhead of arab radicalism agreed 
on a middle east conflict in nearly 20 years 
everyday the us comes up with a new kind of support to 
extend to israel only very recently it decided to provide israel 
with patriot missiles and new ammunitions the source was quoted 
wednesday as saying 
earlier this month us officials announced they were providing 
two batteries of patriot missiles to israel on an emergency basis 
wednesdays commentary also complained of us aid to build 
housing for jewish immigrants 
the source was quoted as saying that us aid to israel cannot 
achieve peace nor can it be aimed at achieving peace rather it 
strengthens aggression and occupation and encourages invasion and 
expansion

federal health officials largest collection yet 
of aids test surveys shows the nations aids infection rates are 
highest at drug treatment clinics and lowest at blood donor 
centers 
the centers for disease control on thursday will publish the 
results of aids virus test surveys from a variety of settings 
nationwide health clinics hospitals the job corps the military 
and other places where large numbers of blood samples could be 
analyzed 
the separate surveys were considered in the absence of a 
nationwide survey for infection with hiv the virus that causes 
aids 
overall the survey data indicated the widespread yet 
extremely varied distribution of hiv the cdc reported by far 
the highest prevalence rates were found among persons known to be 
at risk specifically gay and bisexual men and users of 
intravenous drugs 
of nearly 150000 aids cases reported in the united states 59 
percent have occurred among gay or bisexual males and 21 percent 
were among iv drug abusers an additional 7 percent of aids 
patients fell into both categories and were counted separately 
the hiv prevalence surveys involved testing blood samples 
collected as far back as 1986 settings ranged from military 
recruitment centers to large urban hospitals to american red cross 
blood donation centers 
hiv infection rates in all categories were relatively low the 
worst was a median of 41 percent among clients at 54 drug 
treatment centers where by definition many are at high risk for 
aids 
federal health officials estimate that between 1 million and 15 
million americans are infected with hiv for an estimated national 
rate of about 005 percent 
one survey found the infection rate quite high in one separate 
classification high prevalences were observed among 
homosexual and bisexual men in all geographic regions the cdc 
reported 
at 103 sexuallytransmitteddisease clinics surveyed across the 
country infection rates among gay and bisexual patients ranged 
from 15 percent in two salt lake city clinics to 64 percent in two 
newark nj clinics with a median of 36 percent 
generally infection rates were higher for men than women and 
for the northeastern and southern states 
more of the surveys findings 
among about 4 million american red cross blood donors in the 
second half of 1989 the infection rate was 00084 percent or 
about 8 in 100000 that indicates not just a low number of 
infected people giving blood but also the removal of infected 
donors from the repeat donation list 
among nearly 25 million applicants for military service the 
infection rate was 012 percent or 12 of 10000 the low rate is 
not necessarily surprising as homosexuals and drug users are 
unwelcome in the military 
among 12 million childbearing women the estimated national 
infection rate was 015 percent 15 of 10000 
at 39 large urban acutecare hospitals where patients blood 
samples were analyzed the median infection rate was 07 percent 
or 7 in 1000 there was however a 70fold variation among 
individual hospitals which ranged from 01 percent to 69 percent 
rates were five times higher for men than women 15 percent to 
03 percent and somewhat higher for blacks 1 percent than for 
whites or hispanics 07 percent 
in about 100000 blood samples annually at a large diagnostic 
laboratory the hiv infection rate was 089 percent or about 9 in 
1000 
among an annual 60000 job corps entrants most of them 
disadvantaged young people the infection rate was 036 percent 
or about 4 in 1000 
at the 103 sexually transmitted disease clinics the median 
infection rate for 205000 patients was 22 percent 
at 187 womens health clinics the median infection rate for 
156000 patients was 02 percent or 2 out of 1000 
in 20 metropolitan tuberculosis clinics the median infection 
rate was 34 percent tb is a frequent complication of hiv 
infection

two women who went public with the stories 
of their rapes returned to the courtroom on wednesday for closing 
arguments in the fourth trial of the man they say attacked them 
almost decade ago 
sue kremelberg and susan sweetser took the unusual step of 
identifying themselves publicly as rape victims earlier this year 
because they were angry at how long it took their cases to go 
through the court system the women were raped in 1981 
i want people to know the outrage ms kremelberg a 
resident of morristown said recently 
robert percy of elmore vt is accused of raping ms 
kremelberg while out on bail after raping ms sweetser an attorney 
from essex just weeks earlier 
in both cases a lower court convicted percy of raping the 
women in both cases the vermont supreme court sent the cases back 
for retrial the states highest court recently upheld percys 
second conviction in the sweetser case 
vermont attorney general jeffrey amestoy wrote a note to ms 
sweetser the day the court upheld the conviction 
nine years late he wrote may my daughters have your 
courage and may they have a fairer and faster criminal justice 
system 
percy does not deny raping ms kremelberg but he says he was 
insane at the time suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder 
and reliving a vietnam war flashback 
on wednesday closing arguments in the case were heard in 
windsor district court in the second trial on her attack defense 
attorney james dumont pointed to psychiatrists testimony which he 
said showed percy was wounded in the brain by his vietnam 
experience 
these are fusions mixtures of nightmares and reality 
dumont said he was in one world and she was in another 
but prosecutor phillip cykon said in his closing argument that 
percy was in control of his actions during the attack 
the defendant was acting in a way that was his continuing 
antisocial behavior they were the actions of a defendant who was 
in control cykon told jurors 
the vietnam war is not on trial here cykon added 
posttramatic stress disorder alone is not enough to excuse 
criminal behavior 
last week ms kremelberg recounted for the jury her ninehour 
ordeal the night of jan 16 1981 that evening her stop for 
diapers for her baby son and gasoline for her car brought her in 
contact with percy an attendant at the mansfield garage in stowe 
her voice calm but at times in tears ms kremelberg testified 
that percy told her to back her car to the air pump located in a 
darker section of the station because her left tire looked low 
once at the pump she said percy jumped into her car 
i said what is this a joke get out of my car i have to 
get home to my husband and baby and he said lady shut up and 
drive she said at that point he pulled a gun out and i 
was so scared i just drove 
ms kremelberg said percy tied her hands behind her back with 
tape blindfolded her and raped her 
after driving to connecticut he raped her again before that 
assault she said she struggled for the gun and told percy id 
rather be dead than do this again ms kremelberg escaped in 
brookfield conn and police there arrested percy 
percy was convicted of the rape in 1982 but the state supreme 
court reversed the decision giving percy a new trial

before marking her ballot wednesday 
morning benazir bhutto visited the grave of her father prime 
minister zulfikar ali bhutto who was overthrown in a 1977 coup and 
hanged two years later 
but it was later in the day that the 37yearold ousted prime 
minister choked back tears accusing the government of rigging her 
partys overwhelming defeat 
this election is a fraud said ms bhutto who apparently 
won one of her two races for a national assembly seat 
ms bhutto the first woman to lead a modern moslem nation also 
faces corruption charges in which she could be jailed and banned 
from politics if convicted her husband businessman asif ali 
zardari is jailed on kidnapping and extortion charges 
early results showed the rightwing islamic democratic alliance 
with a strong lead over ms bhuttos populist centerleft pakistan 
peoples party in races for 214 national assembly seats reports 
also indicated her party trailing badly in all four provinces 
especially punjab the most populous province and the major 
battleground of the election 
she had earlier predicted her party would win up to 120 seats in 
the assembly the lawmaking lower house of parliament that chooses 
the prime minister 
ms bhutto singled out president ghulam ishaq khan who led her 
aug 6 dismissal on charges of corruption nepotism and 
incompetence 
he has shown his partiality he is not the president of 
pakistan she said at her sprawling family home in larkana about 
500 miles southwest of the capital of islamabad 
she claimed the 73yearold president advanced the campaign of 
her opponents 
the president has made a mockery of the elections she said 
ms bhutto predicted she and her husband will be the subject of 
a witch hunt following the elections 
ms bhuttos opponents portrayed her 20month government as the 
most corrupt in pakistans 43year history and said the elections 
displayed the peoples anger 
since her dismissal three months ago ms bhutto had repeatedly 
compared her sacking to her fathers overthrow 
after her fathers death ms bhutto the eldest of four 
children was jailed and placed under house arrest she eventually 
fled to selfimposed exile in britain 
groomed for politics by her father ms bhutto returned to 
pakistan in 1986 promising to drown military dictator gen mohammad 
zia ulhaq in a tide of support from the countrys poor and 
downtrodden 
for days millions of people cloggged streets for a glimpse of 
ms bhutto 
the nations first free elections in 11 years were held after 
zia died in a mysterious plane crash in 1988 that also killed 
several top pakistani generals and us ambassador arnold raphael 
her party captured the largest bloc of votes with 93 assembly 
seats but failed to win a majority 
even supporters say ms bhutto struggled unsuccessively to make 
the transition from the oppressed champion of democracy to the 
leader of 110 million people most of whom are illiterate and earn 
less than 400 a year 
several analysts say her downfall was accelerated by her 
political inexperience and what her detractors have called the 
arrogance of the bhuttos 
she faces seven charges of misconduct and abuse of power before 
special onejudge tribunals set up by the president 
conviction on any of the charges could deny ms bhutto a seat in 
parliament and banish her from politics for seven years 
ms bhuttos husband faces charges of kidnapping a pakistanborn 
briton and extorting 800000 he has denied the charges claiming 
they were orchestrated by the government

structure for europe gen mikhail a moiseyev told a gathering 
of 400 belgian army navy and air force officers military 
organizations must cease to exist 
noting the soviet union will withdraw its troops from all 
eastern european allies by 1994 moiseyev said there will no 
longer be a warsaw pact as a military organization 
what remains is nato what is the purpose of the atlantic 
alliance moiseyev said in an address at the higher royal 
defense institute 
moiseyev expressed concern that the western european union a 
defense group of nine european nato members was being positioned 
to supplant nato what is needed is a paneuropean group that

the house virtually eliminated any chance of 
fish inspection becoming federal law this year by approving a bill 
wednesday that sharply contrasts with companion legislation passed 
by the senate 
we dont have time for a conference said agriculture 
committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas who tried 
unsuccessfully to win house approval of a measure similar to the 
senates 
the bill is dead said a senate aide the presidents veto 
threat killed it 
no one questioned the need for inspection with seafood 
consumption up and about 60000 people becoming ill in one year 
from eating fish even the industry wanted it 
the problem was who should do the inspection 
members from the agriculture committee insisted that it belonged 
with the agriculture department which inspects meat and poultry 
members of the commerce committee and the merchant marine and 
fisheries committee which oversee the federal agencies related to 
the fishing industry said the farm concerns didnt know enough 
about fish 
were arguing about rules and turf fights said rep pat 
roberts rkan a member of the agriculture committee trying to 
win the inspection program for usda or what should be surf and 
turf fights in this particular instance 
but rep gerry studds dmass chairman of the merchant marine 
subcommittee on fisheries said the agriculture committees bill 
failed to recognize that shellfish are the main cause of illness 
related to eating seafood 
he and commerce committee chairman john dingell dmich argued 
successfully that the fdas current fishinspection program which 
concentrates on shellfish should be expanded rather than moving 
the process to usda 
dingell said he had a letter from commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher health and human service louis sullivan and white house 
chief of staff john sununu saying they would recommend a veto if 
the dingellstudds plan was not adopted 
the house approved the plan by a vote of 277153 when it was 
submitted as a substitute for de la garzas bill 
the issue is not whether we want to inspect seafood said 
rep billy tauzin dla the issue is whether you want the 
agriculture committee which may not understand the difference 
between a chicken and a crawfish to undertake that effort 
the senate approved legislation last month that gives the 
agriculture department primary responsibility by putting the 
inspection process under its wing 
the senate bill requires the food and drug administration to set 
limits on the level of contamination in fish that would be 
acceptable for human consumption it instructs the commerce 
department to monitor the waters in which fish are caught 
although sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee said the differences in the house and senate 
bills could be worked out in conference committee aides said the 
differences were too great to be resolved in the waning days of the 
101st congress

soviet dissident yelena bonner said 
wednesday that her late husband nobel peace prize laureate andrei 
sakharov would have been uneasy with mikhail gorbachev winning the 
same prize 
i doubt that sakharov would have approved bonner was quoted 
as saying 
the remarks carried by the norwegian news agency ntb were her 
first public comment on the award of the 1990 nobel prize to the 
soviet president 
the oslobased peace prize committee announced oct 15 that 
gorbachev was selected because his reforms and glasnost policies 
had helped ease international tensions 
most western leaders welcomed the selection but bonner told ntb 
that the committee had either been unaware or chose to ignore 
conditions inside the soviet union 
she was referring to criticism at home that some of gorbachevs 
reforms have led to ethnic rioting food shortages and demands by 
most soviet republics for more independence from moscow 
the nobel committee has also not taken into consideration the 
fact that we are living between the second and third world wars in 
the gulf crisis totalitarian and democratic values are standing 
against each other said bonner 
considering the tensions provoked by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait no one deserved the prize she said in the agencys 
translation of her remarks 
she said it seemed strange that a soviet leader could win a 
peace prize when his country had supplied arms and military 
advisers to iraq 
the soviet union has since denounced iraq for invading kuwait 
but it has not provided soldiers to stand beside us forces 
opposing baghdad 
sakharov a physicist and human rights activists was awarded 
the nobel award in 1975 soviet officials did not allow him to come 
to oslo for the prize that year ut he picked it up last year 
shortly before his death 
bonner who was in oslo to promote a norwegian edition of 
sakharovs memoirs said her husband at first trusted gorbachev 
then lost faith 
she said gorbachev shortly after reaching power in 1985 took 
some positive steps such as allowing freedom of the press freeing 
such dissidents as sakharov and withdrawing soviet forces from 
afghanistan 
but after 1988 he concentrated on building up his own 
power she was quoted as saying

the national trade union organization 
voted to dissolve itself wednesday as coal miners gathered in the 
ukraine at the same time and announced plans to create the first 
mass independent union in soviet history 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev attended the meeting in 
moscow of the governmentsponsored national congress of trade 
unions whose 2500 delegates voted to reconstitute the 70yearold 
organization as a voluntary association of unions 
gorbachev told the meeting that he favored strong and 
independent unions the state news agency tass reported 
a meeting of the umbrella group representing about 140 million 
workers was called for this week two years ahead of schedule the 
dissolution of the organization appeared to be an effort to defuse 
the emergence of the radical miners union 
the miners holding their congress in the donetsk coal basin 
600 miles south of moscow have been threatening a repeat of the 
nationwide strikes that threatened to cripple the nation in july 
1989 
miner delegates from western siberia kazakhstan and the far 
north said they would not call a strike pending consideration of 
their complaints by the legislature of the russian republic now in 
session in moscow but they said they would create an independent 
union 
we will adopt a draft and we will go from here as the first 
members of an independent trade union said alexander adanidi a 
member of kuznetsk basin workers committee which started the 1989 
strike 
adanidi and other siberian miners complained that coal minister 
mikhail shchadov whose agency owns all mines and associated 
industries across the country had tried to undermine the 
legitimacy of the congress by contributing nearly 70000 to it 
shchadov was scheduled to address the congress thursday he was 
shouted down and driven from the hall when he spoke to a similar 
miners congress last summer 
at the congress of the governmentsponsored trade union 
association in moscow gorbachev urged delegates to keep in touch 
with all sections of the working people 
he urged them to support his reforms which he said were aimed 
at creating a society of democratic institutions and mechanisms 
that preserve and maintain law and order but we are still far from 
it 
it was not clear whether the miners new union would be allowed 
or would want to join the newly reformed national trade union 
organization whose leaders acknowledged they were losing the 
support of workers 
deputy chief vladimir scherbakov said the revamped organization 
would no longer demand a monopoly on workers loyalty 
the bidding for workers hearts in a country that once called 
itself a workers paradise shows the political importance that 
organizers place on bluecollar labor as the political and economic 
system opens up 
the miners strikes of 1989 began in protest of working and 
living conditions and shortages of such basics as soap and medical 
care 
demands quickly escalated to include regional economic autonomy 
for the main mining regions the kuznetsk basin the don river 
basin in the ukraine vorkuta in the far north and karaganda in 
kazakhstan 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov persuaded the miners to return 
to work promising to meet most of their demands but most of those 
promises remain unfulfilled 
the strike committees meeting at their first conference in 
donetsk last summer called for ryzhkovs government to resign

the second of four secret policemen 
convicted of the 1984 slaying of the rev jerzy popieluszko a 
prosolidarity priest has been released from prison the 
prosecutor general said wednesday 
lt leszek pekala originally was sentenced to 15 years in prison 
after a threemonth trial that ended in february 1985 but his term 
was reduced in 1987 to six years and he was freed tuesday under a 
law that allows releases after a prisoner has served twothirds of 
his sentence 
the release was confirmed at a news conference by prosecutor 
general aleksander herzog 
popieluszko a charismatic 37yearold warsaw priest whose 
sermons bolstered the solidarity labor movement when it was 
outlawed was abducted oct 19 1984 his beaten and bound body was 
pulled from an icy river 11 days later shocking the nation and 
galvanizing the anticommunist opposition 
pekala and wlademar chmielewski were found guilty of committing 
the murder with ringleader grzegorz piotrowski their superior 
adam pietruszka also was convicted 
the public was never satisfied with the determination that no 
higherups were involved in the murder or its coverup on oct 6 
the postcommunist interior ministry reopened the case by arresting 
two former police generals on charges of masterminding the slaying 
the four convicted officers all had their sentences reduced by 
the former communist authorities and chmielewski has already been 
paroled piotrowski now is serving a 15year term due to end in 
october 1999 and pietruszkas 10year sentence is to end in 
november 1994 herzog said 
the prosecutor said the government is reviewing the supreme 
court decisions reducing the sentences and some irregularities 
are being analyzed however an extraordinary reopening of the case 
would be required to reverse the sentence reductions and the 
problem is very difficult herzog said

amnesty international on wednesday urged president 
bush not to sign proposed legislation broadening use of the death 
penalty 
in a letter to the president the international human rights 
group said that if the proposal becomes law social justice may 
be simply ignored in the desire to seek vengeance 
the letter said amnesty was aware of at least 23 innocent 
people executed in the united states this century 
amnesty international is opposed to the death penalty in all 
cases based on our conviction that no authority has the right to 
deny anyone their most basic and fundamental human right the 
right to life itself the letter said 
david bull british section director of amnesty delivered the 
letter to the us embassy in london on wednesday 
the congressional proposals would extend the death penalty to 
some nonhomicidal offenses under federal law 
amnesty said such a move represents a dangerous departure from 
the us supreme court ruling in 1972 which stated that the death 
penalty would be cruel and unusual when applied to offenses which 
did not result in death 
a total of 138 people have been executed in the united states 
since the court in 1976 allowed states to resume use of the death 
penalty fifteen states have done so 
in its plea to bush amnesty referred to the selfevident 
racial bias in death penalty sentencing and the carrying out of 
such sentences 
the bush administration strongly supports the death penalty but 
it has threatened a veto over attempts by some congressmen to allow 
defendants to fight the death sentence by showing racial bias 
many opponents of the death penalty argue it is unfair because 
it is more often applied to blacks than whites 
amnesty also said studies have shown the death penalty is not an 
effective deterrent to violent crime or murder 
it further argued that execution methods are cruel and 
barbaric

a ceasefire accord signed by two of 
liberias three warring parties was rejected wednesday by the 
largest faction in the 10monthold civil war 
a spokesman for rebel leader charles taylor said the 
disagreement centered on the composition of a multinational task 
force dispatched in august to end the fighting which has claimed 
more than 5000 lives and destroyed many sections of liberias 
capital monrovia 
taylor spokesman tom woewiyu said the rebel commander wants the 
task force expanded to include soldiers of governments sympathetic 
to his movement including ivory coast and burkina faso the 
fivenation force includes troops from nigeria ghana guinea 
sierra leone and gambia 
the talks in banjul were the first time in months the three 
factions met together 
taylor is opposed by remnants of slain president samuel does 
forces who still hold the executive mansion in monrovia and a 
splinter rebel group led by prince johnson 
both groups have cooperated with the multinational force and 
approved the ceasefire agreement 
taylor invaded from ivory coast on christmas eve seeking to oust 
doe who was captured and killed sept 9 by johnsons troops 
wednesdays ceasefire agreement was negotiated after three days 
of talks mediated by the economic community of west african states 
which sent the task force to liberia 
the last attempt to end the conflict broke down in late 
september when the task force attacked taylors men for refusing to 
relinquish control of the liberian capital 
using fighter bombers and tanks the regional force has pushed 
taylors army out of the city 
but taylors rebels have overrun most of the rest of the nation 
and taylor has set up headquarters in the central city of gbarnga 
declared himself president and announced plans to hold elections 
also opposed to taylor is an interim government chosen by exiled 
liberian politicians clergymen and businessmen at a conference 
organized by the west african organization 
taylor has said he is entitled to run a temporary government as 
the spoils of war and has denounced the interim government as a 
puppet of west african governments that sent soldiers to liberia

clearly defined and diseaseprevention claims would have to be 
governmentapproved 
the bill passed by unanimous consent will go back to the 
house which passed a similar version in late july and was expected 
to accept the senates changes 
labeling will guarantee that advertising claims are supported 
by the facts and that consumers have the information they need to 
make wiser choices about their health and diet said sen edward 
kennedy dmass and chairman of the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
the bush administration has proposed foodlabeling regulations 
similar to the provisions of the legislation because the 
administration says the matter can be handled with regulations it 
has said in a policy statement that it opposes the bill however 
the administration has not threatened a veto 
the food and drug administration had hoped to issue final 
foodlabeling regulations by next spring requiring industry 
compliance a year later but because of differences between the 
legislation and the regulations have forced the fda to rework parts 
of its plan 
it will delay what we had been doing but we wont have to go 
back to square one said edward scarbrough acting director of 
the fdas office of nutrition and food science 
one difference between the proposed regulations and the 
legislation is that congress would require much of the nutrient 
labeling to be uniform nationwide the fda had requested comment on 
whether states should be allowed to supersede the federal 
regulations with stronger rules 
the center for science in the public interest gave the senate 
plan a qualified hurrah bruce silverglade legal director of 
the group said the days of misleading nutrition and health 
claims for most foods are coming to an end but he said he was 
concerned that cities and states would be unable to impose their 
own labeling requirements 
the national food processors association however was pleased 
with the uniformity requirement we did not get all we wanted in 
terms of federal preemption but we have a strong federal nutrition 
labeling law that will help maintain our national food distribution 
system and permit nationwide food label education programs he 
said 
under the senate measure the secretary of health and human 
services would set guidelines defining such labels as low salt 
and light food makers would have to adhere to the guidelines 
to use those terms 
also companies would need fda approval to make 
diseaseprevention claims 
restaurants would be exempt from the labeling requirements and 
foods such as fresh produce and seafood could provide nutrition 
labeling with a sign or brochure at the site of sale

the government of panama filed a 65 billion 
racketeering lawsuit wednesday against its former military ruler 
charging manuel noriega looted the nations treasury and tortured 
and killed his opponents 
we have long waited for justice and justice is beginning to 
happen here said eduardo vallarino panamas ambassador to the 
united states who accompanied the lawyer filing the suit we 
have a duty to the people of all the world to show that 
dictatorship and tyranny doesnt ultimately pay 
the panamanian governments lawsuit contains 11 charges against 
the toppled dictator for alleged misconduct during his 28year 
military and political career 
the lawsuit filed in us district court says noriega 
participated in assassination torture drug trafficking money 
laundering embezzlement sale of visas and passports and other 
abuses while he was head of the panama defense forces 
a process server sent by panamas attorney gregory craig failed 
wednesday in an attempt to serve papers on noriega at the 
metropolitan correctional center southwest of miami where he has 
been held on drugtrafficking charges since the december 1989 
invasion of panama 
prison spokeswoman dena davion said the process server was 
turned away for security reasons and that a judge would have to 
order the us marshals service to deliver official notice of the 
suit to noriega 
the final years of noriegas reign deflated panamas gross 
national product by 20 percent through corruption and misrule 
vallarino charged panama estimated those damages at 500 million 
which can be tripled under us racketeering law the panamanian 
government also is seeking 5 billion in punitive damages 
but vallarino who was appointed ambassador by the government of 
president guillermo endara said the damage to panama went beyond 
economics 
we are also talking about murders the ambassador said 
mentioning the bloody torture slaying of opposition leader hugo 
spadafora many other persons were blatantly and openly murdered 
in the streets of panama 
the united states holds 20 million frozen in international bank 
accounts some of which has been earmarked for noriegas criminal 
defense attorneys but craig said panama was asking for an 
injunction to stop any release of noriegas money 
the panamanian government estimated noriega earned a total of 
700000 in the military but craig said noriega still he has 300 
million to 500 million in assets that have not been attached by 
the us government 
noriega attorney jon may said the lawsuit was an attempt to 
interfere with his clients consitutional right to a fair trial 
including the right to choose and pay his own attorneys 
this isnt about money may said of the lawsuit this is 
simply an attempt to keep general noriega from having sufficient 
assets to be able to defend himself 
us attorney dexter lehtinen acknowledged a conflict existed 
over the money involved in the criminal case assigned to us 
district judge william hoeveler and the civil case assigned to us 
district judge edward davis but not an insurmountable one 
as we have said in court to judge hoeveler several times the 
united states government is not the only government that has made 
claims on that money he said when we release our claim to 
pay defense counsel here we do not of course control foreign 
governments 
lehtinen said he did not believe the lawsuit would interfere 
with noriegas criminal prosecution on drugtrafficking charges 
the criminal charges accuse noriega of turning panama into a way 
station for columbias medellin cocaine cartel and accepting 46 
million in bribes to protect their smuggling 
hoeveler has said he would not allow panamas longexpected 
lawsuit to sidetrack noriegas prosecution 
craig said he could not identify noriegas 20 codefendants in 
the civil case because they have not been served 
but previous reports listed other targets as marcos justines 
noriegas chief of staff jailed in panama city carlos duque the 
1989 presidential candidate of noriegas revolutionary democratic 
party michael harari a former israeli military officer three 
former ambassadors noriegas wife felicidad his mistress vicki 
amado and others

the soviet parliament sought to arrest the 
collapse of central authority by passing legislation wednesday 
saying its laws supercede those of conflicting measures in the 15 
soviet republics 
three republics immediately challenged the parliamentary move 
the sponsors of the national bill said it is designed to end the 
war of laws between the national and republic governments but 
there seemed to be little way to enforce it and no promise it would 
end the jurisdictional disputes 
in defending the measure soviet lawmaker yuri kalmykov was 
quoted as saying we are neither declaring war on the republics 
nor bringing pressure to bear on them 
the republics should understand that this legal act is in the 
interests of all he said according to the state news agency 
tass kalmykov is chairman of the parliamentary committee on 
legislation in the national supreme soviet the parliament 
despite his comments the two largest soviet republics russia 
and the ukraine on wednesday passed their own laws overruling 
national legislation tass said in separate dispatches 
in addition the parliament of the baltic republic of latvia 
which declared independence this year passed a law saying 
stateowned property belongs to the republic and not to the 
national government tass said 
the latvian law overturned an oct 19 decree by soviet prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov he ordered that 51 percent of 
stateowned industries and businesses be sold to workers on a 
jointstock basis and the remaining 49 percent stay in the hands of 
the national government 
in its action wednesday the russian republic legislature 
meeting in moscow gave preliminary approval to laws limiting the 
authority of the national government in the republic and abolishing 
the state monopoly on land ownership tass said 
the ukrainian legislature meeting in kiev proclaimed the 
precedence of the republics laws over national laws on ukrainian 
territory national laws will enter into force in the ukraine only 
after they are ratified by the republics parliament it said 
the fragmentation of soviet power was also deepening in the 
republic of moldavia where an emergency session of parliament was 
called for thursday tass reported 
moldavian president mircha snegur said the session was needed 
because the social and economic situation in the republic has 
reached the boiling point due to declarations of independence by 
two tiny corners of moldavia a southwestern republic the 
socalled gagauz and dneister republics are seeking to separate 
themselves from moldavia 
nearly all the 15 soviet republics have declared independence or 
autonomy from the central government in moldavia georgia and the 
russian federation smaller regions have sought to distance 
themselves from republic authorities 
the law passed wednesday by the national legislature appeared to 
be a fruitless effort suspend the constitutional crisis until 
completion of a new treaty of union that soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev is seeking to persuade the republics to negotiate 
gorbachev has had little success starting formal talks to 
replace the treaty of union which forms the legal basis of the 
national federation 
russian president boris n yeltsin and other radical reformers 
want to negotiate bilateral treaties on political and economic 
cooperation before agreeing to a new treaty of union to form a 
federation or confederation 
national legislators heatedly debated wednesdays law their 
dispute centered on a clause giving gorbachev the right to fire 
local officials who disregard national law tass said 
one house of the national legislature the council of 
nationalities approved the law without the clause the other 
house the council of the union approved it with the clause 
they later agreed on a compromise that apparently left the issue 
undecided

palestinians stayed home from jobs in israel 
wednesday as troops sealed off the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip in an effort to stem a wave of arabisraeli revenge attacks 
the latest victim a palestinian accused of stabbing two unarmed 
israeli women soldiers died wednesday of head injuries reportedly 
suffered when he was kicked and beaten by israelis after the 
attack 
in jerusalem meanwhile the death of an 18yearold palestinian 
set off a general strike in the citys arab sector 
on tuesday defense minister moshe arens ordered the 17 million 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip banned from entering 
israel where many of them work 
the ban which began wednesday was in response to a string of 
attacks on jews that left three people dead and eight wounded since 
sunday 
a 30yearold palestinian laborer was also killed and three of 
his cousins were wounded by gunshots fired from an israeli civilian 
car other arab workers driving in israel have had their cars 
stoned during the violence 
police minister roni milo said the closure of the territories 
expected to last several days was meant to teach arabs a lesson 
the state of israel must make it completely clear that we will 
not permit the attacking of jews and stabbing of women soldiers 
or civilians we will not allow this to happen without response 
he said on army radio 
in the israeli parliament legislators called for making the 
closure permanent surprisingly some of the strongest arguments 
came from leftwing politicians who normally argue for making peace 
with the arabs 
if theres any chance of reaching political dialogue its by 
disengagement of the two peoples chaim ramon a leftist member 
of the labor party told israel television 
israeli fear over the attacks was evident wednesday there was a 
reported run on gun shops and thousands of israelis called police 
to report arabs still present in israel 
sarah benjamin head of police operations in tel aviv estimated 
that she and her colleagues got 1700 such calls from the coastal 
city and its suburbs 
the palestinian accused of stabbing the two women soldiers on 
tuesday omar shawaneh 39 died at rambam hospital in haifa 
hospital officials said 
one of his victims was reported in serious but stable condition 
with a chest wound on wednesday the other suffered a superficial 
knife wound in the back 
israeli television and radio both carried accounts of israeli 
citizens who said they helped capture the suspect describing how 
he was punched kicked and beaten 
there was initial confusion over how shawaneh was injured 
because a police statement said he was questioned before being 
hospitalized and the radio said he told police he came to israel to 
carry out an attack 
but shawaneh from a west bank village near jenin was later 
reported unconscious and in critical condition in rambams 
neurosurgery ward 
northern district police spokesman danny ramati reached by 
telephone said shawanehs death was under investigation 
ramati confirmed that shawaneh was taken to a police station 
before being hospitalized but said the blows shawaneh suffered 
were from soldiers and civilians during the struggle in the field 
while he was putting up stiff resistance to arrest 
also wednesday in jerusalem faisal husseini a leading proplo 
figure was released on 2500 bail he was arrested on suspicion 
of inciting the riot that led to the oct 8 temple mount police 
shootings in which at least 19 palestinians were killed 
husseini denied any incitement saying he was trying to calm 
things down 
meanwhile salim awad khaldi died of a bullet wound to the 
chest becoming another victim of the violence on oct 8 
initial reports said he was shot in the temple mount clash but 
arab reporters and police sources later said he was wounded by 
gunfire from an israeli civilian on a nearby street 
news of his death sparked a general strike in arab east 
jerusalem 
the deaths wednesday brought to 766 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli troops and civilians in the 34month palestinian 
uprising fiftyone israelis also have been slain in the violence 
in the west bank the body of a 50yearold palestinian was 
found stabbed to death near tulkarem and arab reports said he was 
suspected of collaborating with israel during the uprising 287 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most as allegedly 
collaborators

irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh 
charged wednesday that the cia and attorney general dick thornburgh 
abused secrecy procedures to frustrate the prosecution of a former 
cia agent 
the attorney general and the cia not only frustrated the 
public development of evidence against former cia agent joseph 
fernandez but did so in a manner that exasperated the district 
court and dragged out the resolution of this issue in unproductive 
litigation walsh said in a rpeort on the case 
walsh issued his report nearly two weeks after thornburgh 
formally ended the prosecution by stating he would not withdraw his 
affidavit blocking the release of secrets the judge ruled fernandez 
was entitled to disclose in the case 
on oct 12 the attorney general stuck by a previous decision 
blocking the release of documents showing the location o cia 
facilities in central america and detailing agency operations in 
costa rica the justice department quoted an administration 
official as saying release of such information would strike a 
devastating blow to national security 
the judge in the case had ruled that fernandez former cia 
station chief in costa rica was entitled to disclose the 
information to defend himself against charges he lied about his 
role in helping ship arms to the nicaraugan rebels 
thornburghs action marked the first time that an attorney 
general had invoked a provision of the classified information 
procedures act to block a prosecution 
it capped a 15month legal battle during which walsh charged 
thornburgh forced two fruitless appeals to the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals in richmond va on secrecy issues 
the appellate court in september upheld us district judge 
claude hiltons dismissal of the charges because thornburgh had 
refused to allow fernandez to use evidence needed to defend 
himself 
if the information could not be revealed without grave damage 
why did he force two appeals rather than reach this conclusion 15 
months ago if the potential danger is as he reports 
devastating why did he promise to reconsider his decision if the 
dismissal of the case was affirmed on appeal walsh wrote 
the bush administrations actions in the irancontra cases 
underscore the need for objective standards to govern the release 
of classified information in criminal prosecutions walsh said 
this is particularly true when there is an appearance of 
conflict of interest because the agency refusing disclosure is 
itself a subject of investigation walsh said in a reference to 
his continuing probe of cia involvement in the irancontra affair 
and the subsequent coverup 
walsh called disingenuous thornburghs assertion the 
independent counsels strategy in dealing with the classified 
information problems forced him to block the release of all 
secrets 
a justice department letter to congress released wednesday 
said that walshs acquiesence to a court review of categories of 
documents rather than an itembyitem examination of the material 
complicated thornburghs decision 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for walsh said that when thornburgh 
filed his affidavit last november blocking the release of secrets 
he did not object to the categorybycategory procedure 
belcher said walshs office did not acquiesce in the 
categorybycategory rulings suggested by hilton we 
strenuously argued for specific review of documents after the 
categories were ruled on she said 
the justice department letter also noted that those who are 
familiar with the case asset it as a relatively weak one which 
would not have been brought had fernandez been willing to cooperate 
with the investigation 
we obviously disagree that it was a weak case said mary 
belcher a spokeswoman for walsh

the budget bills in congress are designed to 
reign in deficit spending which if unchecked would add more than 
1 trillion to the national debt in the next five years 
that would continue the pattern of the 1980s during which the 
treasury was forced to triple its borrowing the national debt is 
now 3195 trillion 
the white house estimates the deficit for the current fiscal 
year which began oct 1 will be 294 billion dollars the budget 
legislation before congress would trim that by roughly 40 billion 
so only another 254 billion will get added to the longterm debt

the air force general named to replace the 
chief of staff fired for public comments about us contingency 
plans against iraq said wednesday his friend made an honest 
mistake 
gen merrill a mcpeak told the senate armed services committee 
his colleague erred in discussing issues within the presidents 
bailiwick and speaking on the record with news reporters for 15 
hours straight 
defense secretary dick cheney fired gen michael dugan on sept 
17 one day after dugans statements about contingency plans to 
unleash massive air raids on iraq and target saddam hussein 
personally appeared in several newspapers 
cheney said dugan had violated pentagon rules by publicly 
discussing likely military targets inside iraq and disclosing 
classified information about the size of us forces in the gulf 
area 
it was an honest mistake on his part nevertheless a mistake 
ill certainly seek to avoid making the same mistake mcpeak told 
the panel at his confirmation hearing 
lawmakers indicated no opposition to the nominee a 54yearold 
native of santa rosa calif who is commanderinchief of forces 
in the pacific region 
while serving as a fighter pilot in 1961 mcpeak said he struck 
up a friendship with dugan a fellow lieutenant mike dugan is 
probably my closest friend in the us air force mcpeak said 
the nominee backed a number of steps dugan took during his brief 
term in particular his attempts to improve frosty relations 
between the air force and congress and the media 
i think he was right about an awful lot of things he started 
to do during his tenure as chief in particular his initiative 
toward greater openness mcpeak said i endorse that 
the air force general said dugan made a mistake in expressing 
an opinion about military options that are really a decision for 
the president to make 
dugan remains at the pentagon as a special assistant to air 
force secretary donald rice he is currently overseeing studies on 
the future needs for pilots and navigators as well as the officer 
evaluation system

jews and roman catholics met to pay homage 
to a nearly disappeared culture wednesday capping the event by 
attending a stirring concert in a synagogue scarred by neglect and 
nazi defacement 
being here and listening to the music of our people is a way 
to tell the world that we go on living said irene weingarten a 
certified public accountant from houston one of about 250 american 
jews who flew to krakow a southern polish city rich in jewish 
history to attend the event 
gilbert levine maestro of the krakow philharmonic orchestra 
conducted the concert inside the temple postepowa a 100yearold 
synagogue virtually unused since world war ii 
polands jewish community which once numbered 35 million was 
nearly wiped out by the holocaust despite the fact that fewer than 
10000 jews remain antisemitism has resurfaced in recent months 
pope john paul ii archbishop of krakow before being named 
pontiff in 1978 heartily endorsed the concert as a vehicle for 
reconciliation between the faiths said levine who was received by 
the pope at the vatican 
the chief of krakows tiny jewish congregation czeslaw 
jakobowicz said he found the concert sad but very nice 
you know we all lived together catholics and jews in this 
society for hundreds of years jakobowicz said there is no 
reason it cant be like it used to be 
levine said several highranking church officials had been 
invited to the conciliatory event for two faiths including krakow 
archbishop franciszek marcharski but local priests were the 
highest church representatives in attendance 
a letter from macharski read before the concert quoted john 
pauls words we are all children of the same god it closed 
with shalom the hebrew word for peace 
the program opened with the national anthems of poland the 
united states and israel followed by the kol nidre a traditional 
lament of jews sung during the yom kippur holiday 
the program also included works of beethoven bruch and dvorak 
the dark apricot walls and gold filigree arches and columns of 
temple postempowa reflected five decades of neglect but the 
concerts audience of 400 people sharing the small space with the 
orchestra was moved by the music many wiped away tears 
before the concert members of both faiths joined to raise a 
star of david atop the synagogue replacing one torn down by the 
gestapo in november 1939 
this will be a concert of rememberance because you cant 
forget what happened in poland 50 years ago and of hope for 
reconciliation said levine who has headed the philharmonic 
since 1987 the first american to direct an orchestra in eastern 
europe 
only a handful of jews live in krakow today their average age 
is 70 the synagogue stands in a neighborhood that has had a jewish 
presence since the 1300s 
in recent years catholicjewish relations in poland have been 
strained by the presence of carmelite nuns at the auschwitz 
concentration camp 36 miles from krakow 
over jewish protests the nuns built a convent adjoining the 
camp where 15 million jews were murdered by the nazis the church 
first promised to remove the convent in 1987 and renewed the 
promise last year but so far it has not done so 
this year also has witnessed antisemitic acts in newly 
democratized poland as well as elsewhere in eastern europe nazi 
slogans and antijewish slurs have appeared on bus stops and even 
the memorial at umschlagplatz the site in warsaw where hundreds of 
thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps 
levine whose grandfather emigrated from warsaw in 1895 and 
whose wifes mother survived auschwitz said the concert presented 
an opportunity to overcome some of the bitterness that has 
overshadowed recent dialogue between catholics and jews in poland 
music can serve a tremendously important purpose to wordlessly 
express emotions levine said but you have to have hope and a 
desire for reconciliation and for dialogue that at least goes some 
of the way toward achieving it

the senate on wednesday approved a 155 
billion foreign aid bill that includes a cut in el salvadors 
military aid and debt forgiveness for egypt after an abortion 
controversy over the bill evaporated 
the senate voted 7623 for the bill sending it to negotiations 
to work out differences with a housepassed version 
since last week the measure had been stalled because of a 
dispute over whether to reverse a 6yearold policy that bars us 
aid to international population control agencies that offer 
abortion as an option 
sen tim wirth dcolo ended his push for the change in the 
face of a filibuster threat by antiabortion forces including sen 
william armstrong rcolo wirth did not want to jeopardize the 
entire foreign aid bill in the waning days of the 101st congress 
an aide said 
the bill provides aid to us friends and allies around the 
world including 3 billion for israel and 21 billion for egypt 
the two biggest recipients 
both the house and the senate versions of the bill include a 50 
percent cut in military aid to el salvador intended to give 
incentives to both the government and the leftist fmln rebels to 
end their decadelong civil war with a negotiated settlement 
the bills provide that military aid would be cut to half its 
current level of 85 million in the fiscal year that began oct 1 
if the rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
walk away from unsponsored peace talks the aid could be 
restored but if the government fails to pursue peace it could 
lose the other half of its military aid 
the language represents a major change in us policy toward el 
salvador which has received aid at a rate of nearly 1 million a 
day in recent years bushs top advisers have threatened to veto 
any bill that contained such an aid cut 
but the bill also contains a powerful incentive for the 
president to sign forgiveness of 67 billion in past military 
loans egypt owes the united states bush has sought to erase the 
debt as a reward to egypt which has been among the staunchest us 
allies in opposing iraqs occupation of kuwait 
administration officials have argued that a substantial reward 
is due president hosni mubarak who took a serious political risk 
by leading arab opposition to iraq mubaraks continued tenure 
could well depend on a tangible american gesture they contended 
in addition to the cash aid for israel the senate version of 
the bill also included authority for the president to give israel 
at least 700 million worth of pentagon weaponry 
that provision was pushed by supporters of israel who argued it 
was needed because of the increased threat to that country from 
iraq and the increased costs of israels high military alert it 
also appeared designed to counterbalance the likely debt 
forgiveness for egypt and a 75 billion arms sale approved for 
saudi arabia 
in other action on spending bills the senate and house approved 
and sent to president bush a 193 billion bill providing fiscal 
1991 money for the departments of commerce justice and state and 
for the judiciary branch 
the measure includes full payment of us dues to the united 
nations as well as 20 percent of dues that had been withheld in 
prior years because of us dissatisfaction with the world body it 
also includes 105 million for prosecution of savings and loan 
scandal cases and 694 million for the drug enforcement agency

leftist rebels on wednesday shot to death an 
army officer on the joint military command near his house in this 
capital defense sources said 
in ayacucho the andean city where maoist shining path rebels 
launched their movement the government lifted a state of 
emergency it was imposed in december 1982 
the military sources said lt col oscar caballero castillo was 
gunned down as he was getting into his car near his house in a 
middleclass lima neighborhood 
the sources said they were unsure which of perus two guerrilla 
groups killed caballero at least three rebels including a woman 
took part in the attack they said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the assassination however was typical of the shining path the 
much smaller tupac amaru revolutionary movement has not committed 
many assassinations 
caballero was shot in the head neck and leg he died in a 
military hospital hours after the attack 
before being assigned to the joint military command in lima the 
42yearold officer served in ayacucho 
though the state of emergency was lifted there the measure was 
extended in rural areas surrounding the city as well as in nine 
other departments more than half of perus population of 22 
million people live under a military state of emergency 
under the measure authorities can restrict the freedom to 
travel and assemble they can also detain people without hearings 
and search houses without warrant 
violence has decreased drastically in ayacucho the last three 
years as the shining path spread its operations into other parts of 
the country the rebels are now thought to base many of their 
andean operations in huancayo 120 miles east of lima 
another rebel stronghold is the upper huallaga valley rebels 
there receive guns and money in exchange for allowing drug 
traffickers to operate in the cocarich area 
more than 20000 peruvians have died in political violence in 
the 10 years since the shining path first took up arms

a committee revising prayers and rituals for the 
united methodist church disagrees about whether to refer to god as 
anything but a masculine deity a bishop told the churchs high 
court on wednesday 
bishop susan morrison of philadelphia asked the churchs 
judicial council to rule on petitions from the committee revising 
the book of worship ms morrison heads the committee 
a minority of committee members disagree with proposals to 
replace the existing reference to the trinity as father son and 
holy spirit with such nongender specific references as 
creator redeemer and sustainer ms morrison said 
were honoring the trinity language said ms morrison who 
sides with the majority but in other places sometimes we use 
father and other times we use other biblical metaphors such as 
creator 
we dont want to use any one image of god sometimes we use 
female images such as the mother who nurtures her young she 
said 
the church which has nearly 9 million members is revising its 
official book of worship for the first time in 20 years 
each congregation would be allowed to decide whether to use 
traditional references to god or to adopt the references included 
in the revised book of worship ms morrison said 
the judicial council made up of five lawyers and four 
ministers asked few questions about the debate during the 
hearing the council was expected to meet again within several 
days 
council members indicated that at that time they could delay a 
final decision until next year when the churchs general assembly 
is expected to rule on the matter

congressional negotiators faced several key 
tax issues wednesday night as they worked on a compromise 
deficitreduction bill 
here are some of them according to a proposed compromise 
incorporating elements from both parties 
exact figures could change in the course of further 
negotiations 
rates the 28 percent top income tax rate on the wealthiest 
600000 americans likely would be raised to 31 percent they would 
get a tax increase effective rates could even be higher depending 
on exemptions and deductions about 4 million couples and 
individuals who now pay a top rate of 33 percent would pay a 
maximum 31 percent and get a tax cut 
deductions a couple or individual could write off only 97 
percent of otherwise allowable itemized deductions on any portion 
of adjusted gross income exceeding 100000 thus a highincome 
taxpayer would lose 300 in deductions for each 10000 of income 
above 100000 this has the effect of raising the top marginal tax 
rate on those people to 32 percent 
exemptions benefits from the 2050 personal exemption allowed 
each taxpayer and dependent would be reduced as taxable income 
exceeds 100000 for single people and 150000 for childless 
couples filing a joint return the exemption would be fully lost 
once income tops 225000 for single individuals or 275000 for a 
couple filing jointly 
each exemption lost would raise the effective marginal tax rate 
by onehalf percentage point the bigger the family the higher 
their marginal rate thus a couple with two children would pay a 
top rate of 34 percent on part of their income the regular 31 
percent rate plus 1 percentage point because of the limit on 
deductions and 2 points by losing their exemptions 
capital gains the maximum tax rate on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of assets such as investments would be 28 
percent even though wages and other income would be taxed as high 
as 31 percent this would benefit those who pay a top 33 percent 
rate on income including capital gains under present law 
gasoline the 9centagallon tax would be increased by 5 or 6 
cents 
alcohol negotiators already have settled on higher taxes on 
alcoholic beverages tobacco airplane tickets furs and jewlery 
and expensive cars

global warming will create food shortages that 
could eventually drive up prices by as much as 20 percent a 
leading climate expert said wednesday 
climatologist martin parry a member of the unsponsored 
intergovernmental panel on climate change forecast that higher 
temperatures and drier conditions will reduce food production 
globally by an average of 5 to 10 percent 
his report climate change and world agriculture was put 
out by earthscan a publisher of books on third world issues 
poverty and the environment 
the nearly 1 billion people who already suffer from 
malnutrition and famines would face an even greater threat to 
their survival from the combined effects of decreased agricultural 
production and the effects of higher prices for imported 
food parry told reporters at a news conference at the royal 
geographic society 
parry said farming production could fall as much as 30 percent 
in the midlatitude breadbasket regions of the world such as the 
midwestern united states canadian prairies northern european 
lowlands soviet ukraine and argentine pampas 
the regions most at risk however are those least able to cope 
such as north and west africa central america southeast asia and 
eastern brazil parry said 
his report was released five days before delegates from 100 
nations meet in geneva at the second world climate conference to 
discuss what to do about reducing carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases 
such gases increase the atmospheres ability to trap heat like 
a greenhouse 
hundreds of the worlds top scientists working on the 
unsponsored climate panel have concluded that if the world 
continues emitting the gases at the current rate global avrrage 
temperatures could rise a couple degrees over the next four 
decades 
but the actual temperature increase might be even higher in some 
regions with the largest rises in higher latitudes said parry a 
professor at birmingham university 
in the wheat and maize regions of europe and north america 
production could be cut by 20 percent with a 2 degree centigrade 
rise in temperature 
the result could be increased costs of food for consumers in 
those regions smaller cereal crops for export and higher prices 
in the world cereal market

a tree trimmer suffocated under a heavy palm 
fronds that fell on him as he working 25 feet up in the tree 
authorities said wednesday 
neighbors heard the mans screams for help but he died by the 
time rescuers were able to free him and get him to the ground about 
80 minutes later fire officials said 
reynaldo medrano 36 was working alone tuesday afternoon on a 
palm tree in a back yard said fire capt kevin boyle medrano died 
of suffocation the maricopa county medical examiner office said 
wednesday 
firefighters used a ladder to reach medrano who initially was 
conscious but struggling to breathe boyle said 
a ring of cut fronds possibily weighing hundreds of pounds had 
slipped down like a hula skirt said boyle the weight kept 
medrano pinned even after firefighters had cut his safety chain 
he said 
by then the captain said medrano was falling in and out of 
consciousness by the time rescuers got him to the ground he was 
dead 
falling palm fronds suffocated two workers in separate accidents 
in 1987 one in phoenix and the other in suburban scottsdale 
palm fronds grow to six feet or more in length and resemble a 
huge fan blade

the magellan spacecraft found that 
600milewide circular features on venus are milehigh volcanic 
bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet a 
scientist said wednesday 
from a birdseyeview the bulges look like nested sets of 
concentric rings called coronas the rings are ridges and valleys 
that form huge circles numerous volcanoes and lava flows dot the 
coronas 
the coronas are formed by the same kind of upwelling of 
underground plumes of molten rock that created the hawaiian 
islands said ellen stofan a geologist at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
theyre definitely formed by some sort of thermal pulse from 
the interior of the planet that lasts hundreds of millions of 
years she said 
in 1983 and 1984 the soviet venera 15 and 16 spacecraft 
identified about 30 coronas that measure from 75 miles to more than 
600 miles across but the venera orbiters couldnt determine if 
they were upward bulges or depressions in the ground caused by the 
impacts of gargantuan meteorites 
magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated 
radar which makes much more detailed pictures and also is able to 
calculate surface topography it found five more coronas and 
determined they rise as much as one mile above the surrounding 
terrain stofan said that shows they are hot spots rather than 
impact craters 
one corona thats 150 miles wide seems to be in the early stages 
of bulging upward suggesting that some of its small volcanic domes 
and lava flows may be actively erupting she said 
magellan wont be able to confirm the presence of active 
volcanoes until the middle of next year when it passes over the 
same part of venus a second time and can look for landscape changes 
resulting from any ongoing eruptions 
nasa engineers meanwhile said the sun will almost block 
earths view of magellan and venus on nov 1 when venus the sun 
and earth will be oriented in almost a straight line 
that will cause a nineday halt starting sometime between 
saturday and monday in magellans use of radar to peer through 
venus clouds and map the planet said phil allin administrative 
assistant to magellans project manager 
the astronomical lineup called superior conjunction also 
may make nasa completely lose contact with magellan for up to three 
days although engineers disagree on whether that will happen 
allin said 
the sun wont completely block earths view of venus and 
magellan during the planetary lineup but activity from the sun 
already has impaired some communications he said 
engineers twice lost touch with magellan in august due to a 
yetunidentified problem if that happens again when the 
venussunearth alignment also makes communication difficult or 
impossible we worry about how quickly we would get things back 
to normal allin said 
magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 and arrived at the second planet from the sun on aug 10

prime minister yitzhak shamir rejected 
president bushs appeal to cooperate with a un probe of the 
slayings of 19 palestinians and avoid a second antiisrael vote by 
the security council israel television reported wednesday 
later wednesday the united states and other security council 
members voted 150 to rebuke israel for its refusal to support the 
investigation of the oct 8 shootings it was the second vote 
against israel the past 10 days by the united states which in the 
past normally exercised its veto and shielded israel from un 
censure 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner could not immediately be reached 
for comment 
the television referring to a letter from bush that was 
delivered tuesday to shamir said shamir sees no possibility of 
changing his position 
shamirs cabinet voted last week to refuse to cooperate with a 
un probe into the killings 
the cabinet said cooperating with the un mission would 
compromise israels rule over the city including the arab sectors 
israel annexed following the 1967 middle east war 
if we put a loophole in our claim to sovereignty in jerusalem 
the arabs will exploit it at every future opportunity the 
television said quoting an unnamed government official israel 
captured the arab sectors of jerusalem in 1967 
the television quoting unnamed sources in washington also said 
bush in the letter begged shamir to accept at least a 
personal envoy from un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
this would compromise a security council resolution ordering a 
threemember delegation to investigate the slayings 
the television report did not say whether shamir gave bush a 
written reply or conveyed his message via diplomatic channels 
israel is conducting its own investigation into the shooting 
deaths of at least 19 palestinians by jerusalem police during a 
riot at the temple mount a site holy to moslems and jews the 
results are expected to be published later in the week 
jerusalem a focal point of the arabisraeli conflict is home 
to 350000 jews and 150000 arabs

the senate decisively rejected a move 
wednesday to slap tough new antiobscenity curbs on the national 
endowment for the arts and voted instead to penalize artists whose 
federally subsidized works are deemed obscene by the courts 
ignoring charges by sen jesse helms rnc that the endowment 
is financing obscenity produced by sleazeballs at the 
taxpayers expense the senate approved scrapping current 
restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal support 
on a 7324 roll call the senate embraced a bipartisan 
compromise offered by sen orrin hatch rutah that would require 
the endowment to recoup its money from grant recipients who are 
subsequently convicted of violating obscenity or child pornography 
laws 
guilty artists would be barred from receiving any new federal 
grants for three years 
the house approved a similar proposal last week as part of its 
119 billion version of a fiscal 1991 appropriations bill for the 
interior department and several other federal agencies including 
the nea the forest service the smithsonian institution and some 
energy department programs 
the senate version totaling 117 billion and including the nea 
compromise was approved wednesday night on a 926 roll call 
the senate bill contains 170 million for the arts endowment 5 
million less than president bush had requested and a slight 
reduction from the neas 171 million budget last year the house 
had voted to boost endowment spending to 180 million 
differences between the two measures will have to be reconciled 
by house and senate negotiators before a final bill is sent to the 
president for his signature 
hatch said his proposal was aimed at protecting taxpayer funds 
and artists freedom of expression at the same time 
he said congress must continue to encourage artistic excellence 
and diversity through the federal arts agency and i believe we 
can do this without compromising the bounds of good taste 
earlier on a 7029 roll call the senate rejected a helms 
amendment that would have forbidden the endowment to finance works 
that depict or describe in a patently offensive way sexual or 
excretory activities or organs 
helms argued that his proposal was aimed at halting this 
slime this sleaze allegedly produced by artists who receive 
federal grants 
the american people are darn well sick of this said helms 
who grabbed the spotlight as the senate began debate on a proposed 
170 million appropriation for the fedeal arts agency in the 1991 
fiscal year which began oct 1 
what is really at stake is whether or not america will allow 
the cultural high ground in this nation to sink slowly into an 
abyss of slime to placate people who clearly seek or are willing to 
destroy the judaicchristian foundations of this republic he 
said 
before the fight was over the senate approved a helms proposal 
to forbid the nea to support any work that denigrates the objects 
or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion 
but helms was defeated by voice vote in an a separate attempt to 
block endowment grants to affluent artists which his formula 
defined as any individual whose annual income is 94665 or more 
during the debate helms was backed by sen gordon humphrey 
rnh who proposed abolishing the endowment for what he called 
its subsidies of frivolity and decadence at a time when 
congress is struggling to reduce huge budget deficits 
opposing the helms amendment hatch and sen claiborne pell 
dri said it would amount to prior restraint on endowment grant 
recipients and probably would be ruled unconstitutional 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said that at a time when the 
walls of oppression are falling in eastern europe it would be 
shameful to erect new barriers to freedom of expression in 
america 
we must resist the call to censorship kennedy said 
helms read his colleagues a list of offensive paintings and 
theater performances he accused the endowment of subsidizing he 
said they included a woman who performed disgusting live sex 
acts on a new york stage and an artist who portrayed homosexuals 
engaged in ultimate excretory acts with one another 
helms said senators who voted for his amendment would be 
voting against the vilest most crudest material or the funding 
of it 
he said his ban would not censor artists but only order them not 
to try to dip into the public trough to pay for it 
the emotional floor battle over the obscene art issue was 
fought over the senate appropriations bill that earmarked nearly 6 
billion for the interior department its biggest beneficiary it 
omits a houseapproved oneyear moratorium on oil and gas leasing 
in many sections of federal offshore waters of the outer 
continental shelf 
on tuesday night the senate rejected a move to bypass the 
endangered species act so logging could continue in pacific 
northwest forest regardless of the impact on the threatened 
northern spotted owl and also rejected a move to cut the forest 
service roadbuilding effort in half 
the only votes against the bill came from helms humphrey and 
sens christopher bond rmo alan dixon dill charles 
grassley riowa and william roth jr rdel 
sens mark hatfield rore and rudy boschwitz rminn did 
not vote 
the current obscenity ban adopted a year ago under pressure 
from helms and his conservative allies forbids endowment financing 
of works that may be considered obscene including depictions 
of homoeroticism sadomasochism the sexual exploitation of 
children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
the senate bill also would allow endowment chairman john e 
frohnmayer to continue his requirement that grant recipients sign a 
pledge not to produce obscene work the pledge has caused 
widespread protests among artists and resulted in three lawsuits 
challenging its constitutionality 
by contrast the house voted to ban frohnmayers pledge and to 
omit any explicit antiobscenity restrictions

attempted murder for setting a 12yearold boy on fire after 
forcing him into the basement of an abandoned building and binding 
him to a pipe 
the victim david opont survived but will be scarred for life 
the 14yearold defendant whose name was withheld because of 
his age was found guilty under juvenile law of attempted murder 
kidnapping assault robbery and attempted robbery following a 
nonjury trial before judge joseph a esquirol jr 
there could be no other conclusion than he secreted david 
tied him hand and foot and he set him onfire the judge said he 
said the boy intended to and did in fact severely and permanently 
disfigure david 
the teenager could be locked up in a juvenile hall for three 
years but the sentence could be extended each year until he was 
21 he was also ordered to undergo a series of psychological tests 
the march 7 incident was a shock to the city and evoked an 
outpouring of sympathy and getwell messages from across the 
country while in the hospital david was visited by former 
president reagan the rev jesse jackson and entertainment and 
sports figures 
the defendant who is large for his age sat impassively at 
wednesdays hearing occasionally wagging his head from side to 
side during the hourlong proceeding he was returned to the 
spofford juvenile detention center in the bronx where he has been 
held since his arrest on the evening after the attack 
david and his parents werent in the courtroom when the judge 
returned his verdict 
the boy later issued a statement through his family that he was 
glad to finally put the attack behind him 
i am looking forward to my life and all the challenge it 
brings the statement said 
at the trial david identified his attacker and testified the 
bully had accosted him and his friends a day earlier on a street in 
their neighborhood in the borough of brooklyn on the morning he 
was burned david said the same boy stopped him and a companion as 
they walked to school and searched their pockets for money 
the older boy then made david go with him into an abandoned 
building bound his hands behind him and set him on fire after 
david refused to smoke something the assailant offered him david 
testified 
david who moved with his family from haiti two years ago 
suffered severe burns over much of his body and was initially given 
less than a 50 percent chance of survival after several skin grafs 
and a strong recovery he was released from the hospital in august 
he is still undergoing rehabilitation and will always bear scars 
from the attack the judge said 
police initially said david had been torched because he refused 
to smoke crack with his assailant but they later said robbery was 
the motive for the attack 
the teenager was known in his neighborhood as a vicious bully 
who taunted smaller children and stole their lunch money and other 
property

galen cook figures glacier ice from his native 
alaska is just what hawiians and their guests need to keep cool 
or at least to keep their drinks cool 
cook has shipped 25 tons of glacier ice to honolulu to test the 
market 
the citys waikiki resort area was an ideal test site because of 
the large number of japanese tourists cook said glacier ice 
became a popular novelty item in japan a couple years ago 
glacier ice compressed over thousands of years has a clear 
prismlike sparkle and is denser than ice produced by refrigerators 
or ice machines cook said 
the density means it melts more slowly and doesnt water down 
drinks as quickly as regular ice cubes he said 
the product has been well received by customers who say it 
doesnt change the taste of their drinks said sean ellis food and 
beverage manager of the sheraton moana surfrider hotel 
the sheraton was cooks first big customer he has since 
contracted with another waikiki hotel and a nightclub 
cook charges 1 per pound for the ice which raises the cost of 
drinks by about 15 cents a glass ellis said 
cook said he doesnt know of any other vendors of glacier ice 
and his main competition is the ice machine which can provide 
large quantities of ice faster and more cheaply 
cooks partner al schafer has a permit from the state of 
alaska to harvest the freefloating ice that falls from a glacier 
near seward cook said 
the idea came from a term paper cook wrote at chaminade 
university where he is working on a masters degree in business 
administration 
this is an exercise in marketing mystique cook said its 
from alaska its from a glacier and its from a different time 
zone

government of largescale voterigging in what most analysts and 
opinion polls predicted would be a close contest 
this election is a fraud ms bhutto said fighting back 
tears

shes a sore loser said hussein haqqani a spokesman for 
the caretaker government shes finding it hard to accept that 
shes no longer on the pedestal and that she is no longer the 
heroine of democracy after a few days shell have to accept it 
ms bhutto herself ran for two seats she overwhelmingly won 
reelection in larkana in southern sind province but suffered a

a 12yearold girl was found 
locked in a filthy closet and her parents were charged wednesday 
with child endangerment for allegedly keeping her confined most of 
her life police said 
the girl was found monday night in a reeking cockroachinfested 
closet kept closed by a bent nail said sgt jenifer kauffman 
joseph and sandra sauceda were charged with felony child 
endangerment and the father also was charged with felony child 
abuse ms kauffman said 
police were tipped by a relative when they asked the saucedas 
to show them the girl they took officers to the closet ms 
kauffman said 
officers said the girl was lying in her own feces and wore a 
urinestained sweatsuit 
obviously its a terrible traumatic condition said sgt 
bob evans it will probably take years to recover from 
the couple was held in this city 60 miles east of los angeles in 
lieu of 50000 bail each arraignment was set for thursday 
the girl and her six brothers and sisters ages 2 months to 15 
years were turned over to the county child protective services 
there was no evidence that the other children were abused ms 
kauffman said 
police said they didnt know why the girl apparently was singled 
out for alleged abuse 
joseph sauceda 33 denied that he and his 31yearold wife 
abused their daughter he said te closet was not a cell and that 
his family was a loving one 
my other girl was playing with her and i guess she locked it 
by accident he said in an interview at the county jail tuesday 
police said the child whose name was withheld was unusually 
thin and bruised after being kept in a 4footby5foot closet in a 
back bedroom 
investigators believe the child rarely left the closet and 
probably had been kept locked up at other homes where the family 
lived during the past decade ms kauffman said 
police based their belief on comments from relatives and other 
evidence at the home she said 
she was apparently taken out on occasion but it was not a 
consistent activity ms kauffman said for example recently 
she was taken out once a day to go to the bathroom and do some 
chores 
although malnourished and slightly bruised the girl was in 
fairly good shape she added 
the discovery shocked arresting officers 
this little girl really got to me i normally dont get 
emotional but what i saw there i was not able to tolerate 
said cpl steve filson a 13year police veteran 
both myself and my partner there virtually gagged when the 
room was opened there was a very strong urine smell 
neighbors were stunned 
this is making me sick said 18yearold joann banchetto 
they were good people i never saw them beat their kids theyve 
always treated their kids right 
but ms banchetto said some things didnt seem right 
they said they had seven kids ms banchetto said but we 
always saw only six when youd talk to them they would barely 
peek out of their window 
the saucedas had rented the home for at least seven months 
neighbors said 
neighbor lorina finley said she once heard a young girls plea 
for food 
i heard a lot of screaming and crying in there she was just 
crying im hungry im hungry she said 
ms finley said she also heard joseph sauceda shout shut 
up

israel rejected an appeal by president bush to 
cooperate with a united nations investigation prompting another 
us vote against israel in the un security council us 
officials and other sources said wednesday 
the vote was on a resolution deploring israels rejection of the 
inquiry into the slaying of 19 palestinian arabs on the temple 
mount us officials declining to be identified said all other 
members of the security council were notified ahead of time that 
the united states would not veto the resolution 
the vote was 150 in the security council marking the second 
time in 10 days the united states voted against its ally 
the resolution was sponsored primarily by yemen and other 
nonaligned nations a us veto would have killed the resolution 
the us decision shows the growing rift between two friendly 
governments 
the united states through the years mostly stood by israel in 
rebuffing attacks on its policies and actions in the united 
nations but after 19 palestinians were killed by israeli police in 
a riot oct 8 the united states drafted a resolution condemning 
israel and calling for an investigation under the supervision of 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the israeli cabinet declined to cooperate 
bush on tuesday sent a letter to israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir appealing for cooperation with the investigation us 
officials and other sources said wednesday 
while the israeli leader did not reply in writing it was made 
clear to american diplomats in washington and in jerusalem that 
israels position had not changed the sources told the associated 
press 
israels initial decision to rebuff the un inquiry was based 
on two principles that still stand said the sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
they were that the un security council had already reached its 
conclusions condemning israel before making a factual judgment 
and that the inquiry conflicts with israels sovereignty the 
sources said 
this position was conveyed to us ambassador william brown who 
delivered bushs letter tuesday in jerusalem and by zalman shoval 
the new israeli ambassador in meetings in washington with brent 
scowcroft the presidents national security adviser robert 
kimmitt the undersecretary of state for political affairs and 
dennis b ross head of the policy planning staff of the state 
department 
the letter represented a lastditch attempt by bush to persuade 
israel to admit the investigators lest it face sterner treatment 
from the un security council 
israeli television reporting on the letter quoted unidentified 
sources in washington as saying bush begged shamir to accept at 
least a personal envoy from the secretarygeneral 
the united states was the principal drafter of the initial 
resolution which condemned israel for the oct 8 slayings the 
israeli government has initiated its own investigation 
the sources declining to be identified confirmed an account of 
bushs letter published in the new york newspaper newsday later 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman confirmed 
bush had written to shamir about the un inquiry 
she said bush also expressed condolences about the violence 
between israelis and palestinian arabs and told shamir it was 
important to all of us to have the focus back on iraq 
she said if israel complied there would be no point in having a 
second resolution approved 
if prime minister shamir agreed to let the secretarygenerals 
mission come in it would make null and void the necessity of having 
a second resolution she said 
the palestinians were slain after police used tear gas and 
rubber bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the stoning of 
jews praying at the western wall the attack on the jews was not 
condemned in the resolution 
the administration in urging israel to cooperate with the 
inquiry says it is the only way for the facts to be sorted out 
a us official insisting on anonymity said if shamir refused 
to cooperate the mood of the council will be less solicitous than 
if they did 
however he said no resolutions apart from the renewed request 
had been prepared for council action 
among israels reasons for rejecting the investigators is 
concern the united nations is trying to get a foothold in 
jerusalem the nations capital east jerusalem the older 
predominantly arab section of the city ruled by jordan for 19 
years was captured by israeli forces in the 1967 mideast war and 
annexed 
the united states and nearly all other nations do not recognize 
israeli sovereignty over east jerusalem 
several jews and arabs have been killed and wounded in the city 
since the oct 8 melee israeli defense minister moshe arens on 
tuesday barred palestinians from traveling to israel from the west 
bank and gaza which were also held by the arabs until israels 
victory in the 1967 sixday war 
ms tutwiler said we hope that the situation will rapidly 
calm down so these measures can be lifted and israelis and 
palestinians can go about their lives in peace and security as 
they both deserve

pinochet had confirmed the participation of army personnel in 
the illegal scheme details of which were unavailable news reports 
said hundreds of officers lost money

humphrey the wayward whale swam under the 
golden gate bridge wednesday and headed toward the open sea ending 
a fourday visit that saw one wrong turn after another 
the 45ton humpback whale passed under the span about 5 pm 
escorted by a flotilla of small boats coast guard vessels and 
private cruisers 
people on the bridge cheered as humphrey swam by 
he headed back to the ocean where he belongs a day after he was 
freed from a stranding on mud flats along the shore of san 
francisco bay 
for a time the mammoth mammal seemed to be reenacting his 1985 
tour of san francisco bay then the wayward whale was tracked by 
legions of wellwishers as he meandered far from the open ocean 
where he belongs for 25 days 
anxious rescuers tracked the whale through the day as he seemed 
to be headed anywhere but out to sea first he was seen south of 
the bridge then away to the north 
rescuers mobilized to intercept the 45ton whale and try to 
induce him to head out to sea she said after the 40foot humphrey 
was freed from the mud flat tuesday evening he seemed to have 
gotten his bearings raising hopes he would join the rest of his 
kind which feed in the bay sometimes but seldom stay for long 
he was swimming well and going toward the golden gate 
denize springer of the california marine mammal center said early 
in the day well he wasnt really going in just one direction 
whales tend to meander 
humphrey for some reason attracted to san francisco bay has a 
history of meandering 
in 1985 when the news media gave him his name he went through 
the bay and up the sacramento river with much of the nation 
tracking his wanderings 
on sunday humphrey veered off course again turning left into 
san francisco bay as his fellow migrating whales continued south 
along the west coast 
he spnnt about 24 hours stuck on the mud flat before the coast 
guard the incoming tide and a crowd of cheering spectators helped 
shake him loose tuesday afternoon 
experts could only speculate about why humphrey went off course 
your guess is as good as mine but my guess is somethings 
wrong with this guy said brian gibeson a marine biologist at 
the california academy of sciences 
it could be that a parasite has affected his brain or 
rudimentary inner ear gibeson said making humphrey like a car 
with his wheels out of alignment

the company that created the love canal 
toxicwaste dump ignored its own employees warnings and sold the 
filledin site to a school board without explaining the dangers a 
state lawyer charged wednesday 
also at the start of a trial over liability for cleanup costs 
the president of that companys parent apologized for the problems 
the dump created but a company lawyer argued it didnt hide 
conditions at the site 
hooker chemicals amp plastics corp built the dump in 1942 and 
sold the land to the niagara falls school board in 1953 
toxic chemicals eventually leaked into basements and backyards 
of a middleclass neighborhood built on the dump and made love 
canal a symbol of americas toxicwaste problems in the late 1970s 
about 2500 people fled their homes 
the state is seeking 250 million in punitive damages against 
occidental chemical corp which bought hooker in 1968 the state 
contends hooker recklessly failed to take care of the dangers at 
the site or warn others about them 
the company argues that the federal state and niagara falls 
municipal governments and the citys school board share liability 
two former love canal residents were called as the states first 
witnesses 
peter t bulka jr a former niagara falls policeman told how 
children on a little league team he coached discovered 
volcanoes in the outfield of a baseball diamond built on the 
dump 
we found two places where the ground was mounded up and stuff 
was spewing up from the middle bulka said 
timothy moriarty who grew up in one of the first houses built 
in the area said he remembered seeing at least two fires at the 
dump in the early 1950s throwing flames 10 to 20 feet in the air 
he also said city garbage trucks occasionally used the dump as 
well as hooker 
eugene martinleff the states lead trial lawyer charged 
hookers own employees warned of a quagmire at the site and 
urged it not be sold to the school board because of the 21800 tons 
of buried toxic chemicals 
conscience told hooker to safeguard this dangerous place so 
people could not come in contact with the dangerous poisons inside 
it martinleff said in his opening argument to us district 
judge john t curtin who is hearing the case without a jury 
but the narrow voice of selfinterest said dont spend money 
to install a fence and later go ahead and sell the site so 
other people can take care of it martinleff said 
thomas h truitt occidentals lawyer argued that hooker 
adhered to the standards of the day when it built the dump and 
should not be judged through the hauntingly seductive lens of 
hindsight 
the central issue in this case is not whether all the 
decisions are correct many were some were not truitt said 
but the issue is whether we can go back to the 1940s and 
1950s and place these decisions in the context in which they were 
made 
truitt said the company had given the school board full notice 
that dangerous chemicals were buried beneath the property when the 
board asked about buying it for construction of an elementary 
school he said the company included that warning in the deed 
the deed says may cause injury or death truitt said i 
believe death is fair notice to any person 
in fact the deed does not use the words may cause injury or 
death but it does say waste products resulting from the 
manufacturing of chemicals are buried on the site and absolves 
hooker of liability for injury death or property damage they 
cause 
the trial is expected to last at least two years opening day 
brought nearly 100 spectators to the federal courthouse thirtytwo 
lawyers and aides packed the counsel tables and spilled over into 
the jury box 
evidence includes up to 1 million pages of documents a computer 
was installed in the courtroom to keep track of all the paperwork 
before opening arguments occidental chemical president roger 
hirl apologized for love canal we do feel badly about it he 
told reporters we apologize to all those who suffered because of 
it 
occidental does not dispute that hooker dumped 21800 tons of 
dioxin pesticide byproducts and other chemicals some of them 
highly toxic in an abandoned canal bed dug in the 1890s by 
entrepreneur william love 
the dallasbased company paid 20 million in 1984 to settle a 
separate lawsuit brought by 1345 former love canal residents

yves saint laurents show of luxury summer 
readytowear wednesday was a puzzling affair capping a hectic 
week of presentations 
the great fashion master made a splash with his fabulous 
harempants evening wear based on the scheherezadestyle costumes 
of the turnofthecentury ballets russes designer leon bakst 
the party clothes looked either sexy or downright wanton 
billowing pants in light chiffons and crepe de chines came out in 
busy colorfully theatrical prints 
they were topped by everything from bare bosoms adorned with 
beads to beaded pointed bras or sequined boleros heads coiffed 
with tasseled silk fez hats 
audience reactions to the show were mixed some spoke of saint 
laurents superb mastery of colors others muttered about 
vulgarity 
it was all of that conventional daytime styles in classic good 
taste vied for attention with flounced ruffled feathered 
legbaring numbers more appropriate for the lido than the sleek 
crowd saint laurent usually caters to 
backstage the 54yearold couturier was enthusiastically 
embraced by famous friends like paloma picasso and catherine 
deneuve but having been through a bout of nervous fatigue and 
rest cure several months ago saint laurent still looked pale and 
shaky 
and that was the unsettling mood of the whole collection which 
wavered between a sure approach in color and cut and an attempt to 
redeem it all with forced injections of color lace and sparkles 
and views of skin 
nevertheless there were a lot of saleable items offered in a 
considerably softened daytime silhouette the current new paris 
mood 
mariner styles with easy jackets smallstriped navy and white 
tee shirts fitted tunics and tank tops minis and shorts with 
yachting caps or longbilled sunhats could certainly be worn 
jauntily anywhere 
saint laurent is going in for lots of sportswear evident in the 
opening of his new leftbank shop for his lowerpriced line called 
variations where his original rive gauche shop was even 
there prices are high for american purses with a silk shirt going 
for about 300 
he showed many straight and narrow pants emphasizing the 
newlysoftened silhouette shoulder padding when it appears is 
softly rounded as in the moderate batwingsleeved absinthe green 
belted trench with goldbuttoned raw silk pants the color of orange 
sherbet worn with a collarless mustardyellow satin shirt 
in the easier fluid line saint laurent also showed charming 
modified aline sailor dresses a beautiful brick linen coat 
without buttons just outlining the body over pants and a blouse 
and a lot of babydoll dresses sometimes in hot fuchsia shades 
strapless or offoneshoulder and plastered with a lace band around 
the bust 
the white silk and lace fitted blazer with full ivory silk pants 
was fine as was the classic shortskirted black tuxedo suit the 
jacket piped in a curve of satin 
the trouble with the collection was that it often fell into a 
rather boring mode perhaps reflecting saint laurents recent 
depression the charcoal trouser and skirt suits were wellcut if 
somewhat severe balanced by a line of flowing silky crepe numbers 
in browns beiges or dusty pastels 
but as saint laurent harked back to his own corselet dresses 
the little black lacy lingerie dresses and the busy look of red 
organza or zany ostrichfeather puffs to pep up the party one 
longed for the authoritative old saint laurent who didnt need 
to try so hard to offer fun 
that man knew how to make a simple cocktail dress and jacket 
sexy without having to revert to attentiongrabbing froufrou 
some admirers wish for nothing more than his former surefooted 
creative elegance long the hallmark of ysl

congress on wednesday approved and sent to 
president bush legislation aimed at improving the security of air 
travelers against terrorism 
the bill which grew out of recommendations of a commission that 
studied the 1988 pan am flight 103 bombing authorizes up to 7 
million for security improvements in the fiscal year which began 
oct 1 
transportation secretary samuel skinner welcomed the action and 
said he would recommend that president bush sign it 
skinner in a statement called the measure a signficant 
milestone for the families of the victims of the pan am 103 
tragedy and everyone who flies 
paul hudson chairman of the families group families of pan 
am 103lockerbie said in a statement families of the victims 
feel elated and relieved 
the bill would require the government to issue guidelines for 
warning passengers of potential terrorist threats would create a 
new post at the transportation department to press for security 
improvements and would require intelligence agencies to share 
terrorism information with the department 
rather than face a veto the house and senate amended the bill 
to give the administration flexibility to decide whether to force 
airlines to buy and use expensive explosive detection devices 
widely criticized for unreliability 
the federal aviation administration wanted to make airlines 
acquire 150 of the thermal neutron analysis devices at a total 
cost of 175 million and deploy them at 15 international airports 
in the united states and 25 abroad 
but a test of the device by a presidential commission that 
investigated the pan am bombing over lockerbie scotland showed 
that it could not detect an amount of plastic explosive like that 
used in the bombing and also avoid false alarms 
the final bill allows the faa to order limited use of the 
devices but only for 18 months until better technology is 
developed 
many of the reforms called for in the bill already have been put 
in place by the government and skinner said the measure would 
ensure that the changes are lasting

a freelance undertaker accused of dumping 
cadavers from a medical school in a mass grave and pocketing the 
money he was paid to cremate them pleaded innocent wednesday to a 
felony theft charge 
prosecutors said they planned more charges against richard 
joseph herrin owner of the continental casket store and 
continental cremation services 
assistant district attorney jean spradling hughes said herrin 
44 would be charged within the next week 
she refused to specify the charges but herrins attorney jack 
kennedy said the charges would include fraud wiretapping and 
making terrorist threats against area funeral homes 
kennedy said herrin would plead innocent to all the charges 
the felony theft charge stems from an agreement herrin had with 
the texas chiropractic college in pasadena 
the college paid him 189 per body to dispose of cadavers 
donated to the schools anatomy laboratory texas law requires that 
the cadavers be cremated or buried in a cemetery but prosecutors 
say herrin dumped the bodies illegally 
fortyfour cadavers and body parts were recovered last week from 
a field 
judge george godwin ordered herrin to remain in custody until 
another court hearing next week 
i am concerned about the possibility of additional charges 
godwin said in denying bond 
herrin has contracts with several area funeral homes and 
arranges burials or cremations for his customers 
his funeral directors license was revoked by the texas funeral 
commission in 1988 amid allegations he was using his apartment to 
improperly dispose of fetuses from an abortion clinic the 
allegations were never proven 
herrin has said he has been harassed by the funeral industry 
because the prices for the caskets he sells are much lower thanthose sold 
through funeral homes 
there is a great deal of bitterness between herrin and the 
funeral industry because he undercuts their business by selling 
caskets for 700 or 800 kennedy said

the white house shook its finger wednesday at 
republican candidates who publicly oppose the president on major 
issues but at the same time said they are free to say whatever 
they want 
if they can sleep with their conscience let them try said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
venting frustration with gop discontent toward bushs policies 
fitzwater initially said that republicans who speak out against the 
president would be subject to unspecified penalties 
but he later said he was kidding and meant to suggest they 
would suffer in their private purgatories 
fitzwater said that bush has crisscrossed the country in support 
of gop candidates raising some 80 million for their campaigns 
some candidates have asked for us back five or six times to 
suggest they dont want us is pure baloney fitzwater told his 
daily white house news briefing 
the spokesman also expressed pique at a memo by edward j 
rollins cochairman of the national republican congressional 
committee 
in the memo rollins reportedly suggested that gop congressional 
candidates put distance between themselves and the president if 
they felt it to be politically helpful 
the white house was less than enthusiastic about the memo 
fitzwater said 
rollins defended his advice the gop is a diverse party with 
diverse views which we tolerate and encourage he said 
he minimized the memo saying it was a common practice to advise 
candidates on washington issues 
we advised candidates not to abandon their previous positions 
even if it meant opposing the bipartisan budget summit agreement 
he said that advice rollins continued was hardly unique 
asked if republican candidates who oppose bush on key policy 
issues would be penalized fitzwater said absolutely but we 
never discuss it in public 
what might that punishment entail 
i cant tell you if i told you it wouldnt be a surprise 
fitzwater said 
however he later told reporters he did not mean to suggest that 
there would be actual retaliation against rebellious republicans 
the president has never been one for retribution he 
understands candidates sometimes have to take differing positions 
nevertheless hed like to see strong support fitzwater said 
as he campaigns around the country bush increasingly has 
encountered gop candidates who disagree with him on taxes and other 
issues 
for instance on tuesday rep peter smith rvt introduced 
bush at a fundraising dinner in burlington by telling his audience 
that he disagreed with bush on taxes and the presidents civil 
rights veto smith is running for reelection 
then in manchester nh republican bob smith didnt even show 
up for bushs appearance in the lawmakers senate campaign he 
begged pressing action in the house in washington 
fitzwater said he would not fault either candidate claiming 
that bob smith did have important reasons for remaining in 
washington and that peter smith had been a chief ally of the 
president on many issues including an earlier budget proposal

disagree with bush should refrain from criticizing administration 
policies in his presence 
candidates can say whatever they want they ask us to be

a selfdescribed bunch of frugal 
yankees donned protective suits emblazoned with the words 
pigeon busters and offered to shovel pigeon droppings out of 
the town hall attic for free 
town officials plan to spend up to 200000 removing the 
droppings and already have spent about 10000 on a consultant and 
preparation of bids for an elaborate removal plan 
the residents met with town manager barry del castilho this 
week 
we wanted to let the selectmen know its all a lot of poop to 
us david keenan a building contractor and realtor said 
tuesday 
selectmen open their town meeting next week and will have the 
final say on the pigeon droppings they have endorsed the proposed 
expenditure but they also urged del castilho to consider the offer 
as an alternative 
the town is to open bids on the project on monday 
keenan said his fiveperson crew would remove the droppings 
without charge and even nail the windows shut so pigeons cant get 
back into the attic 
keenan said he and other local contractors including some 
licensed to remove asbestos had tried unsuccessfully for months to 
get officials in the college town to consider cheaper alternatives 
for removing the droppings 
sometimes they just intellectualize things to death he 
said its typical of them to take a little pigeon droppings and 
blow it up into a national project with studies and experts

ornithologists were elated this week 
by the sighting of an elusive night parrot a species that hasnt 
been seen officially in nearly 80 years 
thats the good news 
the bad is that the emerald green and yellowspotted bird was 
found dead at the side of a roadway in queensland state the likely 
victim of a cars windshield 
i was just standing there and i looked down at my feet and 
there it was said walter boles an ornithologist at the 
australian museum in an interview thursday in the sydney morning 
herald 
the night parrot was considered by some experts to be extinct 
with the last official sighting in 1912 in western australia state 
the bird first was collected on the edge of the simpson desert in 
south australia state by explorer john stuart in 1845 
the species is strictly nocturnal and lives on the ground in the 
desert flying only when disturbed boles said 
he was returning from a twomonth museum expedition to western 
australia when his group stopped to look at some other birds on the 
road south of mount isa about 940 miles northwest of brisbane 
boles said he was standing near his vehicle by the roadside 
waiting for a second vehicle to catch up when he spotted the 
birds corpse at his feet 
i knew what it was straight away said boles i picked it 
up and casually showed it to wayne longmore an associate he just 
yelled over and over for the next 10 minutes 
the discovery may cost australian geographic publisher dick 
smith 39000 last year he offered that reward 50000 australian 
dollars for conclusive evidence the night parrot still existed 
one condition of the reward was that the bird not be killed 
purposely a magazine official said thursday that since the 
vehicle that hit the parrot probably did not do so purposely the 
reward would likely be paid once the dead birds identity is 
verified

the united states on wednesday joined with 
14 other security council members in voting unanimously to rebuke 
israel for rejecting a un mission to investigate the killings of 
palestinians at the temple mount 
israel denounced the resolution in advance said it would not 
cooperate and termed the un council hypocritical 
the united states sending a public signal of displeasure to 
israel refrained from exercising a veto that would have shielded 
israel from censure it was the second time in 10 days that the 
united states had joined in voting against its ally the vote of 
the 15member council was unanimous 
the united states had been under intense pressure from arab and 
other states not to veto the resolution and risk eroding the 
fragile usled coalition against iraq 
western diplomats said they hoped the council decision would 
shift the arabisraeli issue from centerstage and return the 
international spotlight to iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but 
some arab diplomats appeared determined to maintain the focus on 
israel and press for action 
after the vote israeli ambassador johanan bein said the 
security council exercised a double standard he said recent deaths 
in lebanons civil strife occurred without council condemnation 
i heard not one word in the security council about jews being 
killed he said 
he depicted israel as the victim of the us effort to 
keep the coalition against saddam hussein intact 
bein however said he does not foresee a major strain in 
usisraeli relations 
we feel that the us and others have done something wrong 
he said but we are their best ally 
us ambassador thomas r pickering left the security council 
without making a speech or commenting to reporters 
the united states had tried unsuccessfully for a week to 
persuade israel to accept a un probe the us vote came after 
president bush sent a letter to israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir urging him at the last minute to cooperate with a un 
investigation israel refused 
the resolution which is considered binding was greatly 
watereddown in order to avert a us veto it deplores the 
refusal of the israeli government to receive the mission urges it 
to reconsider and insists it permit the secretarygenerals 
team to visit 
it requests the secretarygeneral to submit a report on the 
killings council members said in a nonbinding statement last week 
that the report should recommend how to protect palestinians in the 
occupied territories 
british ambassador david hannay president of the council for 
october said the issue of treatment of palestinians is not 
going to go away from the council agenda he said he did not 
anticipate sanctions against israel for rejecting the un mission 
the principal loser by not receiving the un mission will be 
israel he said 
envoys of china france and the soviet union the other 
permanent security council members along with the united states and 
britain also did not deliver speeches or commenting 
even before the vote israel rejected the un resolution and 
repudiated any un mission as a violation of its sovereignty 
us officials in washington said 
the resolution was approved after a week of consultations and 
amendments aimed at averting a us veto by softening the 
resolution it substituted the word insists for the word 
demands and deleted reference to a un charter provision that 
requires all member to obey security council resolutions 
but israel said the council is hypocritical and biased against 
israel while ignoring arab violence against israelis it said that 
approval of the resolution could open the way to greater council 
involvement with the occupied territories and calls for un 
observers and peacekeepers 
israel calls any mission a violation of its sovereignty over 
east jerusalem where the killings of at least 19 palestinians 
occurred two weeks ago security forces opened fire after 
palestinians rioted and stoned jewish worshippers at the western 
wall 
israel has said it would give the united nations its own inquiry 
into the deaths which followed the stoning by palestinians of jews 
praying at the western wall known commonly in the west as the 
wailing wall but the secretarygeneral has said he wants to 
prepare a report based on his own investigation and will not send a 
team unless israel cooperates 
on oct 12 the security council condemned the violence by 
israeli defense forces and endorsed the un secretarygenerals 
plan to investigate the deaths in a nonbinding statement the 
president of the council said the 15 members want a report in which 
the secretarygeneral makes suggestions for the protection of 
palestinians in the occupied territories 
the council includes the five permanent members with veto power 
and the nonpermanent members canada colombia cuba ethiopia 
finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen and zaire

a strong earthquake 
spooked tourists and loosened rockslides that blocked roads the 
second time this year that natural disaster has blocked access to 
the park 
some tourists said they were jolted awake by the 58magnitude 
quake about 1115 pm tuesday that was felt as far away as san 
francisco and in northern nevada casinos 
no injuries were reported and damage apparently was limited to 
the closure of three of four roads leading into yosemite 
also wednesday a quake measuring 35 on the richter scale 
jiggled southern illinois it rattled windows woke residents and 
roused pets into a frenzy but no damage was reported 
roads into yosemite were closed for 11 days this summer when 
forest fires burned out of control bureaucratic wrangling in 
washington over the federal budget closed the park to campers 
during the columbus day weekend 
it comes in threes said jane van den hoek who said she was 
inside her trailer when she was jarred by the quake 
van den hoek of rancho palos verdes said campers started 
packing up and leaving the park soon after the temblor 
raymond grant of prince edward island canada waited until 
daybreak wednesday to leave cutting by several days his visit to 
the park known for its majestic vistas and waterfalls tumbling from 
huge granite monoliths 
my wife said were getting out of here as soon as possible 
grant said 
spokeswoman mallory smith said visitors were full of talk of the 
quake wednesday but there was no mass exodus and travelers 
continued to enter the park on highway 41 which remained open 
some visitors especially from foreign countries and other 
states who havent felt very many earthquakes tended to be very 
frightened smith said 
national park service crews worked to clear several granite 
boulders about 50 tons each that tumbled onto highways 41 and 120 
about a half mile from each other on the parks western edge 
workers lopped off a piece of boulder jutting onto highway 140 
and opened the road leading into the west side of the park late 
wednesday afternoon said a dispatcher for the state department of 
transportation 
highway 120 which cuts through the park also was closed on 
both the parks east and west sides after the quake 
the east entrance was opened later wednesday but the slide on 
the west side of highway 120 wrecked a 3foot section of the roaday 
and destroyed part of a retaining road said ranger scot bowen it 
was not expected to open until nov 2 
the quake was centered at lee vining a small mono county town 
east of yosemite national park and about 190 miles southeast of san 
francisco 
the quake was felt by gamblers at nevada casinos in south lake 
tahoe and reno and by residents in a wide area including manteca 
modesto sacramento and stockton 
mono county sheriffs deputy suzanne sturdivant said the quake 
lasted about 45 seconds 
in nevada residents of reno and carson city reported rattling 
windows swinging lamps and pictures falling off walls 
i never felt anything like it there was a total rolling 
motion for about 1 minutes said mary biber a disc jockey at 
radio station kptl in carson city 
the illinois quake was the second quake in the area in less than 
a month but was not linked to the new madrid fault said 
geophysicist paul heigold of illinois geological survey in 
champaign 
a climatologist iben browning has predicted a major earthquake 
is 50 percent likely along the new madrid fault which runs from 
marked tree ark to cairo ill on dec 3 
last week that prediction was rejected by an advisory panel to 
the us geological survey the scientists said that while people 
in the region should prepare for the longterm possibility of a 
major quake along the new madrid fault brownings prediction is 
without scientific basis 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to 
ground motion as recorded on seismographs every increase of one 
represents a tenfold increase of magnitude a quake of magnitude 5 
is capable of considerable damage and a magnitude 6 quake can 
cause severe damage

several westerners who were held hostage in iraq said wednesday 
that their captors starved them and refused them medical attention 
prompting a brief riot at one strategic site 
the accounts came as separate groups of british and american 
hostages arrived in london following their release tuesday the 32 
britons and 14 americans were among hundreds of westerners held by 
baghdad since its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
two senior officials told congress that the release of the 
hostages and an agreement to free frenchmen held in iraq and 
kuwait were part of a broad effort by iraqi president saddam 
hussein to weaken the resolve of his opponents by dangling the 
possibility of hostage releases 
in saudi arabia king fahd expressed his firm and 
unchangeable stand that iraq should withdraw from kuwait 
unconditionally it was the second day the saudis had sought to 
quell reports that they want kuwait to grant territorial 
concessions to baghdad to prevent war 
crude oil prices again rose above 30 per barrel in trading 
wednesday as speculators grew more pessimistic about a solution to 
the gulf crisis light sweet crude closed up 171 to 3108 for 
december delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
nine of the freed americans arrived in london on wednesday and 
were to fly home thursday 
the other five flew to new york on a flight with a stopover in 
amsterdam they appeared healthy and in good spirits when they 
disembarked at john f kennedy international airport 
jack frazier of santa ana calif said leaving other hostages 
behind was the hardest thing ive ever done in my life 
the leader of an american peace group meanwhile said he was 
optimistic that more americans would be released by friday 
c douglas hosdetter head of a delegation from the fellowship 
of reconciliation said his group met with middlelevel iraqi 
officials in baghdad and received no absolute commitment but we 
are very hopeful 
iraq also released 25 portuguese stone masons wednesday a week 
after they finished work on a palace for saddam 
britains foreign secretary denounced the piecemeal releases as 
grisly and repulsive and said bitain would not be blackmailed 
into softening its stance against baghdad 
in contrast to the piecemeal release of others all french 
citizens were to be freed iraqs ambassador to france abdul 
razzak alhachimi said wednesday that all 327 french citizens in 
iraq and kuwait could leave within two days 
iraq is attempting to splinter the international coalition 
against saddam by using western hostages as bargaining chips 
secretary of state james a baker iii and defense secretary richard 
cheney told lawmakers wednesday 
saddam has invited the foreign ministers of canada and germany 
to come to baghdad in recent days holding out the promise that 
some of their citizens could also be released the two cabinet 
members told lawmakers 
the overtures failed but are signs saddam would like to weaken 
western resolve by manipulating the hostages he holds the two 
officials said in a closeddoor briefing for lawmakers according 
to sources present 
in cairo egypt soviet envoy yevengy primakov met for 90 
minutes with president hosni mubaraks chief political aide 
wednesday to discuss the gulf crisis 
primakov who earlier persuaded saddam to allow the evacuation 
of about 5000 soviets from iraq said he may return to baghdad to 
meet again with saddam 
some returning western hostages described abysmal conditions in 
iraq such as lack of food and inadequate toilet facilities 
we were in really bad shape freed briton jim thompson told 
reporters on the flight home from iraq he said meals consisted of 
rice and stale bread 
thompson 50 an engineering company manager said he was among 
15 foreigners held as human shields at an iraqi armaments 
factory saddam has kept some western detainees at strategic 
locations to guard against attack 
we told the guards unless you do something we are going 
to have a disturbance thompson said 
he said that when nothing was done the detainees tore down 
fences broke windows daubed antisaddam remarks on walls and 
shouted antisaddam slogans until guards forced them back into 
their rooms at gunpoint 
he said the riot occurred sept 29 and also involved american 
japanese german and french detainees he did not say where the 
factory was located 
london sales executive john york a diabetic said the iraqis 
denied him insulin 
doctors on the flight said the sick included people suffering 
from a variety of illnesses including cancer heart trouble 
diabetes liver complaints punctured eardrums epilepsy and 
stress 
dr ronald eccles who was detained in iraq while on a 
physiology lecture tour warned of health problems among those 
still trapped in iraq 
there are a lot of stressrelated diseases coming out said 
eccles 42 who suffers from severe arthitis 
everybody was getting upset you start to get angry but you 
dont know where to direct it its a bit dangerous to start taking 
it out against the iraqi soldiers 
one hostage en route to baghdad airport to join the british 
flight was killed in a fatal car accident the british foreign 
office said he was identified as alexander duncan 19 an oxford 
university student 
the nine freed americans who arrived in london had little to say 
to reporters they asked us very nicely not to say anything 
said peter timko from pennsylvania 
john charlton 19 from tampa fla said the detainees didnt 
have much warning before they were told they could leave 
it was just a few hours pretty sudden he said i was 
never scared except the invasion was a little scary but thats

one year after jim bakker was sentenced 
to 45 years in prison a civil trial opened wednesday in which ptl 
contributors seek more than 757 million from their former leader 
in opening arguments an attorney for the contributors told the 
jury the ptl founder committed management fraud when he enticed 
his followers to send him money 
we represent some 145000 investors who were told that for a 
1000 investment they would receive the right to stay for four 
days and three nights in ptl hotels attorney tom anderson 
said in us district court 
bakker lawyer jim toms told the jury that the people suing 
bakker now are the same ones who gladly sent him money years ago 
the constituency of ptl including the lifetime partners 
wanted jim and his wife tammy bakker to prosper and they didnt 
hide their lifestyle 
toms said bakker was a visionary and said that visionaries often 
make mistakes before they eventually succeed 
the lawsuit was filed in 1987 on behalf of the contributors 
also called ptl partners several months after bakker resigned 
from his religious empire in the wake of a money and sex scandal 
the scandal began when it was revealed bakker had sex with former 
church secretary jessica hahn 
in the suit thousands of former ptl partners accused bakker of 
conspiring with others to fraudulently raise million of dollars and 
misuse ptl money most of the lifetime partners sent bakker 1000 
in exchange for offers of lodging at the heritage usa retreat 
south of charlotte 
the suit also alleges a conspiracy by bakker and other ptl 
officials accountants and others to launder money so bakker and 
his top aides could spend it on themselves 
they plaintiffs were told this was a wise investment 
anderson said jim bakker said on television that if we go over 
the limit well refund your money 
other defendants are former ptl board member aimee cortese and 
roe messner ptls chief builder two auditing firms retained by 
ptl deloitte haskins amp sells and laventhol amp horwath also are 
named as defendants 
the suit alleges the two firms oversaw a secret bank account 
that was used to pay bakker and others millions of dollars in 
bonuses at ptl 
bakker 50 is serving a 45year sentence in a minnesota prison 
he was convicted last october on charges of fraud and conspiracy 
and his appeal is scheduled for later this month before the 4th 
circuit us court of appeals in richmond va 
us district judge james mcmillan approved a motion to have 
bakker brought back to north carolina if the plaintiffs agree to 
pick up his expenses 
the judge also said bakkers former top lieutenant at ptl 
richard dortch would testify dortch is serving 2 years in a 
florida prison camp after pleading guilty to fraud and conspiracy 
dortchs testimony against bakker in the first trial helped send 
the ptl leader to prison 
byron attridge the attorney for leventhol amp horwath told the 
jury his client was unaware of any overselling of lifetime 
partnerships he introduced to the jury the team of accountants who 
performed ptls audits warning jurors against falling victim to a 
strategy of guilt by association 
jim williams who represents deloitte haskins amp sells said the 
plaintiffs would be unable to prove his clients knew about any 
fraud at ptl 
deloitte was not in the crystal ball business nor should it 
have been williams said

the house approved a defense bill wednesday 
night that slashes president bushs budget request for star wars 
and barely keeps alive the b2 stealth bomber program 
by a vote of 271156 the house adopted the bill despite 
republican doubts that it meets the pentagons needs for the 
potcold war era and democrats concerns about building costly 
weapons to counter a lessening soviet threat 
the legislation sets spending ceilings for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 totaling 288 billion or 19 billion less than bush 
sought in his original proposal in january 
the total is 55 billion more than the house approved in 
september a change made to meet the levels set in the budget 
resolution adopted by congress earlier this month 
the legislation goes on to the senate which is expected to pass 
the bill defense secretary dick cheney has said he supports the 
legislation and presidential approval is likely 
the money must be provided in separate appropriations 
among the major provisions is scaleddown continuation of the 
b2 bomber the radarevading aircraft estimated to cost nearly 
865 million a plane and designed to locate targets in the soviet 
union after a nuclear attack 
the legislation also calls for 29 billion for the strategic 
defense initiative or star wars 18 billion less than bush 
sought for sdi and 700 million less than congress approved last 
year 
the military blueprint is the product of weeks of negotiations 
between the house and senate which approved vastly different 
bills 
the original house legislation stopped production of the b2 
bomber while the senate adopted the administrations request for 
money to buy planes no 16 and no 17 
the compromise provides 41 billion for the program but is 
ambiguous on how many bombers the air force can purchase senate 
proponents contend that the service can spend the money as it sees 
fit house opponents believe cost overruns on the first 15 planes 
will consume most of the money 
the confusion and contradictions over the b2 erupted on the 
house floor late wednesday as republicans contended that the 
pentagon can buy two new radarevading bombers and democrats 
argued it cannot 
the joke is on the democrats mr cheney told me he got the 
money and hes going to build them somebody is being lied to 
said rep bill dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the 
house armed services committee 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed service 
panel threatened that if the air force tries to buy two new 
planes we will cut off all b2 money 
the bill reduces us troop levels now about 21 million by 
100000 but bowing to pressure from the pentagon gives the 
defense secretary added authority to limit the troop cut to 80000 
if he believes the us military buildup in the persian gulf 
warrants such a step 
it significantly scales back spending on landbased nuclear 
missiles and continues the v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft the 
pentagon has tried to cancel the past two years as unneeded 
final passage did not come without angry complaints from house 
republicans who chastised aspin for excluding gop members from 
negotiations with the senate 
dickinson was not included in a latenight session in which 
aspin and the ranking members of the senate armed services 
committee reached final agreements on the bill 
never before has any committee gone into conference and the 
ranking member been excluded from the windup session dickinson 
said this is the sleaziest conduct and treatment of any ranking 
member ive heard of 
democratic rep marvin leath of texas came to aspins defense 
saying i dont think our chairman intended for this to happen

charges against a woman who locked her child 
in the family car when she went to work will be reduced because she 
has been a caring thoughtful and concerned mother prosecutors 
said wednesday 
the same day chante fernandez who lost her secretarial job at 
a lumber company when her employer heard of her arrest learned she 
would get her fulltime back 
the store where ms fernandez works parktime on the weekends 
also offered her a fulltime job on its sales staff along with 
full benefits counseling and a loan 
but despite a day of good news she didnt get her daughter 
back fiveyearold anjuli who was found in good condition was in 
the custody of the state division of youth and family services 
pending an investigation 
ms fernandez told police she locked anjuli in the car because 
she didnt have a suitable baby sitter to watch the child while she 
worked weekends she left a rear seat folded down so the girl could 
sleep in the trunk area 
ms fernandez also told authorities her husband had abandoned 
her her father died in january and her house had been robbed three 
times 
the 24yearold faced up to five years in prison and a 7500 
fine had she been convicted of criminal restraint charge filed 
following her saturday arrest 
but widespread public support for the single mother caused 
authorities to reevaulate the case middlesex county prosecutor 
alan rockoff told a wednesday news conference the charge was 
reduced to a disorderly persons offense 
in reviewing the case the woman has on all occasions been a 
caring thoughtful and concerned mother that has used common sense 
about her child rockoff said 
she didnt abandon the child and allow her to drift with the 
elements he said she did check on the child did try to give 
her the necessities and try to make her comfortable during the 
course of the day so there were some mitigating circumstances 
rockoff said he was not condoning the action but i cant 
call it child abuse he said 
under the reduced charge ms fernandez can either plead guilty 
to a petty disorderly offense which carries a maximum 500 fine 
or apply for a yearlong probation under supervision of the court 
rockoff said 
the associated press was unable to reach ms fernandez for 
comment wednesday night

the budgetconscious city is handing out a 
cheaper brand of condom that is too tight too thin and breaks too 
easily antiaids groups complained wednesday 
david fair former director of the citys aids activities 
coordinating office said he feared the product is being used by 
poor people drug users and others likely to be exposed to aids and 
sexual diseases 
the city has 600000 of them on the street giving them out to 
people with higher levels of sexual activity he said its 
exactly the wrong product to give to these people 
the condoms in question named crown are made by okamoto 
industries inc in tokyo hisayuki naito vice president for 
marketing of its american subsidiary okamoto usa in stratford 
conn said he hadnt received any complaints 
he said the crown condom is roughly 1 millimeter four 
onehundredths of an inch smaller in diameter than the average 
brand and a little bit thin but the same strength as thicker 
brands he said a stanford university study rated the condoms good 
fair said the city switched from the prime brand made by

budget negotiators all but reached final 
agreement wednesday on a longsought plan to slash the federal 
deficit by boosting taxes on the wealthy raising levies on 
gasoline and increasing costs for medicare recipients 
the white house said final details remained to be worked out 
but sufficient progress has been made to allow bush to sign 
another emergency bill to keep the government operating through 
saturday when lawmakers hope to finish their budget business for 
the year 
the house approved the measure 38045 the fourth temporary 
extension of federal spending this month and the senate passed it 
by voice vote 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said all federal workers 
should report to work as scheduled thursday bush will not actually 
sign the stopgap bill until thursday morning 
earlier house speaker thomas s foley dwash said a budget 
compromise might be wrapped up in time to reach the floor for a 
vote thursday he said democrats had reached a very very strong 
consensus to support the package an important development 
because most house republicans were ready to oppose the plan but 
bush canceled several campaign stops for thursday and planned to 
spend the day drumming up gop support for the measure 
the plan would raise taxes on cigarettes and luxury items and 
force spending cuts for a variety of federal programs but the 
democrats no longer are insisting on imposing a surtax on the rich 
rather foley said the new plan fully supplants the impact of 
the surtax 
democratic negotiators expressed confidence they had found a 
formula that could end months of negotiations that alternated 
between bipartisanship and electionyear politics 
if so it would pave the way for savings estimated at 500 
billion over five years avert the threat of a partial shutdown of 
government services at midnight and signal the final days of the 
101st congress 
and not a moment too soon this years session had run on longer 
than in any other election year since world war ii 
budget issues aside there was the usual crush of sessionending 
developments 
the senate failed by a single vote to override president bushs 
veto of civil rights legislation the dministration claimed would 
restore quota systems in private business 
both houses were expected to vote thursday or friday on an 
overhaul of the nations clean air laws that would force reductions 
in acid rain and automobile pollution 
the senate passed the 11 billion interior appropriations bill 
after embracing a comromise on government financing of allegedly 
obscene art under the bill an artist would be barred from further 
grants for three years if a court found work financed by the 
government to be obscene the bill goes to a housesenate 
conference committee 
the house approved a 15 billion foreign aid bill reducing aid 
to el salvador and forgiving egypts debt it goes to a 
housesenate conference committee 
the house passed an intelligence bill scaling back covert 
operations generally the bill came from a conference committee 
and the senate must pass the same version 
the house passed a defense bill setting spending ceilings 
totalling 288 billion another bill from a conference committee 
that the senate still must approve 
the budget agreement would clear the way for final approval of a 
fiveyear measure raising taxes on gasoline by about 5 cents a 
gallon while boosting levies on cigarettes alcohol and airline 
tickets 
projected increases in medicare spending would be reduced by 
about 43 billion and other cuts would be made in benefit programs 
including those for veterans college students and farmers 
officials said the plan derived savings from wage earners with 
the heftiest incomes by 
raising the top incometax rate on the wealthiest americans 
from the current 28 percent to 31 percent 
phasing out the personal exemption now 2050 per person for 
the welltodo while reducing the deductions they can claim by 3 
percent 
the exemption would begin to be phased out for individuals 
earning 100000 and be completely phased out at the 225000 
level the salary levels would be higher for families deductions 
would be reduced for people earning more than 100000 yearly 
democrats said they abandoned their demand for a 75 percent 
surtax on people earning more than 1 million yearly after bush 
made it clear he would never accept that demand 
it appears this is not something the administration will 
support said foley who said he spoke by telephone with bush 
twice early wednesday 
but lawmakers also said there had been a dramatic mood shift and 
that after several days of partisan confrontation it was time for 
the budget agreement to be completed and for congress to adjourn 
for the year 
its one thing to tax the peoples pocketbooks and its 
another thing to tax their patience said rep thomas downey 
dny weve done too much of both 
budget negotiations began last spring and resulted in a 
bipartisan agreement late last month but that was rejected by the 
house for hitting the middle class too hard and several weeks of 
frantic bargaining followed 
the compromise package bore another political victory for 
democrats it lacked a cut in the capital gains tax another bush 
campaign theme 
even with the plan the budget gap for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 was projected at a record 250 billion the budget is 
expected to total about 12 trillion this year 
the deficitreduction package would 
raise the 9centagallon gasoline tax to 14 cents 
impose a new 10 percent tax on expensive cars private planes 
and boats jewelry and furs 
boost the 16centperpack cigarette tax by 8 cents and 
increase levies on alcohol and airline tickets 
increase the earned income tax credit claimed by the poor 
raise the wage ceiling from which the 145 percent medicare 
payroll tax is deducted from its current 51300 to 125000 
bestow billions in tax breaks for some businesses

he had helped secure fourteen freed americans were also headed

iraq released the westerners on tuesday after what some 
interpreted as a peace overture from the saudi government 
also tuesday saddam husseins parliament endorsed his proposal 
to allow all 330 french citizens in iraq to leave a gesture seen 
in paris as an attempt to divide the wests antiiraqi alliance

washington ap the un embargo against iraq is beginning to 
squeeze the iraqi occupation forces in kuwait but there is no 
evidence of even a partial iraqi withdrawal from the tiny emirate

pete williams chief spokesman for defense secretary dick 
cheney said tuesday that iraq is making some adjustments to 
its military operations in and around kuwait as a result of the 
embargo which has been in effect since aug 6 four days after 
iraq invaded its neighbor 
williams said us authorities believe the iraqi military is 
suffering shortages of tires and other materials he cited iraqs 
recently imposed rationing of civilian supplies of gasoline as an 
indication that the whole nation including its military is 
threatened by the sanctions 
as time goes by the sanctions continue to have effect it 
becomes harder and harder to support that military force as the

mexico is building seven border bridges 
and thousands of miles of highway to handle the boom in traffic 
from an expected freetrade agreement with the united states 
with help from private investors president carlos salinas de 
gortari set a plan in motion last year to improve mexicos 
inadequate roads and customs system 
solidarity bridge and border crossing at colombia now a 
cinderblock town of only 350 people is the largest project 
a 66mile highway linking colombia to an improved road between 
laredo texas and monterrey will cut the driving distance between 
the border and monterrey to 140 miles from 180 
more than 2480 miles of highways are to be built before the 
presidents sixyear term ends in 1994 half will be financed 
through private investment 
the other bridges under construction or planned will be in 
matamoros nuevo laredo and valle hermosa all in tamaulipas state 
piedras negras and ciudad acuna in coahuila and ciudad juarez in 
chihuahua state 
mexican officials say the improvements are needed to strengthen 
trade links with the united states and compete with the economic 
blocs of europe and asia 
trucks crossing into mexico often must wait for hours then 
negotiate undivided twolane highways riddled with potholes 
we dont need to be a rich country to have good roads but we 
need good roads to become a rich country said carlos joaquin 
vallejo rivero he directs the state highway office in nuevo leon 
the northeastern border state where the colombia project is being 
built 
it costs more and takes more time to transport things via bad 
roads because of higher insurance and loss of goods he said 
trade with the united states took off in 1986 when mexico joined 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade lowering import duties 
on hundreds of foreign products and making exports of mexican 
manufactured goods a priority 
from less than 30 billion in 1986 twoway trade rose to 52 
billion in 1989 mexico is the thirdlargest us trading partner 
after canada and japan 
a usmexican trade agreement that would remove tariffs and 
other barriers is under discussion it may be linked with the 
similar uscanadian pact of 1988 to create a single north 
american trade zone of 335 million people 
salinas and president bush are to discuss the proposal at a 
meeting nov 2627 in monterrey 
all indications are that we are going to have even more 
intensive trade with the united states and we are just not 
prepared said antonio fuentes flores director of the trust for 
the development of nuevo leon 
fuentes whose organization is overseeing construction said the 
820acre solidarity site will include an eightlane bridge stoage 
terminals refrigerated warehouses and hotel 
it will more than triple the size of colombia a town 10 blocks 
square populated mostly by farmers 
many people didnt think a new bridge was justified because we 
already had a crossing at laredo fuentes said laredo is the 
united states biggest inland port of entry with 1600 trucks 
crossing daily 
but we looked at projections of how much traffic would 
increase in the next few years he said and concluded that we 
didnt need to just build a bridge but we needed to build a new 
concept of border crossings 
nuevo leon was an ideal site fuentes said because more than 
half the merchandise moving south through laredo goes to monterrey 
the state capital and mexicos leading industrial city 
monterrey businessmen wanted a border crossing in nuevo leon so 
they would not have to send products through nuevo laredo in 
tamaulipas state they claim customs officials and corrupt unions 
in nuevo laredo inflate the cost 
the mexican side of the bridge and its support facilities is to 
cost 49 million split between the federal government and private 
investors 
laredo texas is financing the us side at 62 million with 
help from the state government and washington the site is dolores 
a town 18 miles from laredo 
four new highways in nuevo leon totaling 350 miles are being 
built with 584 million in private funds 
vallejo of the state highway office said the concessionaire 
viaductos de peaje would charge tolls for 8 to 14 years before 
turning the roads over to the state 
he said the highways would be divided with at lin each direction 
speed limits of 75 mph lights in urban areas 
rest stops aneast two lanes 
d the concession companys own roadside mechanics and 
patrolmen

linda bounced into the room with a graduated 
cylinder that held a tiny amount of rainwater her 23 classmates 
whipped out weather charts and began the daily ritual type of 
precipitation pattern contaminants 
it was no mere weather report that occupied the pupils at pape 
public school in toronto but a sixweek acid rain monitoring 
program involving grade school children in all of canada and the 16 
us border states 
its aims are to get accurate readings on acid rain levels over a 
wide area of the two countries while making the young aware of 
environmental issues in general and acid rain in particular 
it introduces kids into doing a scientific project like this 
and it helps raise some grassroots awareness in canada said 
steve smith executive director of public focus a nonprofit 
environmental education organization in toronto that runs the 
backyard acid rain kit program called bark 
acid rain specifically is an issue of considerable concern 
to canadians he said 
nadia miller who teaches the class at pape uses the program to 
instill observation in her pupils in field trips they examine 
trees and buildings that may be suffering the effects of acid rain 
you have to teach the kids to look to see the world around 
them ms miller said 
bark also works its way into class discussions on temperate rain 
forests and dovetails into the extensive recycling program run 
completely by the children at pape school 
this is all part of environmental awareness ms miller 
said 
the program involves 827 classrooms in canada and 592 in the 
united states and all the schools are twinned most of the 
canadian classes have an american counterpart with which they 
exchange results of their observations and other information 
linda had just made the daily trip to the roof to fetch the 
cylinder which had collected 1 millimeter of rain the class 
determined what sort of precipitation it was rain drizzle hail 
snow whether it was continuous or intermittent sky and wind 
conditions the degree of acidity and what contaminants were 
present bird droppings insects dirt leaves 
for the acidity test linda took one of the ph strips provided 
in the simple kit by public focus and dunked it in the rainwater as 
the rest of the class gathered in a circle on the floor the paper 
came up dark olive green which an accompanying comparison chart 
said was 55 ph or little acidity 
martin an intense redhead explained that ph is a scale of 
measuring acidity and alkalinity 50 to 56 is normal rain 
a classmate said one day we got a 75 but we did it in the 
afternoon and the wind was a south wind 
what does it all mean 
maybe on some days industry is less active martin mused 
or the wind direction might be different one of the girls 
offered 
the discussion was serious ms miller urged her pupils to 
analyse what they were doing and draw conclusions 
she said the pape school class participated in last years bark 
pilot run which involved only ontario and three american states 
and the children would like to continue the work all year 
datagathering for bark ends in november 
all the information will be fed to bark headquarters for 
processing and tabulation the results will be computermapped and 
colorcoded by queens university in kingston and each class will 
get a copy of the map 
one of the values of the results is that the kids receive the 
maps smith said 
they see theyve contributed to something not just read about 
something that others have done those kids are far more likely as 
adults to feel motivated to take part and do something

discounts on bestselling books are common in the 
united states but a major british bookseller who offered bargains 
on six new titles was taken to court and forced to raise his 
prices 
terry maher chairman of the pentos group says he will continue 
fighting britains pricefixing system for books but he faces 
opposition from competitors publishers and authors 
the consumer is getting a raw deal maher said in a 
telephone interview we have a fairly narrow elitist market 
books re not part of everyday life 
his company offered an unprecedented 25 percent off the six 
books nominated for the booker prize britains most important 
literary award 
publishers got court injunctions blocking the pentos discounts 
in england wales and scotland but discounts continue in ireland 
maher is fighting the court action in hopes of overturning the net 
book agreement a voluntary accord that allows price fixing 
pentos a fastgrowing operation controls 11 percent of the 
british market through 95 stores including dillons and mowbray it 
recently acquired hatchards the 193yearold london bookshop 
patronized by queen elizabeth ii 
maher argues that discounts will move books in greater 
profitable numbers and draw customers into shops where they can be 
tempted by fullpriced books he points out that book clubs already 
are allowed to discount 
his opponents including the publishers association booksellers 
association and society of authors say discounts would start a 
price war between pentos and the huge wh smith chain that would 
devastate small bookshops 
they claim discounts would cut the profit margins publishers use 
to produce books that are important but lose money 
wh smith has 25 percent of the book market amd supports the 
90yearold net book agreement which lets a publisher set minimum 
prices for its books the pact has survived 11 years of freemarket 
reforms by prime minister margaret thatcher who forced competition 
on lawyers brewers and utilities 
no similar restrictions apply in the united states but 
pricesupport arrangements exist in 10 of the 12 european community 
nations the publishers association said 
it says prices are lower in britain than the united states but 
maher claims they are 50 percent higher 
possession by booker prize winner as byatt sells in 
britain for 1395 pounds 2748 and the full price in the united 
states is 2295 when pentos marked the book down to 1045 pounds 
2059 maher said sales increased sevenfold 
maher has threatened for nearly two years to defy the net book 
agreement he discounted some books last christmas but they were 
among the 5 percent of british titles are published outside the 
voluntary agreement 
last year the office of fair trading decided circumstances had 
not changed enough to warrant another review of pricefixing 
agreement the restrictive practices court decided in the 1960s 
that abolishing it would result in fewer bookshops more limited 
stocks and higher prices 
david shaw a conservative member of parliament calls the 
agreement an absolute scandal but could not win support in the 
house of commons for its abolition shaw says he will try again 
ian taylor a director of the publishers association said the 
net book agreement provides a wide choice of books readily 
available to the public at reasonable prices compared with other 
developed countries 
the average book price in 1987 the most recent year for which 
taylor said figures were available was 285 pounds in britain and 
348 pounds in the united states using an exchange rate of 172 
to the pound taylor said the current exchange rate is about 
197 
independent us booksellers have been able to survive in an 
unfettered market 
major chains account for 40 percent of us bookstore sales 
which are expected to total 72 billion this year the american 
booksellers association said the united states has 11000 
bookshops 
the british association said it does not have comparable 
figures but that twothirds of britains 5000 to 7000 stores are 
independent book sales in britain last year totaled 483 billionit said

the deadline for her term paper was less 
than a week away before senior lynn flaherty got down to work 
instead of loading a backpack with notebooks and pens she 
pulled a chair up to the computer in her dorm room instead of 
thumbing through a card catalog in the library she rifled through 
reference material without lt like to 
hang out in the library and this means i dont have to 
my brother goes to drake and he has to go to an office to use 
a word processor i just chuckle when he talks about waiting in 
line for computers 
northwest missouri is the first and so far the only public 
college or university in the united states to put a terminal in 
every room and office then tie them together with a software 
system designed for college life 
without leaving the residence hall kids can access library 
information and scholarship and job postings said robert henry 
a school spokesman they can write and edit papers for classes 
balance their checkbook and find out whats going on around campus 
they can even look up their phone bills and see how much they 
owe 
the faculty also approves i write tests record grades look 
up student transcripts and class rolls instead of calling the 
registrars office you can look it up on the computer said 
chemistry professor harlan higginbotham 
if he lost his computer he said id just have to retire a 
secretary wants two days notice to type an exam but a computer 
isnt like that 
the systems 2400 terminals represent a techno invasion at the 
campus in the rolling farm country of extreme northwest missouri 
the electronic campus didnt come cheap and that is one 
explanation why it remains an anomoly 
the school spent 24 million to set up the electronic campus 
and officials have spent 600000 more since then the initial cost 
to furnish each dorm room with a terminal now about 1500 of them 
was about 300 per unit the university recoups its costs by 
charging each student 25 per semester 
getting campuses computeroriented is a high priority but its 
a costly item the shelf lives are not as long as youd like 
said bob aaron spokesman for the national association of state 
universities and land grant colleges and there is a competition 
between the two strains the hightech user versus the general 
user 
still other schools have taken the plunge carnegiemellon 
university in pittsburgh may be the most computerintensive 
university in the world said william arms vice president for 
academic affairs 
our basic principle is that they pay a lot of money to come to 
carnegiemellon and the computers are just like the libraries and 
playing fields they are things that come with the campus arms 
said 
students there are not provided with terminals in their rooms 
most buy their own so they can hook into the university network 
arms said 
at northwest missouri offcampus students must buy their own or 
use terminals on campus more and more courses require their use 
on campus computers are universal the 2800 students living in 
the 13 residence halls need only share terminals with roommates 
your patience is a lot greater waiting 30 minutes in your own 
room instead of walking across campus to wait in line at some 
building said jon rickman director of computer services 
in many disciplines electronic workbooks are available 
students can call up a program to quiz themselves on things like 
chemistry problems 
the program gives them explanations and then asks them some 
questions higginbotham said you get immediate feedback on 
what youre doing right or wrong 
in the english department the word processing function has 
improved the quality of writing seen by chairman jim saucerman 
it frees them up to write instead of dealing with the 
mechanics of writing he said it doesnt mean perfection 
because students who are careless with a pen are careless with a 
keyboard but overall the finished product is better because they 
have more freedom to write 
university president dean hubbard is proud of his electronic 
campus technology is going to penetrate deeper into our lives 
we need students to be as comfortable with computers as their 
parents are with their telephone 
there are signs that is happening electronic mail is the 
systems most popular function basically a message system 
electronic mail is a way to talk to old friends and meet new ones 
as a freshman i was really into the email said senior 
stephen king an art major from maryville i used to stay on 
campus just to use it 
with such reliance on an electronic campus what happens when 
the system goes down no one knows its never happened 
we take it down every other month for about four hours on a 
friday afternoon for scheduled maintenance rickman said 
weve never had it crash on us we have so many backups that if 
one part of the system fails the others pick up the slack

several days before his recent death noted 
religion statistician constant h jacquet jr said of the longtime 
decline in mainline protestant membership its turning 
he was ill at home at the time and didnt have at hand 
comparative figures to document his point he suggested waiting 
until he got back to his office but he didnt make it 
he succumbed to cancer that he thought he had overcome 
consequently his annual compilation of religious data the 1990 
yearbook of american and canadian churches can be reported this 
time only without his further clarifying analytical comments 
it shows that the latest us membership figures for churches 
and synagogues has increased to 1454 million from 1438 million a 
year earlier a gain of about 11 percent or slightly outstripping 
the population growth of 1 percent 
that means active religious affiliation amounted to 587 percent 
of the american population a proportion that had inched downward 
in recent years but which this time was up fractionally 
while the total grew including the two largest denominations 
the 149 million southern baptists and 57 million roman catholics 
membership in most mainline protestant bodies continued to slip 
but to a lessening degree 
that lessening was the basis of the turning comment by 
jacquet researcher at the national council of churches for 37 
years and editor of its annual yearbook the only comprehensive 
summary of american religious data 
most mainline protestant bodies have been losing members since 
the late 1960s amounting to millions of inactives dropped from the 
rolls but the steep losses of the 70s have moderated since the 
mid80s 
that leveling trend furthered in the latest figures was seen 
by jacquet as presaging a turnabout in the long decline although 
he didnt get a chance to detail the statistical pattern of the 
shift 
jacquet 64 had undergone surgery for lung cancer last summer 
and had returned to work seeming to have overcome the problem but 
recently cancer was found to have invaded his spine 
his death on oct 16 stilled a key voice in measuring the status 
of american religion for news media other researchers reference 
books and us government departments 
among the denominations still suffering slight losses in his 
latest compilation the decreases this time were around 1 percent 
often less 
it was only a fraction of that for larger denominations such as 
the 9 million united methodists 24 million episcopalians the 53 
millionmember evangelical lutheran church in america and 26 
millionmember lutheran churchmissouri synod 
however the presbyterian church usa dropped 125 percent 
to 29 million the american baptists fell 122 percent to 15 
million and the united church of christ decreased 107 percent to 
16 million 
the latest totals are for 1988 reflecting the regular twoyear 
time lag in accumulating the combined figures several later 
reports from individual denominations show further fading of the 
prolonged shrinkage 
whiled losses persisted for some denominations others such as 
southern baptists and roman catholics stayed on the upgrade as did 
most smaller evangelical denominations that resulted in the 
overall increase outpacing population growth 
the overall increase in us religious membership was in 
contrast to the total for canada whose inclusive membership 
dropped about 153000 to 168 million 
the yearbook also cited other indications of greater religious 
activity 
these included gallup poll findings that weekly worship 
attendance rose to 43 percent of the population in 1989 up three 
percentage points from two years before it means that about 1075 
million americans attend worship services each week 
teenage attendance also reached a high mark of 57 percent 
compared to 54 percent three years before 
later 1990 gallup surveys indicate 74 percent of americans have 
made a commitment to christ up from 66 percent in 1986 
however giving to american churches increased an average of 
only 35 percent lagging behind the 44 percent inflation rate for 
1988 resulting in decreased real income 
jacquet known as connie to friends had been working before 
his death at compiling figures for next years yearbook but 
associates without his long perspective or experience will have to 
finish the job 
over the years reporters across the continent knew that 
constant jacquet was their best source for statistical information 
about american religion said the rev j martin bailey the 
councils communication director 
he carried an enormous amount of historical data in his 
head

are brought out about community issues in economically depressed 
barbour county wva and in affluent westchester county ny

we are seeing that if individuals simply seek to maximize their own 
welfare they produce not a common good but a common bad

los angeles ap messianic jews are urging israel to amend its 
law of return to include jews who believe in jesus in its grant of 
automatic citizenship to all jews 
the international union of messianic jewish congregations sent 
letters to israeli officials calling for such a change following a 
recent israel supreme court decision rejecting immigration 
applications of two messianic jews 
such an exclusion poses a potential threat to approximately 
100000 jews worldwide who believe that jesus called yeshua is 
the jewish messiah 
excluding messianic jews could lead to barring of 
reconstructionist reform atheist or any other jew whose 
thoughts do not conform to that of the powerful religious 
parties wrote elliot klayman of the messianic jewish group 
 
washington ap a roman catholic leader says the new soviet 
law on religious freedom will allow american catholics to assist 
their brother and sister catholics to rebuild their church 
archbishop roger m mahony of los angeles chairman of the us 
catholic conferences international policy committee said the new 
law is a critical step in the process of providing the 
institutional guarantees of full religious freedom in all its many 
dimensions

democrat jimmy carter used to call the income 
tax system a disgrace to the human race republican ronald reagan 
said it was so complex frustrating and unfair as to be 
unamerican 
then the system was overhauled and when reagan signed a tax 
reform bill the democrats helped fashion he said equity and 
certainty had been restored 
not for long 
four years later the fairness issue is back sharply drawn by 
democratic insistence that the rich havent been paying their 
share the sole surviving certainty about the reformed tax system 
is that there will be more pressure for changes meaning increases 
next time the government faces a budget crisis 
that next time is almost inevitable and in fewer than the five 
years the 1990 deficit deal was designed to cover the 500 billion 
in deficit reduction it is supposed to produce is based on economic 
forecasts so optimistic as to be almost euphoric 
that includes a forecast of sharply declining interest rates 
especially after 1991 economic growth would have to surge over the 
same period to meet its revenue estimates and inflation would have 
to decrease steadily 
budget negotiators insisted the numbers are not phoney even 
though they may not prove correct by now thats the pattern 
deficit forecasts have been far from results during the past five 
years those estimates were computed one year at a time not five 
and the major reason they missed was that economic estimates were 
overly optimistic 
sen george j mitchell dmaine the majority leader said 
nobody could look people in the eye and claim to know whats going 
to happen over the fiveyear span nor he said could there be any 
guarantee that the government wont have to address the same 
problem again 
safer to guarantee that it will be back for another round over 
taxes spending and the federal deficit the economy is slumping 
not surging in the best of circumstances the projected fiveyear 
plan would only reduce the rate of increase in the national debt 
not the debt itself 
explaining his grudging agreement to accept tax increases bush 
said tuesday that reagan had to compromise too because he also 
had to deal with democrats in congress 
president reagan found same thing 1982 go back and look 
at the record the rhetoric was about the same bush said during 
a campaign stop in manchester nh that in spite of his aversion 
to taxes the only way to govern was to accept a compromise 
but reagan swallowed hard and the economy moved and interest 
rates came down when he did what he had to do bush said 
his own administration had struggled to avoid compromising on 
tax rates trying to hold one of the lines reagan left a 
28percent top bracket set in the 1986 tax reform law instead of 
raising the rate republicans wanted to restrict deductions a 
disguised and more complex way of imposing more taxes 
both a higher rate and deduction limits on the wealthy wound up 
on the table 
governors in both parties complained about restrictions on 
federal income tax deductions saying that would restrict their 
ability to raise state revenues and would set a precedent that 
could lead ultimately to eliminating the deductibility of state and 
local taxes 
senators and house members from states that levy high income 
taxes said the impact would be uneven and unfair the 
counterargument congress took away the deduction for state and 
local sales taxes in the 1986 law and that had a disproportionate 
impact on states that rely most heavily on sales taxes instead of 
income taxes 
thats the way one seasons reforms become fodder for the next 
seasons tax debate fairness is always in the eye of the political 
beholder the tax code and tax rates will be at issue as long as 
there are politicians to talk about them and congresses to change 
them 
before this round the top tax rate had been changed 10 times in 
30 years

rep john conyers was a fiery rebel who 
disdained the establishment for much of his first quartercentury 
in congress now hes joining the other side 
i get some kidding about the fact that now im one of the 
institutional leaders that i used to criticize so much he said 
in a recent interview but my goals havent changed that much 
the black democrat from detroit is completing his second year as 
chairman of the house government operations committee 
it might seem a confining assignment for a civilrights champion 
who stood with martin luther king jr slept on sidewalks with the 
homeless and raised the possibility of impeaching president reagan 
over the irancontra affair 
but conyers 61 insists he will not abandon the causes he has 
supported since his activist days in the 1960s 
rather he can pursue his social agenda as an insider 
substituting dealmaking and quiet persuasion for the searing 
rhetoric of old 
the son of an auto worker and union organizer conyers was 
interested in politics and civil rights from his youth he chose 
law school over his other passion jazz after his father 
insisted he not become a musician 
he thought that was unthinkable wasnt steady work and 
wasnt responsible work as far as he was concerned conyers said 
i had a dickens of a time working out an arrangement to buy a 
trumpet because he thought that would start me out on the wrong 
way 
but conyers remains a big jazz fan hes even sponsoring 
legislation to forgive the 16 million tax debt of band leader 
woody hermans estate conyers says an unscrupulous business 
manager gambled away hermans money and didnt file his taxes for 
six years leaving herman penniless before his 1987 death 
unpredictability and a fierce desire for personal privacy are 
other conyers traits 
he ended his lifelong bachelorhood in june marrying 25yearold 
monica ann esters without telling his closest friends political 
associates or even his brother 
ive never gotten into his personal or social life said 
eugene gilmer of detroit a friend since 1942 its just always 
been hands off 
conyers is continuing to evolve into a congressional insider a 
year after what some considered a potentially fatal blunder his 
1989 bid to unseat veteran detroit mayor coleman young his 
errorplagued poorly organized campaign flopped and he finished 
third in the democratic primary 
he was a charismatic figure on the campaign trail dapper in 
suspenders and colorful handkerchiefs but he often showed up late 
for appointments or missed them altogether on one occasion aides 
tried to rush him to an engagement but he insisted on stopping at a 
restaurant for soul food 
after that defeat democrats spoke openly of challenging 
conyerss reelection to the house instead he was renominated for 
his house seat without opposition and is a heavy favorite to defeat 
republican raymond h shoulders in the general election 
you dont really lose any clout here in congress if you run 
for another office and dont win conyers said there are lots 
of guys walking around that tried to run for governor or mayor 
conyers became chairman of the government operations committee 
which has jurisdiction over nearly all government programs and 
agencies when rep jack brooks dtexas moved to the judiciary 
committee helm in early 1989 
since then conyers has conducted hearings and introduced 
legislation on topics as diverse as the drug war environmental 
protection the military budget and privacy of genetic information 
he sponsored legislation which became law this year requiring 
the fbi to compile statistics on crimes motivated by bigotry 
another conyers bill that would register people to vote when they 
obtain a drivers license has cleared the house 
conyers also is using the committee as a platform to air blacks 
grievances against the government he prodded the fbi to 
investigate charges that black agents were being harassed 
and he has promised an investigation of complaints that black 
officeholders are being singled out for criminal investigations 
the subject of a shouting match earlier this year between conyers 
and attorney general dick thornburgh 
allout sleazy tactics are being used to entrap black 
officials by any means that can be imagined conyers complained 
at a committee hearing 
i trust our judicial system to treat people fairly 
thornburgh said 
i used to believe that conyers retorted i dont believe 
that any more

along with a special on tuna on aisle 7 and 
a sale on cat food on aisle 4 dont be surprised if your local 
supermarket features a nice deal on checking accounts 
supermarket banking something of a novelty when it first 
appeared in the 1970s has been rapidly gaining popularity over the 
last five years 
with banks under the gun to cut costs in a rocky economy there 
may be a lot more of them soon its much cheaper for a bank to set 
up a branch at a grocery counter than to operate in a tradional 
brick and mortar bank building 
and theyre apparently popular with customers 
there are currently 847 supermarket bank branches nationwide 
with most of them in the southeast and southwest said john w 
garnett executive vice president of norcross gabased 
international banking technologies a consulting firm that helps 
banks open and operate these facilities 
garnett admits that at first blush it looks mighty strange to 
see a banker holding court amid the produce and frozen pizza 
people are accustomed to seeing a 400000squarefoot 
branch he said when you walk into a supermarket and see a 
400squarefoot branch there is a perception you have to 
overcome 
we explain to customers that its backed up by the fdic 
federal deposit insurance corp that the bank is sound then 
its not a problem 
the grocery branches are fullservice operations that can do 
virtually anything a traditional bank location can do however 
they usually stay open into the evening and also do business on 
sundays garnett said 
garnetts company entered the supermarket bank business in 1983 
and now has 350 branches across the country ibt had 20 million in 
revenue last year he said 
garnett said the unconventional operations provide a great 
opportunity to attract new customers 
in a traditional bank 95 percent of your walkins are 
already customers or coming in for a specific reason he said 
ninetyfive percent in the supermarket are not your customers 
theyre not coming in for banking theyre coming in to shop 
so employees at the grocery branches have to be aggressive 
marketers these bankers walk the aisles and solicit business 
garnett said 
the chief attraction for the bank business garnett said is 
costcutting where it costs an average of 1 million up front to 
open a traditonal style bank it takes only 200000 to open a 
grocery branch he said 
ongoing costs vary from location to location said garnett 
whose exhibit drew a respectable crowd this week at the american 
bankers association convention he declined to give an average of 
monthly operating costs 
in the atlanta area bank south has branches in 36 kroger 
stores garnett said ibt recently signed a deal with pittsburghs 
mellon bank to open 21 locations he added 
not everybodys crazy about supermarket banks but some are 
said dallas banking consultant don wright they seem to work 
quite well if you put them in the right location 
garnett said ibts clients include banks as well as savings and 
loans though sampl interest has stalled since the thrift industry 
has come under seige 
in the last two years additions to the grocery list have been 
almost exclusively commercial banks garnett said about 64 percent 
of all supermarket facilities are banks he said

turn to page 225 of the 13th edition of the 
fannie farmer cookbook to learn how to truss a chicken page 628 
to bake a batch of brownies or just soak in the spirit of the 
book which is only partly about food 
it also is about an act of giving and receiving because the 
experience at table is a communal sharing talk begins to flow 
feelings are expressed and a sense of wellbeing takes over 
marion cunningham writes in the 13th edition of fannie merritt 
farmers guide to the american kitchen 
a valuable cookbook also reflects its time and the previous 
edition cunninghams first published 11 years ago already was 
losing its relevancy when she set out three years ago on the new 
edition 
i tell you things are different really different it was 
only looking recipe by recipe that i could see how dramatic our 
changes have been she said in an interview in new york 
testing every recipe in the 12th edition cunningham dropped 200 
and added 325 for an appropriate total of 1990 fat was reduced 
when it worked and recipes sometimes dropped when it didnt 
theres no kipered herring in cream or crabmeat terrapin for 
example 
there are new chapters on microwave cooking which surely wont 
prompt any manufacturers to ask her to be a spokeswoman outdoor 
cooking and vegetarian foods such as zucchini pancakes and a 
winter vegetable cobbler that will win any contest 
all sorts of ethnic ingredients are used raw fish is out as is 
steak tartare salt generally is left up to the cook and there are 
warnings about raw eggs and fish and other safety problems 
those were the issues that were very hard to reconcile 
cunningham said to act responsibly and not destroy the feeling 
that cooking and eating are well certainly one of the better 
human endeavors 
while farmer aimed the boston cookingschool cook book 
published in 1896 at families who had help in the kitchen the 
newest edition of the fannie farmer cookbook alfred a knopf 
2495 is intended to capture the way ordinary people actually 
eat 
so along with the instructions for making pasta from scratch are 
recipes for a ham and cheese sandwich for making popcorn hotdogs 
and macaroni and cheese cunningham tells how to improve the flavor 
of canned broths and offers suggestions for leftovers everyone 
clamors for the simple cheese spread in the appetizer chapter 
she writes 
there is plenty of practical advice too of olive oils for 
example she says money does not always buy the best and i have 
found the terms virgin and extra virgin not very meaningful 
both inside covers have all sorts of nifty facts things youve 
been told dozens of times but cant seem to keep straight such as 
how to tell if an egg is stale and whether cream whips better cold 
or at room temperature 
farmer would cunningham concluded wholeheartedly embrace 
todays health movement cunningham too thinks we ought to know 
what we eat 
but in concentrating so much on the negative aspects of 
eating we are making ourselves overly fearful and we are missing 
the pleasure that a good meal provides she writes instead of 
stringent diets eliminating almost all fats all salt all sugar 
from our diets and bloating ourselves with highfiber products i 
believe that the best possible approach for the average person is 
to eat a wide variety of foods and to eat sensibly in 
moderation 
while there is plenty of lowfat food this is no diet book 
along with the turkey patties and vegetable soups and green 
salads there is a carpetbag steak a beef and oyster dish from 
the improvident days of the 19th century and chicken fried 
steak served with milk gravy 
cunningham delivers a storehouse of basic information and a 
pep talk come on now just get up and go in the kitchen taste 
the food experiment its fun its homey and it tastes good 
dont let your failures stop you 
cooking is a dandy way to solve a lot of problems said 
cunningham besides she said its harder to learn to drive a 
car 
cunningham 68 began the 12th edition of fannie farmer in 1974 
with no writing experience and no famous name she had been a 
fulltime homemaker and two years earlier had met the late 
american cooking icon james beard 
jim beard recommended me i didnt think i had any 
qualifications said cunningham sitting on a hotel bed with her 
legs drawn up under her gray hair pulled straight back into a 
short neat ponytail 
the choice made sense to judith jones cunninghams editor at 
knopf 
for one thing she had worked with beard and his classes on 
the west coast he thought she really typified the good home cook 
in america and had natural good taste and thats just what fannie 
farmer needed jones said 
cunningham was charged with restoring the oldfashioned 
principles 
it made me so happy to have something to focus on ive really 
loved it she said i loved it from the beginning 
her pale blue eyes still express a little awe at her success 
more than a decade later during which she also has written the 
fannie farmer baking book and the breakfast book and worked 
as a restaurant consultant 
her husband a man shed known since kindergarten and who she 
says gave her the support and encouragement to become a 
professional died three years ago their son and daughter are 
grown so except for a yellow labrador named rover and a cat she 
lives alone and cooks for herself in walnut creek calif 
besides beard she uses joy of cooking and the early 
american cookbooks she collects i turn to a lot of them 
wonderful recipes simple to make 
like threequarters of american families she has a microwave 
the speedy clean and silent oven did not fare well under 
cunninghams scrutiny although she includes more than 50 recipes 
specifically for it 
the microwave has promised a lot more than it can deliver 
she said 
it was she wrote no faster than the stove for many of the 
vegetables she tested meat becomes pallid and the texture is not 
appealing 
while cunningham experimented with the new in equipment and 
ingredients sometimes she found the old to be far superior 
lobster thermidor and newburg for example did not work with 
milk instead of cream and with cream they stayed 
people can read about them if they dont want to make them 
she said

convinced its now warranted the rev william r farmer is both 
a united methodist and a roman catholic the combination contrasts 
with the separate institutional postures but he says there is firm 
basis for it 
his rare joint allegiance puts into effect for an individual 
the ecumenical movements unifying goal for the churches they 
havent yet made it formally but he says the way has opened for it 
on essentials 
consequently he said he acted to live a reality that is 
here but that still is hidden to most people even though 
protestantcatholic dialogue teams have found sufficient mutuality 
for it 
you have to act proleptically to see something coming and 
act now as if that which is coming is already here he said in an 
interview its apparently not going to happen in my lifetime 
so ive taken steps to actualize it in my own life in a 
practical way it works for me i dont see any need to wait for 
official bodies 100 years from now to iron out some of these minor 
things 
farmer 69 a longtime new testament professor at southern 
methodist universitys perkins school of theology joined holy 
cross roman catholic church in dallas last jan 25 but he also 
kept his methodist affiliation 
his unusual step has raised some canonical questions in both 
denominations that still are to be clarified he said he has had a 
lot of reaction the gist of almost all of it positive 
i dont regard it as a conversion or that ive put away my 
methodist heritage at all he said noting that he continues his 
methodist university post and serves as an assistant pastor at st 
lukes community methodist church in dallas 
at the same time farmer said at the catholic holy cross parish 
led by a longtime friend the rev timothy gollop he was seen as 
bringing into that church a very rich methodist heritage 
im trying to be fully in both congregations in a single 
ministry and in the whole church recognizing its oneness above 
all in matters of race farmer said 
both he and gollop are white the two congregations on dallas 
south side are made up largely of blacks and hispanics farmer said 
that the new age of ecumenism is taking place in concepts of 
gods option for the poor 
its grass roots ecumenism he said its happening all 
over the world in homes in churches officials dont know what to 
do with it accordingly there are no provisions for it and no 
restrictions against it 
its best not to cause scandal but go ahead and do it being 
sure youre doing it in good conscience and doing it in obedience 
to the gospel 
temporarily farmer is on leave as resident theologian at the 
methodist mission resource center at emory university in atlanta 
and as a research scholar at columbia presbyterian seminary there 
he said that when he returns to his teaching post and ministry 
in dallas in january it will be up to the roman catholic and 
united methodist bishops there to adjudicate his special status 
theyre studying it he said it doesnt mean were out of 
the woods i dont know what the outcome will be a lot of good 
friends in both churches have been very encouraging it remains to 
be seen what the bishops will do 
farmer said catholic dialogue teams with methodists lutherans 
and episcopalians have found concurrence on most major issues 
including a modified papacy with the pope as presiding officer 
over a representtive council 
he said basic accord also has been found on christs real 
presence in holy communion basicially roman catholic 
understanding of it is very close to that of methodist founder 
john wesley farmer said 
there still are differences and some are important but 
theyre not great enough to justify our not being able to share the 
lords supper he added its a scandal that were divided at 
the lords table 
we ought to be ashamed at the excuses we use it must be very 
painful to christ 
farmer said that as assistant pastor at st lukes he does not 
preside in celebrating holy communion but receives it both there 
and in the catholic church catholic rules generally bar protestant 
reception in catholic services 
with his dual membership surmounting that barrier personally 
farmer said the churches should find some way of taking communion 
together on an officially approved basis 
most rankandfile church people both protestants and 
catholics still are living with stereotypes of the past in 
which the two christian branches are seen as contradictory he 
said 
but when you get together and look at the living gospel you 
find those contradictions disappear he said you find out that 
essentially they are the same faith

the netherlands is tightening the 
rules on asylum because it hasnt enough money housing and jobs 
for all the poor refugees flooding in 
holland is a historic haven for the oppressed it sheltered the 
pilgrims who fled religious persecution in england before they 
sailed for the new world 
a decade ago in 1980 only 1330 people claimed refugee status 
in the netherlands this year the number is expected to reach 
20000 and the government threatens to jail aliens who make 
unjustified requests for asylum 
dutch officials contend most asylum seekers are economic 
refugees looking for easier lives in this hightech welfare state 
hundreds of people have come from economically depressed eastern 
europe in recent months and the government fears a new rush of 
arrivals if the persian gulf crisis turns into war 
the netherlands subscribes to the un definition of political 
refugees as those fleeing persecution on ideological grounds and 
is reluctant to stretch its welfare resources in a time of economic 
uncertainty 
jobs housing and tolerance are getting scarce and only about 
13 percent of asylum requests are approved 
this is one of the most densely populated countries in the 
world said maurice van hezik spokesman for the justice 
ministry theres pretty high unemployment among the nondutch 
population if you were to admit people who only come to work that 
would make the problem worse 
one asylum seeker sara amini of iran claims she was persecuted 
at home for being a member of a small opposition party in iran 
when she arrived last summer with her husband and two children 
she expected the free housing and allowances that used to be given 
nearly all asylum seekers 
instead they were jammed into a 15footsquare room at a former 
convent school in rijsbergen one of 23 refugee camps in holland 
i heard people in the netherlands were very friendly very 
helpful compared to other european people she said in an 
interview i didnt expect it to be like this 
people seeking asylum in the netherlands used to be taken to 
governmentsubsidized housing projects and given social welfare 
payments equivalent to about 800 a month 
in 1987 however an influx of ethnic tamils fleeing the civil 
war in sri lanka gave rise to what critics call the bed bath and 
bread program 
the government opened 15 refugee camps including rijsbergen to 
house asylum seekers during processing 
aad kosto deputy justice minister said this summer he would 
jail those who sought asylum without good reason and might flee the 
camps and try to lose themselves in the population 
only a few people have been jailed but the practice is expected 
to become more common in the effort to stop rejected asylum seekers 
from joining the estimated 50000 to 60000 illegal aliens in this 
nation of 146 million 
prime minister ruud lubbers summoned the mayors of eight towns 
and villages in september and told them each would be host to a new 
refugee camp he said the first busloads of people were on their 
way 
seven more camps are planned by the welfare ministry which is 
buying 500 mobile homes 
van hezik said some people admit theyve only come for jobs and 
others offer the strangest stories 
he cited the case of a third world refugee who claimed to have 
arrived on a ship bound for switzerland which is landlocked van 
hezik said the man apparently hoped to be expelled to that country 
in early august romanians began pouring into eindhoven in 
southern holland radio free europe the ussponsored station 
had described the city as hospitable to strangers van hezik said 
hundreds of east europeans have made their way to the 
netherlands and the persian gulf may provide the next source of 
refugees said jan tielemans director of the rijsbergen camp 
well probably be noticing the side effects the indians 
the sri lankans who are huddling in jordan eygptians too he 
said we wont know for another few months 
some of these people are simply looking for a living and they 
think one of the ways theyll get it is by asking for asylum 
a 26yearold iraqi at rijsbergen said he deserted saddam 
husseins army days before it invaded kuwait on aug 2 
i was sick and tired of it all said the man who identified 
himself as an artillery sergeant born in yemen but would not give 
his name i just wondered what would happen if i deserted 
he said he hid in a helicopter belonging to the red crescent 
the moslem version of the red cross which took him from his 
position near basra in the south to the kurdistan region of 
northwestern iraq then crossed into turkey 
the iraqi said he reached amsterdam by ship and acknowledged he 
stood very little chance of being accepted as a refugee 
if theyre willing to listen ill tell my story he said 
if not the world is big enough

its a tough campaign for president 
barbed with polish humor between the earthy shipyard worker who 
founded solidarity and the somber laconic intellectual he chose as 
prime minister 
what do poles think of the contest between lech walesa and prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki in their first popular vote for the 
presidency 
some call it cham vs hamlet cham pronounced ham is 
polish for bumpkin 
others have asked will mazowiecki declare his candidacy before 
or after the election 
then theres the story of a problem walesa had when he wanted to 
reserve a burial site in jerusalem next to jesus christ 
he found the cost was 150000 it goes and said to his top 
aide i dont know krzysiek is it worth it for only three 
days 
the duel between eastern europes first noncommunist head of 
government and the man who gave him the job has rekindled interest 
in politics after months of handwringing by commentators over 
postcommunist apathy 
nearly all conversations turn sooner or later to the question of 
which one will occupy belweder palace seat of polish presidents 
a man was even killed in a drunken dispute with his soninlaw 
over who would be the better president the state news agency 
reported 
poland held parliamentary elections in june 1989 that were 
largely free and democratic local elections in may but this is the 
first real contest because solidarity candidates swept the earlier 
votes 
surveys indicate the two former solidarity allies are running 
about even 
other candidates have ventured into the ring including roman 
bartoszcze of the peasant party and wlodzimierz cimoszewicz of the 
social democrats formerly the communists but only walesa and 
mazowiecki are given a real chance 
if neither gets 50 percent of the votes nov 25 a runoff will 
be held dec 9 
part of the fascination stems from their contrasting styles 
walesa is electric speaking rapidly seeming to bob and weave 
through questions thrown at him from the crowd 
mazowiecki is grey on grey in the words of one newspaper 
shy and ponderous in speech but exuding character and moral 
authority 
walesa declared early and began an aggressive campaign 
immediately with meetings at factories where he is strong and 
with academics mazowieckis turf 
in the first three weeks of october walesa visited nine cities 
saw more than 100000 people and was seen by millions more on 
television local solidarity chapters organize his westernstyle 
rallies held outdoors or in large arenas with banners brass bands 
and deafening loudspeakers 
mazowiecki made his first campaign appearance oct 14 two weeks 
after walesa in the krakow philharmonic hall which seats only 800 
people instead of direct questions from the crowd he took written 
ones that were rephrased by his campaign spokesman 
the prime minister seems hesitant about contact with strangers 
hundreds of people waited outside the hall in krakow for two hours 
and mazowiecki rewarded them with only a few minutes on the 
balcony his stilted words of thanks barely audible through a 
bullhorn 
his dedication to his job evident in his tired careworn 
appearance earns sympathy even from people who say they will vote 
for walesa 
after becoming prime minister in august 1989 mazowiecki set a 
considered pragmatic course that won respect abroad and gave poles 
a sense of security against the sudden shocks of revolutionary 
change 
to many however mazowieckis government has seemed to drag its 
feet allowing former secret police to destroy records and keeping 
communist ministers in the government half a year after the party 
dissolved 
in his campaign walesa advocates faster change and has been 
quoted as intending to use a sharp axe to chop away vestiges of 
the old system 
he and mazowiecki also appear to disagree about policy toward 
the communist leadership when he took office the prime minister 
spoke of drawing a line between present and past but walesa has 
said he wants to settle accounts with those who have injured 
poland or stolen from it 
if walesa becomes president mazowiecki says he will join the 
opposition walesa replies that he already has five other 
candidates for prime minister 
critics accuse walesa of currying favor with the mob promising 
easy solutions he cannot deliver and becoming a demagogue who could 
abuse the stillfragile democracy and frighten off western 
investors 
ill vote for mazowiecki because under his presidency i can 
sleep peacefully adam michnik a former walesa adviser told a 
rally if someone knocks at my door at 5 in the morning it can 
only be the milkman 
walesa is as suitable to be president as i am to be a radio 
announcer michnik now editor of gazeta wyborcza polands 
leading daily newspaper said in a recent broadcast 
michnik spoke with his usual stutter 
walesa wished him luck in radio

marvin leath came to congress from the heart 
of texas with a country musicians soul and a bankers sense 
but after a dozen years in the house leath is calling it quits 
frustrated by the ability of an individual congressman to make a 
difference 
you see so much written in the media and so forth about 
people incumbents who get these jobs and they never leave and 
theyre an institution said the waco democrat 
people say nobody walks away from that job well somebody 
did he said and maybe that gives a little bit of faith to 
people who think the system is so totally corrupt and bad it 
really isnt 
in the early 1980s leath was a part of the group of 
conservative democrats called the boll weevils that supported a 
stronger defense and tax reform 
but he said defense spending ran amuck under president reagan 
and the deficits growth from 40 billion to more than 300 billion 
deeply distresses him 
most of the things i hoped to do the big issues we did 
something about but we did in excess leath said 
i really thought the 80s was going to be the decade that was 
the most critical in the countrys history he said perhaps it 
was but i think if you look back on that i have to think that as 
a government we blew it 
reagan didnt exert the leadership to make hard choices leath 
said noting the government wasnt designed for congress to make 
laws alone the hundreds of interests reflected by congress also 
frustrate its power he said 
you cant expect congress to develop national policy 
leath said youve got to have a strong president willing to 
take the political risks to solve the problems bush is much more 
prone to do that than reagan 
leath who made his fortune as a banker in marlin and waco is 
known as a pretty fair country music crooner and host of a popular 
annual barbecue 
you dont see a whole lot of those kinds of parties around 
here said rep charles stenholm dtexas who was elected in 
1978 from a neighboring district and was also a boll weevil 
this guy has star potential congressional scholar norm 
ornstein said of leaths singing 
leaths friend willie nelson has encouraged him to cut an album 
but leath said im a little bit old to go on the country music 
circuit at 59 leath is only two years older than nelson 
in congress leath closely followed the problems of the budget 
and financial industry from a seat on the house budget committee 
he voted against thrift deregulation in 1980 and argued that 
crisis in thrifts banks and insurance companies was caused by 
lawmakers foolish mistakes 
those of us who understood what the banking system was 
understood why we had some of the rules we had for 50 years we 
felt very reasonably assured when you destroyed those things that 
were necessary foundations this would happen leath said but 
you couldnt get anybody to listen to you 
leath will take about 484000 in leftover campaign funds with 
him when he leaves hell keep some for himself to repay expenses 
from that first campaign he said the rest will go to charity and 
political candidates i think that gives me a good way to stay 
involved in the system leath said 
he worried some about leaving constituents in the lurch 
particularly while fighting the armys decision to deactivate one 
of two armored divisions at fort hood in his district 
you can always say ive just got to do another term first 
thing you know youre a doddering old man leath said

jim devoes downhome deep voice and pot 
belly exude friendliness hes also pretty smart with an mba under 
his belt and hes good with numbers having worked in commercial 
loans for a big chicago bank 
the question is would you buy a used car from this man 
so many people have that usedcar dealer devoe is now selling 
his sales techniques to others 
every month dozens of dealers nationwide travel to this general 
motors corp factory town to hear the successful 46yearold native 
hoosier explain how they can make money selling used cars to 
customers with bad credit 
the threeday course outlines devoes buy herepay here 
philosophy a trade practice by which dealers provide the financing 
for customers the banks have turned away 
the car dealers today are having plenty of trouble and they 
need extra help said devoe who owns a chevroletcadillac 
dealership 
domestic car sales were off around 5 percent through early 
october over the previous year the prospect of a recession 
declining consumer confidence and high gasoline prices make it 
unlikely sales will rebound any time soon 
they are conditions that make buy herepay here all the more 
attractive devoe said 
he said as many as half of all car customers have some flaw in 
their credit profile that gets them rejected by banks perhaps 
theyve missed a loan payment or spent too little time in a 
community or on a job 
dealerships can set up their own lending operations that can 
finance a car purchase by these customers without as great a risk 
as a bank faces devoe said 
he gives this example involving a car selling for 2800 after 
taxes and a 300 downpayment a 2500 loan may be needed if the 
borrower doesnt pay the bank may get as little as 300 when the 
recovered car is resold and be stuck with a 2200 loss 
using that same example a dealer who may have paid only 1000 
for the car to begin with has only a 700 risk after taxes and 
downpayment with the car recovered and resold even at 300 his 
potential loss is only 400 
with a paying borrower the bank will profit from interest on 
the loan but the dealer gets interest plus the 1800 profit on 
the car at the time of the sale devoe said 
while customers get to buy a car when all seems lost they also 
pay dearly for the privilege 
interest rates many car dealers charge are well above market 
rates devoe said financing with consumer loantype rates as high 
as 25 percent is structured so the customer makes weekly or 
biweekly payments for one to three years on cars ranging in cost 
from 2995 to 5995 
devoe an mba from indiana university who worked in commercial 
loans for continental illinois bank amp trust in chicago has been 
selling cars for more than two decades he got his big break at his 
fathers dealership in marion 
devoe was attending a meeting in 1978 when another dealer told 
him about the buy herepay here plan and how it sold a lot of extra 
cars the idea became more appealing a year later when a recession 
began to set in 
devoe says an initial 19 newspaper ad grossed 8000 as cash 
flow grew devoes dealership graduated from cheaper cars and low 
sales volume to better cars and more profits 
we had to reinvent the wheel one spoke at a time during those 
10 years my god theres a lot to learn and a lot of mistakes to 
be made he said 
he started sharing those experiences with other dealers in his 
auto credit seminars beginning in 1986 he estimates more than 400 
dealer organizations and more than 2500 dealers have attended 
them 
for a 6295 fee a dealership can send as many employees it 
wants can return at any time and gets startup support a tour of 
the local gm stamping plant is thrown in for free 
ron tonkin former president of the national automobile dealers 
association said he was skeptical when he he first attended 
devoes program two years ago but he says he now has nine buy 
herepay here lots at his 10 dealerships in the portland ore 
area it took him 18 months to break even but now hes seeing 
profits 
anybody that is contemplating going into this i would 
definitely recommend they go to devoes school tonkin said 
devoe took his buy herepay here concept a step further last 
year when he created jd byrider systems a national buy herepay 
here company with 20 dealer franchises from wilmington del to 
greeley colo 
franchisees pay a 29000 fee a 3 percent royalty fee and 2 
percent for advertising 
with our experience in the business many of the dealers could 
use more support more training field men marketing programs done 
for them better operations manuals and so we feel like theres a 
big potential in franchising devoe said

joanna kerns took her work home with her when 
she was filming the nbc miniseries the big one the great los 
angeles earthquake 
her house is now earthquakeproofed she says 
miss kerns plays a us geological survey seismologist who 
fights to make public her evidence that a great earthquake will 
strike los angeles within a few days the fourhour show will be 
broadcast in two parts sunday and monday 
miss kerns who also stars in the abc series growing pains 
said she strongly identified with her character in the miniseries 
because she was torn between duty and cnncern for her family 
after the temblor strikes in the miniseries miss kerns sets out 
on foot across the ravaged city to find her daughter 
i was on stage during the whittier quake she said 
recalling an earthquake that measured 59 on the richter scale and 
killed eight people in october 1987 
my daughter ashley was visiting me on the lot she said 
all the stage lights started shaking everybody ran offstage a 
stage is a bad place to be because of all the heavy overhead 
lights all i could think of was where was my daughter when 
something like that happens you go back to basics 
making the miniseries nearly two years later helped her turn 
fear into resolve to be prepared for any future disaster in 
earthquakeprone southern california 
i had my house bolted to the foundation miss kerns said 
i had the hot water heater and all the heavy furniture bolted 
down i bought earthquake insurance i think people will learn a 
lot from this show its very responsible without hitting you over 
the head 
the big one also features ed begley jr dan lauria richard 
masur joe spano brock peters lindsay frost clarence gilyard jr 
and alan autry 
miss kerns in the role of seismologist claire winslow predicts 
a devastating earthquake but city officials fear an announcement 
will cause mass panic a real estate tycoon also tries to silence 
her long enough to unload his endangered property 
its compelling television despite the employment of every 
cliche in the disaster genre the husband whose career is 
jeopardized by his wifes outspokenness the overzealous assistant 
the television reporter who twists her words into new meanings and 
the weasellike official trying to conceal the prediction 
it also has an overlapping crisis with the attempted 
assassination of a man likely to become the first black prime 
minister of south africa what could have been an interesting 
subplot soon becomes ludicrous when the wouldbe assassin like 
wile e coyote just wont give up no matter how many buildings 
fall around him 
miss kerns said she modeled her character on lucile jones a 
us geological survey seismologist in pasadena calif 
when the last quake occurred lucy had to drop her child off 
at a day care center so that she could go to work she said 
shes very dedicated and believes in preparation 
miss kerns spent what she calls a relentless nine weeks 
working on the miniseries last summer 
it was a tough shoot she said in recent times ive done 
the preppie murder blind faith and those she left behind i 
directed a play im in deadly intentions ii which will probably 
come on in february i play the second wife with harry hamlin but 
with this we had such technical dialogue it has to roll off your 
tongue 
miss kerns is in her sixth season of growing pains in which 
she plays working mother maggie seaver the show also stars alan 
thicke as her husband and kirk cameron tracey gold jeremy miller 
and twins kristen and kelsey dohring as the baby sister 
i never thought they would cast me as the mother of a 
15yearold she said of her growing pains role i was too 
young id rarely done sitcoms i was a dramatic actress now i 
have the best of both worlds i have a choice of what i want to do 
the kids on the show are growing up and out of the house its 
hard to hide the fact that theyre growing up when jeremys now 
taller than i am 
miss kerns is unmarried in real life but said with a laugh 
im looking for a great guy with a great sense of humor who 
likes that im an actress 
not long before growing pains miss kerns thought she might 
become a writer she and a partner becky ayers have written a 
script for the show and she now is working on several writing 
projects 
i was tired of playing the dumb blonde she said i dyed 
my hair brown and did a lot of character roles i decided to write 
because i wanted something i could control i guess letting go 
helped because i got the series the four seasons after that 
things began to happen for me

for many of us the law is a giant firm called 
whereas habeus amp big fee full of dark mystery talk in strange 
tongues and blood oaths never to use a simple declarative sentence 
but help is on the way next year two new cable channels will 
debut one tentatively called american courtroom network the 
other definitely called in court 
the channels likely will disappoint perry mason fans used to 
watching a trial reach a critical phase and then hearing a 
prosecution witness suddenly shriek yes i killed him the 
swine and id do it again but they may enlighten viewers about 
our legal system 
both channels will televise criminal and civil trials live and 
on tape and try to explain the law to civilians the coverage 
wont be restricted to state courts either limited coverage of 
federal civil court trials also is in the wings 
therell be no judge wapners here 
presiding anchor for courtroom fred graham lawyer and 
former law correspondent for cbs news 
presiding analyst for in court arthur miller harvard law 
professor and contributor to abcs good morning america 
while each channel will do its best to keep things interesting 
it is a fact that even the most sensational murder case has long 
moments of mundane 
and it remains to be seen whether the public already used to tv 
coverage of key cases in state courts particularly by local 
stations and cable news network is ready for cables new heavy 
double dose of the living law 
the public may get some realmccoy law on at least one of the 
networks too albeit in a far smaller portion cbs news is 
considering a halfhour series on trial a taped condensed 
version of a trial from start to finish 
all this comes at time the four networks are rife with the 
makebelieve variety of lawyering viewers can choose from cbs 
the trials of rosie oneill abcs gabriels fire nbcs 
law and order and la law and fox broadcastings 
against the law 
be that as it may in court which says it plans to begin 
operations early next year will start with 14 hours of programming 
a day beginning at 6 am eastern time it plans to become a 
24hour operation in 1993 on weekends it will replay highlights 
from the previous week 
courtroom will offer law 24 hours a day though its chief 
steven brill wont say when next year it will start 
the nighttime half of courtoom will be a taped replay of each 
days coverage says graham a genial tennessean who is doubling as 
the operations managing editor 
although the channel is for people not lawyers he says 
with a perfectly straight face it will set aside saturday and 
sunday mornings for our legal ghetto shows basically by 
lawyers for lawyers 
i dont know he says when asked if theres room for two 
channels devoted to the same topic i certainly have heard plenty 
of people say that the logic runs against having two 
there is antilogic precedent the same question was raised last 
april when viacoms ha took on hbos the comedy channel in a 
multimilliondollar chuckles contest neither has folded yet and 
the battle continues 
it helps though that each is backed by corporations with deep 
pockets the same applies in the coming court fight on cable 
the owner of in court is a major cable company cablevision 
systems corp 
courtroom is a venture of time warner inc another major cable 
player and brill an attorney journalist and publisher of 11 
magazines including american lawyer their limited partnership is 
called american lawyer media 
the meat and potatoes of what were going to do is cover real 
courtroom trials says graham it will be a mix of live and 
taped 
the service wont confine itself to trial coverage though he 
says 
were going to be in all kinds of nooks and crannies of the 
judicial system he says from small claims court to liquor 
license hearings 
in court general manager dennis patton says his service 
primarily will offer live gaveltogavel coverage of important 
trials 
but it also will have nontrial segments on legal matters and 
issues hosted by veteran actor eg marshall 
in court also will start each weekday with a preview of the 
days coming cases and report state federal and international 
legal news in sort of a today show of law patton says 
both services already have begun taping trials some wellknown 
some not the latter includes a daterape trial that courtroom 
taped in atlanta 
in court covered the recent trial of 2 live crew and each 
caught cincinnatis equally publicized mapplethorpe obscenity 
trial 
fortyfive states now allow some form of tv coverage of courts 
although some allow cameras only in appellate courts graham says 
not all the states are equal in permitting trial coverage some are 
more restrictive than others 
for that reason he says his channel is concentrating on a 
core of about 13 states including california new york 
florida nevada and massachussetts that are quite liberal in 
letting us in 
next july the beady electronic eye of tv also will be allowed 
in federal courts in a limited threeyear test run the first break 
in a 53year ban on cameras and sound gear in those courts 
but only civil cases can be televised and only in six selected 
trial courts cameras also will be allowed in two federal appeals 
courts 
despite the restrictions graham who covered the supreme court 
during his 15 years at cbs sees even the limited tv peeps into 
federal court as a hopeful sign he even thinks tv may enter the 
nations highest court the supreme court possibly by 1994 
as preparations of the court channels continue so does a sort 
of reverse voir dire process in which the jury the nations cable 
system operators questions the opposing parties to decide if they 
want to carry either channel 
these jurors can challenge the cable petitioners for cause 
cause advertising revenue is down everywhere cause their profit 
margins keep shrinking or cause their systems lack the capacity 
for yet another new service 
all those factors make it especially difficult says erica 
gruen a cable analyst 
but hope springs eternal and not just in the court channels 
about 12 new cable channels from the cowboy channel to a 
24hour talk show channel plan startups from the fourth quarter 
of this year through next spring says gruen a vice president at 
saatchi amp saatchi advertising 
why despite the trying times of cable now she says the 
potential is tremendous thats what truly draws people in 
she still recalls a friend who a decade ago thought the idea 
of cnn was stupid he said who wants to watch news all day long 
 
begun in 1980 by ted turner the atlantabased 24hour channel 
now is seen in 57 million homes and offices and cnn says in 100 
countries

they joined because it paid well offered 
them a fine education and a nice home put them in a position of 
power and privilege 
to many working for the east german secret police was a 
glamorous and exciting way to make a living 
no longer the fear and obedience the socalled stasi once 
instilled have been replaced by open hostility the professions 
prized perks have slipped away 
peter kuntze now shovels coal on the college campus where he was 
once a highly paid professor of criminology an elite member of an 
exclusive club 
for 16 years he worked as a stasi detective who dissected 
information on his countrymen for nearly two decades after that 
he trained new generations of stasi officers 
now kuntze is a 54yearold laborer working in the boiler room 
that supplies heat to the old stasi spy school now a teachers 
college specializing in language and music 
i dont regret my work for the stasi said kuntze a father 
of five i only regret that i put my heart and soul into it im 
now in a position where i can only do unskilled labor 
dietrich fischer 52 once specialized in tracking down western 
spies a very analytical job he found quite exciting today 
the former stasi colonel works as headmaster of a kindergarten 
instead of foreign agents he keeps track of squealing children 
everyone thinks its comical he says smiling 
because of the stifling hold they kept on society because of 
the paranoia and dread they created the hatred for these people 
remains intense in what was east germany 
what to do with them is one of the deep social dilemmas 
confronting the united germany as it brings the old communist 
society the oppressed and the oppressors together into a free 
world 
contrary to popular belief most stasi agents are not hiding 
most are still out there mixing in the new society holding jobs 
or looking for them 
after years of serving as a governments iron fist on a cowed 
society however it is the oncefeared stasi who now fear the 
people 
one of the most cloistered pockets of this privileged elite used 
to be the old stasi officers college outside golm a small village 
about 25 miles southwest of berlin 
the school was a topsecret invitationonly training center 
that offered a broad education to only the brightest young officer 
candidates 
about 30 gray blocklike buildings stand on the end of a 
winding secluded road the campus is an incongruous icily 
intimidating mix of ivycovered walls and highsecurity fences 
the school was closed in january and turned over to the 
teachers college in nearby potsdam 
much of the old faculty still lives in a 30house neighborhood 
near campus a horseshoeshaped complex of neat homes with spacious 
yards and private car ports 
the people here say the land has been put in public trust to be 
sold their offers to buy their homes have been spurned the 
telephone system has been removed 
most of them personally deny the allegations of stasi brutality 
and corruption now chronicled daily in the german press all 
nations have secret services they say 
if someone says something against us its impossible to prove 
it wrong says kuntze people can say whatever they want 
kuntze joined the stasi in 1956 because the pay and 
opportunities were so good he said he specialized in collating 
information weighing its accuracy and value 
as a teacher he taught prospective stasi officers how to 
develop informants 
it was part of the work nothing negative he said 
unofficial sources were necessary to any secret service 
one of the stasis jobs was to check the pulse of public 
sentiment but kuntze said this information often was ignored or 
lost in labyrinthine bureaucracy 
if the information had been exploited in the right way there 
would have been changes that would have precluded last autumns 
revolution he said 
of the 85000 people who worked for the stasi about 
4500050000 were actual field agents each of whom had two or 
three paid informants in workplaces or schools he said 
former agents say potential stasi recruits were singled out 
early often as young as 13 
they were watched for years kuntze said people were excluded if 
they demonstrated an inordinate amount of fear gossiped too much 
or had relatives in the west 
ullrich heidenreich followed such a career path 
fashionably dressed and lounging in a handsomely furnished 
living room the 34yearold heidenreich and his wife martina 
could be any upwardly mobile young couple 
the son of a police officer he was recruited when he was 16 and 
joined two years later he worked as a stasi guard on the 
czechoslovak border then as an operative in karl marx city 
like other top recruits he was sent to school he was trained 
as a lawyer and became a professor at the stasi school 
unlike other teachers he found a job in his field after he was 
fired 
heidenreich now teaches law at a police academy in potsdam he 
teaches west german law which he spent nine months studying 
he does not expect to keep this job once a united german 
government takes a closer look at the people on its public 
payrolls 
but hes optimistic about finding new work 
people who are competent hold positions of responsibility 
he said people who are incompetent want us out those who have 
nothing try to drive the bright ones out by shouting stasi 
the couple are prepared to move west to advance their careers 
this virulent campaign against the stasi is really a symptom 
of the east he said in the west people are more realistic 
here there is too much emotion 
the former stasi captain has no qualms about shifting his 
ideology nor apologies about his past 
as long as you are socially well off you dont ask questions 
and you dont rock the boat he said 
im not saying i was convinced that what i did was wrong when 
i worked for the stasi i believed it was right he said im 
only saying that i can learn the new way 
communist party and stasi officials were well paid with 
tremendous perks and fine homes heidenreich said he and his wife 
have a lot of money but not as a much as people think 
kuntze fischer and heidenreich all made about 3000 marks 
about 1950 a month as teachers more than triple the average 
east german wage 
kuntze and fischer say they make about onethird that now 
heidenreich makes about 1900 marks 1250 
some have not done so well 
juergen kanis 34 has a law degree in a legal system that no 
longer exists a marxistleninist philosophy doctorate in a 
capitalist nation and no job in a free market 
kanis a father of two says he has lost three jobs in the last 
year because of his stasi past 
the stasi recruited him as farm boy and sent him to karl marx 
university it gave him a job and turned him into a teacher of the 
ideology that created it 
that was the way things were in those days kanis said 
if the cia came to you would you say no he asks

few sectors of east german society scaped the 
scrutiny of the stasi the communist secret police created an aura 
of paranoia that still lingers 
more than 85000 people were members more than twice that 
number were informers who worked in factories businesses and 
schools 
east german workers and students were broken down into small 
manageable work groups former agents say each such group contained 
at least one paid informant 
about 9000 stasi members monitored telephone conversations 
people considered to be nonconformists were denied good jobs and

democrats expect to improve their hold on the 
nations governorships this year but they face tough battles to 
wrest control of the largest states from the republicans 
ohio gov richard celeste the head of the democratic governors 
association predicts a net gain of one to four governorships for 
his party this year 
republicans who gained eight seats when many of these same 
governors were up four years ago would be content just to hold 
their own this time 
democrats have the upper hand in the nations statehouses going 
into the elections controlling 29 governorships to the gops 21 
but the party that controls the biggest states will be pleased no 
matter the outcome of the rest 
much more important than the raw number of gains or losses is 
which states go which way says political analyst charlie cook 
unlike house or senate seats all governorships are not created 
equal and it is the megastates this year that really count 
the reason is redistricting legislatures will draw new 
congressional district lines next year that may change of face of 
their us house delegations both parties would like to hold the 
veto stamp in states facing big gains or losses in their 
congressional delegations 
republicans control the governorships in four of the biggest 
states that are up this year california texas florida and 
illinois 
californias legislature will figure out how to distribute as 
many as seven new congressional seats next year based on the 
states population gain in preliminary census figures democrats 
control the legislature there and republicans say they need the 
governorship to ensure a fair map 
texas and florida will gain new house seats too while illinois 
stands to lose two seats 
in only one of those states florida is the incumbent seeking 
reelection florida gov bob martinez has come from behind to a 
virtual tie with democratic challenger lawton chiles the former 
senator 
the highstakes california race is considered deadlocked too 
republican sen pete wilson faces democrat dianne feinstein the 
former mayor of san francisco republican gov george deukmejian is 
retiring after two terms 
in texas flamboyant republican clayton williams has held a lead 
over democrat ann richards richards has pulled closer in recent 
polls however and has accused williams campaign of encouraging 
reports she once used drugs 
in illinois republican jim edgar once led in his bid to replace 
retiring gov jim thompson but in a reversal of normal tax 
rhetoric it is the democrat neil hartigan who has trumpeted a 
notax pledge to turn the race into a tossup 
among the democratic governors who control big states 
michigans gov jim blanchard has a substantial lead in his bid for 
a third term new york gov mario cuomo is a sure thing for 
reelection so is pennsylvania gov bob casey the most prominent 
antiabortion democrat 
in other contested states that democrats now control 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis retires reviled just two 
years after leading his party to presidential defeat democrat john 
silber a university president won the nomination in a repudiation 
of dukakis he leads his gop opponent although republican william 
weld is within striking distance 
republican george voinovich the former cleveland mayor leads 
in the ohio governors race where democrat celeste is retiring 
the democratic candidate anthony celebrezze has tried to make his 
support for abortion rights a deciding issue but celebrezze has 
been criticized for his dramatic switch from an abortion opponent 
late last year 
minnesota was a state republicans had hopes of reclaiming from 
democratic gov rudy perpich but republican jon grunseth has been 
rocked by allegations that he swam nude with teenage girls at a 
party nine years ago grunseth has backed up his denials with a 
polygraph test but he trails in the polls 
democrats are in danger of losing connecticut where gov 
william oneill is retiring the democratic nominee is running 
third behind former gop sen lowell weicker who is running as an 
independent 
in oregon another state where a democrat is retiring the 
race between republican dave frohnmayer and democrat barbara 
roberts is close 
republican incumbents are in danger in at least four states 
rhode island nebraska kansas and maine 
worst for republicans is rhode island where gov ed diprete is 
far behind democrat bruce sundlun who lost to diprete in the last 
two elections 
nebraska gov kay orr and her kansas neighbor mike hayden both 
have been in trouble for tax increases but both have narrowed the 
gap by which they trailed democratic challengers 
hayden has rebounded as his democratic opponent joan finney 
has struggled to explain her opposition to abortion recent polls 
have shown hayden winning the womens vote 
maines republican gov john mckernan has also made a partial 
recovery in the polls but still faces a tough race with joseph 
brennan a former governor who replaced mckernan in congress four 
years ago 
among other republican incumbents alabamas guy hunt and iowas 
terry branstad both hold leads against strong challengers 
republicans face uphill battles to hang on in oklahoma and new 
mexico where gop incumbents are retiring democrats expect to hang 
on to the arizona seat which they took over when republican gov 
evan mecham was impeached 
in alaska the entry of former gop gov walter hickel as 
thirdparty candidate has confused a tossup race former gop gov 
richard snelling leads in vermont where the democratic incumbent 
is retiring 
democratic incumbents have leads in polls or are rated likely 
winners in colorado hawaii maryland nevada tennessee idaho and 
wyoming republican incumbents are rated favorites in south

with voter outrage high and congress appearing 
incompetent house incumbents face the 1990 elections with anxiety 
political experts predict no more than marginal shifts in the 
democraticcontrolled house but caution that this years voting 
could hold some surprises 
theres clearly a pretty strong sense of anger out among the 
voters and it is directed both at politics and politicians as much 
as incumbents said geoff garin a pollster with the democratic 
firm of peter hart 
there is a sense that people in government only care about 
politics and not about whats right and wrong he said 
neil newhouse a pollster with richard wirthlins republican 
firm was more blunt the political environment is going to hell 
in a handbasket 
most of the action in the nations 435 congressional districts 
will be in the 29 races where there is no incumbent seeking 
reelection 
democrats have a lopsided advantage in that category they are 
defending 11 of the open seats while republicans must try to hang 
on to 18 districts the gop openings include 11 districts where 
otherwise safe republican house members decided to run for senate 
seats or statewide office 
there could be volatility among incumbents as well 
several already are threatened by association with the nations 
savings and loan scandal denny smith rore charles pashayan 
rcalif and frank annunzio dill 
rep arlan stangeland rminn is in trouble over using his 
official credit card to charge for hundreds of dollars worth of 
longdistance phone calls to a woman who worked for a lobbying 
company reps craig james rfla and stan parris rva have 
been targeted by strong democratic challengers who made an issue of 
their opposition to abortion 
the political year for incumbents has been a roller coaster of 
changing issues complicated by congress inability to finish its 
work and adjourn that has had the effect of compressing the 
campaign season to its shortest length since world war ii 
early in the year experts were pointing to strong prochoice 
votes on capitol hill and a newly invigorated womens lobby as 
signs that abortion would be a dominant issue in the elections in 
quick succession that issue was followed by politicking over the 
savingsandloan scandal flag desecration congressional ethics 
and campaign finance environmental protection vs jobs and the 
persian gulf crisis 
then came the governments paralysis over the budget leaving a 
bad taste that was likely to remain with voters even after final 
agreements were worked out for trimming the federal deficit 
the whole budget process has given voters a focal point 
for the frustration with government and politicians newhouse 
said 
both parties predict a democratic pickup of fewer than 10 seats 
padding the majority partys current 258 to 176 advantage but the 
volatility of the season could yield a far greater shift if angry 
voters go to the polls in a throwthebumsout mood 
among the hottest contests to watch on election day 
in washingtons 3rd district freshman rep jolene unsoeld has 
been squeezed by her stand for the endangered spotted owl and 
against the cutting of oldgrowth forests that are its home to 
mollify angry loggers she assumed the lead on an antiguncontrol 
issue in the house backed by the national rifle association 
republicans believe their candidate former state rep bob 
williams has an even shot at defeating her 
analysts say the fate of gop rep peter smith in vermont will 
be a good gauge of voter anger smith supported an early budget 
proposal that included heavy new taxes on home heating oil 
anathema in the northeast and his opponent socialist former 
burlington mayor bernard sanders was campaigning as an 
antiwashington populist even before it became fashionable if he 
pulls it off sanders would be the first socialist in congress in 
six decades 
another bellwether of antiincumbency will be in 
massachusetts where rep chester atkins is known as an abrasive 
and aloof figure atkins role as chairman of the democratic party 
in a state that is in open revolt against its establishment cannot 
help republicans have high hopes for their challenger state rep 
john macgovern 
several incumbents of both parties are in trouble simply 
because they represent politically polarized districts republicans 
james inhofe of oklahoma and john hiler of indiana and democrats 
james clarke of north carolina bill sarpalius of texas george 
brown of california and george sangmeister of illinois political 
analyst charles cook predicts that most of the undecided vote this 
year will go against incumbents which could hurt those in marginal 
districts 
former cincinnati mayor kenneth blackwell stands a good chance 
of being the first black republican in the house since 1935 
blackwell is in a tight race with current mayor charles luken 
whose democratic father rep thomas luken is retiring 
the idaho seat of republican rep larry craig who is running 
for the senate is up for grabs polls show democrat larry larocco 
a stockbroker and former senate aide deadlocked with gop state

angry voters have loaded state ballots with the most citizen 
initiatives in 76 years aiming to slash taxes clean the 
environment improve schools and limit the terms of politicians 
their oftensnappy nicknames big green son of jarvis 
the two percent solution belie the unusual stringency of many 
of the tax revolt environmental and political term limitation 
proposals to be decided on nov 6 
citizens across the country are feeling anger toward the way 
government is performing nd they are expressing that anger 
through the initiative process said john keast who monitors 
ballot measures for the free congress foundation a conservative 
research group in washington dc 
in all voters in 43 states and the district of columbia will 
decide 236 ballot questions according to the foundation the 
majority were referred to the ballot by state legislators 
more tellingly 67 are citizeninitiated ballot measures the 
most since the progressive era in 1914 when a record 90 appeared on 
state ballots 
voter wrath could be most keenly felt in massachusetts where 
passage of question 3 would result in the largest voterinitiated 
state tax cut in history 2 billion or 15 percent of the states 
budget opponents argue it would bankrupt poor school districts 
seriously damage others and lead to tens of thousands of state 
layoffs polls nonetheless show broad support 
taxing and spending limits appear on ballots in ten other 
states including nebraska where a proposed two percent 
solution would impose a 2 percent lid on state and local budget 
increases 
colorado and california voters will decide whether to limit the 
length elected officials can serve a proposed state ethics panel 
is also on the california ballot kansas city mo residents may 
limit city council terms 
arizonans will decide whether their state legislators deserve a 
raise to 24000 from 15000 
californians face their usual prodigious load of statewide 
measures 28 in all including questions ranging from saving 
ancient redwoods to raising alcohol taxes 
by far the most closelywatched initiative is proposition 128 a 
sweeping environmental issue called big green by backers 
including robin williams sylvester stallone and many other 
hollywood stars it would phase out pesticides known to cause 
cancer ban oil development in state waters ban chemicals that 
harm the ozone and require a dramatic reduction in emissions of 
gases that contribute to global warming 
important environmental issues are being considered in other 
states 
washington voters could require that state to set up boards 
mandating local land use planning 
oregonians may impose strict recycling codes and force the 
shutdown of the states only nuclear power plant 
missourians consider sweeping protections for ozark mountain 
streams 
new yorkers decide on a 2 billion environment bond 
south dakotans may limit black hills mining and restrict 
garbage dumping 
arizona and minnesota may dedicate portions of state lottery 
proceeds to preserving the environment 
another potentially explosive california measure dubbed son 
of jarvis in memory of howard jarvis father of proposition 13 
would forbid any tax increase without a twothirds legislative or 
electoral majority 
among noteworthy local california issues santa clara county 
will consider whether to finance a new stadium to lure the san 
francisco giants sacramento voters will decide on a citycounty 
merger that would make it the nations seventh largest county san 
franciscans will consider a domestic partners measure allowing 
nonmarried livein couples including homosexuals to register 
their relationships with city officials while affluent pacific 
grove may float a 12 million bond for a butterfly habitat 
meanwhile the course of school reform could be on the line in 
several states 
the most crucial in the eyes of the nations educators is 
oregons choice initiative allowing parents a 2500 tax credit 
for educating their children in anywhere they wish including 
private or parochial schools or even at home 
the bush administration applauds choice as a key to better 
schools but teacher unions and others in the education 
establishment are fighting to keep the measure from passing 
fearing it would unleash similar measures around the country to the 
detriment of public schools 
nebraskans will decide whether to repeal a tax reform passed 
last year aimed at shifting the burden of school financing from the 
property tax by increasing sales and income taxes 
in arizona proposition 103 the classroom improvement 
initiative would require the legislature to increase public school 
spending by 100 per pupil in each of the next 10 years the 
pricetag has been estimated at up to 6 billion 
in kansas voters will settle a political tug of war by deciding 
a proposed amendment that would in effect give the state 
legislature neartotal control over school governance stripping 
the state board of education and board of regents of much of their 
independence 
elsewhere 
oregon and nevada take up abortion rights issues 
arkansas considers a proposed lottery 
staten islanders decide whether to study a possible secession 
from new york city 
alaskans may recriminalize marijuana 
montanans may make their cigarette taxes the nations highest

the partisan makeup of the house for the next 
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year a 
they choose governors and state legislators these voters will be 
picking the powerbrokers for major redistricting battles 
the arcane redistricting process draws little attention from 
voters but national political parties are pouring millions of 
dollars and advice into state legislative races that often are 
ignored in washington except in years ending in zero 
redistricting occurs once a decade after the census bureau 
completes its decennial head count the population figures are used 
to redistribute us house seats among the 50 states and to redraw 
congressional district lines 
some 19 house seats are expected to shift as a result of the 
1990 census most of them will move from the democraticleaning 
northeast and midwest to the more conservative south and west 
where republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and 
presidential elections but lag behind democrats at the state level 
democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge 
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to 1992 when 
the party will try again to wrest control of the white house from 
the gop 
republicans for most of the 1980s touted their 1991 plan as 
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in 
the house but the gop now finds itself scrambling to defend its 
major redistricting power bases against formidable democratic 
challenges 
already the gop is threatening to press legal challenges to 
partisan plans it expects the democrats to craft 
were in position this year to successfully defend most if not 
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not 
more from the republicans said tim dickson executive director 
of the democratic partys redistricting arm project 500 
at stake is nothing less than control of the house through the 
year 2003 even modest democratic gains would cement republicans as 
the minority party for the foreseeable future 
party operatives say new computer analyses that mix census 
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly 
on redistricting to fashion nolose districts 
you can slice up a state and preordain the results with 
incredible accuracy said ben ginsberg the republican national 
committees chief counsel 
the republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from 
the frost belt to the sun belt after the 1980 census but democrats 
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of 
three seats 
the shifting is called reapportionment the census bureau term 
for deciding how many of the 435 house seats go to each state once 
thats done the states in most cases their legislatures take on 
the task of redistricting literally redrawing the lines of each 
congressional district 
there are 6144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states 
there are no legislative races this year in virginia new jersey 
mississippi and kentucky 
after years of exhaustive research the parties have narrowed 
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major 
redistricting battlegrounds primarily states that are gaining or 
losing seats 
fourteen of the shifting seats and their accompanying 
electoral votes in presidential elections will be gobbled up by 
california florida and texas 
in those states republicans now control the governors office 
but face stiff challenges this year 
at the legislative level in those states only control of the 
florida senate appears in question democrats enjoy sizeable 
advantages in both chambers of the texas and california 
legislatures and in the florida house 
republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the 
four seats they need to control the florida senate which would 
give the gop a voice in redistricting should republican gov bob 
martinez lose his reelection bid 
democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge 
the fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting 
loser new york focuses on the state senate where democrats need 
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting 
if that happens what you will see is blatant political 
gerrymandering said the rncs ginsberg 
he wont get an argument from democrats on that point 
the process is inherently political said democratic 
national committee redistricting guru mark bohannon it was 
designed that way to benefit winners 
president bush has visited new york to help the gops state 
senate effort and gov mario cuomo is working hard for the 
democrats new york likely will lose three of its 34 house seats 
democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining 
redistricting monopolies in pennsylvania indiana and michigan 
they hope to capture the senates in pennsylvania and michigan and 
both chambers in indiana where the gop has twoseat majorities in 
the house and senate with the ohio gubernatorial contest leaning 
republican democrats also are targeting the ohio senate where 
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state 
legislature 
the party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill 
odds in trying to erase slim gop majorities in both chambers of the 
arizona legislature and the colorado house 
democrats find themselves playing defense in the florida senate 
contests as well as in illinois where republicans need to gain two 
seats to capture the senate republicans also are trying to take 
over the lower chambers in pennsylvania and oregon needing a gain 
of three seats in each state 
the pennsylvania michigan illinois and ohio contests are 
particularly important because each of these states is likely to 
lose two congressional seats control over redistricting will 
decide which incumbents get squeezed 
the other likely losers are massachusetts new jersey west 
virginia kentucky iowa louisiana kansas and montana those 
eight states will lose one seat each according to preliminary 
census data 
the redistricting winners are led by california which should 
gain seven seats and see its house delegation grow to 52 floridas 
expected gain of four would bring its house delegation to 23 the 
likely pickup of three seats by texas would swell its 
representation in the house to 30 
together these states would supply 24 percent of house members 
and hold 105 electoral college votes 38 percent of the 270 needed 
to win the white house 
the other gainers expected to pick up one seat each likely 
will be virginia north carolina georgia arizona and washington 
heading into the elections there were just four states idaho 
kansas new hampshire and south dakota in which republicans have 
outright control over state government and none of them are 
considered major redistricting battlegrounds 
democrats on the other hand hold the governors office and 
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of 
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others

the sharp fall in oil prices has wiped out most 
of the war premium whipped up by the persian gulf crisis but 
consumers shouldnt expect much of a break at the gas pump 
immediately 
home heating oil will probably be even slower to fall at the 
retail level analysts said tuesday as critics of the oil industry 
renewed their cries of pricegouging 
those who follow the pricing of oil and refined petroleum 
products say that although rising crude prices usually bring rapid 
increases in consumer prices drops in crude usually dont work 
their way into the retail level for a few weeks 
product prices tend to lag said philip l dodge an analyst 
with nomura securities international inc people who have 
established those high prices tend to give them up grudgingly 
oil prices in the futures market have tumbled from a peak above 
40 to less than 30 per barrel as signs of a peaceful solution to 
the gulf standoff have proliferated 
light sweet crude for december delivery was pegged at 2937 per 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange at the close of trading 
tuesday 
dodge predicted retail gasoline prices will dip a bit in the 
near future while home heating oil might even go up largely for 
seasonal reasons 
on gasoline normally it would come down at this time of year 
anyway dodge said heating oil would be the reverse 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 retail gasoline prices have 
gone up about 305 cents per gallon according to an american 
automobile association survey tuesday that showed pump prices were 
rising even as crude oil was falling over the past week home 
heating oil costs in the northeast are likewise running about 30 
cents to 40 cents per gallon higher than they were at the same time 
last year 
i cant imagine much decrease said thomas blakeslee an 
energy analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
its usually a lag of about two or three weeks 
big oil companies say they are not to blame for any 
pricegouging at the pump because they cant control what gas 
stations choose to charge 
there have been quite clear indications that the price of 
gasoline has not gone up quite as rapidly as crude oil said gus 
ensz a spokesman for the american petroleum institute the leading 
industry group some of the marketers have been saying they have 
not been making what they should be making 
if thats the case it might not be surprising if they wait a 
little before they try to cut their prices ensz said from apis 
headquarters in washington 
critics nonetheless contend that oil compnnies are taking 
advantage of consumers 
at buyers up a ralph nader consumers group in washington 
research director christopher dyson said home heating oil prices 
have remained virtually unchanged after oil took its big fall 
prices have gone down 1 cent a gallon here in the greater 
washington area even though crude oil prices have gone down about 
10 a barrel so far dyson said it may drop more but theyre 
taking their time a lot of it is just sort of gouging prices 
should fall more than a penny after a 10 drop 
sen joseph i lieberman dconn calls the recent high oil 
prices a theft of billions of dollars from workers and businesses 
across the country 
lieberman has organized a series of senate government affairs 
committee hearings into oil pricing that will begin thursday in 
washington he hopes to outlaw pricegouging during times of

richard a kirk once donned a star trek 
costume and played the part of capt kirk to lead a chamber of 
commerce campaign in his hometown of denver 
as the new president of the american bankers association he is 
walking into a situation that may make him wish he was in another 
universe 
kirk who was installed as aba president tuesday becomes the 
chief spokesman for an industry that is suffering from a weakened 
economy losses by some of its most hallowed institutions eroding 
consumer confidence and the likelihood of tougher government 
regulation 
i think its going to be a particularly challenging year 
kirk said in an interview at the abas annual convention a 
fiveday affair that concludes today 
kirk chairman of the united bank of denver said one of his 
main tasks is to take steps to restore confidence in the banking 
industry 
he maintains that the industry is fundamentally sound and its 
problems have been exaggerated in the public eye since the banks 
having serious problems include some of the nations most 
wellknown institutions 
kirk said the banks also have been unfairly tainted by the 
savings and loan crisis 
my primary agenda item is to work on confidence in banking 
its an area i feel strongly about 
kirk is annoyed by the suggestion that banks are going through 
one of the worst times in the industrys history an opinion that 
has been frequently aired in the media in the wake of third quarter 
earnings reports that showed losses for many banks and sharply 
declining profit levels for others 
that is clearly incorrect he said banks may have been in 
worse shape in 1985 there were more failures agriculture was 
having problems 
he said his home state is an example of an area that is now 
showing economic improvement 
we had an eight year recession in colorado denver is now on a 
rebound kirk said the southeast and the northeast are having 
problems they can be dealt with 
with the national economy teetering on the brink of a recession 
or as some economists say already there kirk said confidence 
in the banking system is imperative 
it appears to me when the public reads in the newspapers about 
the real estate bust about the problems large banks are having it 
starts to raise questions whats my bank like thats a very 
serious situation kirk said 
i dont think its healthy for the nation to worry about their 
banks being in good condition 
kirks star trek getup came in 1987 for a greater denver 
chamber of commerce membership drive he said he doesnt plan any 
such gimmicks for the aba though he wants to spread the word that 
the industry is healthy 
kirk said he hopes aba members will spread that message in their 
own communities 
kirk said banks are in far better shape than the savings and 
loan industry banks he said have more capital better regulation 
and stronger insurance 
its very important for us to keep people aware of those 
differences he said 
the federal government wants banks to increase their capital as 
a cushion against bad loans that is just one of several regulatory 
areas apt to be changed on kirks watch at the aba 
kirk whose association has one of the nations most powerful 
political action committees said hes unfazed by the prospects 
its almost a sure bet we will get some significant banking 
changes in congress next year maybe earlier he said were 
well positioned to deal with these issues

former drexel burnham lambert inc chief 
frederick joseph testified against the man who led the firm to wall 
street stardom as the government finished the second phase of its 
presentencing case against michael milken 
also tuesday the former president of an important drexel 
junkbond customer said milken offered him a personal investment in 
a 1985 takeover after his company bought a large stake in the deal 
the testimony by richard grassgreen was important because it was 
the first indication milken may have directly given big clients 
equity in the leverage buyout of storer communications inc 
taking the stand nearly four years after drexel and milken were 
linked to wrongdoing in the governments insider trading probe 
joseph said milken may have violated company policies related to 
storer investments and misled him 
government charges against milken are being aired at a 
presentencing hearing before us district judge kimba wood 
prosecutors claim milken broke the law beyond criminal charges to 
which he has pleaded guilty and deserves a lengthy prison term 
the hearing is to resume thursday with testimony on the last of 
three alleged illegal transactions involving trading in caesars 
world inc securities in 1983 a sentencing date has not been set 
grassgreen formerly president of kindercare inc testified as 
part of his own agreement to plead guilty to two felony charges 
related to pocketing up to 500000 from investments made by his 
company 
tuesdays testimony focused on the 25 billion buyout of storer 
by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co for which drexel provided 
financing in late 1985 
prosecutors claim milken misappropriated valuable storer equity 
warrants or rights to purchase storer stock and used them to lure 
customers into buying riskier storer securities 
under questioning from assistant us attorney john carroll 
grassgreen said that after committing kindercare to buying 5 
million in preferred stock in storer he was told by a drexel 
executive about the warrants 
when grassgreen asked whether kindercare could buy some of the 
warrants he said milken told him no its for you and perry 
referring to kindercare chairman perry mendel 
grassgreen testified he believed he was offered the warrants 
because of his longstanding relationship with drexel and the 
companys role in the storer deal 
but grassgreen contradicted testimony last week by drexel 
executive thomas connors also none of six government witnesses on 
storer directly backed the bribery charge against milken 
grassgreen said under crossexamination by defense lawyer arthur 
liman that milken was unaware of grassgreens lawbreaking and that 
all investments made with drexel in a relationship dating to 1978 
were based on merit 
grassgreen has agreed to plead guilty to pocketing commitment 
fees paid by drexel to kindercare for investing in four takeover 
deals and to failing to disclose his personal stake in storer to 
his company he resigned last week as president of montgomery 
alabased enstar group inc kindercares successor 
milken 44 pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to 
illegal trading and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties he 
faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment 
joseph testified under drexels agreement to cooperate with the 
government in settling criminal charges last year drexel now is in 
chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
he said he did not learn about a drexelrelated investment 
partnership known as macpherson investment partners that was formed 
out of the storer deal until 1988 
macpherson consisted of drexel clients money fund managers 
drexel employees and a trust in the name of the children of both 
milken and his brother lowell who also worked for drexel 
joseph said the stake for the trust for the milkens children 
should have been disclosed to executives of the firm because of 
drexels role in creating and trading the securities disclosure 
was required to ensure the investment complied with federal and 
firm rules 
joseph said he believed the decision to give partnership stakes 
to fund managers whose institutions bought risky storer securities 
also violated drexel guidelines against giving favorable 
treatment to institutional investor accounts 
joseph also said that he asked milken in the fall of 1988 
whether any fund managers had invested in drexel partnerships and 
milken said no 
under crossexamination joseph said that drexel employee 
partnerships had taken equity stakes in other leveraged buyout 
deals 
joseph also conceded that milken was not responsible for 
determining whether investments needed to be disclosed and that 
milken routinely consulted drexel executives about personal 
investments

american airlines is planning expansions of its 
hub in san juan puerto rico and some other caribbean operations 
despite economic conditions that have left its 1990 performance 
shaky 
even in the worst of times there are opportunities to be 
found out there american chief executive robert crandall said as 
he announced the 100 million expansion tuesday 
the caribbean has been strong for us in good and bad times 
he said 
over the next four years american plans to add 10 gates for a 
total of 25 at luis munos marin international airport and a customs 
facility capable of processing 5000 passengers an hour 
its terminal area will total more than 1 million square feet 
when the expansion is done up from 260000 square feet 
a looming recession and higher jet fuel prices are likely to 
dent americans 1990 earnings crandall said last week when the 
companys third quarter profit drop of 52 percent was announced 
unless fuel prices decrease significantly crandall warned a 
fourthquarter loss was almost assured and could be large enough to 
wipe out the companys 1755 million profit in the first three 
quarters 
but americans vice president for the caribbean peter dolara 
said air traffic in that region will likely remain strong even if 
it slows in the continental united states 
the demand for air travel is less elastic in the caribbean 
because a large share of passengers live in the region and are 
flying to visit friends and relatives on other islands dolara 
said few of them have other travel options besides flying he 
said 
in addition continental us passengers who vacation in europe 
typically turn to the caribbean as a less costly alternative during 
a recession dolara said 
lee howard chief executive officer of airline economics inc 
said american is one of the few carriers that can make a 
substantial capital commitment such as the san juan expansion in 
a recession and fuel crisis 
american will emerge probably a relatively stronger carrier 
because some of the weaker ones will have gone by the wayside in 
the same time frame howard said 
united airlines which jockeys with american as the nations 
largest carrier also made a major capital commitment tuesday 
united will spend 400 million to purchase most of pan ams routes 
between the united states and london 
american began service in 1986 to the caribbean and the region 
now accounts for about 12 percent of its routes and slightly more 
than 12 percent of its revenues crandall said 
when new route additions are completed in december american 
will have 58 daily flights to 26 destinations from san juan 
american eagle its regional affiliate will have 68 daily flights 
to 15 destinations 
the airline eventually may operate 200 flights daily in san 
juan crandall said 
in addition to the terminal improvements in san juan american 
will also help pay for a roadway expansion and new control tower at 
the airport the company plans smaller capital improvements at st 
thomas santo domingo st croix st maarten puerto plata 
montego bay and kingston 
the airline recently opened a 10 million reservations office in 
san juan that eventually will employ 200 people

canadians abhor being seen as following in 
american footsteps and this time they got out in front by 
officially tumbling into recession on their own the united states 
however may nt be far behind 
finance minister michal wilson after weeks of dodging the dread 
r word finally acknowledged to a house of commons committee 
monday night that canada had slipped into a recession though he 
expected it to be short 
the countrys largest bank the royal bank of canada also 
predicted negative growth for the third and fourth quarters of this 
year saying a slow recovery would begin next year 
wilson said the current recession would be nothing like the 
198182 version which involved a precipitous drop into a black 
hole 
the partial information that is now available for the third 
quarter together with some major work stoppages the crisis in the 
middle east and the weakening us economy suggest a further 
decline in output wilson said however we do not expect this 
to be a severe recession 
dr edward neufeld chief economist at the royal bank said the 
current situation differed from the 198182 recession in that the 
economy since 1988 has slipped slowly into economic malaise and 
will work its way out slowly 
neufeld said the canadian economy has never gone into recession 
when the american economy did not no matter how far back you want 
to look 
some economists says the us economy already is in recession 
others say it will hit recession in the fourth quarter of this 
year and still others predict the united states will escape 
recession by a narrow margin 
the opposition in the canadian parliament has blamed the 
conservative governments policy of high interest rates an effort 
to cure inflation for the recession 
recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarters of 
negative growth the canadian economy shrank 04 percent in the 
second quarter of 1990 and wilson predicted there would be 
negligible growth for four quarters 
consumers will be looking over the next year or so at no 
increase in their standard of living neufeld told a group of 
reporters at an economic briefing 
he said it would be a period when consumers pay tremendous 
attention to managing their financial affairs and a time to 
focus on keeping your job if you have a good one 
canadians seem to have the word already retail sales in august 
were down 02 percent from july as consumers spent less on 
bigticket items such as vehicles furniture and appliances 
according to statistics canada the governments number crunchers 
the royal banks forecast said unemployment probably would rise 
from the current 84 percent to about 9 percent at the peak of the 
downturn 
statistics canada figures showed a drop in the composite leading 
indicator for the sixth straight month corporate profits have 
plunged 23 percent below a year ago and personal bankruptcies are 
37 percent above 1989 
canadian inflation has dropped from 55 percent in january to 
41 percent in august but that at the cost of extremely high 
interest rates the rates have been edging down a bit recently the 
prime lending rate has gone from 1475 percent to 1375 percent 
various business groups have been pleading with prime minister 
brian mulroneys government to get a handle on the deficit 
the latest plea came this week from the canadian manufacturers 
association which has created a new competitiveness index 
measuring labor productivity wholesale prices and exports 
laurent thibault president of the association said much of the 
prosperity of the 1980s has been built on an accumulated mountain 
of debt 
the last canadian budget forecast a deficit of 242 billion 
us for the 199091 fiscal year wilson said recently it will be 
850 million to 13 billion higher than that 
the majo policy issue in the united states and canada is the 
fiscal deficit said the royal banks neufeld in addition to 
that we are building up a load of debt to foreigners that is 
finally becoming uncontainable 
the government and the country biggest bank agree the present 
slowdown is the price to pay for a decade of prosperity and that 
the shallow economic dip should be over by the end of 1991 
all the predictions however assume there will be no shooting 
war in the middle east 
a disruption of middle east oil flows would have a devastating 
effect on the economy and you could forget all my forecasts said 
neufeld

southland corp filed early today for protection 
from its creditors along with a reorganization plan that would 
clear the way for selling control of the nations largest 
convenience store operator to a japanese group 
the parent of the 7eleven convenience store chain said its debt 
and preffered stock holders have approved the socalled prepackaged 
reorganization plan which is being submitted for confirmation by 
the federal bankruptcy court 
the company has been trying to avoid filing for protection under 
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since march when it announced it 
would sell a majority stake to itoyokado co ltd and seveneleven 
japan co ltd its japanese franchisees 
the japanese investors would provide 430 million in new cash in 
exchange for a 70 percent stake in common stock in the reorganized 
company 
the restructuring would leave the creditors with far less than 
they loaned the firm in 1987 when the founding thompson family took 
the company private 
dallasbased southland has struggled under the debt incurred in 
the 49 billion leveraged buyout the company also faces 
increasing competition from proliferating convenience stores run by 
major oil companies 
the company said today that a syndicate of lenders has agreed to 
provide southland up to 400 million in debtorinpossession 
financing 
southland spokeswoman cecilia stubbs norwood said the company 
intends to use the funds as working capital to purchase necessary 
inventories and to continue the companys other normal operating 
activities 
the company said that of those security holders voting on the 
prepackaged reorganization plan about 89 percent of the 
outstanding principal amount of debt securities and approximately 
90 percent of the outstanding shares of preferred stock were voted 
in favor of the plan 
southland has asked for a bankruptcy court hearing on dec 10 
for the confirmation of the prepackaged reorganization plan 
ms norwood said the proposed prepackaged bankruptcy plan 
consists of two parts exchange offers and a cash infusion by the 
japanese partners 
under the exchange offers existing shareholders primarily the 
thompson family would retain a 5 percent equity position 
bondholders would receive 25 percent of the common stock and the 
japanese would purchase 70 percent of the companys common stock 
she said 
creditors reportedly like the bankruptcy plan because they 
believe it could bring a quick resolution to their uncertainty 
companies have begun using such prepackaged plans to shorten the 
time it takes for them to emerge from bankruptcy 
the company also said it is immediately filing motions in 
bankruptcy court to seek approval to assume existing 7eleven 
franchises and area licensee agreements pay employee salaries and 
wages and continue existing employee benefit plans and pay 
prepetition debt in full to all suppliers who agree to provide the 
company with customary credit terms during the bankruptcy case 
in the light of the results of the exchange offers and the 
high level of support we have received for our prepackaged 
reorganization plan we believe this is the best alternative to 
complete a financial restructuring quickly said clark matthews 
southlands chief financial officer we hope to obtain court 
approval of the prepackaged reorganization plan as soon as 
possible 
upon confirmation of our plan and consummation of our new 
stock purchase agreement we will go forward with a more manageable 
debt load as well as the capital we need to remain at the top of 
the competitive convenience retailing industry matthews added 
members of the thompson family were not available for comment 
ms norwood said 
southland operates about 6800 7eleven stores and other 
convenience outlets in the united states and canada with another 
6000 stores in the united states and 21 other countries run by 
licensees of which seveneleven japan is the largest

with chrysler corp were pleased to learn that canadian auto 
workers union officials think a contract with chryslers canadian 
subsidiary may be near 
the uaw and the canadian auto workers are pressing chrysler and 
its chrysler canada ltd subsidiary to agree to contracts mirroring 
agreements already reached with general motors corp ford motor 
co and their canadian operations 
chrysler and its canadian subsidiary have hinted they may not be 
able to agree to a pattern agreement ratified by gm and ford 
workers 
on monday chrysler canada gave the caw an economic proposal caw 
president bob white called a great relief the caw has set a 
midnight thursday deadline 
analysts said the proposal from chrysler canada may signal that 
the parent corporation is more willing to go along with the uaw 
pattern agreement than it had indicated the caw represents about 
10000 chrysler workers in canada 
on tuesday a uaw official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said i didnt see any long faces around here after 
whites remarks 
company spokesman lee sechler declined to say tuesday if 
negotiators had made headway in the talks 
the uaw has set no deadline for its talks with chrysler the 
union represents about 63000 active chrysler workers in the united 
states 
the detroit free press today quoted unidentified union officials 
as saying that a monday strike deadline could be set today 
meantime the detroit news reported today uaw president owen 
bieber told union bargainers hes hoping for a settlement by the 
first of next week the news said neither bieber nor uaw vice 
president stan marshall in charge of the unions chrysler 
department said anything about setting a strike deadline 
bieber set up shop monday morning at chryslers headquarters in 
the detroit enclave of highland park he met with chrysler vice 
president anthony st john said the uaw source 
there have been no formal sessions at the main negotiating 
table company and union officials said as negotiators have been 
bargaining in subcommittees that focus on specific provisions in a 
contract 
chrysler and its canadian subsidiary have said for months that 
meeting the pattern agreement reached with the other two automakers 
would be difficult 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca and other executives while 
falling short of demanding concessions have said the struggling 
company needs special consideration

that may wipe out the 251 million it earned in the first six

finaniial institutions in connection with stock manipulation linked 
to koshin a group under investigation for the last two years 
a former sumitomo bank branch manager was arrested earlier this 
month for allegedly providing illegal loans to the group two top 
bank executives resigned over the case and the bank ordered

wheat and corn futures prices were slightly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade amid 
speculation the soviet union wants to import more grain soybean 
futures were mostly lower 
the expectations of new grain sales to moscow stem in part from 
reports the soviet union has chartered freight vessels that now are 
situated off the us canadian and argentine coasts said william 
biedermann director of research with the commodities brokerage 
allendale inc 
he said there was talk in the markets that the soviets were 
considering buying 600000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
soybeans edged lower in quiet trading inspired more by technical 
factors than supplyanddemand fundamentals biedermann said 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 264 a

the goodyear tire amp rubber co today said it 
planned to cut 3000 jobs by mid1992 as part of a restructuring 
spurred on by a depressed tire market and a 614 million loss in

quarter 
in september the company warned various factors would lead to a 
loss for the quarter 
goodyear earned 705 million or 122 per share in the 1989 
third quarter 
the loss reflected 517 million or 89 cents per share in 
unusual charges for restructuring the costs resulted from 
realignment of european tire marketing phaseout of medium and 
heavy truck tire production in quebec 222 million in 
environmental cleanup costs and depreciation of the all american 
pipeline system 
about 3000 jobs will be cut to reduce goodyears worldwide 
staff to 106000 by mid1992 as part of the restructuring chairman 
tom h barrett said in a message to shareholders 
the company also blamed the loss on increased selling 
administrative and general expenses severe competitive pricing in 
the tire replacement market reduced auto and truck production and 
production cutbacks to reduce inventories 
thirdquarter revenue rose 82 percent to 29 billion from 
268 billion a year earlier 
for the first nine months of 1990 goodyear reported a loss of 
499 million or 86 cents per share the company earned 1921

sears roebuck and co today reported a 30 
percent drop in thirdquarter ear straight 
quarterly decline in nings the thirdprofits for the retailing and financial 
services giant 
sears blamed the weak thirdquarter performance mainly on lower 
gains from property sales in its coldwell banker real estate 
subsidiary 
the companys struggling retailing division posted a 76 percent 
gain in the third quarter after suffering a decline in the second 
quarter and a loss in the first 
chicagobased sears reported overall earnings of 1792 million 
or 53 cents a share for the three months ending sept 30 compared 
with 2575 million or 75 cents a share in the same period a year 
ago 
total revenues rose 59 percent to 1396 billion from 1318 
billion in the third quarter of 1989 
coldwell bankers operating income fell tlittle 
sense because the poor dont have any money if they had money 
they wouldnt be poor 
republicans who cry out against class warfare are not 
against class warfare when it involves the middle class being 
forced by law to subsidize the rich they oppose warfare or even 
unpleasantness against their own class because it might result in 
losing a few bucks 
raising the income tax will not remove the motivation to be 
rich as sophie tucker put it rich is better no matter what 
the tax rate the worst thing higher upperbracket taxes might do 
is convince financial wheelerdealers and lawyers to work a little 
less hard a blessing to every life form on this planet 
interest on the national debt is the fastest growing 
entitlement program in the budget it is money we bale up and 
ship off to international bankers to pay for the phony prosperity 
of the days when it was morning in america 
if we dont do something soon there wont be any arguments over 
guns vs butter there will be none of either our money will go 
straight to our creditors like a family with 100 credit cards all 
past due

greenwood miss commonwealth on the budget 
president bush personally and members of congress collectively 
are losing the confidence of the nation as they drag out their 
feuding and quarrelling over a deficitreducing budget 
the democrats say tax the rich the republicans say cut federal 
expenditures 
we would go with the republicans but both may be a little 
right the nations wealthiest taxpayers are being taxed at a much 
smaller percent of their total incomes than they were a decade ago 
meanwhile as congress debates the federal deficit continues to 
rise interest rates remain high and this massive federal 
borrowing is depleting the economic vigor of america 
why not cut the military the cold war is over the soviet 
union with its failing economy is in far worst shape than the 
united states the soviets obviously are not bent on military 
confrontation with the west 
why more than 300000 us troops in germany world war ii has 
been over for 45 years germany an economic powerhouse has 
reunited the soviet union intends to withdraw its troops from what 
used to be east germany and the germans are going to pay for the 
withdrawal moreover while europe was exhausted and in ruins after 
world war ii today europe is stronger than ever through the 
european community the nations of europe are prospering so why are 
us troops needed to protect a dynamic europe 
it is true the military operation in the persian gulf will 
require a substantial expenditure so long as it lasts we are still 
assuming however that this is not a permanent military 
commitment that it will be worked out in time and the us troops 
will come home 
 
oct 18 
the daily journal elizabeth nj on the budget 
as us sen bill bradley dnj points out this budget 
crisis didnt happen overnight the executive and legislative 
branches have ignored a growing deficit for more than a decade and 
now facing the catastrophic results of grammrudman they snivel 
and bicker 
bradley estimates that we could easily cut 250 million from 
defense spending over the next five years and still maintain a 
strong military in a regional crisis like the persian gulf 
but congress resists the house has delayed by two years defense 
secretary dick cheneys proposal to shut down 35 bases in the us 
and 12 overseas the move affects more democratic districts than 
republican and thus parochial house representatives undermine the 
deficit reduction process 
over the next few days the president and congress must discard 
hidden agendas special interests and partisan politics they have 
a job to do and america tires of their stall tactics

las cruces nm sunnews on inflation 
inflation is a lot like flu even when its not around theres 
a feeling that its lurking somewhere just waiting for an 
opportunity to strike again 
for two months now the cost of living has risen sharply if the 
situation worsens we could return to the days of doubledigit 
inflation 
usually inflation can be blamed on a number of factors but its 
recent upsurge could largely be attributed to one single villain 
saddam hussein the inflation spurt was caused largely by the jump 
in the price of oil which was precipitated by saddams invasion of 
kuwait 
the future does not look promising still we have blundered our 
way through other messes the us economy is under siege but it 
is still a very tough customer at this point we can still keep 
our fingers crossed and hope for the best

magazine publishers say theyve found a way to 
beat the high cost of delivering theyre doing it themselves 
a few small alternative magazine delivery systems have popped up 
over the last few years but now one of the industrys heavy 
hitters time warner inc has entered the picture 
the publishing industry says if times system prospers more 
companies could follow and eventually provide significant 
competition for the us postal service 
theres no question what the motivation here is said george 
gross an executive vice president of the trade group magazine 
publishers of america by building a distribution system you are 
saying to the postal service that while there is no alternative 
now in time there will be 
the magazine industry has been complaining for year that rising 
postal rates have been cutting into their profits postmaster 
general anthony frank has acknowledged that postal rates have 
increased beyond general inflation and he has vowed to slow the 
pace 
but the postal service maintains it can do a better job of 
delivery than alternative systems such as publishers express for 
which time warner is the managing partner eight other equity 
partners are involved in the project 
begun in atlanta last year on a trial basis publishers express 
now is delivering more than 100000 magazines catalogs and 
advertisement packages a month to more than 80000 households 
within five zip codes the company has set a goal of 200000 pieces 
a month to 100000 households by the end of the year 
from a suburban atlanta facility delivery crews sort 24 titles 
including time sports illustrated tv guide the atlantic 
monthly and playboy and deliver them in sealed packages before 
dawn each day 
publishers express cannot use mailboxes under federal law the 
magazines and catalogs are delivered to doorsteps or left at the 
base of a mailbox 
if you look at the magazine business distribution is the only 
cost we dont have control over said howard rosen president of 
publishers express but its very tough to tell the post office 
you dont like their pricing structure theyd say fine but 
youve got nowhere else to go 
since 1970 rosen said the cost for second class postage 
which is the rate for newspapers and magazines has risen 811 
percent compared to a general inflation rate of 209 percent over 
that time third class postage the rate for most catalogs has 
gone up 364 percent he said 
the postal service puts the figures a bit lower 767 percent for 
second class and 247 percent for third class 
nonetheless rosen said its too cost prohibitive to 
distribute our products through the post office 
in addition to titles published by time warner the distribution 
service has contracted with other magazines and catalogs to deliver 
their products rosen said the titles in the designated zip code 
areas are automatically distributed through publishers express 
though consumers may request that the postal service take over 
their service 
postal service spokesman bob hoobing said costs may be higher 
but service is reliable 
the fact of the matter is we have people who are career 
workers delivering the mail we think were more reliable he 
said 
hoobing declined to speculate on the impact of such alternative 
delivery services he said about 65 percent of the 1616 billion 
pieces of mail handled last year by the postal service was second 
class 
if future postal rate increases continue to pinch there will 
be more magazines saying to time we want to join you said 
gross of the magazine publishers of america 
kofie q dadzie an assistant marketing professor at georgia 
state university who specializes in distribution systems said an 
operation such as times would have to handle an enormous amount of 
material to make its costs competitive with the post office 
id be interested in finding the cost analysis that said it 
would be cheaper dadzie said im surprised 
rosen declined to disclose publishers express income but he 
acknowledged the distribution system must expand if it is to do the 
job of the post office at a lower cost 
clearly at the scale were at we are not in a competitive 
price situation with the post office he said we need to 
double our volume it can be reached within the next year or 
two

the du pont co on wednesday reported a 
3 percent drop in thirdquarter earnings with increases in its 
petroleum operations offset by slower growth in the companys 
chemicals businesses 
the company reported net earnings of 533 million in the quarter 
ended sept 30 down from 547 million last year earnings per 
share were flat at 79 cents and reflected a lower number of shares 
this year due to a buyback program 
sales for the quarter were up 16 percent at 99 billion 
compared with 86 billion last year 
thirdquarter results reflect strong performance from our 
petroleum operations said du pont chairman edgar s woolard jr 
in a statement petroleum results have benefited from higher 
crude oil prices which will provide a hedge to rising feedstock 
costs in our chemical operations 
at the same time earnings in several of our chemical 
businesses continued to be adversely affected by the slowdown in 
the us economy woolard said 
du pont said the improvement in petroleum earnings was due 
partly to higher oil prices which soared after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait in early august the company said 70 percent of the overall 
improvement was due to operations overseas where there was a 
strong demand for petroleum products and greater efficiency at the 
companys refineries 
it said higher crude prices also led to an increase in us 
earnings although the company did not fully pass on increased 
costs at the gas pump 
du pont also said its quarterly results include gains of 8 cents 
a share from the sale of an interest in a north sea oil property 
and an instrument systems business 
net income for the first nine months fell 8 percent to 18 
billion or 271 per share compared with 19 billion or 282 per 
share for the first nine months of 1989 
sales for the first nine months were 29 billion up 9 percent 
over 265 billion last year

its thirdquarter earnings despite a drop in revenue but still 
posted a ninemonth loss as a result of the bankruptcy of its 
former bus line 
net income totaled 3199 million or 80 cents a share on 
revenues of 87593 million for the period ended sept 30 that

9062 million a year earlier the company said wednesday 
for the ninemonth period revenue totaling 265 billion 
produced 8804 million in income from continuing operations or 
219 per share but there was a net loss of 1196 million or 32 
cents a share in the period because of a 100 million aftertax 
loss provision taken in the second quarter as a result of the 
bankruptcy of dallasbased greyhound bus lines the company said 
greyhound dial sold the bus company in 1987 but retained an 
interest in it 
the current ninemonth figures compare with revenues of 267 
billion a year earlier when income from continuing operations and 
net earnings were 8067 million or 205 per share

said the companys financial group was performing well with no 
major problems in its corporate finance or real estate operations 
a statement said operating income was up 21 percent in the 
consumer products segment while income rose 75 percent in the 
services sector 
revenue from transportation manufacturing and service dropped 
sharply however because of a new model startup problem that

when the stock market decline becomes too much 
to take it may be time to look into the future to dream a bit of 
wonderfully bullish times when you can awaken each day to prospects 
of profits 
it has been many months since people enjoyed such days and it 
might be a long time before they experience them again the 
economic base that stock prices reflect has serious and maybe 
worsening problems 
still history declares that somewhere out in the future are 
better times how far out depends on your sense of time if you 
view a few months as a long time you might be disappointed if you 
think in terms of years you wont be 
did you know that even in the decade of the 1930s when stocks 
floundered after the great crash of 1929 the annual loss from 
equities was 01 percent barely into the minus column 
purists will point out of course that much of the collapse 
occurred in the final year before the decade of the 1930s but 
historians counter by pointing to another downturn in 1931 and 
still another in 1938 
in no decade since then has the average annual return been a 
minus that is the total return for the decade broken down to an 
annual basis in each of those decades however prices bounced 
like a golf ball on a highway 
in all there have been 11 bear markets since the 1930s 
including the present one and another that spanned the turn of the 
decade from 1939 to the spring of 1942 
in each one prices fell sharply 48 percent in 19731974 but 
only one lasted more than three years that was the 37month bear 
market from may 1946 to june 1949 in each instance of course 
prices resumed their rise 
wright investors service arrived at the 01 percent loss for 
the 1930s by using this calculation 
it started with an earned return of minus 02 percent a year 
from 55 percent annual dividend income and a 57 percent decline 
of earnings to that was added an increase of 01 percent a year in 
priceearnings ratios 
using the same formula the return for the 1940s averaged 92 
percent a year rose to 194 percent in the 1950s fell back to 78 
percent in the 1960s and to 59 percent in the 1970s but then 
leaped to 175 percent in the 1980s 
you are not convinced by the historical record nothing unusual 
about that such despair is one of the identifying traits of a bear 
market as surely as unjustified optimism identifies a bull market 
heading to a disastrous finale 
equity investments require faith as well as information they 
are risky simply because nobody knows anything for certain about 
the future very little about the present and probably only 
slightly more than that about the past 
that said here are wrights projections for the period through 
1995 
dividend income will grow an average of 34 percent a year and 
earnings 81 percent giving an earned return of 115 percent pe 
ratios however will be lowered by 26 percent a year leaving an 
annual return of 89 percent 
based partly on those estimates wright projects the dow jones 
industrials to average 2750 points in 1991 rising to 2975 in 
1991 to 3175 in 1993 to 3413 in 1994 and to 3625 points in 
1995 
nothing like the period 19851990 when the average almost 
doubled from 1547 points but a relatively serene sea nonetheless 
for those investors who in 1990 saw their stocks engulfed in the 
maelstrom

sears roebuck and co reported sharply lower net 
income wednesday for the third straight quarter but said its 
struggling retail unit has improved under the direct supervision of 
chairman edward brennan 
overall earnings plunged 30 percent in the third quarter mainly 
due to lower gains by the coldwell banker real estate subsidiary 
sears said 
earnings from the allstate insurance unit also declined but the 
dean witter financial services group showed great improvement over 
the third quarter of 1989 
chicagobased sears reported net income of 1792 million or 53 
cents a share for the three months ending sept 30 compared with 
2575 million or 75 cents a share in the same period a year ago 
revenues rose 59 percent to 1396 billion from 1318 billion 
in the third quarter of 1989 sears said in a statement 
coldwell bankers operating income fell to 18 million from 
812 million in the third quarter of 1989 when the division sold 
partial interest in several shopping centers 
sears said aftertax gains from property sales in the latest 
quarter totaled 181 million compared with 872 million a year 
earlier 
the decline was the result of the timing of property sales as 
well as the soft residential market sears said 
the sears merchandise group which accounts for more than half 
of sears revenues posted a 76 percent gain in thirdquarter 
operating income after suffering a 32 percent decline in the second 
quarter and a 374 million loss in the first 
operating income from the retailing division totaled 892 
million sears said revenues rose to 78 billion from 76 
billion 
brennan who was given direct oversight of the merchandise group 
in early august said encouraging results in home appliances 
electronics automotive and womens apparel reflected the 
effectiveness of new retailing strategies that sears began 
implementing in march 1989 
but brennan said the performances of sears catalog home 
fashions home improvements childrens clothing and mens apparel 
departments remained sluggish 
retailing analyst walter loeb of loeb associates in new york 
said the weakness in such traditional sears strongholds as home

maytag corp on wednesday named a new 
managing director to its hoover appliance business in britain as 
part of what it called a major reorganization of the european 
business 
hoovers appliance and floor care operation in the united 
kingdom has been a drain on maytag profitability since maytag 
acquired the business in a 1989 takeover of the chicago pacific 
corp 
daniel krumm maytags chairman announced the latest in a 
series of steps to shore up the british operations in remarks to 
employees at hoover production facilities in england scotland and 
wales he said the plan is designed to achieve the rebirth 
rejuvenation stability and return to profitability of hoover uk 
krumm named veteran labor relations executive william foust to 
succeed anthony williamson as managing director of hoover uk and to 
head a task force to speed organizational changes and implement 
production efficiencies 
foust is the senior vice president of human resources at maytag 
and a former officer of the magic chef co another maytag 
subsidiary krumm said foust will serve full time in south wales 
until he completes the special assignment then return to maytags 
headquarters in the central iowa community of newton 
williamson who has worked for hoover for more than 30 years 
announced he intends to retire but will continue to serve as a 
director and to represent hoover with various industry 
associations 
the shakeup was no surprise said analyst russell leavitt who 
follows maytag for the new york investment firm salomon brothers 
that business has suffered in the last year or two 
essentially since they got it leavitt said he said maytag 
executives were dissatisfied with the performance of hoover uk but 
probably needed time to understand industry conditions in britain 
which has been hit by a major slump in its appliance business 
maytag which does not disclose results from hoover uk last 
week reported a 157 million operating loss from european 
operations for the first nine months of the year compared with an 
operating loss of 83 million a year earlier the hoover uk 
operations were a big contributor to the operating loss said 
maytag spokeswoman lisa mendheim 
the operating loss came despite a 24 percent increase in sales 
to 3401 million from 2737 million 
maytag had net earnings of 86 million on sales of 233 billion 
for the first nine months of 1990 compared with profit of 917 
million on sales of 229 billion in the same period a year 
earlier 
the reorganization followed capital improvements and 
costcutting programs in britain 
maytag said earlier this year it will invest about 22 million 
in a major renovation in wales 
hoover reduced its work force by 17 percent in the united 
kingdom in 1989 and cut 700 additional jobs this year it still has 
4500 workers in britain out of a global work force of 
approximately 25000

suffering a thirdquarter loss of 11 million 
the company declined to say how many jobs would be cut most of 
the impending layoffs will be whitecollar salaried workers at its 
chicago headquarters and across the united states said usg

the company has trimmed its work force in the last two years 
from 21000 to 14000 by selling assets and eliminating jobs 
its a difficult decision and we regret having to make it

decline in housing the savings and loan crisis and most recently 
the problems in the mideast

wallboard

lawsuit against the former owner of western savings association 
contending he defrauded the failed thrift of at least that much 
money 
the federal deposit insurance corp also accuses jarrett e 
woods jr of spending 7 million of depositors money on himself 
during the thrifts final months in 1986 
the lawsuit is one of the largest ever filed by the government 
against a savings and loan owner it was filed friday in dallas but 
not released until tuesday 
the suit accuses woods and western capital a corporation he 
controlled of engaging in fraud and violating contracts the 
government alleges that in the four years woods controlled the 
thrift he squandered its deposits on highrisk and fraudulent 
investments and improper loans 
the losses suffered by the institution appear to exceed 1 
billion at least 560 million of which was the preventable result 
of the policies and practices implemented at western by jarrett e 
woods jr and western capital corporation the suit states 
woods is accused of using thrift money to refinance his home 
funnelling millions into his childrens trust funds paying off a 
personal loan and paying himself an 800000 bonus and a 41667 
monthly salary 
when federal regulators closed western in september 1986 
examiners found deficient or nonexistent appraisals inadequate 
loan documentation inaccurate accounting and shoddy 
recordkeeping the lawsuit states

that the thrift was not insolvent and that he had tried to find 
solutions to the examiners concerns 
woods has an unlisted home telephone number and could not be 
reached for comment wednesday no criminal charges have been filed 
against him

bankers went home wednesday after fve days 
of im ok youre ok reassurance among themselves now theyll 
try to persuade the public 
though beset by problems resulting from the slowing economy 
industry leaders maintained that banking remains fundamentally 
strong restoring public confidence by preaching that message was a 
dominant theme of the concluded american bankers association 
convention 
bankers were exhorted by the aba leadership to become aggressive 
champions of the industry in their hometowns 
the key issue is the confidence the people place in 
banking said aba president richard a kirk 
kirk and others emphasized that banking is in much better 
condition than the savings and loan industry bankings problems 
should be viewed entirely separately than those of the thrifts 
they said 
the 4500 conventioneers heard more than cheerleading however 
in a particularly blunt speech on tuesday that the aba brass had 
requested to be toned down comptroller of the currency robert 
clarke said that confidence in the industry is at its lowest point 
in 50 years and bankers are partly to blame 
this is not a time to be kidding ourselves clarke told the 
convention 
clarke the nations top bank regulator and wellknown in the 
industry for his frankness said the industry is in trouble on main 
street wall street and on capitol hill 
among other things clarke faulted the industry for putting too 
many eggs in its real estate basket the downturn in real estate is 
chief among the reasons many banks are suffering either losses or 
smaller profits 
clarke told reporters that there had been concern that his 
speech was too harsh when a draft copy of it was circulated among 
some people on monday he said he revised one paragraph to clearly 
show that he supported the survival of the industry 
clarke joined other federal banking officials in calling for 
more capitalization in the industry 
in a forum that concluded the aba convention wednesday a panel 
of three economists agreed that the nation is on the brink of a 
recession thats bad news for the banking industry though the 
economists said they expect the recession to be relatively mild 
participating in the forum were arnold a dill chief economist 
at citizens and southern corp in atlanta tucker hart adams chief 
economist at central banks of colorado in denver and william b 
conerly vice president of first interstate bank of oregon in 
portland 
theres a fair chance we wont reach the technical definition 
of a recession said ms adams i consider it very mild 
also dominating discussion at the aba convention was how 
congress may deal with the banking industry next year many believe 
congress will enact sweeping reforms 
clearly our industry is in the throes of major change even 
perhaps a major restructuring the abas kirk said 
edward l yingling executive director of the abas government 
relations group said he expects congress to act on deposit 
insurance reform capital requirements products and services 
reform and interstate banking 
he also predicted a fierce lobbying effort by the banking 
industry and other concerns over the direction of the legislation 
what the aba wants in particular is the abolition of the too 
big to fail philosophy that governs bank regulation and 
legislation permitting banks to enter other lines of business 
the traditional regulatory policy ensuring large institutions 
against failure gives big banks an unfair advantage over smaller 
ones the organization believes 
the bankers want permission to move into other businesses such 
as the sale of securities insurance and real estate so they can 
compete more effectively with other financial services companies 
under the abas scenario such services would be provided by 
separately regulated divisions creating a wall that would not 
threaten the security of insured deposits yingling said

united auto workers union officials so far are 
holding off on setting a deadline for reaching a national contract 
with chrysler corp a union official said wednesday 
in canada however negotiators for chrysler canada ltd and the 
canadian auto workers union bargained through tuesday night to beat 
a midnight thursday deadline for a new pact covering about 10000 
canadian workers 
the uaw and the caw are pressing for contracts similar to those 
they negotiated separately with general motors corp ford motor 
co and those companies canadian operations 
its doubtful if a contract completion date will be set 
today uaw spokesman bob barbee said wednesday theres still 
lots of stuff that has to be done before anything like that 
he added that by weeks end the union might set a deadline for 
reaching a contract with chrysler setting a deadline increases 
pressure on negotiators 
the uaw has about 63000 members at chryslers us operations 
earlier this fall the unions reached a contract agreement with 
gm after setting a deadline the unions and ford then negotiated a 
contract without a deadline 
before talks with chrysler intensified this week there was 
speculation that a bumpy road was ahead of uaw and company 
negotiators and a deadline might be set quickly 
but on monday chryslers canadian subsidiary gave the caw an 
economic proposal union officials said was close to the gmford 
canadian patten agreement 
analysts viewed that move as encouraging for the us talks 
a chrysler official speaking wednesday on the condition of 
anonymity said main negotiators including uaw president owen 
bieber and chrysler vice president anthony st john met twice 
tuesday but no similar meetings were scheduled for wednesday 
they might have to digest everything the official said 
union and company officials also said work continued in 
bargaining subcommittees which focus on specific areas of 
negotiations

the united states on wednesday offered drastic 
acrosstheboard tariff cuts in the uruguay round trade 
liberalization talks and called on other negotiators to 
reciprocate 
the chief us delegate warren lavorel told a committee 
meeting that the offer if fully implemented would represent a 
reduction of 43 percent in the average tradeweighted tariff 
he noted the offer was considerably higher than the 33 percent 
target set in montreal at the midterm review of the 4yearold 
talks 
lavorel said the offer covered all product areas including 
domestically sensitive items such as textiles he said continued 
us support for the offer would depend on the reactions of other 
trading partners 
a summary of his statement was reported by a meeting source who 
declined to be identified 
briefing reporters on the general discussion at the trade 
negotiating committee the source said the european community again 
came under criticism for its delay in submitting a formal proposal 
on cutting farm support in the uruguay round 
the ecs proposal yet to be formalized would cut subsidies by 
30 percent a reduction described as totally insufficient by the 
united states and other leading farmexporting countries 
according to the source argentinas leopoldo tettamanti said 
negotiators had already lost two weeks waiting for the community 
offer tettamanti warned that the talks would enter into a deep 
crisis because the ecs offer might not lead to any meaningful 
negotiation

beech aircraft corp said it will slow 
production of some models and stop hiring new workers because of 
the possibility of a shrinking marketplace 
the companys actions take place as fuel costs have risen due to 
the crisis in the middle east 
in response to this situation we are taking a number of 
preliminary actions while we evaluate our current market 
situation jim gregory director of corporate affairs for beech 
said in a written statement tuesday 
gregory said beech was not trying to influence congress 
consideration of a luxury tax to help reduce the federal deficit 
these actions are being taken in response to a slowing 
marketplace he said 
house negotiators wednesday appeared to have accepted the senate 
version of the proposed 10 percent tax which would apply to the 
excess cost of any airplane above 250000 
gregory said beech was making productionrate adjustments on 
some models and reducing overtime 
beech has quit advertising for new employees halted 
preemployment training for some prospective workers and is 
reconsidering our plans to add a significant number of new 
employees by yearend gregory said 
he did not detail the companys plans and declined comment on 
the possibility of layoffs but an industry source said layoffs may 
occur because beech had been adding employees in anticipation of 
strong sales and increased production rates 
at a trade convention in new orleans three weeks ago beech 
officials said the company had a bright sales outlook and was 
planning to add 500 jobs within the next 12 months as many as 300 
by the end of the year 
officials of two other wichitaarea aircraft makers cessna 
aircraft co and learjet said that although they are concerned 
about the uncertainty in their business they had not made any 
changes in operations

with a gasoline rebate offer yet to 
recharge stalled motorhome sales winnebago industries inc has 
cut back to a fourday work week and says it will begin laying off 
whitecollar workers 
the recent moves by the recreational vehicle giant are a 
dramatic illustration of how a business already hurting from 
softness in the economy has been walloped by the unexpected in 
this case a stunning rise in fuel prices since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait nearly three months ago 
an industry analyst said winnebago appears to be taking the 
right steps to return to profitability once the gasoline price 
outlook and the nations economic prospects brighten 
analyst michael sabbann who follows the recreational vehicle 
industry for the minneapolis investment firm of piper jaffray amp 
hopwood also said winnebago is not alone and that other 
manufacturers are in a bind 
the commerce department said wednesday that orders to us 
factories of durable goods such as appliances and vehicles 
designed to last three years or more fell 17 percent in 
september transportation orders fell 68 percent 
winnebago with products priced at 27000 and up has reported 
five straight quarterly losses and had a record 178 million loss 
in the fiscal year that ended aug 25 as sales fell 23 percent from 
the previous year 
in may directors suspended semiannual dividends to 
shareholders in late september winnebago began layoffs and 
temporary factory shutdowns 
earlier this month it began offering rebates to new buyers 
guaranteeing to reimburse gasoline expenses above 1 a gallon for 
the first 12 months or 12000 miles of ownership whichever came 
first 
sheila davis a winnebago spokeswoman said wednesday that the 
rebates have not led to any noticeable increase in sales its a 
little too early to tell about the success of the program she 
said 
she said company factories in the iowa communities of forest 
city hampton and lorimor have been on mondaytothursday schedules 
since last week with 1000 production workers idled each friday 
the fourday week will continue indefinitely she said 
an additional 500 workers were laid off since the end of 
september with no plans to recall them later this week an 
austerity program will be announced that will include layoffs among 
the ranks of 800 office workers supervisors and executives she 
said 
unfortunately those are the things that have to be done 
sabbann said the whole industry cycle has turned against them 
but he said winnebago is in a good position to regain ground 
once the economy improves he noted the companys claim to more 
than 60 percent of the market in sales of micromini motor homes a 
more fuelefficient recreational vehicle that has taken a growing 
share of the rv business 
forest city mayor paul jefson said the companys travails are as 
serious as he can recall for winnebago the major employer in the 
community of 4300 jefsons memory goes back to when the factory 
burned down in september 1964 counting workers now laid off the 
company has about 2600 employees 
when winnebago is in trouble so is forest city jefson said 
and as problems began surfacing earlier this year we knew its 
important that we live within the means of the city it will affect 
us 
robert rollefson a broker at the forest city office of the 
investment firm rg dickinson amp co and veteran winnebago watcher 
said the company is faced with its most serious challenge since the 
early 1970s thats when an arab oil embargo and the first oil 
price shock left the company with acres of unsold motor homes 
everywhere you looked there was an ocean of white aluminum 
rollefson said the company formed convoys of vehicles and drove 
them across country until they were sold sometimes at prices way 
below cost 
winnebago is in better financial shape today but the outlook 
now and the outlook then may be about the same he said

standard amp poors corp one of the nations two 
major creditrating agencies on wednesday downgraded its rating of 
5 billion worth of debt of chemical banking corp and several 
subsidiaries 
the downgrade of the nations sixthlargest banking company 
followed a similar rating reduction last month by sampp affecting no 
2 chase manhattan corp 
sampp said its downgrade of new yorkbased chemical reflected its 
expectation of further moderate deterioration in loan quality in 
a continued difficult operating environment 
however the rating agency tempered its concern with optimistic 
statements about chemicals prospects 
the company has the liquidity and financial flexibility to deal 
with the expected loan problems it said it added that 
chemicals recent decision to reduce its dividend payment should 
help it rebuild capital after the heavy losses of the past few 
years 
chemical spokesman charles salmans said the company was 
disappointed by the action sampp in its own announcement notes the 
quality of chemicals loan portfolio and the steps we have taken to 
build capital he said 
sampp lowered by one notch the senior debt rating of parent 
chemical banking and subsidiaries texas commerce bancshares and 
chemical new york 
it also lowered by one degree its rating on certifas soon as possible 
us bankruptcy judge harold c abramson wednesday set a dec 14 
hearing on the confirmation plan and company spokeswoman cecilia 
stubbs norwood said southland hoped to emerge from court 
supervision before the end of the year 
ms norwood said store operations would not be affected by the 
filing and the company had commitments for 400 million in 
financing while it proceeds through the bankruptcy process 
southland has been struggling since 1987 when the founding 
thompson family fearing a takeover by the belzbergs of canada 
took the company private in a 49 billion leveraged buyout 
the lbo second highest ever at the time became more expensive 
on oct 19 1987 when the dow jones industrial average plunged 508 
points the crash made it more difficult and more expensive to 
arrange financing for the deal 
southland first proposed its restructuring in march of this 
year acknowledging that dwindling profits would make it impossible 
to meet the debt brought on by the 1987 buyout 
in april southland revealed a fourthquarter loss of 101 
billion as it wrote off goodwill from the buyout the company 
denied the writeoff proved the thompsons paid too much in the 
buyout but only reflected a decline in the value of the company 
assets 
at first southland proposed selling 75 percent of the company 
for 400 million to itoyokado co ltd and seveneleven japan co 
ltd its japanese franchisees 
the thompson family would keep 15 percent and the creditors 
would get the rest along with new securities 
but enough bondholders would not go along in july the japanese 
agreed to take a smaller piece of the company 70 percent and 
provide more money 430 million the thompsons also agreed to cut 
their holdings to 5 percent while creditors got 25 percent of the 
reorganized company in addition to improved terms on their bonds 
however creditors forced southland to require that 95 percent 
of the bondholders go along before they would agree to the swap 
and the threshold proved too high to meet by this weeks deadline 
although the reorganization plan mirrors the restructuring 
proposal it now must be approved by a bankruptcy court and could 
still face objections 
if it succeeds it will end the thompson familys control of the 
company none of the three brothers who run southland would comment 
on the bankruptcy ms norwood said

moodys investors service inc on wednesday 
downgraded by a notch 45 billion worth of debt by ford motor co 
and some of its financial subsidiaries saying the company is 
vulnerable to dips in the economy 
the sluggish economy continued buyer incentive programs that 
cut into profits softening vehicle demand in europe and fuel costs 
heighten the uncertainties concerning fords operating returns 
and cash flow during a period of heavy capital spending moodys 
said 
even with the downgrade securities issued by the nations no 2 
automaker remained well within moodys investment grade general 
motors corp securities are at the same rating as ford and 
chrysler corp securities are below both but still within moodys 
investment grade 
ratings issued by moodys and other companies such as standard 
amp poors corp are used to measure the credit worthiness of a 
company or a subsidiary a lower credit rating can force a company 
to pay higher interest rates when it borrows money 
ford spokesman tom foote declined to describe the size of fords 
capital spending program this year but he said ford planned to 
spend more in the next five years on plants and products than the 
222 billion it spent in the last five years of the 1980s 
we believe that our ability to maintain a substantial capital 
spending program in the present economic environment reflects the 
strong financial position of ford said a statement from ford 
vice president and treasurer david mccammon 
through oct 20 of this year sales of fords domestic cars and 
trucks were 86 percent below last years pace 
next week ford is expected to announce thirdquarter earnings 
of about half the 4771 million the company earned during the same 
period last year 
moodys also downgraded securities linked to first nationwide 
bank a fordowned savings and loan institution with headquarters 
in san francisco 
the ratings agency said first nationwide was particularly 
vulnerable because of its extensive holdings in a softening 
commercial real estate market 
we are pleased with first nationwides operating performance 
this year in the face of a depressed commercial realestate 
market mccammon said 
additionally we believe the ratings fail to recognize the 
strong overall performance of the ford financial services group 
which provides an important element of stability during this period 
of relatively weak vehicle demand he said

stock prices edged higher wednesday in a 
drifting session that did nothing to break the indecisive pattern 
of activity since the start of the week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had slipped 2673 
points monday and tuesday rose 1015 to 250421 
advancing issues just barely outnumbered declines in nationwide 
trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 762 up 728 
down and 490 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 14929 million 
shares against 14630 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the overthecounter 
market totaled 18159 million shares 
the price of crude oil for december delivery climbed more than 
150 a barrel to the neighborhood of 31 a barrel on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
analysts said that helped to put a damper on buying interest in 
the stock market along with persistent worries about the economic 
outlook 
the commerce department reported that new factory orders for 
durable goods dropped 17 percent in september on top of a 
downwardrevised decline of 08 percent in august 
the latest decrease stemmed mainly from a drop in transportation 
orders which are often subject to wide shortterm fluctuations 
but brokers said it still came as something of an unpleasant 
surprise to investors 
observers also said the market was on hold awaiting signs of 
some resolution of the budget impasse in washington 
it is generally agreed that traders hopes for a relaxation of 
the federal reserves credit policy are unlikely to be fulfilled 
until some sort of a budget agreement has been reached 
wednesdays gainers among the blue chips included international 
business machines up 1 at 108 philip morris up at 48 
eastman kodak up lsqb at 39 and westinghouse electric up at 25

when halloween decorations come down this week 
and stores start putting up christmas trees and wreaths retailers 
will begin what is expected to be their bleakest holiday season in 
years 
the faltering economy and the persian gulf crisis already have 
put a big crimp in consumer spending with retail sales falling 
dramatically in august and september no one realistically expects 
shoppers to put caution aside when they start looking for gifts 
its going to be a tough christmas said jeffrey edelman a 
retail industry analyst with barclays de zoete wedd inc the only 
question is how bad is it going to be 
daniel barry of kidder peabody amp co was more blunt i think 
this is going to be one of the worst christmases in two decades 
retailers also are expecting a difficult season 
kenneth macke chairman of dayton hudson corp said his 
company like most retailers is planning conservatively to meet 
the uncertain mood of american consumers 
theyve got job insecurity and oil prices are up macke said 
of consumers if they had a definite answer to some of these 
things wed be better off 
christmas has been something of a guessing game in recent years 
with consumers shopping later in the season and the outcome not 
certain until after all the receipts are tallied 
many observers believe there wont be any suspense this year 
especially since late summer sales considered a harbinger of the 
christmas season were so poor for instance mackes stores 
which include dayton hudson marshall field target and mervyns 
suffered a 2 percent drop in sales in september 
we have a consumer thats really pulling back said walter 
loeb a retailing consultant and analyst he doesnt like 2 a 
gallon gas he doesnt like higher taxes he doesnt like 
unemployment 
there are more americans out of work now than there were a year 
ago the unemployment rate was on an upswing in september rising 
to 57 percent while last december it was holding steady at 53 
percent a consumer who is not working is not going to spend a lot 
on christmas gifts 
even those with secure jobs are scaling back giftgiving plans 
since oil prices shot higher following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait americans have been shelling out more money for gasoline 
and heating oil and have less for extras like gifts 
about the only thing that would keep christmas from being a 
disaster is an end to the mideast crisis and a drop in oil 
prices said barry the kidder peabody analyst 
macke said department stores which generally have more upscale 
merchandise could be more vulnerable to sluggish sales our 
experience is that the consumer has tended to trade down he 
said 
that means there likely will be more ties books and sweaters 
bought this season than stereo sets and expensive jewelry 
apparel retailers may also find themselves in a bind they were 
among the hardest hit as sales dropped in late summer 
for example j c penney whose business grew modestly in the 
late spring and early summer saw its sales fall 24 percent and 
34 percent respectively in august and september specialty apparel 
retailer limited inc which posted moderate increases in the 
spring managed only a 1 percent gain in august and suffered a 3 
percent decline in september 
one segment of the industry likely to fare somewhat better this 
christmas is toy retailers parents may scrimp on gifts for adults 
so their children find plenty of presents under the tree on dec 
25 
santa claus gets first priority on the dollar said macke 
inventory will be a key to how successful this christmas will 
be macke said his stores have bought conservatively and focused on 
the kinds of merchandise that are expected to be the biggest 
movers 
but a wild card that can make or break the season is how much 
retailers are forced to take price markdowns 
markdowns have become almost commonplace in the last few years 
and most analysts expect there will be pricecutting again this 
christmas 
edelman the barclays de zoete wedd analyst predicted markdowns 
would not be quite as severe as in christmas 1989 
last year units of allied stores corp and federated department 
stores inc reduced prices sharply to bring in cash in a futile 
attempt at avoiding bankruptcy court other retailers were forced 
to follow suit to compete and bottom lines that quarter the most 
crucial earings period for retailers were the casualties 
barry took a more pessimistic view of markdowns in the upcoming 
season and had this advice for consumers do your christmas 
shopping late therell be plenty of merchandise at bargain 
prices 
if dayton hudsons sales appear to be falling short of 
projections macke said his stores will try to avoid heavy 
markdowns by reducing expenses 
yet in spite of the sofar glum outlook for the season some say 
it is still possible retailers will be pleasantly surprised 
karen sack an analyst with standard amp poors corp said that 
while consumers have definitely cut back spending i suspect they 
will spend for christmas 
macke despite his conservative outlook said i wouldnt be a the 
threatened 
northern spotted owl and also rejected a move to cut the forest 
service roadbuilding effort in half 
the current obscenity ban adopted a year ago under pressure 
from helms and his conservative allies forbids endowment financing 
of works that may be considered obscene including depictions 
of homoeroticism sadomasochism the sexual exploitation of 
children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
the senate bill also would allow endowment chairman john e 
frohnmayer to continue his requirement that grant recipients sign a 
pledge not to produce obscene work the pledge has caused 
widespread protests among artists and resulted in three lawsuits 
challenging its constitutionality 
by contrast the house voted to ban frohnmayers pledge and to 
omit any explicit antiobscenity restrictions

unocals crude oil prices jumped 460 a barrel to an average of 
2022 in the third quarter said richard j stegemeier unocals 
chairman president and chief executive officer 
crude oil prices rose sharply due to the persian gulf crisis 
but stegemeier said earnings from unocals refining and 
marketing operations fell because the company was unable to pass 
the full price on to consumers earnings dropped to 34 million 
from 39 million in the same 1989 quarter 
for the first nine months of 1990 unocal reported a 27 percent 
earnings jump to 363 million or 155 per share on revenue of 
84 billion that compared with 286 million or 122 per share 
on revenue of 85 billion for the same period last year 
unocals ninemonth increase included a 132 million aftertax 
gain from the sale of the companys wholly owned oil and gas 
subsidiary in norway 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
exxon said earnings from its refining and marketing operations 
dropped 55 percent to 246 million also blaming an inability to 
fully recover the crude price increases 
both companies chemical operations suffered earnings declines 
although unocals 2 percent drop was a far cry from exxons 75 
percent reduction 
exxon said higher costs for raw materials and a sluggish 
industry combined for the steep decline 
the companys ninemonth earnings increased 14 percent to 34 
billion or 273 per share on revenue of 818 billion that 
compared to aftertax profit of 3 billion or 237 per share on 
revenue of 695 billion for the same period last year

crude oil rebounded sharply on the futures 
market wednesday to move back above 30 per barrel as traders 
placed less faith in speculation that peace was likely in the 
persian gulf 
perceptions are hardening here with the saudis and us 
officials indicating we are still a long way from having a 
settlement with iraq said bob baker an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
i think theres no fear of peace but likewise no fear of 
hostilities theres a perception that a stalemate could persist 
for a while baker said 
light sweet crude oil rose 171 to 3108 for december delivery 
contracts on the new york mercantile exchange all other contract 
months traded higher 
crudes move up erased part of a steep decline that had stripped 
away more than half of the war premium which pushed oil to 40 
per barrel in the weeks after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
it was down about 10 in three or four days so you were due 
for a bit of a bounce anyway said ed kevelson a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
speculators were responding to news that the pentagon may deploy 
more us troops to the gulf as well as a statement from sen 
richard lugar rind that the nation appears headed toward 
conflict in the region 
prices also strengthened an american petroleum institute report 
released tuesday evening that showed the nations supplies of 
crude oil and gasoline went down last week as did refinery 
operations api showed a slight increase in the stockpile of home 
heating oil 
refined petroluem products traded higher along with crude 
wednesday with gasoline taking a bigger jump than heating oil 
because of the api statistics 
unleaded gasoline for november delivery rose 549 cents to 8539 
cents per gallon with later delivery months all trading higher 
heating oil rose 406 cents to 8512 cents a gallon for november 
delivery with all other contract months higher 
natural gas fell 8 cents to 244 per 1000 cubic feet for 
december delivery with other months also dropping 
after oils record fall of 541 per barrel on monday that 
pushed it below 30 for the first time in weeks trading turned 
confused with prices moving in different directions as buyers and 
sellers tried to figure out what would happen next in the mideast 
standoff 
when oil shot back up wednesday it left traders wondering 
whether they had seen only a correction from the earlier slide or 
the beginning of another steady climb

polly peck international plc the troubled british 
food and electronics conglomerate asked for court assistance 
tuesday to sort out its 195 billion debt woes 
the decision to apply for a courtappointed administrator 
followed weeks of wrangling with creditors over financing 
the company which was forced to suspend trading of its shares 
on the london stock market sept 20 said in a brief statement its 
board resolved to take the action 
a polly peck spokesman added the company believes that taking 
this step will result in the survival of the company and its 
operations as going concerns 
court administration is a form of bankruptcy which enables the 
company to reduce its debt in an orderly fashion with the guidance 
of the british courts it does not always mean the company 
concerned will be liquidated 
the court administrator will decide whether polly pecks debts 
can be serviced through existing operations or through a partial or 
full liquidation of the company 
company officials held a series of meetings with bankers 
throughout the day wednesday 
in the past week polly peck chairman and chief executive asil 
nadir has tried to round up financial support in turkey and 
northern cyprus 
polly peck which has operating subsidiaries in the united 
states urkey and japan has been operating under a temporary debt 
standstill agreement since oct 5 
the company sought the moratorium after creditors withdrew about 
100 million pounds or 195 million in shortterm financing and 
pressed for answers on the financial status of the company after 
its share suspension the moratorium was scheduled to expire nov 
9 
nadir has been dogged in the british press by allegations of 
links to a reputed polly peck sharesupport scheme the company and 
nadir who was questioned by the serious fraud office sept 20 
have denied any knowledge of wrongdoing 
bankers have called polly pecks troubles a crisis of 
confidence they said in the early stages of talks that they were 
inclined to give the company time to sort out its financial 
troubles 
polly pecks status however deteriorated sharply in recent 
days as bankers pressed the company for answers about nadirs 
financehunting trip to turkey and northern cyprus 
their growing unease was signalled by calls for early repayment 
of outstanding debts and more significantly by the move of 
national bank of canada on monday to petition the british courts to 
liquidate the company to meet its debts

copper futures prices fell sharply wednesday ending a fourday 
runup and precious metals rallied as a bounce in oil prices 
rekindled worries about the economy 
on other commodity markets orange juice futures surged grains 
and soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures settled 14 cents to 35 cents lower on new 
yorks commodity exchange with the contract for spot delivery at 
129 a pound down 32 cents 
the selloff erased more than half of tuesdays gains which had 
been fueled by fears of a tight supply and perceptions that easing 
crude oil prices meant the us economy might not be heading into a 
severe recession 
the copper market tends to respond to economic signals because 
copper is used widely in construction and manufacturing 
but oil prices leaped wednesday after us and saudi arabian 
leaders reaffirmed their position that iraq must withdraw from 
kuwait unconditionally 
analysts said oil futures also were supported by sen richard 
lugars comment that we are very close to conflict in the 
persian gulf and by an industry report tuesday showing a 
largerthanexpected drop last week in us crude suplies 
tim evans a copper trader with deak international inc said 
coppers decline also reflected profittaking after a gain of about 
9 cents a pound in four days 
deak vice president anne orton said far east demand for precious 
metals had increased as the dollar declined in value against other 
major currencies in the last few weeks 
gold futures settled 210 to 230 higher on the commodity 
exchange with the spot price at 37350 a troy ounce silver was 
02 cent to 04 cent higher with october at 4223 a troy ounce

continental airlines board of directors briefly 
considered filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy but decided instead to 
seek other ways to return to financial health a spokesman said 
wednesday 
unidentified sources quoted in wednesdays editions of the new 
york times and the wall street journal said a team of lawyers 
worked through the weekend to prepare chapter 11 papers to be filed 
in us bankruptcy court after a board meeting on monday 
continental responded to the reports by issuing a statement 
wednesday saying it had no plans to file for protection from 
creditors 
we have streamlined our management and like the rest of the 
industry are considering other prudent business steps to assist 
during the fuel crisis the airline said however chapter 11 
is not one of the means we intend to take 
later wednesday spokesman ned walker said the board examined 
several different options one of which was chapter 11 but it was 
rejected in a unanimous vote by the board 
chapter 11 just doesnt make sense for us we have a lot of 
alternatives walker said 
they include possible asset sales introduction of outside 
investors and cost controls such as the postponement of a 
multimilliondollar image campaign he said 
continental stock dropped 1 to 4 per share wednesday on the 
american stock exchange meanwhile standard amp poors corp said it 
had downgraded its ratings on debt of continental airlines holdings 
inc and continental airlines because of problems brought on by 
higher fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel 
the airline decided last week to remove 17 aircraft that were no 
longer fuel efficient from service on dec 1 and replace them with 
more efficient models walker said jet fuel costs have risen 125 
percent since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
a 12 billion order for 25 boeing 757s will still go through 
he added 
were in discussions with some parties that are seriously 
interested in investing in continental walker said 
continentals core operations remain strong he said 
speculation that efforts to contain costs might include a 
major downsizing of the airline is just that speculation the 
airlines statement said 
the reports that continental had considered bankruptcy surfaced 
a day after the carrier realigned its senior management team by 
cutting five top executives in an effort to trim costs 
for the first half of the year continental which until june 
was known as texas air corp lost 87 million compared with a 
loss of 365 million in the period a year ago in june the 
carriers liabilities totaled 16 billion 
thirdquarter results which have not yet been reported are 
expected to show that continental suffered losses during the 
normally busy summer travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel 
prices since the invasion of kuwait 
frank lorenzo who recently stepped down as chairman of 
continental but remains on the board reportedly opposes a chapter 
11 filing by the airline as does jan carlzon chairman of 
scandinavian airlines system which owns 168 percent of 
continental stock a bankruptcy petition filing would reduce the 
value of sass holdings

interior secretary manual lujan will try to 
prevent a japanese company from owning food and lodging concessions 
in americas national parks officials said wednesday 
the issue of foreign ownership surfaced in connection with a 
japanese companys possible purchase of mca inc which owns a 
subsidiary that provides concessions at yosemite national park in 
california 
james ridenour director of the national park service recently 
urged mca to sell the yosemite concessions before the japanese 
company matsushita electric industries acquires mca interior 
spokesman steve goldstein said 
he said ridenour made the request in a telephone call to mca 
chairman lew wasserman with the full support of lujan 
the secretary believes that the concessions in our national 
parks should be run by americanowned companies he wants to make 
sure mca was clear on our position said goldstein 
the mca subsidiary yosemite amp curry co has estimated holdings 
in yosemite of between 100 million and 200 million the company 
provides restaurants lodging and stores at the park under a 
contract with the national park service 
officials with matsushita mca and curry declined comment about 
the discussions involving mca and matsushita or ridenours 
telephone call 
goldstein said there is nothing in law to prevent a japanese 
company from being a concessionaire at a national park but that 
such ownership could be taken into account when the curry co 
contract is up for normal renewal in 1993 
we understand the amount of ill will that would come from a 
japanese acquisition he said manuel lujan believes in buying 
american he added 
matsushita has been holding discussions to buy mca for a 
reported 86 billion the sides reportedly are having difficulty 
agreeing on a price and the japanese company has put off further 
discussions until midnovember 
mca owns universal studios record companies a film library and 
a television station in addition to curry 
ridenour urged wasserman to sell its park concessions subsidiary 
to a private group before dealing with matsushita he said the park 
service also would be interested in buying the concession 
the wilderness society already has expressed interest in 
competing with curry for the yosemite concession in 1993 
normally the contract holder has the advantage in bidding on a 
contract renewal but recently the interior department at lujans 
insistence has sought to make the bidding more competitive 
park officials at yosemite meanwhile have received about a 
half dozen letters from park visitors complaining about the 
possible ownership of the concessions by a foreign company 
american parks and everything in them need to belong to 
americans not to foreign investors wrote lenore cymes of 
palo alto calif

a hog industry group wednesday condemned 
common market plans to ban us pork shipments to 12 european 
countries because american plants dont meet european sanitation 
standards 
this is an artificial trade barrier not a food safety 
issue said mike wehler president of the national pork producers 
council 
the us pork industry has bent over backwards to accommodate 
european sanitation requirements even though many of those 
standards are not based on scientific evidence he said 
the council said the 12nation european community on monday 
informed secretary of agriculture clayton yeutter it plans to stop 
all us pork shipments as of next wednesday on the grounds that no 
us plant meets its sanitation requirements 
the council said exports of us pork products to the european 
nations account for more than 10 million a year in sales

wells fargo amp co hammered on wall street 
along with other big banks this year said wednesday it welcomed 
billionaire investor warren e buffetts purchase of a 98 percent 
stake in the company 
wells fargo denied it was under any takeover pressure despite 
the plunge in the price of its shares from a high of 86 during the 
past year to a low of 4125 recently 
the bank said it had not agreed to any special terms with 
buffett of omaha neb and did not view him as a white knight 
who bought the shares to thwart a takeover 
we are pleased to have him as a shareholder given his 
reputation as an astute investor said wells fargo spokesperson 
mary essary he recognizes longterm value in companies 
the purchase made buffett known for his prescience in picking 
stocks the largest shareholder of wells fargo stock the next 
largest is the capital group inc of los angeles which owns a 93 
percent stake according to a proxy statement filed last march 
in a federal filing tuesday buffett disclosed that nine 
subsidiaries of his company berkshire hathaway bought 5030600 
shares of wells fargo 
he did not state the price paid for the shares but wells fargo 
stock has been trading in recent days at about 48 a share some 5 
million shares at that price would come to about 240 million 
wells fargo stock closed at 5050 per share up 137 
wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
buffett had no further comment beyond the filing but planned to 
make a full statement in next years annual report to wells fargo 
shareholders said a spokeswoman at berkshire hathaway 
major california banks including wells fargo have been hurt on 
wall street this year by the sluggish economy fears of a deepening 
recession and worries that the real estate market might collapse 
the way it did in the northeast 
but some of those worries appear to have been exaggerated and 
wells fargo and several other banks have weathered the problems 
reasonably well 
wells fargo recently reported that earnings for the quarter 
ended sept 30 rose 7 percent from a year ago to 303 per share on 
net income of 1626 million the bank has 515 billion in assets 
we feel that our stock has been adversely affected by the 
marketplace in general and not by the results that we ourselves 
have been showing essary said we have been giving consistent 
performance and we feel very positive about our company and our 
ability to weather any future downtowns 
she said buffett probably was interested in wells fargo because 
being a strong company the decrease in the stock has provided an 
attractive buying opportunity 
in the past buffett has bought sizeable stakes in companies 
under special terms he has served as a friend of management once 
he is in place deterring hostile bidders from making any takeover 
efforts against the company 
his moves also are watched on wall street where he is seen as a 
savvy longterm investor 
a few months ago buffett agreed to buy 12 percent to 14 percent 
of usair group incs stock through a new issue valued at 358 
million a move that could block a hostile takeover 
buffett who made a fortune buying littleknown stocks also 
owns big stakes in coca cola co the salomon brothers inc 
investment house and gillette co he owns the buffalo news 
newspaper 
he played the role of friendly squire to razor maker gillette 
the object of two hostile takeover bids in three years

eastern airlines push to get more business 
travelers could help the moneylosing carrier break even by 
february bankruptcy trustee martin shugrue said 
the effort involves nearly doubling the size of easterns 
firstclass cabins and offering firstclass corporate fares below 
the industrys coach average 
shugrue who was appointed in april to try to salvage the 
carrier said the effort has taken off like a rocket ship 
his optimistic outlook came in a miami herald interview tuesday 
at a time when creditors are balking at releasing more operating 
funds and speculation has revived that eastern may be dismantled 
the miamibased carrier has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization since march 1989 after machinists went on strike 
and was still losing 2 million a day in its most recent quarterly 
report during the summer 
eastern said its new business traveler program has added 4000 
bookings a day the airline said it needs business travelers 
because they fly frequently and dont rely on socalled supersaver 
fares 
shugrues rosy outlook wasnt shared by industry watchers 
it would be a tall order to not only overcome their losses on 
a daily basis but to then go to a profit said robert j 
joedicke an airline specialist with shearson lehman brothers inc 
meanwhile shugrue said he will ask creditors for more money 
from easterns escrow fund in november us bankruptcy judge 
burton lifland approved a 50 million draw in october 
shugrue said american airlines america west delta air lines 
united airlines and usair have expressed interest in buying certain 
eastern assets 
he said northwest airlines pan am and twa have had discussions 
with eastern and delta has confirmed interest in buying 19 eastern 
gates in atlanta 
delta easterns chief rival because of their shared interest in 
atlanta has cut selected coach fares in response to eastern but 
shugrue said he doesnt think delta can do much to undercut 
easterns corporate push 
we expected delta to match the fares but they cant double 
the size of their firstclass cabins like we have he said

john jefferson green figured one day in 1927 that 
he could lure more customers into his southland ice co store if he 
stocked milk eggs and bread giving birth to the convenience store 
industry 
the same year joe c jodie thompson jr went to work for 
the ice company selling ice from the docks 
sixtythree years later the company thompson once led out of 
bankruptcy is back in bankruptcy court the leading convenience 
store chain became a victim of a 49 billion debtfinanced 
takeover and increased competition from gasoline retailers 
southland corp filed wednesday for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection from creditors in hopes of speeding the process 
southland also filed a reorganization plan that would give 70 
percent of the company to japanese investors in exchange for 430 
million in new cash creditors would get 25 percent of the company 
leaving 5 percent for the thompson family 
greens innovation started southlands expansion beyond peddling 
ice the stores renamed totem and using totem poles as a symbol 
began selling gasoline in 1928 beer snacks and grocery items and 
slurpees came later diversification eventually would include 
dairies refineries food processors and even an auto parts chain 
but by 1931 the company was struggling in the great depression 
and went through its first takeover as middle west utilities bought 
out the shareholders 
thompson then 30 was named president and later became the 
receiver when middle west itself went bankrupt the thompson family 
has controlled the company ever since 
with the repeal of prohibition southland began selling beer in 
1933 growth was spurred again in 1935 with the introduction of the 
paper milk carton

made southland the largest retailer of dairy items in the 
dallasfort worth area 
in 1939 southland had 60 stores all in texas expansion 
outside of the state didnt come until 1954 when the nowrenamed 
7eleven stores opened in miami and jacksonville fla 
the chain once reached a peak of more than 7000 stores 
worldwide today there are closer to 6800 with another 5900 run 
by affiliates and franchisees 
jodie thompson died in 1961 at the age of 60 and his oldest 
son john p thompson took over as president jere w thompson the 
second son was elected to the companys board of directors 
it wasnt until 1965 that the slurpee an iced slush drink came 
along 
southland purchased citgo petroleum corp in 1983 but sold half 
interest in the refinery years later to a subsidiary of stateowned 
petroleos de venezuela sa for 290 million 
four years later the events began that laid the basis for 
southlands demise 
as junkbond fed buyout fever was building the belzberg family 
of canada began talking about buying the dallas company 
but the thompsons wanted to keep control so they undertook 
their own takeover using the technique known as a leveraged 
buyout the family bought all the common shares outstanding with 
borrowed money pledging as collateral southlands assets 
then the stock market crashed interest rates shot up and the 
cost of borrowing money surged southland couldnt pay its bills 
and sought the sanctuary of bankruptcy court

walt disney co says its proposed nautical 
theme park and resort hotel in long beach would create 36700 jobs 
and generate 3 billion in economic activity a year 
the claims released wednesday were contained in an economic 
analysis disney presented to officials in long beach the big 
seaport south of los angeles 
disney hasnt yet decided whether to build the nautical park as 
its second gate in southern california it also is studying the 
possibility of opening a different kind of park on property it owns 
in anaheim beside disneyland setting up a bidding war of sorts 
between the cities 
the winning city would collect 62 million in taxes and fees 
much of the long beach park called port disney would be built 
on landfill brought in and dumped in long beach harbor beside the 
queen mary ocean liner now operated as a hoteltourist attraction 
by disney it would include five hotels with 3700 rooms and 
250000 square feet of retail space 
disney said its owned and operated facilities plus improvements 
to roads sewers and the rest of the nearby infrastructure would 
cost about 28 billion in 1990 dollars by the time the final phase 
is complete in 2010 
how much of that price tag will be picked up by the city will be 
a subject of negotiations disney expects the rosy economic report 
to help wring concessions from the city 
still to be completed are studies by disney and long beach on 
how smog traffic and water would be affected by the park but 
disney officials said the economic study was a milestone 
its a very important step for us it will enable us to begin 
financial negotiations with the city of long beach alan g 
epstein vice president of disney development co said in a 
telephone interview from the company headquarters in burbank 
disney presented its concept for the long beach park in july it 
is less far along in its studies for the possible second park in 
anaheim epstein said a facility similar to epcot center in florida 
is among the proposals for the location beside disneyland 
officials in both cities say they are eager to win the new park 
however its impact on long beach is less clear than for anaheim 
long beach officials citing allegations of disney 
highhandedness with florida cities have said they will insist the 
city as well as disney must benefit 
long beach mayor ernie kell said his first reaction was that 
disneys report is very impressive 
but this is just one step in about 100 steps before we are in 
a position to say this is going to work kell said 
just to bring the landfill over from catalina island is 
going to cost about 300 million kell said thats just the 
starter and then we have infrastructure to look at sewer lines 
water the trucks on the long beach freeway that will have to be 
rerouted 
the economic study prepared by the los angeles consulting firm 
kotin regan amp mouchly inc for disney said port disney would 
create more than 36700 permanent jobs in southern california 
including 23900 in long beach plus many more jobs during 
construction port disney itself would employ about 12400 people 
making it the second largest private employer in long beach 
generate about 17 billion in new economic activity each year 
in long beach as part of the 3 billion total for the fivecounty 
greater los angeles region 
produce more than 62 million in new taxes and fees to los 
angeles county and the city of long beach 
with this substantial increase in annual revenues long beach 
would be able to fund not only the public infrastructure required 
to accommodate the project but solutions to some of its most 
pressing problems epstein said in a statement 
kell who told the associated press in an earlier interview that 
disney cheiftain michael eisner didnt get to be the toppaid 
executive in the country by giving cities good deals reserved 
judgement 
theres still a lot of hurdles to go he said 
but he said that as a former real estate developer he knew long 
beach has a far stronger hand in dealing with disney than 
landlocked anaheim because of a big advantage location 
location location 
you have to have pretty great eyesight to see the ocean from 
anaheim kell said
