anger and frustration still simmer in watts 
25 years after a week of rioting reduced entire blocks to charred 
ruins and seared black rage onto the american conscience 
but watts today is not the powder keg it was when the streets of 
los angeles exploded on aug 11 1965 and burned for six nights 
and days according to residents community activists and academics 
some people say such postriot developments as a new shopping 
center and a health clinic have improved the community others 
contend that negative forces are responsible for keeping the lid on 
any more riots 
in recent years gangs and drugs have joined the longtime 
problems of crime joblessness and despair making the area both 
violent and stagnant watts today directs its rage at itself 
rather than at society reducing the risk of another riot but doing 
nothing to solve the communitys woes 
drugs are a deterrent a lazy deterrent said ted watkins 
jr president of watts labor community action committee a leader 
in the effort to rebuild the area i dont think that in 1990 the 
will is here for another riot 
watts became a symbol of innercity anger sparked by an event 
that didnt even happen inside the community of 30500 people eight 
miles due south of downtown los angeles 
four blocks west of watts two white california highway patrol 
officers stopped a 21yearold black motorist for investigation of 
erratic driving 
a scuffle started between the patrolmen and the motorist a 
crowd gathered and quickly grew angry rocks were thrown more 
police arrived the crowd swelled 
in about an hour the disturbance spread to surrounding 
communities including watts rioters torched buildings looted 
stores and pulled white drivers from their cars and beat them 
snipers took to the rooftops 
a 50squaremile area became a combat zone national guard jeeps 
with machine guns patrolled the streets 
when it was all over 34 people were dead 4000 others 
arrested and damage was estimated at 40 million a stretch of 
103rd street was lined by burntout skeletons of buildings giving 
it the name charcoal alley 
the mccone commission named after chairman john a mccone 
former head of the cia issued a 101page report finding that the 
cycle of poverty and despair gripping the area set the stage for 
the riot 
the report recommended a series of ambitious reforms from job 
training to efficient public transportation 
many community activists and politicians say some important 
reforms went into place and made watts a better community 
charcoal alley has become a pleasant street with a post office 
city council field office shopping center with a bank and 
supermarket and a station on the citys new blue line light rail 
system 
relations with the police department are the best ever many 
say thanks in part to increased minority recruitment community 
outreach and the common enemies of drugs and gangs 
ola mae toler a watts resident since 1947 said watts has 
improved to the point a riot could not happen today 
i dont think people are thinking of that anymore she said 
theres a lot of people who want progress i know i do but i 
have never thought that watts was the worst place to live 
others say many of the reforms recommended in the mccone report 
never materialized got lost in the shuffle or were scaled down 
the lockheed aeronautics plant near the wattswillowbrook border 
built in response to the riots was closed in 1988 putting 
thousands of people out of work 
the martin luther king jrdrew medical center built south of 
watts to provide more accessible health care has been battered by 
allegations of administrative negligence and inadequate services 
the schools have a serious dropout problem the failure rate was 
35 percent at ds jordan high school in watts in the 198889 
school year and nearly 36 percent at locke high school just west 
of watts according to the los angeles unified school district 
estimates of unemployment run as high as 40 percent the county 
department of public social services says more than half of watts 
residents receive some sort of public assistance most of them 
children 
crime is rampant in watts and surrounding communities with 
homicides about one every four days in the police departments 
southeast division about a third of which is watts ninetyfour 
murders were committed in the division last year in the first half 
of this year 49 homicides were reported 
the ground gained in 65 for the most part has been lost 
said tommy jacquette a watts resident and head of the watts summer 
festival a local arts celebration health programs and human 
services programs have been cut out by local government 
organizations designed for selfhelp are gone then theres the 
onslaught of drugs and gang activities 
ucla professor james johnson director of the ucla center for 
the study of urban poverty describes watts as a community at war 
with itself with watts residents killing watts residents 
i personally dont think well have another watts rebellion of 
65 he said i think today it takes place on a daily basis

the woman was probably in her 20s but 
she had the look of those who have lost all hope at first glance 
she appeared at least 50 years old 
she sat in the tropical rain on the curb of sekou toure avenue 
with a daysold baby cradled in her lap the baby was crying in the 
darkness no one else was to be seen 
it was after curfew and she risked being shot by president 
samuel does soldiers 
passersby stopped to offer her dollars and to advise her to get 
her baby out of harms way she refused the money i want food 
she said i cant buy food with that 
she was told if she walked into territory held by rebel chief 
prince johnson she might get some red cross rice there had been a 
distribution of rice that morning in the part of monrovia 
the woman shook her head i couldnt make it she said 
im too weak to carry the baby 
it was a statement of fact not a cry for help 
liberias civil war trudges on in its heartless manner civilian 
lives matter little in the immediate battle for a street crossing 
or a gas station and reports from rebelheld territory indicate 
people there face the same dangers 
in the morning the woman had gone 
was she taken in by people living nearby or killed by the 
troops or had she just wandered down the deserted rubblestrewn 
street in search of what 
even news of an impending intervention by a force of troops from 
several west african nations couldnt lift the gloom 
i dont believe anyone can help us in the mess weve made of 
our country said elwyn jackson a gas station attendant until 
the war closed his station and government troops killed his boss 
monrovia has no first aid stations no facilities for the poor 
no one to whom to turn for help not even ambulances or fire 
brigades are functioning 
fires started in the fighting blazed out of control sometimes 
all night when the rain comes every day or so the flames go out 
by themselves in a sizzle of hell 
stray dogs abandoned lost wander through the streets their 
bones show through their backs and they have the strange slow 
movements of those too starved to care 
the rotting bloated corpses of the human victims are seen 
everywhere in strange postures in gutters on sidewalks along the 
beach or in the uncut weeds on empty plots of land 
theres no one to remove the bodies and no one is worrying 
about dying later from some disease spread by the corpses 
feet hands and faces of the corpses are often missing the 
bodies are being attacked under cover of darkness by rats to the 
stray dogs 
acnid farnat is a diminutative lebanese who used to run the 
arabic school on the seafront he still lives there but his 
students have long since gone 
he came to the nearby british embassy pleading for special help 
the odor from a human body that had washed up in front of his house 
was making his family sick he wanted help to move the body 
neither the british nor anyone else was willing to assist him 
the body remained where it was until it disappeared a few days 
later in the waves 
the downtown streets are empty cars without wheels or with 
their windows shot out are parked everywhere long past anyones 
capacity to get them moving again 
the steel shutters of supermarkets most of them owned by 
lebanese or indians who have long gone have been blown apart by 
rifle bullets their contents looted 
the crackling of machinegun fire whipping across the long 
straight streets has become part of daily life 
every morning the remaining downtown inhabitants slink out of 
their homes in search for food and water long lines of civilians 
can be seen making their way across the old bridge over the 
mezurado river toward a haphazard rice distribution set up by 
johnson 
on benson street there is a solitary figure in a red tshirt 
crouched on the sidewalk eating garbage 
he ignores the roadblock set up by johnsons freedom 
fighters across the street and they ignore him 
hes crazy said the sergeant in charge 
even if everyone in this town gets killed hell still be 
there

the deployment of us troops to protect 
saudi arabia prompted an outburst of antiamerican sentiment in the 
arab world ranging from demonstrations to calls for a holy war 
against the united states 
the us troops were dispatched to protect saudi arabia in the 
wake of iraqs invasion of kuwait one week ago although the move 
came in response to a saudi appeal for protection it fanned 
resentment among arabs who consider it unwarranted interference 
arab nations have so far refused to participate in any 
multinational military effort against iraq and have concentrated on 
diplomatic efforts so far unsuccessful to peacefully resolve 
the crisis 
even before the deployment of us troops there was strong 
antiamerican feeling in much of the arab world because of the 
united states close ties with israel but the deployment brought 
an upsurge in such sentiment 
the head moslem clerics or mufti attached to the military wing 
of the palestine liberation organization declared that if the 
united states attacked iraq holy war is a duty for all moslems 
the ammanbased mufti sheik nader assad bayoud altamini said 
in a statement clearly aimed at the saudi royal family that those 
who ally themselves with the enemies of god the americans and the 
westerners and participate in the killing of iraqis are 
considered apostates and their blood should be shed 
in jordan where king hussein said he continues to recognize the 
deposed kuwaiti government the powerful professional engineers 
association called on all arab governments to form popular 
armies to confront the danger posed by the attempt of america 
to impose its will 
we call on all arabs to awaken from their slumber after seeing 
for themselves that imperialist countries stand together against 
the arab nation and its interests the group said in a statement 
a group calling itself the jordanian committee for the defense 
of kuwait urged volunteers to go to iraq to help president saddam 
hussein who has annexed kuwait resist any us attack 
mohammed rashdan a jordanian lawyer who is the secretary of the 
committee said the number of volunteers swelled following the 
arrival of the first us troops in saudi arabia he said he 
expected the number would grow to more than 10000 by the end of 
the day 
the united states and saudi arabia have said the american forces 
will act only defensively 
libyan radio announced during the day that thousands of libyans 
were ready to go to the region to fight against us interference 
in arab affairs 
in the yemeni capital of sana about 1000 people gathered in 
front of the us embassy and chanted slogans denouncing the us 
intervention but yemen the only arab member of the un security 
council joined in the unanimous vote thursday declaring the iraqi 
annexation of kuwait null and void 
the official egyptian middle east news agency reported an 
antiamerican demonstration was staged outside the us embassy in 
the sudanese capital khartoum 
critics claim the united states has no reason to intervene to 
protect saudi arabia because it has not moved to end the israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip which israel seized in 
1967 
faisal husseini the leading proplo activist in the occupied 
lands accused washington of using a double standard with the 
arabs why ask only iraq to withdraw from kuwait he said 
why not ask israel to withdraw from the west bank

iraqis rushed to stock up on rice sugar 
cooking oil and other foodstuffs after economic sanctions were 
announced fearing shortages in a country that imports 2 billion 
worth of food a year 
after iraq invaded kuwait attention was focused on the world 
embargo on iraqs oil exports the food cutoff could impose even 
greater suffering on iraq 
because the world embargo applies to kuwait too the residents 
of the iraqiannexed emirate are likely to feel the food pinch just 
as much kuwait imports effectively all of its food 
foreigners who fled kuwait after the invasion reported immediate 
shortages as residents rushed to supermarkets and prepared for 
siegelike conditions 
londons financial times on thursday quoted a source inside 
kuwait whom it did not identify as saying in notes shipped to the 
newspaper tuesday morning some residents queuing at banks and 
food shops but no sign of them opening 
iraq imports about 70 percent of its food according to omar 
kader a middle east expert and board member of the arabamerican 
affairs council food accounts for a quarter of all iraqi imports 
and onethird of the food brought in comes from the united states 
it consists mainly of wheat corn rice barley sugar poultry and 
eggs at subsidized prices 
washington has also provided agricultural credits to the arab 
country 
even before the invasion the senate voted july 27 to halt 1 
billion in agricultural credit guarantees citing in part iraqs 
recent threat to use chemical weapons against israel 
that measure required presidential approval but became moot 
after the postinvasion sanctions cut off all credit 
omar kader a middle east expert and board member of the 
arabamerican affairs council said on good morning america 
that a food cutoff would have almost immediate impact 
the iraqi people are accustomed to shortages 
during the 198088 war with iran many foodstuffs were rationed 
including rice sugar and cooking oil people stood in lines 
stretching around city blocks to purchase small quantities at 
government stores 
local turkish and iraqi officials have been trying to figure out 
what to do about thousands of trucks blocked on both sides of the 
border since turkey decided to cut off trade with iraq 
turkey is both a supplier of food to iraq and a crucial overland 
route for imports from europe and other points 
a major route for iraqi food imports during the iraniraq war 
was the truck route from the port of aqaba in jordan a country 
where feelings in support of iraq run strong in some quarters 
but businessmen in jordan said ships carrying food or other 
products have not unloaded at aqaba since the un security council 
voted monday for global sanctions against iraq 
another possible route for food imports the long iraniraq 
border has been shut to trade since the 1980 outbreak of the 
iraniraq war it is now patrolled by un ceasefire monitors 
with no trade allowed across it 
marking an exception to the world blockade sri lanka said it 
would continue selling tea a major staple in every arab country 
to iraq despite the embargo 
we are a poor country and must continue to pick and sell our 
tea said deputy defense minister ranjaan wijeratne sanctions 
can be imposed by rich countries we cannot afford to stop selling 
our products 
iraq is sri lankas secondlargest customer after egypt having 
bought 24 percent of last years tea exports

the worlds longest staircase has 
six times as many steps as the empire state building and is nearly 
twice as long as its nearest rival in china but it is virtually 
unknown even in switzerland 
in a bid to end its obscurity local enthusiasts this week 
staged the first official race up the 11674 steps of mount niesen 
in the swiss alps 
organizers say the niesentreppen run will be an annual 
event attracting the worlds top racers in a test of stamina and 
skill up a hodgepodge of concrete wooden and metal steps 
for the rest of the year the steps give maintenance workers 
access to a cable railway and are off limits to others the 
80yearold railway runs from this bernese oberland village up the 
7794 feet mountain 
the lineup at wednesdays race included a sports professor a 
diving instructor a skitour organizer and a shop assistant they 
were among 20 people all men competing for the 7692 prize 
swiss medical student christian aebersold averaged 223 steps a 
minute to complete the dizzying course in 52 minutes 26 seconds 
jairo correa of colombia clocked 5311 minutes correa is the world 
champion of mountain racers whose sport involves running up 
mountains 
us runner jay johnson said one of the reasons he entered the 
race was because it was different from the usual courses in the 
mountainracing circuit 
the narrow steps through tunnels and over bridges spanning 
great drops extend for only 21 miles but scale 5344 feet from 
valley to summit 
after finishing sixth in 5642 minutes johnson the 1988 
mountainracing champion declared the race great fun 
but i had problems with the open metal steps toward the top as 
when i looked at the drop below i felt dizzy he said 
one of the few competitors who had raced on steps before was 
villa frades from colombia he scaled the 6600 steps at the 
chinese temple of tai chun 
mike ballmann a former stuntman who helped organized the race 
said his goal was to put the niesentreppen on the map 
it is a great pity that we have the worlds longest steps here 
in switzerland but they are mostly unknown he said 
ballmann said he first hit on the idea of organizing a race when 
he scaled the steps in 1979 while training for a race in nepal 
he then persuaded fellow mountain enthusiast and swiss 
mathematic professor jacques berlie to take up the challenge 
berlies time last year of one hour and three minutes in a run 
televised worldwide set the standard for this year 
fabiola rueda a twotime womens world mountainracing 
champion also ran up mount niesen on wednesday but was not 
competing 
ms rueda a colombian national married to her swiss trainer 
clocked 10550 to set the target for women racers next year 
ballmann said he hoped four to five women would participate next 
year but the overall number of competitors will stay fixed at 20 
for safety reasons he said

a federal judge thursday denied an environmental 
groups request to immediately halt the shipment of us chemical 
weapons from west germany to a pacific island pending a hearing 
later this month 
greenpeace usa had asked us district judge david ezra to grant 
a temporary restraining order preventing the army from moving the 
weapons from a storage site at clausen west germany to johnston 
atoll 800 miles southwest of honolulu 
ezra denied the request but scheduled a hearing on greenpeaces 
plea for a preliminary injunction for aug 20 
the decision was a partial victory for the bush administration 
which has pledged to remove the weapons from west germany by the 
end of the year government attorneys had said any halt in the 
shipment could delay the operation until 1991 
events unfolding in the middle east have painted up with 
precision and clarity the importance to the national security of 
the united states that commitments made by and between 
representatives of nations be honored ezras 21page ruling said 
greenpeace filed a lawsuit last week naming defense secretary 
dick cheney and michael p stone secretary of the army as 
defendants the organization said the munitions and plans to 
incinerate them pose a threat to the environment and people of the 
pacific 
government attorneys said johnston atoll is the safest location 
for the weapons they said every precaution has been taken to 
ensure the safety of the shipment 
ezra ruled that failing to immediately halt the shipment would 
not cause irreversible harm to the plaintiffs goal of keeping the 
army from transporting the munitions to johnston atoll since the 
weapons are not scheduled to leave west germany until next month 
the weapons are to be loaded onto trucks then transferred to 
rail cars bound for the north sea two us navy ships are to take 
the weapons to johnston atoll by an undisclosed route sometime 
after sept 1 
about 30 percent of the 100000 rounds of nerve gas shells 
already have been removed from the clausen facility or packed into 
shipping containers 
greenpeace attorney skip spaulding said he was confident the 
aug 20 hearing would allow him to prove the army has violated us 
environmental laws 
spaulding contended the army violated the national environmental 
policy act by not filing an environmental impact statement covering 
the movement of the weapons within west germany 
the army said it prepared an environmental impact statement on 
the ocean portion of the weapons journey to johnston however the 
report is classified and ezra has not seen it 
the army has yet to obtain approval to incinerate the weapons at 
the new johnston atoll chemical agent disposal system the facility 
is still being tested 
ezra said nothing leads him to believe us environmental laws 
apply in west germany when the removal of the munitions is being 
assisted by that nation however he said the laws do apply to the 
proposed incineration of the weapons at johnston atoll 
president bush has assured the west german government the 
weapons will be removed by the end of the year 
congress has required that all us chemical weapons be 
destroyed by 1997

a year after his death mickey lelands hope 
and vision to end world hunger is still alive 
its in 500000 worth of food and supplies scheduled to leave 
new york this month for fugnido the ethiopian refugee camp the 
texas congressman was heading for when his plane crashed aug 7 
1989 
its in a drive expected to yield at least 30000 pounds of food 
for the houston food bank 
and it caused 336 house members to vote for more food stamp 
benefits in the 1990 farm bill last week just after the vote many 
of them sang god bless america in lelands honor at a moonlight 
vigil on the capitol steps 
they feel committed to make sure that things and issues that 
matter to him carry forward get attention lelands widow 
alison said after the tribute 
leland a democrat who served a predominantly black and hispanic 
innercity houston district was best known for starting the house 
select committee on hunger in 1984 he chaired it until his death 
mickey had become a conscience in the congress for fighting 
malnutrition across the world civil rights leader jesse jackson 
recalled mickey leland was unique he was bilingual he had a 
great sense of coalitionbuilding he could get strange and odd 
couples to do things together 
lelands friend and former colleague in the texas legislature 
craig washington was elected to his house seat in december 
washington has taken up several of lelands causes most notably 
the reunification of ethiopian jews 
mrs leland who is an attorney briefly considered running for 
the seat she was pregnant then and has since given birth to twin 
boys her sons and a feeling there wasnt any unfinished business 
on mickeys part made her decide not to run she told the 
washington post 
leland and 15 others were killed shortly after the plane 
carrying them left addis ababa the ethiopian capital for refugee 
camps on the sudanese border 
leland took the trip to call attention to the plight of sudanese 
teenagers who fled to ethiopia from the civil war in their country 
these particular refugee situations are among the most totally 
hidden from western view said michael toole an epidemiologist 
with the federal centers for disease control who spent june at 
fugnido and two other camps 
ethiopias own hunger problem has been compounded by 380000 
sudanese and 385000 somalis who fled to the country from unrest at 
home there are 77000 sudanese refugees at fugnido 
relief workers still talked about leland during tooles visits 
he said 
relations between the us and ethiopia being as they are not 
totally good mickey helped overcome that obstacle to providing 
humanitarian aid toole said humanitarian aid was provided 
despite the shaky relations 
aid is reaching the refugees but their mortality rate remains 
high particularly among the somalis he said 
funding problems at the united nations high commission on 
refugees have made the situation worse toole said but lelands 
legacy the hunger committee helped earlier this summer by 
obtaining millions for the commission in a supplemental 
appropriations bill 
neil flieger a committee staff member said leland galvanized 
congress to end hunger 
it was a lifetime and four terms in congress of having worked 
on and paid attention to this issue and trying to get other people 
to pay attention to this issue that came to an untimely end but 
also reached a crescendo that day a year ago flieger said

an error of about one millimeter called 
astonishing by one expert for its large size has been found 
in a measuring device used to guide the manufacture of a flawed 
mirror on the hubble space telescope 
a nasa committee investigating the defect that has crippled the 
15 billion telescope announced thursday that the millimeter 
mistake was found while testing the measuring device called a null 
corrector 
the space telescope touted as an orbiting observatory that 
would be able to see objects up to 14 billion light years away was 
launched in april 
engineers discovered two months later that a mirror in the 
device had been manufactured wrong as a result the telescopes 
views of stars are blurred and of severely reduced value to 
astronomers 
the investigation committee said in a onepage statement that it 
found the millimeter error while testing a null corrector on 
wednesday at the hughes danbury optical systems plant in danbury 
conn where the mirrors were made 
hughes danbury had preserved the null corrector in the exact 
position that had been used to grind and polish the mirrors in the 
early 1980s 
preliminary results of the test the statement said have 
revealed a clear discrepancy of approximately one millimeter 
between the design of the null corrector and the device as it 
exists 
a millimeter is about one twentyfifth of an inch or about the 
size of the very tip of a ballpoint pen 
daniel schulte a senior scientist at the optical laboratory at 
the lockheed palo alto research laboratory in california said an 
error of that magnitude was astonishing 
thats gross he said theres no reason for an error of 
that size to be tolerated 
schulte said that in normal optical manufacturing a difference 
of a 20th or a 50th of a millimeter is considered standard 
tolerance 
he said the error was so large it had to be a transposition of 
numbers or something like that that was carried through it had to 
be something clerical like that 
schulte an astronomer was a member of an independent panel 
named by the national aeronautics and space administration to 
evaluate the hubble focusing flaw just after it was discovered in 
june 
after confirming that the focusing error was in the spacecraft 
mirrors the panel was dissolved and nasa named another committee 
headed by jet propulsion laboratory director lew allen to 
investigate the mistake 
a null corrector is a device that can be adjusted to create a 
pattern of light in the exact shape desired in an optical lens or 
mirror the light pattern from a null corrector is interpreted by 
another device to tell a computer the precise grinding and 
polishing pattern that must be followed 
however if the null corrector is set wrong the lens or mirror 
will be ground to an incorrect shape in effect the optics then 
are made to the wrong prescription and cannot give the expected 
focus 
an engineer who asked not to be identified said that during 
the 18monthlong mirror grinding and polishing process at least 
two measurements had been made with a second null corrector and 
that errors had been found but the errors were ignored on the 
assumption that the main measuring device had the correct pattern 
sarah keegan a nasa spokeswoman said the space agencys 
investigation board would have no further statements this week but 
the board plans to conduct hearings at the hughes danbury plant 
next wednesday and thursday and more information may be released 
after those hearings she said 
thomas arconti a spokesman for hughes danbury said the company 
was informed of the committee finding and we are not in 
disagreement with their release 
he said hughes officials were surprised to find the 
discrepancy but were not going to speculate about what might 
have happened 
arconti said a single null corrector was used to guide the 
polishing process for the hubble mirrors 
dick wollensak vice president of litton itek optical systems 
an unsuccessful bidder for the hubble optical contract said he was 
surprised at the size of the error found by the investigation 
committee 
that is a very large error he said i cant imagine how 
they would have missed something like that

american gis dug into position in arabias searing sands 
thursday while american diplomats worked the airconditioned 
corridors of power both tightening a vise step by step on an 
increasingly isolated iraq 
the dangerous usiraqi standoff in the desert rattled nerves 
across the middle east 
israel fired off a test missile as a warning to the iraqis air 
raid sirens wailed mysteriously in jordan turkish villagers said 
iraqi tanks had rumbled into position near the turkeyiraq border 
and iraq closed its frontiers for foreigners heightening concerns 
about hundreds of americans stranded in iraq and kuwait 
the tension reached as far as the hills of tennessee and farms 
of wisconsin where local air national guardsmen were hurriedly 
called from their civilian jobs to help ferry us troops and gear 
the 5000 miles to saudi arabia 
a pentagon source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united states was prepared to put many divisions in saudi 
arabia in the face of a continued iraqi buildup in kuwait 
we have contingency plans that could result in the insertion 
of up to 200000 to 250000 ground forces before its all done 
said the source who spoke on condition that further identification 
be withheld such moves could take up to two months the source 
said 
the pentagon earlier reported that 50000 iraqi combat units 
were moving south inside iraq and that if they entered kuwait the 
total invasion force would number about 170000 only a day 
earlier the intelligence estimates had put the iraqi force at 
100000 men 
american leaders believe the saudi oil kingdom could be the next 
target of iraqi president saddam hussein whose invasion force 
conquered kuwait last week 
arab leaders desperate to defuse the explosive crisis gathered 
in cairo in search of a peaceful resolution possibly an allarab 
force to act as a border buffer between the saudis and americans on 
one side and the iraqis on the other 
the summit was postponed a day until friday the official reason 
for the postponement was some late arrivals 
but unconfirmed reports said the summit hit a snag because the 
iraqi delegation brought its own representative for the new 
baghdadinstalled kuwaiti government the iraqis according to some 
reports refused to accept the presence of kuwaits emir 
taha yassin ramadan the leader of the iraqi delegation in 
cairo asserted that the us force in saudi arabia would be used 
to attack iraq 
any such move will be answered decisively he said iraqs 
ambassador to greece suggested the iraqis would unleash poison gas 
on any attacking american troops 
while the arab presidents and sheiks marked time in cairo 
american diplomacy pressed forward in world capitals 
secretary of state james a baker iii in ankara told turkish 
leaders they could depend on their nato allies in any showdown with 
neighboring iraq 
in paris a us envoy reassured a 21nation energy conference 
that washington would tap its huge emergency oil stockpile if the 
crisis causes shortages france promised to send an aircraft 
carrier to the gulf and strengthen its naval and air forces there 
at un headquarters in new york the united states helped 
shepherd a resolution through the security council rejecting iraqs 
announced annexation of kuwait on monday the council ordered a 
worldwide economic embargo against iraq 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait aug 2 was rooted in grievances 
over oil money and land 
saddam complained that kuwaiti overproduction of petroleum had 
driven down world oil prices and iraqs oil revenues he also 
rejected kuwaits demands that iraq repay an estimated 15 billion 
in loans and he reasserted longstanding claims on kuwaiti 
territory 
on thursday a day after annexing the wealthy emirate the 
iraqis announced they were cancelling their debt to kuwait 
world opinion led by the united states has almost universally 
condemned the invasion iraqs neighbor and longtime enemy iran 
joined the chorus thursday declaring it will not tolerate the 
kuwait annexation 
on wednesday president bush announced the deployment of us 
troops to buttress the outmanned saudi military and declared we 
must resist aggression or it will destroy us an iraqi takeover 
of saudi arabia a key source of us oil would endanger the us 
economy he said 
on thursday however pentagon spokesman pete williams said the 
iraqi troops in kuwait seem to be in a defensive posture 
at least 2300 american soldiers mostly from the 82nd airborne 
divisions ready brigade were flown to saudi arabia on 
wednesday pentagon sources said elements of two other divisions 
the 101st airborne and the 24th mechanized infantry would be 
among the units to be sent 
the united states also was dispatching some 140 f15s f16s and 
other warplanes including tank killer a10s pentagon and 
other sources reported 
sources in the middle east said the us units were being 
deployed at strategic airports and bases across saudi arabia but 
the main grouping was in the remote northeastern region of hafr 
albaten near iraqioccupied kuwait 
travelers leaving saudi arabia and speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the flow of american forces to the border region 
appeared to be increasing thursday 
the dimensions of the global us operation many of whose 
details were being kept secret could be seen thursday at the 
lajes air base in portugals azores islands where eyewitnesses 
reported 17 us air force aerial tankers lined up on the runway at 
one point 
on wednesday diplomatic sources said hundreds of us marines 
had been flown to saudi arabias northeast corner and deployed at 
khafji just seven miles from kuwait but on thursday a pentagon 
source denied that saying no marines were in saudi arabia at 
this time 
besides the ground forces powerful navy units were converging 
on the tense persian gulf area 
fifteen vessels the biggest of them the aircraft carrier uss 
independence were in the gulf or near its entrance about 20 more 
will be in mideast waters by next week including the battleship 
wisconsin bristling with cruise missiles programmed for targets in 
iraq

a presidential spokesman said us 
marines fired from a helicopter at president samuel doe on the 
porch of his executive mansion thursday in an unsuccessful attempt 
to assassinate him 
in washington the state department denied the charge 
doe spokesman selly thompson speaking in a radio telephone call 
with the british broadcasting corp said a doe adviser former 
justice minister isaac nyaplu was hit in the chest and neck and 
was hospitalized 
the incident came as west african peacekeeping troops headed for 
a showdown with rebels who battled does troops and fought to 
within a mile of his mansion in a bid to take monrovia before the 
african task force arrives 
rebels loyal to former bureaucrat charles taylor pushed into 
eastern congo town suburb where they ransacked the nigerian 
embassy and attacked the guinea embassy 
they forced thousands of people seeking refuge at the nigerian 
embassy most from nigeria into streets where battles raged 
it was not clear what happened at the guinea embassy which had 
given sanctuary to thousands of people from the mandingo tribe 
seeking safety from the rebel who have killed thousands of their 
people accusing them of supporting and enriching themselves on 
does corrupt regime 
nigerian foreign minister rilwanu lukman said in lagos that his 
government sent word to taylor that we will hold him personally 
responsible for any harm done to nigerians inside the embassy at 
the time of the attack 
in alleging the us assassination attempt thompson asked the 
international community to pressure the united states to stop 
excessive harassment to remove doe 
he said doe and all those in the executive mansion have 
felt under contant harassment from the us marines and he was 
sure that the united states government was now going out 
deliberately to kill the president said the bbc report 
last month doe accused a us submarine of firing on his 
mansion the united states denied it 
state depapartment deputy spokesman richard boucher said the 
united states has evacuated 150 people from liberia this week 
including the french and italian ambassadors 
he said prior to the alleged assassination attempt that prince 
johnson a rebel leader who is a rival of taylor has not carried 
out his threat to fire on the marines 
he said the marines are there to protect the embassy and the 
americans there theyre not in monrovia to intervene in the 
fighting or to take sides 
diplomats say taylor wants to capture the city by the weekend 
the fivenation west african force dominated by nigerian 
soldiers mobilized to move into liberia and impose a ceasefire 
by force if necessary 
troops and tanks were reported massing across liberias northern 
border in guinea and to the east on the sierra leone border 
according to military sources in ghana and sierra leone reports 
said 500 troops were on standby and may be airlifted into monrovia 
nigerian troop transports and warships were reported headed for 
monrovia harbor 
a contingent of 225 us marines set up defensive positions 
around their embassy and key us installations on sunday they 
evacuated scores of foreign nationals 
france announced it was closing its embassy and evacuating the 
small remaining staff and any french nationals who could reach 
evacuation points 
taylors men on thursday fought does troops in congo town an 
eastern suburb in which lie embassies and st josephs catholic 
hospital the only hospital still operating in monrovia 
there is fighting going on all around the hospital and workers 
there are cut off from an embassy where they were staying a 
european relief worker said in a radio communication from monrovia 
to europe the name of the agency was withheld to protect its 
workers in liberia 
rebels reportedly met little resistance in their overnight 
advance 
the relief worker said taylors rebels plundered the 
nigerian embassy and forced the refugees out she said it was 
not clear if anyone was wounded 
there were no reports about what had happened at the guinea 
embassy 
a foreign ministry spokesman in bonn said 300 people from the 
nigerian embassy sought refuge at the west german mission he said 
about 500 refugees now were at the mission including americans 
belgians french dutch irish liberians and filipinos 
a relief worker said doctors in monrovia asked doe thursday for 
permission to burn down st peters lutheran church to prevent a 
plague being spread by decomposing bodies of up to 600 refugees 
survivors said the victims were massacred by does troops july 30 
doe said the killers were rebels in dressed in government uniforms 
the attack on the nigerian embassy raised tension in the region 
two days after leaders of the west african economic community 
decided to send troops to end the 7monthold civil war in which 
at least 5000 people have died 
president joseph momoh of sierra leone told his troops in 
freetown on thursday the need for you as soldiers going to 
liberia is due to the deterioration which has resulted in the 
displacement of innocent citizens and also in anarchy 
he said about 80000 refugees who fled to sierra leone were 
affecting his countrys economy and social life while sierra 
leoneans stranded in monrovia and sheltering at their countrys 
embassy had no food or medicines 
there are more than 400000 liberian refugees in neighboring 
states 
doe and prince johnson have welcomed the west african initiative 
taylor is opposed he fears nigerian participation because its 
president gen ibrahim babangida in the past has been an ally of 
doe 
momoh emphasized the task force is to maintain neutrality and 
our intention is not to take over liberia 
gambian leader sir dawda jawara told the bbc there were no plans 
to ask the nigerians to withdraw from the joint force because of 
taylors opposition 
the west africans say they will enforce a ceasefire to allow 
formation of an interim government charged with organizing free and 
fair elections within a year 
on wednesday johnson freed the last of dozens of foreign 
hostages seized monday and tuesday in a bid to force foreign 
intervention 
the civil war began when taylor led an insurgent force across 
the border from the ivory coast accusing doe of corruption and 
mismanagement

the justice departments challenge to 
georgias majority vote election runoff system ultimately could aid 
republican candidates in the south and southwest not blacks a 
political observer says 
the department sued thursday contending that georgias election 
runoff system has had a chilling effect on black political 
participation 
ten states in the south and southwest have laws requiring a 
runoff election if no candidate receives a majority of the votes in 
a general election 
the republican party can be made overnight in the south if 
that runoff law is eliminated said claiborne darden an 
atlantabased pollster that would do more for the republican 
party than republicans could do for themselves in 125 years 
without runoff elections darden said blacks would win more 
democratic primaries but they would lose general elections to gop 
candidates backed by white voters who previously supported white 
democratic candidates he said 
john r dunne assistant attorney general for civil rights said 
more than 35 black candidates in over 20 counties in georgia have 
finished first in multicandidate primary elections in recent 
years only to lose in runoffs against a single white candidate 
he said the law amounts to an electoral steroid for white 
candidates because it gives them an extraordinary power over 
black candidates in states with racially polarized voting 
the suit filed in us district court in atlanta contends that 
the 1964 georgia law requiring candidates to receive a majority of 
the vote to win an election deprives black voters of an equal 
opportunity to elect candidates of their choice 
the suit marks the first time the justice department has used 
the 1965 voting rights act to challenge a states majority vote 
runoff system a position jesse jackson first advocated during his 
1984 presidential campaign 
jackson tried unsuccessfully that year to persuade the 
democratic party to take a stand against majority vote runoff 
elections in its presidential platform democratic presidential 
nominee walter mondale opposed the effort 
jacksons georgia coordinator in 1984 state rep tyrone brooks 
of atlanta renewed the effort earlier this year when he filed suit 
in federal court asking that georgias runoff system be invalidated 
a federal judge refused to rule on the issue before this 
summers georgia elections former atlanta mayor andrew young who 
was seeking to become georgias first black governor opposed the 
lawsuit 
young finished second in the democratic primary and then was 
swamped by lt gov zell miller in tuesdays runoff election 
the runoff law however has made the political careers of other 
georgia leaders sen sam nunn gov joe frank harris and rep 
john lewis all georgia democrats were elected for the first time 
after finishing second in democratic primaries and then winning the 
runoff 
i think the runoff is enormously important and i think 
majority rule is important nunn said thursday and i believe 
that if you deprive the people of the right to make that decision 
by majority votes youve greatly damaged the election process 
asked if he believed the suit was an effort by republicans to 
weaken the democratic party in the south nunn said i wouldnt 
want to make that charge but i certainly disagree with the justice 
department getting involved in this 
dunne said the department has no immediate plans to challenge 
the election systems in alabama arizona arkansas florida 
louisiana oklahoma mississippi south carolina and texas the 
only other states with laws requiring a majority vote to be 
nominated or elected to office 
but he said those state runoff laws because of their similarity 
to the georgia law likely would be overturned should the 
department prevail in the georgia case 
dunne said the departments lawsuit challenges only elections 
where the majority vote requirement has been used to dilute the 
voting strength of minorities that would include most statewide 
elections he said and many local elections where blacks are a 
large bloc of the voting population but have been unable to elect 
black candidates 
dunne said about 24 percent of georgias voting age population 
is black but less than 10 percent of the elected offices in the 
state are held by blacks and most of those are at the local level

congressional investigators say a reagan white 
house plan to deny federal liability in toxic exposure cases led to 
the cancellation of a major study of agent oranges effects on 
vietnam veterans 
a house panel concluded in a report issued thursday that the 
white house controlled and obstructed the study congress 
ordered from the centers for disease control 
the report by the house government operations committee 
supported arguments by the american legion and the vietnam veterans 
of america they filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have the cdc 
resume its study of the health effects of agent orange exposure 
during the vietnam war 
while the reagan administration defended the vietnam conflict 
as an honorable war it worked behind the scenes to deny benefits 
to the very people who sacrificed their health for their country 
said rep ted weiss dny chairman of the subcommittee that 
wrote the report 
the report followed a 14month investigation and hearings by 
weiss subcommittee 
in a written dissent the subcommittees ranking republican said 
the reports conclusion of a white house plot to cover up the truth 
about agent orange is simply not supported by the facts 
instead of advancing the debate on agent orange in a positive 
direction the human resources subcommittee has abused this issue 
in order to launch an ideological assault upon a republican white 
house with which it has never agreed rep richard k armey 
rtexas said 
agent orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during 
the vietnam war it has been blamed by veterans groups for 19 
cancers and a variety of other health problems including birth 
defects 
congress ordered the cdc study to determine whether vietnam 
veterans had been exposed to agent orange it was to be used as a 
basis for other studies measuring links to health problems 
the report said the white house ordered the studys cancellation 
after the cdc said it was scientifically impossible to use military 
records to identify veterans who had been exposed 
the committee said the study should have continued because cdc 
did not document that exposure could not be assessed and 
disregarded alternate methods of measuring exposure 
the white house compromised the independence of the cdc and 
undermined the study by controlling crucial decisions and guiding 
the course of research at the same time it had secretly taken a 
legal position to resist demands to compensate victims of agent 
orange exposure and industrial accidents the report said 
at the cdc in atlanta spokeswoman gayle lloyd said the agency 
would have no comment because it had not seen the report but she 
said we do stand by our studies and our decisions 
a spokeswoman for the department of veterans affairs donna st 
john said the agency had no comment 
the study was officially monitored by a white house task force 
called the agent orange working group the house panel concluded 
the white house controlled the study through the working group and 
the office of management and budget 
the panel said that despite evidence vietnam veterans are more 
susceptible to certain forms of cancer and birth defects in their 
offspring the federal government has consistently refused to 
acknowledge any link to agent orange exposure 
the federal government has suppressed or minimized findings of 
ill health effects among vietnam veterans that could be linked to 
agent orange exposure the report said 
but armey said in his dissent scientific information has failed 
to establish any conclusive link between agent orange and health 
problems he said that compensating veterans for simple exposure 
to agent orange is a political decision not a scientific one 
the va this year decided to award compensation for two rare 
cancers softtissue sarcoma and nonhodgkins lymphoma linked to 
agent orange

stores were closed buses stayed in the garage 
and soldiers in tanks patrolled the streetson the first day of an 
economic austerity program three people died in isolated protests 
and looting 
the capitals normally crowded downtown streets were nearly 
deserted thursday in the hours after the new government of 
president alberto fujimori announced a plan to end soaring 
inflation 
a military state of emergency was declared early this week to 
prepare for the rigid measures announced wednesday by prime 
minister carlos hurtado miller also the countrys economy minister 
under the plan the price of gasoline jumped from 7 cents per 
gallon to more than 2 many basic foods tripled and quadrupled in 
cost price subsidies a staple of government policy for four 
decades are to be eliminated 
controls will be removed to allow the inti the nations 
currency to float free if the value of the inti against other 
currencies falls as expected peruvian products would be cheaper 
abroad and spur exports 
import duties will be drastically cut forcing peruvian industry 
to compete with foreignmade goods taxes will be raised 
especially for the rich 
god help us hurtado said after announcing the measures 
the austerity plan aims to slash the 3000 annual inflation 
rate the government also hopes to provide the basis for rebuilding 
perus collapsed economy which has shrunk by 20 percent in the 
last two years 
industry runs at less than half its capacity automobile sales 
last year were 10 percent of 1967 levels only one in five 
peruvians holds an official job 
perus worst drought this century has deepened the crisis up to 
70 percent of many crops including staples such as the potato 
have been lost 
authorities are uncertain how peruvians will respond to the 
measures many people voted for fujimori because of his strong 
opposition to the harsh austerity plan proposed by campaign 
opponent mario vargas llosa 
the poor are especially liable to feel betrayed by the austerity 
program about onethird of perus 22 million people live in 
critical poverty and the great majority voted for fujimori 
nevertheless it is this sector of the population that will 
likely suffer most from the measures many of the poor will simply 
be unable to afford food or bus fares 
the government has said it will hand out food and subsidize 
water and bus service the government has promised 450 million to 
help the poor survive the economic adjustment hurtado said 
wednesday 
but new bus fares had yet to be set thursday night and most 
municipalities lacked the food to set up soup kitchens the 
government has yet to raise most of the 450 million 
markets were shuttered thursday exacerbating the situation 
most of perus poor buy food on a daybyday basis 
what am i going to eat what are my children going to eat 
maria vidaurre said thursday before the locked gates of a 
shantytown market she held an empty plastic bag 
many economists including top fujimori advisers have said 
perus economy is too weak to absorb an extreme austerity program 
they said vastly higher prices accompanied by a tight monetary 
policy could paralyze the country 
many believe the key to the austerity programs success will be 
the militarys ability to keep order 
the army has taken a major role in fujimoris government with 
active generals running the ministries of defense and interior 
many police responsibilities were transferred to military control 
last week after a purge of top police officials 
the state of emergency which allows the army to arrest people 
without hearings and to search houses without warrant was decreed 
two days before hurtados speech 
the strict security measures are to help quell a 10yearold 
insurgency by leftist shining path rebels in which more than 15000 
people have died

federal regulators want charles h keating jr 
and five associates to pay 409 million to the defunct lincoln 
savings and loan association for losses it suffered from three sour 
business deals 
but a spokesman for keating and lawyers for his company accused 
the office of thrift supervision of trying to harass the phoenix 
businessman because regulators have failed to prove allegations 
raised in court cases 
ots launched administrative proceedings thursday against 
keating the chairman of american continental corp and five of 
the companys top officers the regulators are seeking to recover 
money they say was improperly used to finance questionable business 
deals 
the agency also seeks to remove keating and the five executives 
from the company and bar them forever from the thrift industry 
american continental which owned lincoln savings and loan 
filed for bankruptcy protection a day before the irvine calif 
thrift was seized by federal regulators in april 1989 
lincoln which keatings company acquired in 1984 invested 
heavily in the junk bond market a federal grand jury in los 
angeles is investigating possible criminal wrongdoing in the sampls 
2 billion failure 
keating has repeatedly claimed he is broke 
but ots director timothy ryan said regulators just do not 
believe him right now and want a full accounting of keatings 
personal assets in five days there was much too much money that 
was available to him and too short a time for it all to 
disappear ryan said 
a temporary cease and desist order demanding that he account for 
his assets also bars keating from moving any money out of the 
country it also forbids him from making any transactions over 
5000 without first notifying ots 
american continental spokesman bradley boland said keating and 
his associates would take every legal opportunity that is 
available to fight the charges 
ryan said an administrative law judge will hear the case in late 
october ots may seek additional restitution after completing 
investigations of other deals financed by lincoln he said 
a statement issued by lawyers representing american continental 
said the ots action appears to be a case of duplicative and 
harassing litigation 
in its claim for restitution the government is again seeking 
the same relief against the same individuals with respect to the 
same transactions that are at issue in the civil rico suit it filed 
nearly a year ago the lawyers said in a statement read by 
washington attorney leonard bickwit jr 
last september the resolution trust corp and the federal 
deposit insurance corp cited the same three transactions outlined 
in the ots charges in a racketeering suit against keating and his 
associates filed under the racketeerinfluenced corrupt 
organizations law 
keating in turn sued federal regulators charging that the 
seizure of lincoln savings was unwarranted the case is still 
unresolved 
the agencys complaint details a loss to lincoln of 242 
million for an investment in a moneylosing hotel in detroit and a 
44 million loss on what regulators called the sham sale of desert 
land in arizona 
it also outlines how lincoln lost 123 million when it financed 
an employee stock ownership plans purchase of american continental 
stock from keating and others 
the charges also were filed against five other american 
continental officers judy j wischer president and chief 
executive officer robert j kielty a director senior vice 
president and general counsel keatings son charles h keating 
iii an executive vice president and director and two of keatings 
sonsinlaw who are vice presidents robert j hubbard and robert 
m wurzelbacher jr 
the justice department is investigating whether keating 
illegally donated 13 million to five senators who in 1987 
intervened with federal regulators on his behalf sources say the 
senate ethics committee is also investigating the allegations of 
misconduct against the five lawmakers

despite threats by iraqi president saddam 
hussein to use chemical weapons against israel analysts say they 
do not believe iraq has developed a chemical warhead capable of 
reaching the jewish state by missile 
the experts said iraqs only option was to deliver the chemical 
weapons to israel by artillery bombardments or air raids which 
would have little chance of success 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile compared the iraqi 
leader with hitler and warned him that the jewish people would 
retaliate if attacked 
saddam has threatened to attack israel in case of an american 
military strike in the persian gulf 
speaking to graduates of the armys defense college on thursday 
shamir said he was not taking the iraqi leaders threats lightly and 
warned any attempt to harm israel will cost him and his army a 
heavy price 
after comparing him to hitler shamir noted that the decades 
since the holocaust has changed the jewish nation which lost some 
six million people during world war ii 
this time the jewish nation has the ability and the tools to 
defend itself and if need be to repel and defeat he said 
iraq has the sovietmade scud b or ss1 surfacetosurface 
missiles with a range of 170 miles and the iraqimodified version 
of these alhussein with a range of 370 to 430 miles 
israeli generals decided last weekend to step up the 
distribution of gas masks nationwide but chief of staff ltgen 
dan shomron told israel television the army was refraining from 
distributing the masks because the hysteria would be playing into 
the hands of saddam hussein 
we have the ability to prevent the attacks on israel he 
said without elaborating 
joseph alpher an analyst at the jaffee center for strategic 
studies said he believed saddam did not yet have chemical warheads 
for its surfacetosurface missiles despite iraqi efforts to 
develop rockets capable of carrying the payload 
moshe shlonsky israel televisions military affairs reporter 
said iraq could only deliver chemical weapons on israel through 
atillery bombardment from batteries deployed along the 
israeljordanian border or from long distance air raids which 
involved midflight refuling 
the chance of this happening without being foiled by israel is 
not great he said 
however aharon levran a strategic analyst and former brigadier 
general believed saddam would not have made the threats to us 
chemical weapons against israel if he did not have the capability 
of delivering them

us troops in saudi arabia prepared 
for the searing heat and geargrinding sand of the middle east by 
taking part in mock combat on a 1000squaremile patch of the 
mojave desert near death valley 
summertime temperatures at the armys fort irwin national 
training center reach about 120 degrees about 10 degrees hotter 
than saudi arabia where president bush sent troops to defend the 
oil kingdom against iraq 
at the outset of the deployment gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff noted that troops of the departing 82nd 
airborne division learn desert warfare and chemical combat at the 
california base 
in fact every army brigade visits about once every 18 months 
and spends two weeks in war games since 1982 about 390000 army 
soldiers have battled the elements and each other 
visiting soldiers face the resident 177th armored brigade a 
2300member unit trained in soviet tactics including gas attacks 
said maj john wagstaffe a base spokesman 
you can die every day for 14 days at the national training 
center and thats a sobering thing for most soldiers wagstaffe 
said thursday 
what were hoping is that by dying 14 times out here well 
help prevent our soldiers from dying when they have to go into real 
combat 
fort irwin is on a high desert plain the nearest town is 
barstow 37 miles away the isolation allows a full range of 
military operations including artillery fire radio jamming and 
low flying of jets and helicopters 
president bush visited the center in february and interrupted a 
mock battle to address troops by radio 
military challenges to democracy persist in every hemisphere 
and america must always be prepared to fight for freedom and 
security he said 
from a hill bush watched bursts of artillery and streaking 
jets he saw the sovietstyle opposing force break through the army 
teams lines 
making mistakes is part of the training wagstaffe said one 
lieutenant had his squad prepare for a tank attack by digging a 
deep trench but forgot to close one end of the ditch allowing 
tanks to pour in 
the lieutenant who dug this hole i guarantee you will not 
make the same mistake in saudi arabia in panama or anywhere 
else said wagstaffe 
soviet desert warfare features a speedy swarming style based on 
surprise and a bedamned attitude about taking casualties he 
said ussoviet tensions have eased but iraq and 30 other 
nations train with soviet military tactics and use their equipment 
iraqi leader saddam hussein who boasts a battlehardened army 
of 1 million has used poison gas in his war with iran gas also 
was used against iraqs kurdish minority 
tear gas is substituted for mustard gas and nerve gas in the 
fort irwin war games which count kills with laser beams and 
sensors 
the enemy soldiers of the 177th use the gas freely 
wagstaffe said targeted soldiers scramble into protective 
clothing it takes 15 seconds to put on gas masks and hoods eight 
minutes to don hot cumbersome fullbody suits 
the war is makebelieve but sometimes the dying is real 
helicopter accidents badweather parachute jumps and vehicle 
accidents have killed at least 20 soldiers in recent years

although iraq was removed in 1982 from 
the us list of countries that support terrorism the baghdad 
government still uses force and intimidation against opponents at 
home and abroad experts say 
iraqi exiles say president saddam hussein uses an extensive 
network of informers especially among the iraqi student community 
abroad to finger opponents of his government and to plot their 
assassinations 
prof bernard reich specialist in middle east politics and 
terrorism at george washington university in washington said 
saddam is demonstrating that those not bending to his views will 
face terror and intimidation without question he has employed 
state terrorism and chemical warfare and has been willing to use it 
against his own people 
saddam has used poison gas against kurds seeking independence 
from the baghdad government 
within the arab world saddams goals are iraqi leadership and 
that he is prepared to use virtually all means to achieve that end 
from economic intimidation to the use of force and terror reich 
said in an interview 
the united states resumed relations with iraq in 1984 after a 
17year lapse citing in part iraqs improved record on terrorism 
the us state department said in its annual report on terrorism 
last april that iraq was still working toward improving its image 
and wasnt known to have sponsored any acts of terrorism in the 
past year 
but the latest us state department report on humanrights 
practices around the world said iraqs humanrights record 
remained abysmal in 1989 the intelligence services engage in 
extensive surveillance and utilize extralegal means including 
torture and summary execution to deal with antiregime activity 
the report said 
as recently as april the us state department expelled an 
iraqi diplomat at the united nations because of his suspected role 
in an alleged plot to murder two opponents of the baghdad 
government in california 
two years ago sudan accused an unidentified iraqi diplomat of 
assassinating an iraqi opposition leader who was killed by two 
gunmen as he sat in the lobby of the khartoum hilton hotel 
on terrorism the department said iraq has continued to provide 
safe haven to some palestinian groups including the iraqicreated 
arab liberation front and abul abbas palestine liberation front 
it cited press reports that abu ibrahim whom it described as 
the former leader of the now defunct 15 may terrorist organization 
had returned to iraq 
abu ibrahim is known for the skill with which he built highly 
sophisticated and lethal suitcase bombs the department said 
notorious terrorist mastermind abu nidal once lived in baghdad 
but he was kicked out more than a decade ago as saddam sought a 
more moderate image in the west 
abu nidal the nom de guerre of sabri albanna reportedly lives 
in libya where his movement is riven with an internal feud he was 
expelled from iraq in 1978 but reportedly returned for a while in 
late 1982 
nowadays iraq provides a haven to only a few such international 
terror groups most of which are thought to operate from libya or 
syria 
but reich said saddam might try to exploit any terrorist groups 
that remain headquartered in baghdad 
in the current middle east crisis the focus is on major 
military intimidation reich said but he said that if saddam 
should make a facesaving retreat he might revert to terrorist 
attacks on american and other western targets outside the middle 
east

an hour into the inauguration of a new 
colombian president with the ornate oratory just getting started 
the emergency call came from the white house to bogota with word 
for vice president dan quayle 
american troops and warplanes would be sent to saudi arabia to 
defend against possible invasion by iraq word of the decision was 
seeping out and the white house wanted quayle forewarned that what 
had been secret was becoming public 
the vice president couldnt take the call himself he was in a 
front row vip seat on the inaugural platform of cesar gaviria a 
spot too prominent to leave for a phone call 
i had a pretty good idea what it was about and i was right 
quayle said thursday as he flew home from a threeday latin 
american mission that had left him far from the arena as the 
administration dealt with the persian gulf crisis 
i knew that we were going in 
quayle wouldnt say when he knew ill leave it to others to 
get into a ticktock situation he said 
the vice president left washington for bogota on tuesday the 
sixth day of the crisis triggered by saddam husseins invasion of 
kuwait there had been crisis conferences with president bush every 
day since friday and the administration had planned its course 
there was no reason for me to cancel this trip quayle said 
by late afternoon tuesday bushs decision to send forces to 
saudi arabia began to leak prompting the call to alert quayle 
william kristol his chief of staff took it in a sitting room of 
the colombian presidential palace set aside for quayle and for 
us embassy use that day 
quayle got word of the message before the inauguration was over 
and details before he left bogota for lima peru aides said there 
was no thought of returning to washington and no need 
while bush delivered his televised address to the nation 
wednesday morning announcing what he called a defensive stand 
against an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors 
quayle was at a breakfast meeting with peruvian business and civic 
leaders 
he couldnt break away and the us ambassadors residence in 
lima doesnt have cable television anyhow kristol was the relay 
man again this time he slipped out of the breakfast meeting and 
went upstairs telephoned quayle aides at the sheraton lima hotel 
and had them hold the phone up against a television set so that he 
could take notes on the bush address 
it turned out to be unnecessary the white house had faxed a 
text of the speech to the vice president and it got there before 
the breakfast was over quayle said he had a good idea of what bush 
was going to say from their conversations on the crisis before he 
left washington 
in bogota quayle had talked with venezuelan president carlos 
andres perez about the crisis and had assurances that he would 
work to make up the oil shortfall stemming from the crisis about 
45 million barrels a day in iraqi and kuwaiti production perez 
was said to have told quayle that venezuelan production would be 
increased by 500000 barrels and that other opec oil nations also 
would boost production 
that message went the other way from quayles traveling party 
to the white house 
were in contact i wouldnt say on an hourly basis but every 
couple of hours quayle said 
but it was long distance very long distance 
while quayle was dealing with drug control efforts and latin 
american development and aid programs the middle east crisis came 
up constantly in his conferences with the presidents of colombia 
peru and bolivia and in his public statements 
once he was asked about the danger of iraqs poison bombs 
a reference to the threat of chemical weapons in the gulf conflict 
we are fully appraised of the military capability of iraq he 
said we will be able to defend ourselves and to work for the 
defense of saudi arabia 
quayle returned to washington thursday night after a fourhour 
stop in haiti in the cause of free elections there elections are 
scheduled on nov 4 quayle met with leaders of the provisional 
government the armed forces and an electoral commission to urge 
that they work to enable the haitian people to go to the polls to 
vote in free secure and credible elections 
elections in 1987 were aborted by violence in which at least 34 
people were killed 
haiti deserves democracy quayle told about 200 military men 
and government officials so my message is no coups no murders 
no threats 
and instead free and fair elections that will bring honor to 
the brave people of haiti

the environmental protection agency is 
ordering an 80 percent cut in diesel fuel sulfur content saying 
the move would help get rid of black smoke belched from truck 
tailpipes 
this control measure is an important step for cleaner air and 
protection from the harmful effects of pollution epa 
administrator william k reilly said thursday 
the regulation will boost the price of diesel fuel as much as 
23 cents per gallon he said it requires refiners to reduce 
sulfur content of the fuel used on the road from 025 percent by 
weight to 005 percent effective oct 1 1993 
small refiners have until 1995 to phase in the new standards as 
they install equipment to remove the sulfur reilly said during 
that period they will have to meet a set of interim standards 
the new regulation will help manufacturers of large diesel 
engines meet a 1985 requirement to curtail emissions of diesel 
particulates said jeff alson an engineer with the epas 
office of mobile sources in ann arbor mich 
the particulates tiny bits of soot hydrocarbons and other 
materials are inhaled and tend to remain in the human respiratory 
tract alson said they often are contaminated with poisonous fumes 
epa recently declared the diesel particulate a probable 
carcinogen it is believed to cause about 600 cases of cancer a 
year 
its nowhere near as big a carcinogen as cigarette smoking 
for example but we still want to minimize the damage alson said 
reilly said the new regulation on diesel sulfur and the 1985 
rule on particulates which will be fully effective next year will 
virtually eliminate the black smoke from diesel tailpipes 
cutting particulates by 90 percent reilly said

the cost of maintaining and overhauling the 
nations naval fleet exceeded original estimates by about 30 
percent with expenses rising to 37 billion over a threeyear 
period congressional investigators say 
the general accounting office the watchdog agency of congress 
found cost growth and schedule overruns at the eight public 
shipyards and 44 private shipyards across the united states between 
fiscal years 1985 and 1988 
public shipyards generally work on more sophisticated ships 
including submarines carriers and nuclearpowered surface ships 
private shipyards usually handle auxiliary and amphibious ships 
the gao blamed the problems at private shipyards on an inability 
to determine beforehand what repair work must be done unplanned 
work added after the government contract has been awarded and 
difficulty in obtaining materials 
in the study released the end of july the gao also found that 
the market for ship maintenance and modernization is highly 
competitive forcing contractors to submit low bids to obtain navy 
work 
similar problems also existed at public shipyards where the gao 
found that in some cases the companies did not have enough labor to 
do the work properly 
at the private shipyards the gao said that over a threeyear 
period contract costs increased from 28 billion to 37 billion 
with the final prices exceeding the contract award prices on 357 of 
402 projects

despite pressure from the united states iraq 
continues to deny permission for more than 3500 americans to leave 
iraq and kuwait the state department said 
deputy spokesman richard boucher confirmed thursday that a 
10yearold american girl penelope nabokov was allowed to leave 
the hotel rashid in baghdad and to enter the american embassy 
the girl had been flying unaccompanied from france to india when 
she was taken into custody by iraqi soldiers in kuwait during a 
stopover there at the time of the iraqi invasion last week 
but boucher said iraqi officials have refused exit visas to 
americans and other foreigners in the two countries the united 
states and several western allies have made joint appeals to the 
iraqi government to let citizens of their respective countries 
depart he said 
the administration has become increasingly concerned about 
americans in iraq and kuwait as military tensions between the 
united states and iraq have escalated 
there are about 3000 americans in kuwait boucher said thursday 
there were 580 americans in iraq 
us officials have focused their concern on 38 americans at the 
hotel rashid almost all were bused from kuwait by iraqi 
authorities last week and are confined to the hotel under armed 
guard the state department is refusing to call them hostages 
boucher said that 10 dependents and nonessential personnel from 
t he american embassy in baghdad departed the capital by road 
thursday and reached the iraqijordanian border 
they were turned back by iraqi officials at the border but 
subsequently the foreign ministry in baghdad informed us 
officials that they will be permitted to cross boucher said 
although boucher contended the borders in both kuwait and iraq 
were closed jordanian officials said thousands of foreigners 
mainly arabs had fled kuwait in recent days they entered saudi 
arabia and then crossed the border into jordan 60 miles southeast 
of amman 
the officials insisting on anonymity said most of the arabs 
arriving from kuwait were egyptian workers after crossing into 
jordan they traveled to the red sea port of aqaba to await 
transportation to egypt by sea the officials said

journalists are protesting to the pentagon 
that us troops have arrived in saudi arabia but no reporters 
have been given access to cover the story 
the kingdom of saudi arabia controls its borders and decides 
who enters that country and thats not for us to tell the saudis 
who comes in pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters at 
a briefing thursday 
williams said he was sensitive to such requests and said he 
was attempting to get reporters on the us navy ships that have 
been deployed to the region 
several reporters responded that they would prefer to be in 
saudi arabia with us troops given that placement on a ship would 
prevent them from covering any ground conflict should such an 
event occur 
i think you all know that we want very much for this to work 
obviously as we continue to commit forces to saudi arabia thats 
something we have to be mindful of williams said 
its a very sensitive subject let me just say that well 
try to get you out on the ships as soon as possible to continue to 
work the rest of it 
burl osborne president of the american society of newspaper 
editors and the president and editor of the dallas morning news 
has written williams to protest the situation 
we now have a situation in which an increasing number of 
american troops are deployed in dangerous areas in the middle east 
and the american press is not being given access to the us 
military forces osborne said 
we urge that somehow either with the use of press pools or 
by other means you take immediate action to insure that the 
american press has access to the air ground and naval forces in 
the middle east 
on wednesday defense secretary dick cheney was queried about 
the same subject he said the saudis had established the ground 
rules under which people have access to cover activities inside the 
kingdom 
cheney said the pentagon would work on the problem he didnt 
make any promises and wasnt specific 
in the invasion of panama last december the us forces took 
along a small group of reporters selected in advance by their 
employers and pledged to keep their movement secret to protect the 
security of the military operation 
this pool arrangement was set up after the us invasion of 
grenada when journalists were kept away from the caribbean island 
entirely 
although there have been several tests of the pentagon media 
pool it didnt work in panama instead of being taken to the front 
lines of battle as promised the reporters were kept bottled up 
away from the action

and federal agents claimed to have destroyed more than 1400 
marijuana plants in a 12day sweep that drew protests and a lawsuit 
from residents and civil libertarians 
the operation which ended thursday was the first time that 
activeduty soldiers have been used to fight marijuana growing in 
the united states 
about 50 agents from the bureau of land management and the drug 
enforcement agency and an estimated 150 guardsmen and soldiers from 
fort ord took part in operation green sweep a raid on pot fields 
in the king range national conservation area there were no arrests 
the rugged 60000acre area and its environs along californias 
northwestern coast was settled in the early 1970s by hundreds of 
hippies and homesteaders marijuana was widely planted on both 
public and private land 
on thursday six residents and several groups including the 
civil liberties monitoring project filed a lawsuit in federal 
court seeking to bar the use of soldiers to enforce drug laws the 
lawsuit also seeks 100 million in damages 
the lawsuit alleges the troops engaged in illegal searches 
roadblocks interrogations and detentions the soldiers used 
excessive force to terrorize intimidate and otherwise distress 
residents the lawsuit said 
roger bruckner blm agent in charge called the operation a 
fantastic success he said 1408 marijuana plants with a 
potential street value of 42 million had been confiscated from 28 
marijuanagrowing sites and destroyed 
the blm said 12 tons of growing equipment including pipes and 
water storage tanks was seized 
whats important is that weve made the point that marijuana 
growing will not be tolerated on blm land bruckner said 
wouldbe growers will not only lose their crop and their labor 
but theyll also lose their investment in irrigation systems and 
other agriculturl equipment 
the operation cost about 100000 above normal expenses such as 
salaries said art lunklay blm state drug coordinator 
soon after the raid started 11 demonstrators were arrested on 
minor charges involving violation of government closure of some 
areas but bruckner said such protests never attracted more than a 
small percentage of the areas residents 
some residents called to voice their support bruckner said 
i particularly want to thank the person who mailed us a 
detailed and as it turned out surprisingly accurate map of one 
area he said

iraqs chemical weapons might slow us troops 
down in the middle east but are unlikely to claim many american 
lives arms experts say 
brad roberts a chemicalarms specialist at the center for 
strategic and international studies in washington said iraqs 
chemical weapons could not stop a us naval blockade or defeat an 
american defense of saudi arabias oil fields 
if ground warfare broke out between iraq and the united states 
iraqs president saddam hussein could use chemical weapons to 
attack us forces and to deny them access to certain terrain 
roberts said 
but to do it over an extended period of time he would need a 
lot of chemical agent and it would have to be packaged in 
artillery shells bombs or missiles and he would need the ability 
to move the weapons into place quickly 
those three things are difficult and its not clear he can do 
them roberts said 
iraqs use of chemical weapons against iran led to ghastly 
pictures of victims covered with severe blisters but most of those 
victims recovered iran has reported 
as of april 1987 for example iran had reported 27000 victims 
but only 262 deaths said seth carus a fellow at the naval war 
college foundation in newport ri iraq has also used chemical 
weapons against the kurds an ethnic minority in iraq 
john deutch provost of the massachusetts institute of 
technology and a member of the defense science board said its 
likely the united states would dramatically escalate the conflict 
if hussein used chemical weapons against us troops 
i fear to speculate what the response would be by the us or 
its allies he said 
the threat of chemical weapons could reduce the effectiveness of 
us troops forced to wear protective suits and gas masks in the 
fierce desert heat the authorities said but most said that 
wouldnt give iraq a very important tactical advantage 
there is a popular misconception that you have to wear the 
protection buttoned up all the time and thats simply not true 
said matthew meselson of harvard university who has been a 
government consultant on chemical weapons when the detectors 
show there arent chemicals around you dont zip up 
meselson said protective gear would make it seem 10 degrees 
hotter than it really was if the temperature is 100 degrees and 
the humidity 50 percent a soldier probably shouldnt carry a 
90pound pack for more than 40 minutes he said if he has to pull 
on a suit over his uniform that might be cut to 20 minutes 
it would be an annoyance but nothing to compare with the 
incoming high explosives meselson said 
deutch disagreed he argued that chemical weapons pose an 
important military threat although not a major threat to american 
lives 
even a few badly aimed chemical weapons would cause every 
ship every military unit to conduct themselves in a more prudent 
way and reduce their effectiveness he said 
iraq has known stockpiles of at least 1400 tons of mustard gas 
and perhaps 200 pounds of the nerve gas tabun since it ended its 
war with iran in 1988 said carus actual stockpiles could be 
several thousand tons 
under ideal conditions it takes 4 tons of airborne mustard gas 
or 2 tons of airborne tabun to kill 50 percent of unprotected 
people spread over about a third of a square mile carus said 
if the people are wearing protection the death rates are far 
lower he said and much more gas is needed in the hot dry 
conditions of the middle east where gas evaporates much more 
quickly carus said 
mustard gas and tabun work in entirely different ways said 
gordon burck formerly director of studies on chemical and 
biological warfare at the federation of american scientists in 
washington 
mustard gas is an odorless alcohol compound to which sulfur and 
chlorine have been added impurities in the first versions used in 
world war i gave it the faint smell of mustard it causes severe 
blistering but is rarely fatal 
tabun interferes with nervetonerve communication you cant 
see your stomach throws up you go into convulsions said burck 
but american soldiers carry injectors they can stab into their 
thighs to give themselves a dose of atropine a chemical that 
counteracts the nerve gas it doesnt leave you in top fighting 
form but it doesnt leave you dead burck said

foreigners living in the oilrich persian gulf region are sending 
their families away but sitting tight themselves through the middle

arabian oil co complex with 38000 employees of the between up 
to 28000 americans living in saudi arabia the eastern province is 
home to about 20000

coming soon to a theater near you 
iraqnophobia 
the gathering military storm in the middle east could bring a 
downpour of films inspired by the crisis it may also boost the 
fortunes of films now in release or production 
the cowriter of team 6 has been dispatched to israel from 
los angeles to update the script with references to the persian 
gulf crisis 
navy seals a new movie about navy commandos in combat in 
the middle east will be promoted with an advertising campaign this 
weekend that will try to link the action title to last weeks 
invasion 
other companies including walt disney co with the 
ultimatum have films in development whose focus on middle 
eastern terrorists will have sudden relevance 
the movies are entertainment you go there fantasizing what 
we wish we could do in iraq said actor chuck norris whose 1986 
film delta force was about a plane hijacked by middle eastern 
terrorists 
norris said the sequel delta force iii starring his son 
mike is also set in the middle east and is closely related to 
whats happening now norris and several film producers said they 
expected an increase in the number of movies related to the area 
team 6 which will begin filming for 21st century film corp 
on sept 24 was first a story about navy seals attacking a missile 
installation in a generic middle eastern country after iraq moved 
into kuwait the story was changed the navy unit will now invade 
iraq to disable chemicalweapon missiles aimed at us ships in the 
gulf 
history is writing the script for us said menahem golan 
chairman of 21st century he said he hopes to have the film in 
theaters by early 1991 i only hope im first

more accessible the drama is connected with real life and people 
usually identify better with those situations golan said the 
cast he said includes rob lowe 
navy seals which is playing to modest business in the 
nations theaters could improve its fortunes at the box office 
this weekend because the middle east is so much in the news the 
films producer said

got it so right producer brenda feigen said i can assure you 
that the navy seals are in the middle east right now although the

pictures an american city will be destroyed by a nuclear bomb 
planted by middle eastern terrorists if the american government 
does not order all jews out of jerusalem 
the script languished for three years until the middle east 
became a focus of world tensions this year 
hollywood has a history of predicting history weeks before the 
release of 1979s the china syndrome a movie about a nuclear 
meltdown a reactor at three mile island near harrisburg pa came 
close to doing the same thing 
in a memorable piece of dialogue a nuclear expert in china

scattered demonstrations in support of the deposed kuwaiti emir and 
against iraqi president saddam hussein the travelers said thursday 
in addition iraqis in kuwait have staged demonstrations in 
support of saddam an unspecified number of women with iraqi 
accents shouted prosaddam slogans one traveler said 
for the most part however an eerie silence prevails 
punctuated only by the sound of gunshots iraqi soldiers squat and 
sleep on the pavements of the neardeserted streets they said on 
condition of anonymity 
kuwaiti businessman mohsen alajmi 28 said he participated in 
garbage clearing and maintenance operations to help out housewives 
whose husbands were stranded outside kuwait when iraq invaded the 
country on aug 2 
alajmi said that at one point he and others participating in 
the operations were stopped for questioning by iraqi soldiers 
they did not search us in fact they apologized and cursed 
saddam one of them said why are we here we have been hurting 
kuwaitis and drinking warm water in this heat while saddam sits in 
his airconditioned palace alajmi said 
he said that as he was being questioned by the iraqis two 
egyptian workers passed by the soldiers called to the men asked 
them to produce identity cards then said egyptians you dont 
deserve to live 
they beat the two egyptians so savagely that we implored them 
to stop said alajmi they let the egyptians go they were 
hurt quite badly

crew member pleaded with the soldier to show the woman mercy 
the soldier took his gun and said one move and i blow you 
up the other soldiers laughed alsane said

doors to ask for cold water and sometimes food mainly beef and 
fruit but others said iraqi soldiers forced kuwaitis to provide 
them with water and fruit 
in the sweltering summer heat profusely sweating iraqis 
soldiers look tired and i would say ashamed of themselves said 
26yearold kuwaiti youssef alrashidi 
a number of iraqi soldiers came to us and tried to calm us 
down saying we will do you no harm we have nothing against 
you we only carry out orders alrashidi said at the 
diplomat hotel in bahrain 
but alrashidis four companions had different stories to tell 
i saw iraqi soldiers heap in lorries sacks of money and bits 
of furniture stolen from the gulf bank one of the four said on 
condition of anonymity he said his brother watched soldiers loot 
two car showrooms in kuwait

in the middle east 
toshiyuki nishiguchi a stock analyst with daiwa securities

slump as a whole investors are taking a waitandsee position 
while watching the middle east situation 
the nikkei index the markets main barometer lost 4348 points 
between july 20 and thursdays close because of increasing interest 
rates in japan and the persian gulf crisis which began aug 2 when 
iraq invaded kuwait 
in currency dealings the lack of significant news from the 
middle east also was why the dollar traded in a relatively narrow 
range exchange dealers said 
its very quiet said kozo yoshida a dealer with mitsui 
taiyo kobe bank at this time it is difficult to determine the 
dollars direction unless there will be new developments in the 
middle east 
other dealers said many market players friday were waiting for 
results of the emergency arab summit in cairo called in hopes of 
resolving the gulf crisis 
the meeting originally scheduled for thursday was postponed to 
friday because some arab leaders had not arrived in time

get past an army checkpoint were among americans who fled kuwait 
and came home to tell of their frightening journeys 
meanwhile president bushs decision to sent us troops to the 
middle east was greeted with support and protests around the 
country thursday 
several arabamerican groups denounced the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait but said they did not support the american military presence 
in saudi arabia 
in san francisco a noisy antiwar protest in front of chevron 
corp headquarters drew more than 50 people marchers held signs 
with such messages as us out of the gulf and no vietnam in 
the mideast 
in atlanta 10 members of the quakers american friends service 
committee held a vigil to protest us intervention 
usbased companies including texaco and the boeing co on 
thursday arranged to evacuate some employees and dependents from 
saudi arabia 
theres no order back in kuwait nobody goes to work theres 
no police no services we dont intend to go back there said 
kimberly elzahr 29 she her husband camille 33 and two young 
children were with her parents in portland ore after escaping 
kuwait 
on aug 2 when mrs elzahr heard iraqi warplanes overhead the 
family stocked up on food and got what cash they could from the 
bank 
we lived right behind the crown princes palace like the vice 
presidents palace and they started taking over that palace she 
said it was a terrific bombingshelling artillery rounds and 
everything was going off 
we ended up on the floor in the kitchen and we just huddled on 
the floor until we could get through that 
the family spent three days at a friends house then left in a 
threecar caravan for the saudi border 
nobody stopped us elzahr said nobody looked at us i 
guess we were lucky there were soldiers and big machine guns and 
we were scared 
texan benny whitaker and his wife joined a convoy of his 
coworkers who left the hamad al hamad oil company for saudi arabia 
on aug 3 one day after the invasion 
the group was stopped twice by iraqi soldiers during the 
75minute drive the second time i just acted like i didnt hear 
him and kept going said whitaker who returned sunday to abilene 
steve betts 35 of houston who formerly coached kuwaits 
national swimming squad said his car stalled at a checkpoint 
during his 85mile drive to the saudi border an iraqi soldier 
allowed him to pass after being offered a soft drink 
i had about six to eight diet pepsis with me and i handed 
them to him betts said in an interview from washington he had 
fever blisters on his mouth and the diet pepsi well that rang 
his bell 
the estimated 3400 americans still in kuwait and iraq left many 
loved ones in this country ignorant of their whereabouts and 
condition thirtyeight americans were still being held in a hotel 
in baghdad iraq but were reported to be in good condition 
bush received high marks in the latest pulse of america 
survey conducted in lubbock county texas the presidents adopted 
sounding board for america 
sixtyfour percent of 400 people surveyed aug 68 said they 
would support bush if he opted to use military force to push iraq 
out of kuwait twentyone percent did not support military use the 
survey sent to bush on thursday was conducted by southwest 
research associates and has a margin of error of 4 percentage 
points 
arabamerican groups were divided in their reaction to us 
military action 
the southern california americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee opposed both iraqs annexation and us military 
involvement the best way is to leave it to the arab states 
said regional director nacih bayda 
our confidence is behind president bush and the government of 
the united states of america the detroitbased chaldean 
federation of america said in a statement chaldeans are christian 
arabs mostly from iraq 
mt mehdi president of the americanarab relations committee 
and the national council on islamic affairs held a news conference 
in new york city with about 30 other arab leaders he said about 60 
percent were antisaddam about 40 percent pro but they 
unanimously opposed the us military deployment 
we feel it will increase arab and muslim hostility to the us 
and only increase saddam husseins prestige in the arab world 
mehdi said but he said most arabamerican leaders in the area 
favor economic sanctions

the leading proplo activist in the 
israelioccupied lands has said palestinians are angry about us 
military action in the persian gulf and accuses washington of using 
a double standard with the arabs 
why ask only iraq to withdraw from kuwait why not ask israel 
to withdraw from the west bank the baghdadborn faisal husseini 
said thursday israel has occupied the west bank and the gaza strip 
since the 1967 middle east war 
husseinis comments underscored sympathy for iraqi president 
saddam hussein among the 17 million palestinians in the occupied 
lands saddam whose army invaded kuwait aug 2 has also received 
the backing of palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat 
only a few palestinians expressed fears of being hurt themselves 
if iraq made good on threats to attack israel with chemical weapons 
most palestinians hail saddam as a hero for flexing his muscles 
against the worlds superpowers at a time they are fighting a 
seemingly hopeless battle against israeli rule 
in the 32month uprising 727 palestinians were killed by 
israeli soldiers and civilians and another 246 were slain as 
suspected collaborators by fellow arabs fortyseven israelis have 
also been slain 
israelis are behaving like thugs in this area and so now 
saddam is telling them you are not the only ones who can control 
things said ahmad abu salom 39 a palestinian actor in 
jerusalem 
a local palestinian faction sympathetic to syria called the 
popular struggle front and headed by jerusalemite samir ghoshi 
published a leaflet thursday comparing saddams actions to their 
protests against israel 
the arab masses and the children of the stones are now hoping 
to see victory through you said the leaflet we express full 
support and solidarity with iraq in its revolutionary steps 
husseini 50 said palestinian support for iraq was largely a 
sign of frustration 
the united states has failed to exert effective pressure to 
prevent israels heavyhanded policies against palestinians but 
came swiftly to the defense of oilrich kuwait he said 
okay the united states sends forces to force iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait very good you are the police in the area so why not 
do the same thing with israel said husseini 
so what you are seeing is a reaction of anger at the united 
states he said 
it is not that the palestinians support the regime in iraq or 
believe in saddam husseins ideology but because they believe 
there is a double standard in the area husseini said 
husseini spent a year of the uprising in jail without trial on 
allegations of proplo activism since his release in 1989 he has 
emerged as a popular leader 
his father abdel kader husseini was a palestinian war hero 
killed leading fighters against the emerging state of israel in 
april 1948 
husseini said the plo believes the persian gulf crisis must be 
solved without letting foreign forces interfere we are strongly 
against outside interference because it will complicate the 
situation 
an opinion poll of israeli arab citizens in northern galilee 
also indicated strong support for iraq 
the poll in which 208 people were questioned by telephone 
showed 62 percent supported iraqs invasion of kuwait and 69 
percent considered saddam a national hero fifteen percent felt he 
was mad and irrational no margin of error was given for the poll 
proiraqi and antiamerican sentiments were also prominent in 
editorials run by palestinianowned newspapers published in arab 
east jerusalem 
it would be better for the saudis to seek the opinions of the 
sages before seeking help from enemies wrote the projordanian 
an nahar daily 
the language of escalation by the united states means dragging 
the entire region into a brutal war wrote the proplo alquds 
newspaper

seafoodrich galveston bay opened today to 
shrimpers for the first time in eight days but officials warned 
against fishing in waters stained with residue from a 
700000gallon oil spill 
the coast guard said it hoped to fully open the houston ship 
channel which courses through the bay to all traffic today for 
the first time since a tanker collided with two barges on july 28 
a sunken barge is obstructing the waterway 
texas health commissioner robert bernstein said bay shrimping 
could resume today but he cautioned shrimpers and consumers to 
beware of fish with visible oil or fish caught in oily water 
bernstein shut down the bay to all fishing on aug 2 because of 
a 17mile slick two days later he reopened the bay to fin fishing 
and allowed seafood harvesting in some areas 
shrimpers said the ban cost them thousands of dollars a day a 
ban also was lifted today on the taking of crabs and oysters 
this is clearly good news for the men and women who rely on 
the bay for their livelihoods gov bill clements said 
the spill occurred when a greek tanker collided with two barges 
under tow one barge sank and the other ruptured spilling heavy 
oil that threatened sensitive marshes birds and other wildlife 
coast guard spokesman rick mccullor said salvage crews were 
expected to end the cleanup today and reopen the channel to all 
traffic crews used cutting torches to take apart the sunken barge 
and removed half on thursday leaving the other half for today 
divers had pugt a sling around one end of the barge last week 
and crews moved the vessel into shallow water beside the shipping 
channel where it limited traffic to oneway tugassisted ships 
and twoway slowmoving barges 
the coast guard said that the cleanup has cost more than 1 
million and that the total might be about 3 million 
almost all the visible oil has been recovered mccullor said

scientists may have accomplished far more than 
they thought when they found the gene for elephant mans disease 
the gene it turns out appears to be a switch that can turn on 
cancer researchers reported today 
the payoff here is going to be that we may come up with a 
treatment for brain tumors said dr allan rubenstein medical 
director of the national neurofibromatosis foundation in new york 
neurofibromatosis is elephant mans disease 
the surprising discovery could bring about an explosion of 
research toward a treatment for neurofibromatosis a disfiguring 
disease that a couple of years ago was an obscure phenomenon 
which practically the whole scientific world ignored rubenstein 
said 
that research also holds promise for many people with cancer 
though scientists cautioned that treatments may be years away 
its the kind of understanding we hoped discovery of the gene 
would lead to said the author of the new finding raymond l 
white of the university of utah i expect it to make a 
fundamental contribution to our understanding of cancer genetics 
whites findings appeared today in the scientific journal cell 
the report concludes that the neurofibromatosis gene is one of 
the family of gap genes that may operate as anticancer genes 
that is when the genes are normal they keep cancer growth 
switched off when they are defective they allow cancer tumors to 
grow these socalled tumorsuppressor genes have been found to be 
among the causes of lung cancer breast cancer and colon cancer 
white said his findings suggest that neurofibromatosis tumors 
which are not cancerous may be an intermediate stage between 
normal tissue and cancer 
similar discoveries have been made in colon cancer where white 
and other researchers have shown that benign polyps have some but 
not all of the genetic changes required to form colon cancer 
neurofibromatosis afflicts 100000 americans symptoms can 
include learning disabilities and crippling noncancerous tumors 
all over their bodies until now researchers have had no clue to 
its cause 
a month ago white and francis collins of the university of 
michigan reported that they had independently discovered the 
neurofibromatosis gene 
that opened the door to further studies to determine precisely 
what goes wrong in neurofibromatosis and how it might be fixed the 
latest findings are an important step in that direction 
researchers said 
the potential to start to design therapies is now a couple of 
years closer than it could have been otherwise collins said 
i dont want to raise false hopes but the implication is it 
might be possible to treat some forms of nf said michael wigler 
of the cold spring harbor laboratory in new york 
the gap genes are known to switch off certain cancer genes 
called ras genes which have long been known to contribute to the 
formation of cancer tumors said wigler 
white said he made his discovery by determing the dna sequence 
or genetic code of part of the neurofibromatosis gene he then 
compared it to known sequences stored in a computer and the gap 
genes popped out as clearly as could be 
it is not yet proven that the neurofibromatosis gene acts like a 
gap gene but researchers believe it does because its sequence is 
so closely related to the gap genes white said

a study of violence in atlanta found that one in 
four assaults takes place in a family or intimate relationship 
with most of the assailants men and most of the victims women 
the findings reported thursday by the national centers for 
disease control were based on 1984 police reports the latest 
available at the time the survey was begun 
police reported 27 fatal family or intimate assaults for the 
year and 3295 nonfatal ones said dr linda saltzman a 
behavioral scientist with the cdc 
incident reports were taken from a broad range of police 
categories including assault robbery rape and disorderly 
conduct overall 14 percent of reports in those categories were in 
families or intimate relationships and about 25 percent of the 
assaults were in such situations saltzman said 
analysis of 177 assaults found that 52 percent of the fatality 
victims and 73 percent of the nonfatality victims were women 74 
percent of the fatal assaults and 80 percent of the nonfatal ones 
were committed by men 
twenty percent or more of the atlanta incidents studied involved 
broken relationships and between 26 percent and 37 percent of the 
parties involved had been reported to the police in similar 
assaults before the cdc said 
violence between persons who are related share a household or 
are otherwise intimate with each other is a widespread public 
health problem the cdc concluded in particular intimate 
violence is a leading cause of injuries to women 
the cdc noted a 1986 survey concluding that battering was 
responsible for more injuries to women than car crashes rape and 
mugging combined

a college student with leukemia whose search for 
a compatible bonemarrow donor drew celebrity support and 50000 
volunteers underwent a lastditch transplant using her mothers 
marrow 
allison atlas 20 opted for the surgery thursday although her 
mothers tissue is not a perfect match she said she wanted to try 
the lifesaving procedure while she was still relatively strong 
her condition today at fred hutchinson cancer research center 
was withheld at the familys request said hospital spokeswoman 
alice burgess the transplant team was headed dr edward agura 
the marrow from her 54yearold mother arline atlas matched 
only four of six antigens or cell identifiers from her daughters 
marrow the operation could work if miss atlas body does not 
reject her mothers tissue 
theyre both fighters said sy atlas a cousin theyre 
both people who are determined to beat the odds arline was excited 
to be the donor for her daughter 
miss atlas a student at new york university when she became ill 
last year heightened awareness of the need for bonemarrow donors 
with a publicity campaign that drew 50000 volunteers in the united 
states and israel 
supporters raised 3 million including a sixfigure check from 
actor dustin hoffman to process the 50000 blood tests no match 
was found for miss atlas but 10 other leukemia patients were 
matched with donors 
bone marrow provides necessary components of the human immune 
system and transplant patients are at high risk of infection for 
three weeks after the operation until the new marrow begins to work 
miss atlas of bethesda md will recuperate in a sterile 
environment at the cancer center where more than 3000 bonemarrow 
transplants have been performed more than any other clinic 
anatoly grishchenko a leukemiastricken soviet helicopter pilot 
who flew firefighting missions over the damaged chernobyl nuclear 
reactor underwent a bone marrow transplant at the center earlier 
this year 
he died july 3 of complications of a lung infection that took 
hold during the period when he had no natural defenses 
in leukemia a form of blood cancer white blood cells multiply 
out of control since bone marrow produces blood doctors can 
combat leukemia by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy 
tissue 
before the operation miss atlas reassured her mother with humor 
and encouraged family members 
she was really cool sy atlas said in a tv interview from 
washington dc last night talking with her mom she jokingly 
said mom your marrow better be good for me tomorrow 
shes really positive with that kind of attitude were 
confident shes going to do well

there had no news about major new developments in the middle east 
today but the situation there is hazy resulting in a negative 
psychological impact on investors

price gaps between the spot and futures markets he said 
among losers were chemical drug shipbuilding and trading 
company issues 
the nikkei index has lost a total of 463419 points since july 
20 because of rising interest rates in japan and the persian gulf

an antidrug program born of the aids crisis 
recorded success rates ranging from 47 percent in miami to 16 
percent in chicago in getting intravenous drug users to kick the 
habit officials say 
the program begun in 1987 in 41 communities by the national 
institute on drug abuse was aimed at studying and changing the 
behavior of intravenous drug users and their sex partners 
more than 30000 people who were not then in drug abuse programs 
enrolled and followup interviews in five cities found from 16 
percent to 47 percent stopped all use of iv drugs the centers for 
disease control said thursday 
if the results at other sites prove to be consistent it 
would provide strong evidence of the considerable impact this 
approach could have the agency said 
aids is transmitted chiefly through sexual contact contaminated 
blood and sharing of contaminated needles 
more than 38000 of the 139000 aids cases reported in this 
country have occurred in iv drug users an additional 3000 
involved sex with iv drug users and 1400 were children born to iv 
drug users or their sexual partners 
the national institute on drug abuse project contacted iv drug 
abusers through community workers many of whom were former 
addicts drug users were paid for participating in the program 
results were reported from chicago houston miami philadelphia 
and san francisco between 45 percent and 78 percent of the 
participants came back for the followup interviews 
success rates in getting addicts off drugs included 17 percent 
in san francisco 26 percent in philadelphia and 32 percent in 
houston 
in chicago the percentage of participants not sharing needles 
with friends rose from 18 percent to 47 percent in houston it 
went from 47 percent to 88 percent six months later

an aidsstricken couple who say they 
smoked marijuana to relieve painful sideeffects from their aids 
treatments were found guilty by a judge who rejected their medical 
necessity defense 
but justice was tempered with mercy as circuit judge clinton 
foster on thursday sentenced kenneth and barbara jenks to a years 
probation and 500 hours of community service to be completed by 
caring for each other 
the events of this case are horrifying and evoke sympathy and 
compassion for the defendants by all persons acquainted with the 
facts foster said after a nonjury trial there is no cure for 
this disease 
the husband and wife were convicted of cultivating and 
possessing marijuana 
jenks 28 is a hemophiliac who contracted aids through a 
tainted blood transfusion he passed the disease to his 24yearold 
wife before he was aware he was infected 
ive never had that sweet a sentence in my 20 years of 
practicing law said attorney john daniel who represented the 
couple for free nevertheless he filed notice of appeal an effort 
he hopes will reverse fosters rejection of the medical necessity 
defense 
the couple said they smoked marijuana especially to relieve 
intense nausea and vomiting caused by the antiaids drug azt 
when i started taking azt i lost all reason to eat jenks 
has said he and his wife declined to say whether they will 
continue smoking marijuana 
foster noted the medical necessity defense has been approved by 
some courts around the nation including a judge in fort lauderdale 
who authorized it for another disease 
but he concluded it should not be recognized across the board 
unless the state legislature gives statutory authorization 
addressing the scope and parameters of that defense 
the jenkses have applied to take part in a federal program 
allowing the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes they said 
neither they nor their doctor knew about the program before they 
were arrested march 29 
marijuana has been used to treat the nausea that accompanies 
cancer chemotherapy as well as to treat glaucoma and multiple 
sclerosis

the army wont enter the armed standoff between 
the mohawk indians and quebec police unless a federally appointed 
mediator asks them to intervene an army commander said 
also thursday the mohawks warned that any military presence at 
barricades they have erected between themselves and provincial 
police might jeopardize a settlement of the conflict 
the standoff began a month ago when the mohawks occupied what 
they claimed to be sacred land that was earmarked for a golf course 
expansion 
a buildup of military force at the kahnawake reserve will be 
regarded by the mohawk people as something akin to gunboat 
diplomacy said owen young legal advisor to the mohawks 
the armys role in the conflict will depend on the efforts of 
mediator alan b gold chief justice of the quebec superior court 
to bring both sides to the mediating table said armed forces 
spokesman lt gen kent foster thursday 
if chief justice gold finds in his discussions that there is a 
role for us to play we would do our best to react to that 
foster said clearly we are going to continue to get ready to put 
our forces in place and so on for that eventuality 
he said the earliest the soldiers could be ready to move is 
saturday

and the government of president samuel doe 
a doe spokesman accused us marines of shooting at the leader 
thursday but the state department in washington denied it 
a close advisor to the president was hospitalized with chest and 
neck wounds after the attack in which the marines allegedly shot at 
doe from a helicopter said selly thompson a spokesman for doe he 
spoke in an interview with the british broadcasting corp 
in rome a un agency said it would send 16 million in 
emergency food aid to help feed about 400000 people uprooted by 
liberias war the food will be shipped to liberia and the 
neighboring ivory coast guinea and sierra leone where tens of 
thousands of liberians have taken refuge 
the shipment includes more than 21000 tons of rice 1200 tons 
of oil and 1700 tons of canned meat and fish the romebased world 
food program said 
west african peacekeeping troops massed across liberias 
northern border in guinea and to the east on the sierra leone 
border according to military sources in ghana and sierra leone 
there were reports 500 troops might be airlifted into monrovia 
rebels battled does troops within a mile of his executive 
mansion thursday in a bid to take monrovia before a fivenation 
african task force dominated by nigerian soldiers arrives to 
impose a ceasefire in the warravaged nation 
at least 5000 people have died in the war which began in 
december when rebels invaded from the ivory coast seeking to depose 
doe whom they accuse of corruption and mismanagement 
the war has become a tribal conflict pitting people loyal to 
the rebels against those loyal to does government 
on wednesday night rebels loyal to former bureaucrat charles 
taylor pushed into eastern congo town an eastern suburb of 
monrovia where they ransacked the nigerian embassy and attacked 
the guinea embassy 
they forced thousands of people seeking refuge at the nigerian 
embassy mostly nigerians into streets where battles raged it 
was not clear whether anyone was injured said a relief worker in 
congo town 
nigerian foreign minister rilwanu lukman said in lagos that his 
government told taylor that we will hold him personally 
responsible for any harm done to nigerians inside the embassy at 
the time of the attack 
in bonn a foreign ministry spokesman said 300 people from the 
nigerian embassy sought refuge at the west german mission he said 
that swelled the total at the mission to 500 refugees including 
americans belgians french dutch irish liberians and filipinos 
it was not clear what happened at the guinea embassy which gave 
sanctuary to 5000 people from the mandingo tribe seeking safety 
from the rebels who have killed thousands accusing them of backing 
does regime 
guinea radio called the attack on its embassy a provocation 
and said three guards were taken hostage by rebels in abidjan 
sources were quoted as saying one woman was killed in the attack on 
the guinean embassy 
doe spokesman thompson said former justice minister isaac nyaplu 
was wounded in the assassination attempt against doe and appealed 
for the international community to pressure the united states to 
excessive harassment to remove doe 
but state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said the 
235 marines airlifted into monrovia sunday to evacuate americans 
were there to protect the embassy and americans and not to 
intervene in the fighting or take sides 
boucher said the united states has evacuated 150 people from 
liberia this week including the french and italian ambassadors 
the west africans moving into liberia say they will enforce a 
ceasefire to allow formation of an interim government charged with 
organizing free and fair elections within a year 
doe and johnson have welcomed the west african initiative but 
taylor is opposed he fears nigerian participation because nigerian 
president gen ibrahim babangida has been an ally of doe

students of thomas jefferson college got 
credit for some unusual activities carving indian flutes 
painting portraits of comicbook characters and observing the 
antics of roving bands of mongrel dogs 
about 250 graduates former faculty and administrators will 
gather this weekend for a weekend reunion marking the closure of 
the college 10 years ago 
i felt that we were on the cutting edge of something really 
exciting said t dan gilmore who guided the college through 
twothirds of its 12 years in existence there was almost a 
feeling of a newage mentality 
the college a subdivision of grand valley state university in 
allendale had as many as 600 students in the mid1970s it allowed 
students to design their own classes and experiment with learning 
the college was born out of the freewheeling 1960s when 
alternative higher education programs sprouted nationwide 
the experimental approach drew criticism from some who thought 
credit was given too easily for such pursuits like wilderness 
backpacking 
many graduates said some of their best years were spent at 
there and defended the learning experience there 
tjc taught me how to learn how to adapt to a changing 
world said mark miller who spent part of his academic career 
following the movements of a roving band of mongrel dogs on the 
innercity streets of grand rapids 
miller said he later put his knowledge of urban animal behavior 
to good use as director of an animal shelter 
susan haskins who traipsed the shores of lake michigan in 
search of new rock forms now works for the federal government as a 
geologist 
the college gave me the freedom to chart my own course she 
said it encouraged my independence tjc did fine by me 
dan anderson a grand valley physics professor said teaching at 
the college was the mountaintop of my career 
the schools alumni include doctors dancers mental health 
workers teachers and business owners 
jeff brown who received credits for helping transform a shoe 
store into a theater now owns a nut shop in kalamazoo 
tjc was almost like a schoolwide encounter group he said 
it was magic

journalists allowed into parts of adolf 
hitlers underground concrete bunker have seen a halfdozen dark 
rooms that some day may be turned into an exhibition 
in a tour thursday journalists saw rooms at the edge of the 
oncebustling potsdamer platz in east berlin that historians 
believe were dining facilities for the nazi dictators bodyguards 
there were doors marked toilet and shower a rusting 
steel door led to the reichsrundfunk or government radio 
station which hitler used to broadcast propaganda messages to the 
german people during world war ii 
the only objects left in the rooms which lie under a small hill 
visible to the passersby were a blownup safe and what appeared a 
water tank there were pools of water on the floor 
other parts of the bunker were opened up earlier the soviets 
blew up still other parts at the end of the war 
the underground bunker is off limits to the public and east 
berlin officials are faced with the issue of what to do with the 
labyrinth 
east berlin city councilor thomas krueger said thursday the 
bunker rooms may one day become a historic exhibition but 
cautioned there is still no clear plan 
german officials fear that keeping the rooms intact would 
attract neonazis but they have made a commitment to turning 
relics of the third reich into stark memorials to prevent a return 
of fascism 
vandals occasionally have slipped into the bunker in the past 
sometimes leaving pronazi slogans written on the walls 
the rooms opened up for viewing on thursday do not include the 
one where hitler and eva braun his longtime mistress and wife of 
one day committed suicide on april 30 1945

the vital interest america sees in saudi 
arabia is no mystery its the oil the desert kingdom sits on a 
sea of crude whose flow is crucial for running the engines of the 
modern global economy 
saudi arabia is the worlds biggest oil exporter and its 255 
billion barrels of proven reserves give it 25 percent of the 
worlds total 
the sovereign independence of saudi arabia is of vital 
interest to the united states president bush said in dispatching 
american troops to face off with menacing iraq 
experts agree that if saudi oil fell to conquest destruction or 
intimidation the consequences would be devastating 
the word unthinkable is correct said john lichtblau 
chairman of the petroleum industry research foundation if saudi 
arabia were out 7 millionbarrels a day would be lost you couldnt 
close the gap with prices youd have to have worldwide rationing 
and shortages 
it gets worse any set of events that blocks saudi oil would 
presumably cut supplies from other persian gulf oil exporters as 
well certainly abu dhabi and maybe iran who knows what would 
happen next 
it would be a major international conflict lichtblau said 
oil would no longer be the only consideration 
but the oil shortage would certainly be a major consideration 
if only because petroleum is so essential to the modern way of life 
gasoline of course powers nearly all the 180 million cars 
trucks and buses on americas roads many people use oil or 
liquefied petroleum gas to heat their homes and power companies 
consume 730000 barrels a day generating electricity 
besides petroleum products and derivatives are used in items as 
diverse as detergents plastics fertilizers drugs paint 
cosmetics and clothing 
so far this year saudi arabia has exported more than 12 
million barrels of oil a day to the united states covering about 
75 percent of the nations consumption a barrel contains 42 
gallons 
the saudis have been pumping 53 million barrels a day recently 
nearly 10 percent of what is consumed worldwide excluding the 
soviet union and eastern europe which is how the figures are still 
compiled 
many people believe the saudis now will boost output to more 
than 7 million barrels replacing nearly half of the iraqi oil 
being blocked by a worldwide embargo 
if saudi arabia increases production that puts them in a more 
overt confrontation with iraq said james e akins a former us 
ambassador to saudi arabia wed have to assume there would be an 
attempt by iraq to sabotage saudi oil production 
the oil fields of saudi arabia as it happens are concentrated 
in the east near the borders with kuwait and iraq making them all 
the more vulnerable to attack even if american and other forces 
are able to keep iraq from gobbling up the saudis as it did tiny 
kuwait it would be hard to prevent any damage 
its a huge complex its very difficult to protect every 
checkpoint akins said 
increased production from countries outside the region such as 
mexico and venezuela will not be enough to replace the missing 
iraqi oil let alone cover for a disaster in saudi arabia 
the united states has about 600 million barrels of crude oil in 
its strategic petroleum reserve which should be able to deliver up 
to 35 million barrels a day to refineries if bush orders it 
tapped west germany japan and other industrial powers have 
similar emergency oil reserves 
akins joined other critics in urging bush to release oil 
immediately from the strategic reserve to head off panicky price 
increases and lines at gasoline stations 
he also said it was time to put a gas rationing system in place 
to be ready if drastic shortages and zooming prices make it 
necessary 
price rationing would be catastrophic physical rationing need 
not be catastrophic akins said

what could be more anesthetizing than the 
first august in washington of the postcold war era 
answer just about any august of the cold war era 
this city seemed headed for one of the laziest augusts ever just 
a week ago with communists a disappearing species what passed for 
controversy here was the way roseanne barr butchered the national 
anthem 
the sounds of summer could be heard at households everywhere 
dont forget the beach towels wheres the sun block 
some of the people who were saying those things never made it 
out the front door 
august was only about 18 hours old when all hell broke loose in 
the middle east nothing has been the same here since then saddam 
hussein has reduced roseanne barr to a mere footnote 
washington has become a city of frayed nerves and furrowed 
brows of countless canceled vacations the work days have become 
longer and the tempers shorter 
george lewis of nbc news had it right when he put new words to 
an old bill haley tune titling it iraq around the clock 
as bureaucrats throughout the city fret over saddams deed 
their mail piles up unread spouses and children feel neglected 
books reserved for summer reading will have to wait until fall 
doctor and dental appointments get put off that cholesterol 
check kuwait cant wait those things can 
people who planned to be at nantucket or nags head now find 
themselves manning state department telephones from midnight to 8 
am others who had already arrived at the shore never had a chance 
to unpack the boss summoned them back to duty 
president bush has shown the strain he has been testy with 
reporters replacing the usual evasions with watch and learn 
at his news conference wednesday bush sounded even more exhausted 
than he looked 
but bush is the boss and hes beginning a 3week vacation 
today at his summer home in kennebunkport maine life goes on 
bush said thursday when asked if he really planned to go on 
vacation 
and as the boss bush was taking extra staff along to help 
monitor events in the middle east and he plans to return to 
washington for a military briefing one day next week 
its doubtful anyones schedule has been more mutilated than 
that of secretary of state james a baker iii he had just arrived 
in mongolia and was planning a hunting expedition when saddam 
devoured kuwait 
baker was soon on his way to moscow for talks with his kremlin 
pal eduard shevardnadze 
since leaving mongolia the shredding of bakers schedule has 
continued unabated he canceled a trip to houston for his mothers 
birthday and gave a visiting mexican delegation two hours of his 
time instead of the 12 that had been planned 
his thursday meeting with the israeli foreign minister forget 
it his threeweek vacation that was supposed to start today looks 
more and more like an arabian desert mirage 
other augusts have produced other villains two years ago it 
was willie horton last year manuel noriega was at the top of the 
hate chart but next to saddam willie horton looks like the soul 
of goodness never used poison gas in his life 
another big august was in 1968 the soviets invaded 
czechoslovakia one week and chicagos cops had a street fight with 
antiwar protesters the next 
then there was august of 1981 when ronald reagans jets blew two 
of moammar gadhafis mig fighters out of the sky over the gulf of 
sidra 
but that wasnt too much of a big deal they didnt even wake 
reagan up to tell him the news after all it was august

the extremist palestinian faction led by 
abu nidal claimed today that the release of a 33yearold swiss 
hostage this week came after a deal with the kidnappers 
the fatahrevolutionary council in a statement published by 
beiruts annahar independent newspaper called on the swiss 
government and the international committee of the red cross to 
break their silence and declare the real identity of the side 
that concluded the release deal 
but the statement did not elaborate on the alleged deal or give 
a source for the groups allegation the groups spokesman walid 
khalid was not immeditately available for comment 
swiss and red cross officials have denied that any deal took 
place for the release thursday of relief worker emanuel christen 
france said the release may have been a result of its decision 
last month to pardon anis naccache and four other members of a 
proiranian assassination team 
the fatahrevolutionary council statement reiterated that it was 
not involved at all in the abduction crime or the release deal 
it challenged those who call themselves the ficticious 
palestinian revolutionary squads faction to reveal its true 
identity and shoulder the responsibility of their acts instead of 
blaming them on revolutionary fighting forces 
the previously unknown palestinian revolutionary squads 
announced tuesday that christen 33 and fellow swiss captive elio 
erriquez kidnapped oct 6 would be freed within 24 hours 
there was no explanation why erriquez was not released 
both men worked as orthopedic technicians at a red cross clinic 
in sidon 25 miles from beirut 
no group had claimed the swiss pairs abduction but lebanese 
police suspected abu nidals group which repeatedly denied the 
charge 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna broke away from 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization in 1973 and set 
up his own group based in iraq syria and libya 
christen was the first western hostage released since two 
americans were freed in april his release brought to 15 the number 
of foreigners held hostage in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16

the nations highest court should 
not decide on abortion us supreme court justice antonin scalia 
says 
the constitution says nothing about it either way scalia 
said thursday thats how i read the document its an issue the 
states must decide for themselves 
his remarks came in response to written questions submitted 
after a speech before the los angeles world affairs council about 
1100 people attended 
scalia did not specifically discuss abortion in his talk 
focusing instead on his belief that judges should not engage in 
public debate 
still his speech was interrupted by two abortionrights 
activists 
you have blood on your hands shouted one of the 
demonstrators youre killing women women will die because of 
you 
both were quickly escorted out of the ballroom by security 
personnel 
scalia also avoided discussion of david souters nomination to 
the high court and he declined to answer a question about what the 
senate should be allowed to ask a supreme court nominee during 
confirmation hearings 
the senate and i have an understanding scalia said they 
dont kibitz about how i do my business and i dont kibitz about 
how they do theirs 
the 54yearold scalia appointed to the court in 1986 by then 
president reagan has tried to pull the court further to the right 
and has been outspoken in criticizing conservative colleagues who 
prefer incremental change 
though he has a libertarian streak and strict adherence to 
constitutional principles that occasionally produce a surprise 
scalia is considered one of four solid votes poised to overturn the 
supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalized a womans 
right to an abortion 
hundreds of abortionrights demonstrators crowded outside the 
hotel 
we want to send a message to the president and the senate that 
we want no more scalias said kathy spillar national coordinator 
of an activist group called the feminist majority 
ms spillar was referring to scalias reputation as an abortion 
foe and souters nomination souter has not made public his stand 
on the abortion issue 
american people have a right to know where souter stands on 
abortion ms spillar said he could be the fifth vote the 
swing vote on the roe decision 
motorists creeping along wilshire boulevard in rushhour traffic 
honked and waved at demonstrators who lined the sidewalks and 
chanted slogans 
the protesters waved signs with such slogans as us out of 
my uterus how many black children do you plan to adopt this 
year and women are not incubators 
among the demonstrators was rosemary stasek 27 a member of 
southern california catholics for choice 
because antonin scalia is a catholic we want him to know that 
the majority of catholics are prochoice she said 
demonstrators also included members of the newly formed nurses 
for choice and the national organization for women

fueled by motorists frustration with 
rising gas prices a gimmick to sell cheap gas at a service station 
turned into chaos that took police three hours to control 
before it was over hundreds of motorists had lined up thursday 
to buy gas for 489 cents a gallon at kar kleen which has only six 
pumps 
that was 64 cents less than the price at some competing stations 
in suburban kansas city 
its like somebody giving you seven or eight bucks said 
clel hall who ran out of gas while waiting in line and had to push 
his car to the pump 
the idea was promoted by radio station kbeqfm known as q104 
which offered 1004 to the station with the cheapest gas in the 
metropolitan area 
the price of gasoline has risen since war broke out in the 
middle east 
the special which included premium grades was supposed to last 
for 104 minutes beginning at noon 
cars started lining up at 1030 am and extended more than a 
mile about an hour later station manager roger weibrecht said he 
expected to sell about 3000 gallons during the special 
police were not warned of the promotion and 11 grand view and 
kansas city officers were sent out to direct traffic answer 
complaints from area businesses and mediate traffic altercations 
im all for stunts but this could be dangerous grandview 
officer hr ellis said while directing traffic there are people 
leaving their cars running for food and they could get run over 
business owners complained about blocked driveways and tempers 
flared as cars tried to cut into line waiting motorists were 
detoured to avoid clogging the us 71 interchange 
police closed the line at 1 pm and the last tank was filled at 
230 pm there were no reports of serious accidents but customer 
debbie gross said the good price was tempered by the dent in her 
convertible which was hit by another waiting car 
i dont know the price is wonderful but now i have to go 
home and tell my husband about the car she said

the us food and drug administration will test 
the nations honey after some in massachusetts was found with 22 
times the legal amount of pesticide according to a published 
report today 
officials identified two large beekeeping operations which 
allegedly misused the chemical fluvalinate in hives used to 
pollinate cranberry bogs in massachusetts the boston herald 
reported 
inspectors found fluvalinate in honey taken from hives owned by 
one of the companies the company sells honey to the public as well 
as to the federal government which gives it to schools and senior 
citizen centers 
john a hamilton jr compliance director for the fda in boston 
said the agency was concerned that dozens of beekeepers who travel 
between florida and new england pollinating everything from citrus 
groves to apples orchards may be misusing the pesticide 
we dont know whether this is in food for human consumption 
or not at this point so we are actively investigating it and we 
will begin testing the honey that is sold for human consumption 
he said 
the us environmental protection agency describes fluvalinate 
as low to moderately toxic it is made by the sandoz crop 
protection corp and can cause skin eye and throat irritation the 
epa said 
fluvalinate which is legal for use in hives which do not 
produce honey is used to kill the varroa mite which kills bees 
officials are concerned that some of the 1693 million pounds of 
honey purchased by the us department of agriculture and 
distributed to schools centers for the elderly and other human 
services agencies may be contaminated 
a source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said officials from at least two other states including 
florida are cooperating with the investigation by the epa and fda 
the herald said 
this is just symptomatic of the rest of the industry the 
source said the fda is looking at honey all across the country

the defense in the central park jogger case was 
dealt a setback when the judge told the jury that the law did not 
necessarily require that the young defendants parents be present 
during questioning 
justice thomas galligans instructions came in response to a 
request for clarification from the jury during its first day of 
deliberations thursday jurors resumed deliberations in the rape 
and attempted murder case shortly after 10 am today 
the fact that a parent was not present during the questioning 
of a juvenile does not automatically mean the statement is 
involuntary the judge said 
peter rivera 15yearold raymond santanas lawyer had argued 
that santanas incriminating statements were no good because his 
grandmother who spoke little english was the only adult with him 
during questioning 
the attack on the confession was our central issue the 
judges instructions hurt my case rivera said thursday 
santana yusef salaam 16 and antron mccray 16 are charged 
with attacking a jogger in central park in april 1989 they were 
tried in an adult court as juveniles meaning a conviction would 
bring limited prison terms 
prosecutors said the jogger was dragged into the woods 
gangraped bashed with a brick and pipe and left to die in a pool 
of blood she is back at work as an investment banker but her 
sight balance and smell are impaired 
the savagery of the attack and her extraordinary recovery 
captured the attention of the city and the nation

her efforts to fight cancer signed legislation today that will 
provide federal money to screen women for breast and cervical 
cancer 
mrs quayle wife of vice president dan quayle attended the 
billsigning her first public appearance since undergoing a 
hysterectomy nearly three weeks ago doctors said precancerous 
cells were detected during a routine checkup 
youre looking so well bush told mrs quayle who lobbied 
for the legislation mrs quayle adopted the cause in part because 
her mother a pediatrician died of breast cancer 
bush didnt refer directly to mrs quayles recent surgery but 
said she was a source of strength to all of us 
calling breast and cervical cancer a womens and family 
issue bush signed the legislation authorizing 50 million in 
fiscal 1991 for grants to states 
under the legislation states would use the grants to screen 
women for cancer develop and disseminate information about the 
early detection and prevention of cancer and improve the education 
of health professionals in the area 
to receive the funds states could be required to match 1 for 
each 3 from the federal government they would also have to 
provide free testing services to lowincome women 
bush said 150000 women develop the diseases each year and 
50000 women die from them 
so many sad stories of loss could have happy endings if more 
women are aware of the lifesaving technologies that are now 
available he said

patrick halpin probably thought the mausoleum 
he built 125 years ago would be his familys final resting place 
but unless one of his descendants can be found the generations 
of halpins inside the dilapidated tomb will be exhumed and the 
crypt will be renovated and sold 
the reason a 1974 law under which new orleans tombs in need of 
renovation can be confiscated and the remains moved to unmarked 
mausoleums elsewhere in the same cemetery 
called the cities of the dead new orleans 31 historic 
cemeteries mirror the city in miniature and in marble laid out 
along twisting lanes bedecked with cast iron fences and carved in 
elaborate architectural detail the tombs form whitewashed 
neighborhoods 
hundreds of tourists a day visit the tombs which were built 
above ground because new orleans is below sea level too wet for 
graves 
some tombs such as those of william claiborne the first 
american governor of louisiana and new orleans voodoo queen marie 
laveau are maintained through a special preservation fund but 
other tombs are the responsibility of the family 
as a result the cemeteries have been ravaged by years of 
neglect last week for example lightning blasted apart a brick 
wall of 56 vaults in the lafayette cemetery exposing rusty coffin 
hinges bags of bones and skulls 
the new orleans archdiocese which owns six of the old 
cemeteries on almost 50 acres has upgraded streets drainage and 
monuments in the cemeteries over the years now the church along 
with a volunteer group hopes to use the 1974 law to restore 
hundreds of abandoned tombs built 60 to 200 years ago 
its your house and the city isnt going to come in and 
renovate your house said bret clesi president of save our 
cemeteries which gives tours to raise money for restoration if 
the family doesnt maintain it it should go to someone who will 
among the tombs in need of repair is the halpin family crypt on 
the main street of st patrick cemetery no 3 its soft red bricks 
are loose and weeds grow along the edge of the roof 
this tomb could be beautifully restored if its left as it 
is it will just continue to deteriorate said michael d 
boudreaux assistant director of the new orleans archdiocesan 
cemeteries 
the archdiocese is trying to locate tomb owners by advertising 
in newspapers by mail and through notices posted on the crypts 
under the 1974 law officials must try for a year to trace heirs 
then wait three more years before repossessing the tombs 
over the last five years the archdiocese has located 40 to 50 
descendants many of whom didnt know about their family tomb until 
they were contacted about restoring it boudreaux said so far no 
tombs have been confiscated 
boudreaux put the costs of restoration at 2000 to 3000 per 
tomb although save our cemeteries said some could run 30000 or 
more families also must pay a onetime 2400 for perpetual care 
to assure the tombs dont fall into disrepair again boudreaux said 
if a restored tomb is resold the remains inside will be put in 
another crypt and records will be kept to show where they are 
boudreaux said he said there have been no objections so far 
if the tomb is ready to fall down anyway im not too sure you 
can be concerned about moving the remains clesi said 
boudreaux hopes eventually to restore the cities of the dead to 
their former glory 
were seeing some derelict areas really being upgraded he 
said some day it may be like it once was when families brought 
picnic lunches and spent the day working on their tombs

the military government blamed western 
diplomats friday for what it called exaggerated reports of 
bloodshed in a clash between soldiers and a group of buddhist monks 
and students 
the diplomats said soldiers were reported to have killed at 
least two monks and two students who were demonstrating peacefully 
in the central city of mandalay on wednesday 
government radio said one monk and three policemen were injured 
it said police fired to disperse the crowd after demonstrators 
stoned policemen and tried to seize their guns 
at a news conference friday government spokesman col than tun 
said the foreign media accounts of the clash came from two groups 
of western diplomats who were in mandalay at the time he would not 
identify them 
diplomats should refrain from indulging in mean acts 
incompatible with diplomats of civilized nations he said 
reporters reached the diplomats in rangoon by telephone from 
bangkok they said while they could not independently confirm the 
deaths the reports came from usually reliable sources 
they said the demonstration reflected the growing frustration at 
the governments refusal to hand over power to the national league 
for democracy which won a majority of seats in the may 27 
parliamentary election 
the authorities still hold party leader aung san suu kyi under 
house arrest and other opposition leaders remain imprisoned 
the military government came to power in september 1988 when 
soldiers crushed a nationwide uprising for democracy

travel agents said friday they had received 
cancellations and were being swamped by phone calls from anxious 
tourists worried about an iraqi chemical attack on israel 
also friday an israeli newspaper reported the united states has 
vowed to launch a full military strike against iraq if that country 
attacked israel the us assurance was part of a message sent by 
defense secretary richard cheney to his israeli counterpart moshe 
arens hadashot said in an unattributed report 
defense ministry spokesman dan naveh did not return several 
telephone messages friday us embassy spokesman don cofman would 
not refer to specifics saying only that us support for israel 
is wellknown 
sixteen americans in a 40member tourist group canceled at the 
last minute thursday and many more cancellations were expected 
said ofer eshed manager of ophir tours in tel aviv 
it is not the persian gulf crisis but the stories of the gas 
masks that are worrying american tourists eshed said tourists 
are asking if they will also be given gas masks 
the cancellations could mark the start of a deep slump in 
israels tourism industry just recovering from a twoyear decline 
attributed to the palestinian uprsing tourism is israels largest 
source of foreign capital bringing in more than 17 billion last 
year 
on wednesday iraqi president saddam hussein threatened to 
launch a missile attack on israel if the americans launched a 
military strike in the gulf in april saddam threatened to burn 
half of israel with chemical weapons if israel attacked iraq 
the hyatt regency hotel in jerusalem has received many overseas 
inquiries about the situation in israel said the hotels public 
relations manager ezra astruc 
people abroad want to know if israel has really mobilized its 
troops and if everybody has been given gas masks astruc said 
both astruc and eshed said there was a lull in reservations for 
spring 1991 which usually pour in this time of year 
tourism ministry spokesman yossi shuval confirmed that 
reservations for spring were down and said some americans might 
think twice now before buying a ticket to israel or any other 
overseas destination 
those who have tickets in hand will still come but those who 
havent bought their tickets yet may change their plans shuval 
said 
if there is world war iii people will prefer to stay home 
shuval said 
another tourism official said most shortterm cancellations over 
the gulf crisis would come from holiday makers from europe 
looking for sun and fun 
the official said pilgrims who account for 38 percent of 
israels tourism are less easily deterred by troubles 
before the persian gulf crisis israeli tourism enjoyed a 1990 
comeback after the plunge set off by the palestinian uprising 
figures released by the ministry of tourism said the number of 
tourists coming to israel in the first six months of 1990 was up 10 
percent from the same period last year

cashstrapped east germany halted millions of 
dollars in trade with iraq on friday joining a worldwide embargo 
but endangering the fragile existence of some east german factories 
the economics ministry said it was complying with a un 
resolution to cut economic ties with iraq because of its invasion 
of kuwait 
east germany had been a big exporter of electronics 
agricultural machinery industrial equipment and some chemical 
products to iraq said rainer schuster head of the ministrys 
office for economic relations with developing nations 
the trade agreements with iraq were made by the former communist 
regime which was toppled in the fall and replaced with an elected 
democratic government in march 
schuster said east germany has in the past exported 200 million 
to 300 million in goods annually to iraq but that amount has been 
cut to less than half in the past year because of iraqs own 
economic problems 
he said his office had no specific figure for the current dollar 
value of trade between the countries 
east german exports often were paid for in iraqi oil east 
germany which relies solely on soviet crude for its own petroleum 
needs would then sell the iraqi oil to other countries schuster 
said 
he said east germany received 70 million to 100 million in 
iraqi oil in 1990 
east germany has only negligible trade with kuwait he said 
east germanys economy has taken a beating since the nation 
switched to a free market on july 1 in anticipation of unification 
with west germany later this year 
jobless is skyrocketing and hundreds of factories are threatened 
with bankruptcy 
schuster said he did not think the trade embargo with iraq would 
significantly worsen east germanys already dire economic 
situation but said it may be harmful to some enterprises that 
manufactured products sold to iraq

here are excerpts from the statement 
friday from iraqi president saddam hussein which was monitored in 
bahrain and translated from arabic by the associated press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the foreigner used to respect the arab and did not trample them 
under foot nor their sacred shrines and the arabs were one nation 
they were dignified the ruler was a wise man and one of the 
most courageous leading the vanguard wherever the fighting 
strong standing in the front lines the most generous among 
them he was honest and feared god was loved and respected by his 
people a real leader he distributed the riches of the 
nation to the people 
he didnt obey the foreigner he was close to god and kept 
distance from evil 
look at where the arabs are today the foreigner entered our 
homes the western imperialism has divided us setting up small 
states to facilitate the task of occupying arab land 
imperialism made sure they guaranteed the major points by creating 
those states kept away the riches from the majority 
with the riches in a minority it was used for the foreigner and 
the minority ruler they used schemes to help the imperialists 
because of this condition they give the worst picture of the arabs 
to the foreigners because of their shameful behavior they were 
stooges of the foreigner 
there had to be a fundamental correction of this picture 
changing this minority control that is spreading disease in the 
body of the majority and so in the south of iraq iraq responded 
to save kuwait 
the traitors who betrayed the nation collapsed it is the 
battle of the entire arab nation the battle of freedom from hunger 
and humiliation away from god its the beginnning for the 
foreigners to respect the arab demand and respond to them 
everywhere its the gain on which the palestinians can base 
imperialism and zionism are standing up to iraq because it 
represents the conscience of the arab world iraq oh arabs is 
your iraq iraq is moving darkness away and after we all 
stand in one line god will bless us the evil ememies ranks 
will collapse no matter how strong and no matter what traitors 
the american forces came and saudi arabia opened its doors to it 
under false pretext that the iraqi army will continue toward them 
denials and clarifications were of no avail 
it means that there are plans for aggressive intentions the 
joint policy with the foreigner has become exposed so they are not 
only defying the arab and islamic nations and their own they 
were challenging god the day they put mecca and the tomb of 
mohammed under the soil of the foreigner 
oh arabs oh moslems oh believers in god wherever you are this 
is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend mecca 
which is captive to the spears of the americans and the zionists 
this is your day to rise quickly to defend the prophet mohammed ibn 
abdallah who carries the noble message in this noble land for it 
to remain holy 
rise up against evil against the foreigner who has trampled our 
sacred rights keep the foreigner away from our sacred shrines 
tell the traitors there is no place for them on the soil of the 
arabs after they humiliated arab honor and dignity 
burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders who 
want harm for your families in iraq until the voice of right rises 
up in the arab world hit their interests wherever they are and 
rescue holy mecca and the grave of the prophet mohammed 
dont let the enemy pass from the soil of egypt to use your 
water sons of the strait of hormuz stop the fleets from moving 
sons in ras alkhaimah and sharjah arabs everywhere your brothers 
in iraq are determined on holy war without hesitation and without 
any slowing down 
victory with gods will we shall be victorious god willing 
and evil and corruption will be trampled wherever it is and the 
sun will rise on the arabs and the moslems and god will be happy 
after we purify our souls and land from the foreigners oh 
brothers denounce them hit their interests wherever they are and 
rescue holy mecca

magellan the first us planetary 
spacecraft launched since 1978 fired its braking rocket and 
dropped into orbit around venus today on a mission to make the best 
pictures yet of the planets cloudcovered terrain 
the system worked as planned a lot of hard work was 
rewarded said george alexander chief spokesman for nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
im tremendously gratified we were able to do something for 
nasa and the public that shows this is a capable agency following 
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the hubble space telescope he 
said this breaks the string of bad luck 
magellan dived over venus north pole then ignited the 
forwardfacing rocket at 932 am slowing from about 24600 mph 
to roughly 18500 mph 
that allowed magellan to be captured by venus gravity and start 
orbiting the second planet from the sun said mission commentator 
steve wall 
the rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind 
venus out of radio contact with engineers on earth magellan 
emerged at 953 am but preliminary confirmation that all went 
well came 13 minutes later because of the time magellans radio 
signal takes to reach earth 
we are now in orbit said david okerson a magellan project 
engineer 
in the magellan project office there was cheering and 
applause and whistling and hooting by scientists and engineers 
said secretary sharon kyle 
magellan encountered venus 144 million miles from earth after 
circling the sun 1 times during a roundabout 948millionmile 
journey 
the 413 million magellan the heart of a 744 million mission 
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick venusian clouds 
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planets 
deformed volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail mapping is 
slated to start by sept 1 
nasa plans to release the first pictures in september but may 
do so this month if images made during tests produce any 
interesting discoveries 
magellan has raised nasas hopes after its recent woes 
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of 
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the 15 
billion hubble space telescope 
the major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed 
wesley t huntress jr nasa director of solar system exploration 
said thursday id prefer not to speculate on what failure might 
mean 
the 21foot magellan deployed from the shuttle atlantis in may 
1989 was the first us planetary spacecraft launched since 1978 
when nasa sent the pioneer 12 orbiter and the pioneer 13 probes to 
venus 
magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary 
exploration huntress said were looking forward to the 
drama 
the voyager probes explored jupiter saturn uranus and neptune 
between 1979 and last year but they were launched in 1977 
galileo launched in october is headed toward a 1995 rendezvous 
with jupiter 
during the coming decade or so nasa also plans to send 
spacecraft to explore mars the moon saturn comets and the suns 
polar regions 
nasa has said magellan would return more data than all previous 
nasa missions combined 
venus is similar to earth in size density and position in the 
solar system although a runaway greenhouse effect raised its 
surface temperature to 900 degrees fahrenheit about as hot as a 
selfcleaning oven 
nasa wants to learn if the planets geological processes are 
similar to earths venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes but 
no one knows if any are active 
magellan was named for the portuguese explorer ferdinand 
magellan who sailed around the world in the early 1500s 
the spacecraft was built by martin marietta corp and its radar 
was built by hughes aircraft co

shirley kagan and matthew dubroff did not want 
to begin married life buried by the usual wedding presents so they 
created their own bridal registry a list of classic rock n roll 
compact discs on file at a record store 
we figured that wed never remember who gave us the ceramic 
dalmatian but wed always know who gave us van morrisons 
moondance said kagan 
she and dubroff both 22 get married sunday since they plan to 
spend the next two years in japan teaching english the couple 
neither want nor need a lot of household objects so instead of 
registering a silver pattern at tiffanys kagan decided to 
register at tower records 
we both really love music she explained and this was a 
way to get it in bulk 
her plan was simple they would list in order of preference 
the 150 compact discs they most wanted to begin their rock library 
but choosing and ranking proved difficult he liked the grateful 
dead she liked cat stevens they wound up spending three days in 
the store arguing over the best of rock n roll 
finally they settled on a system hed pick one shed pick 
one all the way from the complete 16volume beatles collection 
down to princes 1999 and earth wind amp fires raise 
it was an experience in compromise before marriage kagan 
said but we never even made it to the classical section we were 
exhausted 
when the couples friends and relatives called tower they were 
told which discs on the list had not been purchased and where they 
ranked in preference 
store manager steve harman outlined the packages kagan and 
dubroff had devised such as a fourdisc set of solo albums by john 
lennon and paul mccartney and one comprising the essential jimi 
hendrix and bob dylan live at budokan 
but some gift buyers tried to break up the packages 
they wanted to choose music that they liked harman said 
one woman was willing to buy kate bush but she said no led 
zeppelin she wanted to substitute dire straits 
kagans aunt and uncle provided the most essential gift a 
portable cd player 
weve also gotten an espresso machine some china and a bunch 
of silverware but im much more enthusiastic about the music 
kagan said some might argue that ill become more mature and 
regret this but i dont see myself getting more sensible

wholesale prices declined 01 percent in july 
the government said friday in a report showing inflation was in 
check before iraqs invasion of kuwait last week sent oil costs 
spiraling 
the seasonally adjusted decline capped a sixmonth stretch of 
virtually no change in the labor departments producer price index 
for finished goods the index had risen a modest 02 percent in 
june 
for the first seven months of the year wholesale prices 
advanced at an annual rate of 3 percent down sharply from the 48 
percent increase for all of last year 
obviously this number is history said economist donald 
ratajczak of georgia state university but what it shows is that 
heading into the oil shock inflation was tame 
financial markets shrugged off the good news stock prices fell 
after iraqi president saddam hussein called for arab unity to 
condemn us forces in saudi arabia and to overthrow the saudi 
royal family 
the effect on world oil markets of iraqs action last week means 
the july report is the end of the inflation respite analysts said 
the numbers almost appear like the calm beach scene before the 
shark in jaws arrives said ron schreibman vice president of 
the national association of wholesalerdistributors 
crude oil prices which averaged around 20 a barrel in july 
have pushed past 25 since the invasion and gasoline prices are 
reported up as much as 16 cents a gallon at many service stations 
ratajczak predicted that overall wholesale prices could shoot up 
as much as 16 percent in august that would be the biggest 
increase since a 19 percent jump in january when a severe cold 
snap froze vegetable crops and dried up fuel oil supplies 
in july energy prices fell 05 percent the sixth consecutive 
decline food costs were unchanged and prices excluding the 
volatile food and energy sectors considered a better indicator of 
underlying inflationary pressures fell 01 percent the first 
drop in a year 
the prospect of accelerating inflation at the same time the 
economy seems on the verge of recession presents a dilemma for the 
federal reserve the central bank has been fighting inflation by 
cooling the economy with relatively high interest rates 
but last month the fed nudged shortterm rates lower in response 
to signs that businesses were having trouble obtaining loans 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york said monetary policy makers will 
look beyond the oil shock which they cannot influence and pay 
close attention to recent signs of accumulating economic weakness 
those include a leap in the civilian unemployment rate from 52 
percent in june to 55 percent in july the highest in two years 
the handwriting is on the wall for the fed its going to have 
to ease the question is whether its going to ease right away or 
whether its going to wait until its aug 21 meeting he said 
the labor department offered these details of july prices 
gasoline fell 53 percent while natural gas rose 66 percent 
and fuel oil was up 04 percent 
fresh fruit prices jumped 14 percent but egg prices declined 
183 percent costs were up for rice pasta chicken fish and soft 
drinks prices fell for vegetables baked goods beef pork and 
shortening and cooking oil 
clothing prices were mixed with a 02 percent rise for girls 
childrens and infants apparel a 01 percent drop in mens and 
boys clothing and no change in womens clothing 
passenger car prices dropped 05 percent household glassware 
fell 51 percent but silverware rose 41 percent 
tobacco prices fell 29 percent but they had been rising 
steadily before and were still 133 percent higher than a year ago 
the various changes put the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1180 in july that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 cost 118 last month up 
from 11410 a year earlier 
in earlier stages of the production process prices were 
unchanged for intermediate goods and rose 06 percent for crude 
goods an example of the three processing stages would be clothing 
for finished goods cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude

president turgut ozal said friday that 
turkey is on guard against a possible iraqi attack but he played 
down the possibility his country will become a target 
there is no full alert yet ozal said in an interview with 
the associated press i think we have to be very careful our 
chief of staff is looking at the case very carefully we are trying 
to listen and gather intelligence and act accordingly that is a 
necessity 
citing national security reasons the government friday ordered 
an end to strikes by civilian workers at us bases in turkey last 
week about 4000 turkish workers walked off their jobs at 26 
american installations to demand pay increases 
the air force announced thursday it was in a state of advanced 
readiness to ward off any attack 
ozal denied iraq and turkey were beefing up forces along their 
185mile border the iraqi embassy in ankara also denied baghdad 
had reinforced troops at the frontier 
according to the intelligence i have there is no real 
military buildup not on the turkish side nor the iraqi side 
the president said probably these are already existing forces in 
the area but this may change as time goes on i dont know 
speaking in his office in the presidential palace ozal said 
there was no legitimate motive for iraq to attack turkey some have 
suggested that iraq might retaliate because turkey effectively shut 
down two iraqi oil pipelines and froze trade with baghdad 
ozal stressed that the sanctions were adopted in compliance with 
an embargo ordered by the un security council 
the sanctions are a united nations decision and there is a 
legal basis for it he said i think they the iraqis should 
understand this 
sanctions adopted earlier this week allowed for sale of food and 
medicine to iraq on friday turkey said it was banning all food 
exports except for a few items such as milk for babies turkish 
sanctions have also blocked iraqs only land route to europe 
if iraq attacked turkey iraqs forces would counter a 
formidable adversary the turkish armed forces with 800000 men 
are the secondlargest in nato behind the united states 
foreign ministers of the nato alliance pledged to stand by 
turkey in the event of an attack it is very clear that an attack 
on turkey would be considered an attack on all nato nations 
nato secretary general manfred woerner said 
as the only nato nation bordering iraq turkey has taken on a 
central role in the alliances strategy since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait secretary of state james a baker iii conferred here 
thursday with ozal and other turkish leaders on the crisis 
ozal said baker thanked turkey for applying the un sanctions 
discussed turkeys losses stemming from the embargo on oil and 
trade and asssured him nato would come to turkeys aid in case of 
attack 
us administration officials traveling with baker said turkey 
had pledged to allow the united states to use its air bases as 
staging areas for attacks against iraq in the event of war 
ozal however said there had been no specific discussions on 
the matter and denied turkey made any commitment on the use of the 
bases but he did not rule out that turkey might eventually do so 
the americans were using the bases for training in accordance 
with nato and bilateral agreements he said asked whether they 
could be used for largerscale military operations he said no 
it is not required right now 
the president also said turkey had no immediate plans to join 
the usled multinational force being deployed in saudi arabia he 
said any such decision would have to be approved by parliament 
a senior government official speaking on ground rules of 
anonymity said it is out of the question for turkey to take 
part in any kind of military action at this point 
but the official said turkey might reconsider if iraq attacked 
saudi arabia 
ozal said there would be no need to resort to military action 
against iraq if the worldwide embargo is strictly enforced i 
have a feeling the world this time will not falter he said 
however he said saddam may not take the embargo seriously on 
grounds that western nations would give in to profit motives and 
gradually relax the embargo after all who built those chemical 
weapons plants in iraq ozal asked the europeans did 
asked whether the embargo might force iraq to retaliate rather 
than withdraw from kuwait ozal dismissed the possibility i know 
saddam hussein he said he is decisive but hes an 
intelligent man hes a firstclass intelligent man

the national geographic society is 
anticipating history and unifying east and west germany and 
decentralizing the soviet union in its new world atlas society 
officials said friday 
the sixth edition of the national geographic atlas of the world 
removes the red line that separated the two germanys in past 
editions and refers only to the nation of germany 
weve had to look into our crystal ball and see that the 
unification of germany is inevitable said john b garver 
national geographics chief cartographer 
the atlas shows both bonn and berlin as capitals but features 
only the west german flag the page on germany was printed at a 
willard ohio publishing house thursday and friday with the new 
edition of 240000 copies to be released in november 
unification is scheduled to take place in december although the 
east german parliament has called for the first allgerman 
elections and the merging of the two germanys on oct 14 
spokeswoman barbara hand fallon said national geographics first 
new atlas since 1981 drops the letters ssr or soviet 
socialist republic from ll soviet states except russia to reflect 
impulses within the soviet union for greater independence 
the capitals of such states as lithuania have been clearly 
marked in the event they later gain independence from moscow she 
said 
other political changes to be reflected in the new book are the 
recent unification of north and south yemen and the de facto 
division of cyprus 
the middle east map will be flagged with a note that on aug 
2 1990 iraqi military forces invaded kuwait 
its a precarious time to be putting out a world atlas miss

a federal judge ruled today that the us 
government illegally kidnapped a mexican doctor to stand trial in 
the slaying of a us drug agent 
us district judge edward rafeedie said the abduction of dr 
humberto alvarez machain violated an extradition treaty between the 
united states and mexico and was an offense against mexicos 
sovereignty 
the judge added the court orders this defendant is to be 
discharged and the government is ordered to repatriate this 
defendant to mexico forthwith 
but he stayed execution of his order for one week after 
assistant us attorney william fahey asked for time to consider an 
appeal 
alvarez lawyer robert steinberg said he felt the judges 
ruling was a warning to the us drug enforcement administration to 
stop kidnapping suspects from mexico 
he added that he believed the judges ruling would be appealed 
and might go as high as the us supreme court my fear is 
theyre going to take these appeals for years while he alvarez 
rots in jail he said 
although the government suggested a bail hearing for the doctor 
steinberg said the defendant has no property to post as collateral 
and probably would not win release because of fears that he would 
flee to mexico 
alvarez who was wearing a blue jail jumpsuit displayed no 
emotion when he heard the ruling asked for his clients reaction 
steinberg said hes numb 
the doctor was spirited out of mexico on charges he administered 
drugs to keep dea agent enrique camarena alive while he was being 
tortured 
rafeedie stressed that he was not dismissing the charge against 
the doctor but merely ruling that the case could not be tried in 
the united states 
the us justice department said earlier it was pressing its 
investigation into the 1985 torturemurder in mexico following the 
convictions of four men in the slaying 
the probe includes two former highranking officials of the 
mexican government who have been indicted in connection with the 
slaying 
the dea is pursuing its own investigation of the possible 
involvement of mexico citys former police chief in camarenas 
slaying authorities said 
the government of the united states will spare no effort or 
expense in its continuing investigation of the circumstances 
surrounding the kidnapping and murder of special agent camarena 
us attorney lourdes g baird said 
the second camarena trial ended monday with the conviction of 
the last of four defendants three people were convicted in 1988 on 
charges of involvement in the murder 
more than two dozen people have been convicted in mexico

grateful dead keyboardist brent mydland 
who was found dead in his home last month died from an overdose of 
drugs a coroner said friday 
the autopsy examination revealed a recent puncture mark on the 
left arm consistent with a recent intravenous injection prior to 
death said capt al moore of the contra costa coroners office 
toxicology tests reveal lethal levels of morphine and cocaine in 
the blood 
no drugs or narcotics paraphernalia were found and there was no 
indication of foul play moore said mydland had reportedly been 
troubled over family problems but moore said there was no evidence 
of suicide 
mydland 37 was found dead july 26 in the bedroom of his 
secluded lafayette home in the hills above berkeley 
the band had returned to northern california two days before

immediate comment on the coroners report 
speaking as an individual mcnally added i can only say 
no matter what the cause of death brent was a sweet guy and its a 
tragedy his music is not around any more 
mydland joined the grateful dead in 1979 and was its newest 
member in addition to playing keyboard instruments he wrote songs 
such as far from me and the environmental ballad we can run 
but we cant hide 
led by guitarist jerry garcia the band was formed in the 1960s 
in san franciscos haightashbury district although it releases 
albums sporadically its concerts are almost always sold out 
thanks to devoted fans known as deadheads 
mydland replaced keyboardist keith godchaux who later died in 
an auto accident about a year after leaving the band godchaux had 
replaced ron pigpen mckernan who died of cirrhosis of the 
liver at age 27 in 1973

his more than 2 million estate went automatically to his wife 
under california law and under mydlands will the other half was

armed soldiers riot police 
and anc marshals marched through mixedrace townships of port 
elizabeth on friday to restore order after 42 people died in four 
days of rioting and looting 
it would appear the situation is under control but we cannot 
say if it will flair up again or what is going to happen said 
maj bill dennis a police spokesman in the southeastern coastal 
city he said sporadic incidents or arson looting and 
stonethrowing continued friday although it was much quieter 
police lt gen mulder van eyck said security forces were in 
control of much of the area where violence erupted monday night 
following a local meeting to protest rent increases and the 
educational system 
police said 42 people were killed in fighting which spread 
thursday night to townships around the city of uitenhage 15 miles 
inland from port elizabeth some were killed by police gunfire but 
there was no breakdown on how many they said 
police said 220 people had been arrested for looting 
plundering and burning since monday 
telephone trash collection mail and all other public services 
were cut off in the riothit areas municipal employees had been 
targeted for attack and along with most other residents stayed 
home to protect their houses 
the government had appealed to port elizabeth residents to stop 
the unrest the african national congress held a community meeting 
and urged people to stay off the streets 
van eyck said residents told him the unrest was sparked by the 
high rental of homes the lack of proper water supply lack of 
facilities and the inadequate schools 
the riots began monday in a clash between members of a political 
group and police at a meeting to protest rent increases and 
education problems 
dennis said police had learned that criminals had joined the 
crowd and helped spark the violence by throwing stones 
police and political organizations said criminal gangs and mobs 
of looters then took advantage of the unrest and were responsible 
for much of the violence and arson 
police repeatedly opened fire with shotguns and pistols to 
disperse the mobs businessmen have also been reported firing at 
looters

the american red cross today announced that it 
is nationalizing the operations of its 54 regions and appointing a 
new senior vice president who will oversee blood services 
the changes aimed at assuring the safety of the blood supply 
and meeting federal regulations came after searing 
selfexamination as well as scrutiny by the press and the food 
and drug administration said red cross chairman george f moody 
the organization has been the subject of an fda investigation 
into the condition of its blood supply 
moody said each of the groups 54 blood regions will have a new 
principal officer appointed and paid for by the national 
headquarters who will report directly to the new senior vice 
president dr jeffrey mccullough of st paul previously regional 
blood services directors had reported to their local chapters 
in addition moody said the organization has tripled its 
regulatory affairs unit in washington from five to 14 people and 
doubled from eight to 16 people the unit responsible for evaluating 
the blood services offered by local chapters and following up their 
reports of accidents or errors 
a preliminary report on an fda inspection of the red crosss 
national headquarters in washington in may found that for years 
various red cross regional offices had not reported accidents and 
errors made in gathering and distribution of blood 
even when regions did make such reports the audit found 
washington headquarters did not always review or follow up those 
reports 
the red cross supplies blood to more than half the hospitals in 
the country 
one example the investigation cited concerned the washington 
regional center about 230 cases were reported to the washington 
region in which people may have contracted the aids virus through 
blood transfusions the report said but headquarters was alerted 
to only four of those cases 
fda officials said red cross procedures were not responsible for 
the infections almost all of the transfusions they said took 
place before 1985 when reliable aids tests became available 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the agency was unaware of the 
pending changes 
but if theyre putting in a system where they can get reports 
from their field office thats all to the good he said 
nesbit said the fda has an ongoing discussion with the red 
cross and i suspect those discussions will continue 
the agencys regions which have been operating rather 
independently will be centralized in the washington 
headquarters he said

the roman catholic church asked court permission 
to open a grave in an old church cemetery to make sure it holds the 
remains of pierre toussaint a onetime slave from haiti who could 
become the first black american saint 
we want to be certain that whats down there is not sticks and 
stones and someone elses bones said monsignor robert oconnell 
who is directing the campaign to canonize toussaint 
on thursday the archdiocese of new york sought the order from 
state supreme court judge phyllis gangeljacob scheduled a hearing 
for aug 28 and pronounced the matter utterly fascinating 
this is much more interesting than trump 
although the health department routinely issues permits to 
unearth buried coffins mostly so they can be moved from one 
cemetery to another anyone who wants to actually open a coffin 
must obtain a court order 
those present when the coffin is opened including pathologists 
church officials and gravediggers must take an oath to testify 
truthfully to what they saw oconnell said 
church officials do not expect to find any supernatural evidence 
of toussaints sainthood such as an unusually wellpreserved 
corpse he said 
toussaint apparently was buried 137 years ago in the cemetery of 
old st patricks cathedral in manhattans little italy the grave 
bears several markers but oconnell said that if he is declared 
a saint and there is a ceremony honoring him we must be sure 
he said there was another reason for positive identification if 
toussaint becomes a saint the vatican may distribute some of his 
bones or personal items to places where his faith was 
nourished such as haiti or to prominent places of worship such 
as st patricks cathedral on fifth avenue 
toussaint was born a slave in haiti in 1766 and moved to new 
york with his owners family in 1787 he became one of the citys 
leading hairdressers and was allowed to keep some of his income 
when toussaints owner died leaving his wife and child 
impoverished toussaint secretly supported them for about 20 years 
the widow freed toussaint shortly before her death in 1807 
toussaint gave lavishly to several charities including an 
orphanage and the citys first school for black children and 
entered quarantined sections of the city each august to help yellow 
fever victims 
but he took no stand on slavery and seems generally to have 
avoided controversy according to a pamphlet released by the 
archdiocese the famous phrase only my hairdresser knows for 
sure could well have had its origin in pierres discretion 
when toussaint died in 1853 the new york post said he was 
spoken of by all who know him as a man of the warmest and most 
active benevolence 
oconnell said the case for toussaints sainthood is buttressed 
by one reported miracle the recovery of a young haitian with 
cancer who refused medical care and relied solely on prayers to 
toussaint 
even if toussaint is deemed worthy of sainthood canonization 
could be years away cardinal john oconnor has said he hopes 
toussaint might be near sainthood by the time pope john paul ii 
visits haiti in 1992 but oconnell said he was told by vatican 
officials that no timetable could be set

with john poindexter and oliver north testified for more than two 
hours friday before a federal grand jury investigating the

declined to discuss his testimony as he left the us courthouse 
sable was a witness at poindexters criminal trial in march 
a retired air force colonel sable is now vice president for

security adviser decided to follow the line of poindexters 
predecessor robert mcfarlane mcfarlane in 1985 denied that north 
was raising money or coordinating the contra military effort 
poindexter sent responses to congress endorsing mcfarlanes 
denials which mcfarlane eventually admitted were false shortly 
after poindexters letters were sent north denied in a 
facetoface meeting with the house intelligence committee that he 
had armed the contras 
sable testified that he did not know the denials were false 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he misled 
congress when he denied norths contra military aid in letters to 
three house committees 
poindexter was convicted of obstruction of congress in 
connection with his denials that north was assisting the congress 
poindexter also was convicted of four other felony counts his 
lawyers have said the conviction will be appealed 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh said she would have no comment on sables 
grand jury appearance 
since the end of may north has appeared six times before the 
grand jury and poindexter has appeared once 
on wednesday a former national security aide to thenvice 
president bush testified for nearly two hours before the grand 
jury g philip hughes has been nominated by bush to be the us 
ambassador to barbados

secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
he expects announcements soon from germany canada and belgium 
about joining military efforts to thwart iraqi aggression in the 
oilrich persian gulf region 
at a news conference following a closeddoor session at nato 
headquarters baker denounced iraqi leader saddam hussein for his 
invasion of kuwait last week but he sidestepped the question of 
whether the united states would like to see him overthrown by 
internal rebellion 
he said that is an issue for the iraqi people to decide and 
added im not going to suggest that this is something the united 
states is interested in or pursuing 
baker also said the bush administration is very disturbed 
about restrictions on travel placed on an estimated 3500 americans 
as well as other foreign nationals in iraq and kuwait 
but baker said we are not calling them hostages nothing 
has been asked or demanded for their freedom he said discussions 
are under way to press for permission for them to leave 
baker was returning to washington later in the day 
the secretary of state expressed satisfaction with the results 
of his session with nato foreign ministers over what he said was 
the first crisis of the post coldwar period 
he said he found solid support for president bushs decision 
earlier this week to deploy ground air and naval forces to deter 
iraq from invading saudi arabia and seizing control of its enormous 
oil fields he also said the western allies were united in their 
determination to defend turkey a nato member from any military 
action by iraqs saddam hussein 
baker said a number of members of nato have indicated they 
do intend to send military support to the efforts that are under 
way in saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
he noted that great britain and france already have announced 
the deployment of forces and said germany belgium and canada 
gave indications they will have announcements to make in due 
course 
hours later in ottawa prime minister brian mulroney said his 
nation will send three ships and 800 sailors to the persian gulf as 
its contribution to the multinational force he said canada is 
dispatching two destroyers and a supply vessel 
in bonn west germany said today it is sending four or five mine 
sweepers and a supply ship to the mediterranean in case iraq tries 
to mine shipping lanes there and left open the possibility they 
could sail to the persian gulf region 
west german government spokesman hans klein said the deployment 
was a contribution of solidarity to the allies efforts to 
stabilize the situation in the gulf 
in australia prime minister bob hawke said today that canada 
and japan might join australia the united states and britain in 
sending military forces to the gulf 
in addition baker thanked italy spain and portugal for being 
very forthcoming in giving the united states the use of bases 
within their borders 
officials at the nato meeting also said denmark had offered to 
make naval ships available to fill gaps left within the alliance by 
units that have been assigned to help in the gulf 
baker made no mention of the possibility of whether nonnato 
nations would be joining american ground forces in saudi arabia an 
emergency meeting of arab nations was under way in egypt to discuss 
a regional response to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
he noted the soviet union had sent a ship to the persian gulf 
region and said he believed they would want to do any 
coordination only under united nations auspices 
asked about turkey which shares a border with iraq and recently 
shut down an iraqi oil pipeline baker said there is some 
evidence of increased activity up there up north 
he also said there is evidence of iraqi troops moving into 
kuwait in greater numbers 
baker stopped in brussels after a visit in turkey at which he 
reassured the turks of united states commitment to back up their 
own retaliation against iraq 
in casting the persian gulf confrontation as the first crisis of 
the postcold war era he said nato was demonstrating its ability 
at dealing with threats from new sources and new directions 
in his prepared speech he called on the 15 us allies to 
examine how you might help enforce the boycott of iraq approved 
by the united nations security council 
he said he found support for bushs decision to send troops to 
saudi arabia and said each member nation will contribute in its own 
way to the effort 
he also said there was support for the un sanctions 
reaffirmation that nato will stand by its defense obligations to 
turkey 
finally he said we sent another signal that nato is the 
place to consult and meet together on common crises 
earlier in his closeddoor speech baker vowed to do what was 
necessary to devastate iraqs economy 
we should show that we will do whatever must be done in order 
to enforce the will of the united nations baker said 
his appeal to the nato foreign ministers extended far beyond 
iraqs invasion of kuwait and seizure of its oil fields 
it is not only economic progress that is threatened he 
said if might is to make right then the world will be plunged 
into a new dark age 
we have seen a continous and unrelenting buildup of arms 
baker said the iraqi dictator saddam hussein has spared no 
expense to sustain a vast force far out of proportion to any 
conceivable threat 
baker arrived in brussels from ankara where turkish leaders 
pledged that the united states could use their air bases to launch 
an attack on iraq in the event of war 
baker called saddam a dictator pursuing ominous nuclear and 
chemical weapons programs and said he hoped iraq was ready to 
close the book of war after its 12year conflict with iran 
surely that was in the countrys interest he said 
just as surely that remains the true interest of the people 
of iraq today baker said 
the nato foreign ministers were determined to stand by turkey if 
iraq threatens that nato ally across their shared 185mile border 
turkey which stands to lose an estimated 3 billion a year in 
commerce with iraq received through baker an offer of some 
compensation from the oilrich kuwaiti royal family that was 
overthrown in the iraqi invasion 
baker also promised the united states would back turkey in its 
request for development loans from the world bank and would provide 
credits for turkey to import industrial machinery 
there was no immediate sign at the nato headquarters thursday 
that the alliance sees an imminent threat against turkey

president bush said today hes determined to 
see economic sanctions tightened up even more against saddam 
hussein to drive iraq out of kuwait sources said the us 
deployment in saudi arabia could involve up to 250000 troops in 
the event of war 
i would advise iraqi ships not to go out with oil the 
president warned he spoke with reporters aboard air force one en 
route to his maine vacation home 
the presidents comments came a few hours after secretary of 
state james a baker iii met with nato counterparts to press for 
common action against iraq saying the world could be plunged into 
a new dark age if saddams aggression went unchecked 
asked whether he was calling for a naval blockade to enforce a 
united nations trade embargo against iraq bush replied im not 
prepared to use the word blockade but we are prepared 
the president said saddams call for an arab holy war against 
the west was the frantic ploy of a man who is isolated in world 
opinion it wont work he said 
even as he said that economic sanctions can be tightened up 
bush added the troubling thing is were up against a man known 
for his brutality and irrationality 
even as the iraqis reinforced their troop numbers in kuwait 
bush said theres no evidence right now that saddam hussein 
would be foolish enough to cross that border into saudi arabia 
as did baker bush expressed concern about the fate of americans 
and other foreigners who are not being permitted to leave iraq or 
kuwait 
and like baker he shied away from calling them hostages 
im not going to invite further harassment by elevating the 
value of any citizens were not helpless no but as weve seen 
with hostage situations and i dont think this is one sometimes 
it is very difficult said the president 
saddam said in a speech today that arabs everywhere should 
attack western forces in the persian gulf region and overthrow the 
saudi royal family 
said bush of those incendiary remarks its not unexpected he 
is so isolated in the world so much backed into a corner by world 
opinion 
bush applauded a meeting of arab leaders in egypt and said 
maybe just maybe and im not optimistic somebody can talk some 
sense into saddam 
bush said he would monitor the crisis and the continuing 
buildup of american forces from his vacation home on the maine 
coast ill be in very close touch he said baker is flying 
there on saturday to brief the president on his trip to europe this 
week 
in his news conference in brussels baker said given the 
significance of gulf oil to the world economy we all have an 
interest in thwarting iraqs menacing and unlimited ambitions 
he said the united states was very disturbed that foreign 
citizens including 3500 americans were not being allowed to 
leave iraq and kuwait but he said nothing has been asked or 
demanded for their freedom so we are not calling them hostages 
in a dramatic statement baker escalated the already high stakes 
of the middle east standoff saying its outcome would have 
worldwide ramifications and test natos clout in a time of improved 
western relations with the soviet union 
he added if might is to make right then the world will be 
plunged into a new dark age 
this is the first crisis of the post coldwar era baker 
said germany belgium and canada have indicated they soon will 
send forces to confront iraq baker said fresh deployments would 
be a major boost to the bush administrations efforts for a 
multinational deterrent force 
still no major arab powers have committed to the saudi defense 
effort baker said nato had no military role in the middle east 
unless iraq was to go into turkey 
bakers diplomatic efforts came as naval forces were growing in 
the waters of the middle east and white house officials suggesting 
that an international naval blockade against iraqi commerce was 
possible plans are being made for a blockade fitzwater said 
so that one could be imposed swiftly if ordered by president bush 
bush under terms of the war powers act today officially 
informed congress of the saudi military deployment and played down 
the possibility of war 
i do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent 
bush said in a letter to congress to the contrary it is my 
belief that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful resolution 
of the crisis 
bush said our armed forces will remain so long as their 
presence is required he said the forces are equipped for combat 
and have a defensive mission iraq bush said has an enormous 
and sophisticated war machine near kuwaits border with saudi 
arabia 
in a separate letter detailing the us sanctions against iraq 
bush told congress that iraq has has tightened its unlawful grip 
over the territory of kuwait and has installed a puppet regime that 
in no way represents the people or legitimate government of 
kuwait 
several thousand american combat troops already are on saudi 
soil supported by a powerful contingent of air and naval forces 
their mission is to defend the saudi kingdom amid hopes that 
worldwide economic pressure will force saddam to withdraw from 
neighboring kuwait 
us officials have refused to publicly reveal the scale of the 
troop deployment codenamed desert shield and aimed at 
forestalling an iraqi invasion of the saudi kingdom the worlds 
largest oil exporter 
but several pentagon and administration sources who declined to 
be identified by name revealed planning that could involve the 
largest deployment of us ground troops since vietnam 
we have contingency plans that could result in the insertion 
of up to 200000 to 250000 ground forces before its all done 
said one source who added that the troop transfer also could be 
capped at any point 
such a deployment would take up to 60 days to complete the 
sources said a pentagon official said troops could come from units 
in colorado kansas texas georgia kentucky and north carolina 
husseins response will determine exactly how much combat 
power we put on the ground one source said 
but if deterrence fails and us forces must do battle it 
will be a highintensity war with many casualties many chemical 
casualties much equipment destroyed the official said it 
will mean warfare on a scale that we havent seen since world war 
ii 
baker arrived from turkey where he won a promise that american 
forces could use turkish military bases in the event of fighting 
with iraq 
the us troop commitment in vietnam reached 550000 at its 
peak plus additional personnel in other southeast asian countries 
the new total if deployed in saudi arabia would be a 
significant share of the approximately 940000 activeduty members 
of the army and marine corps 
at least 2300 american ground troops from the 82nd airborne 
division have landed in saudi arabia as the first wave of the 
deployment additional f15 fighters and a10 tank killer jets 
were ordered to the region two navy hospital ships the mercy and 
the comfort were being readied for deployment to the mideast 
two us aircraft carriers flanked the saudi coasts more than 
20 other warships including a third carrier and the battleship 
wisconsin will be in the mediterranean sea or nearby waters by 
next week 
earlier thursday the pentagon reported that 50000 iraqi 
soldiers were moving south inside iraq and that if they entered 
kuwait the total invasion force would number about 170000 a day 
earlier the intelligence estimates had put the iraqi force at 
100000 men

even if the americaniraqi standoff in the 
arabian desert doesnt come to a shooting war the crisis almost 
surely will give president bush new ammunition to slow congress 
assault on the defense budget 
saddam hussein for all the bad things he did may have done 
us a favor sen bob dole rkan said friday of republican 
efforts to scale back the 1991 defense spending cuts of 24 billion 
approved by the house on july 31 he sort of woke us up in 
america and woke us up in congress dole said 
others argue that while the persian gulf crisis highlights the 
need for a strong american military it also shows the need for a 
different sort of defense than the one built on fear of allout 
global combat with the soviet union 
this stresses the need in our future defense posture for 
mobility for flexible forces for ready forces just what were 
having to call on right now in saudi arabia said sen john 
glenn dohio a member of the armed services committee 
glenn speaking to reporters on wednesday acknowledged that the 
gulf crisis may help bush limit defense cuts 
bush proposed 307 billion in defense spending for the budget 
year starting oct 1 but last month said he would accept an 
additional 18 billion in cuts as proposed by the senate the two 
houses will begin negotiating a compromise defense bill when they 
return from recess in september 
the drive to cut defenses has been fueled by a perception that 
with democracy sweeping eastern europe and the cold war ending the 
world is a safer place 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait and bushs decision to dispatch 
us warplanes ships and troops to saudi arabia americas biggest 
supplier of imported oil has cast the defense budget debate in a 
different light analysts say 
it probably will mean the defense cuts will be a little bit 
less than they otherwise would be said alexis cain of the 
private defense budget project 
by triggering a substantial rise in oil prices which in turn 
makes a us economic recession more likely the middle east crisis 
also may weaken congress resolve to reduce the budget deficit 
cain said government spending helps fuel the economy thus 
pressure to cut the defense budget might ease 
bush himself has cited the iraqi invasion in arguing against 
major defense cuts 
notwithstanding the alteration in the soviet threat the world 
remains a dangerous place with serious threats to important us 
interests wholly unrelated to the earlier patterns of the 
ussoviet relationship bush said aug 2 one day after 100000 
iraqi troops swept into tiny kuwait and overthrew the government 
bush on friday exempted military personnel from the 1991 
spending cuts other agencies are preparing for in the absence of a 
budgetreduction agreement with congress his spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said clearly the situation in the persian gulf 
played a role in the presidents decision 
the iraqi threat to saudi arabia serves as a convenient 
political tool for members of congress too particularly those 
trying to protect defense installations and weapons programs that 
provide jobs in their states or districts 
rep frank pallone dnj cited the iraqi crisis in 
criticizing the army on thursday for dismissing 300 civilian 
employees at fort monmouth in new jersey 
they are cutting at the heart of our national defense in a 
time of crisis while the fat survives pallone said 
while a surge of patriotic fervor from the us standoff against 
iraq may lead to smallerthanplanned cuts in military personnel in 
1991 it is unlikely to change the debate on cutting weapons 
programs 
one of the biggest defense battles in congress this year centers 
on the b2 stealth bomber which is expected to cost 865 million a 
plane several members of the senate referred to the iraqi crisis 
during floor debate on the b2 on aug 2 the senate rejected 
efforts to kill or slow production of the bomber but advocates of 
ending the program said iraq should have played no role 
there are all kinds of weapons that we can deploy against the 
iraqis if we decide to said rep jim slattery dkan any 
suggestion that we should do the b2 because of whats going on in 
iraq and the middle east right now is just an emotional kneejerk 
reaction that lacks any basis in logic and reason

president bush has exempted military personnel 
from the spending cuts other agencies would face in the absence of 
a budgetreduction agreement with congress his spokesman said 
friday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said clearly the 
situation in the persian gulf played a role in persuading the 
bush administration to avoid cuts in military personnel at a time 
the united states is deploying forces in the middle east 
bush who wrote a formal letter authorizing the exemption 
discussed the issue with defense secretary dick cheney at a meeting 
friday fitzwater said 
if the exclusion were not in effect layoffs could affect us 
armed forces the white house office of management and budget said 
as a result of the exclusion other parts of the defense budget may 
have to absorb larger cuts 
because bush and congress have failed to agree on a budget 
deficit reduction package the administration has ordered federal 
agencies to draw up plans to cut their spending by 319 percent 
under a worstcase scenario most departments would have to 
participate in 104 billion in spending cuts during the budget year 
that begins oct 1 those cuts known in washington jargon as 
sequestration would take effect oct 15 unless congress and 
bush agree on a package of tax increases and targeted spending 
reductions 
negotiations on a package have been suspended until early next 
month however there is a general expectation that the government 
will never permit such deep spending reductions to take effect 
especially with the economy apparently falling into a recession 
even before iraqs invasion of kuwait last week negotiators had 
been planning on a deficitreduction plan of no more than about 50 
billion for 1991 
richard g darman director of the white house office of 
management and budget said in a letter to department heads that 
bush would issue the initial spendingcut order on aug 25 
darmans letter was made public today

the council of actors equity will reconsider 
its decision barring a white english actor from portraying a 
eurasian in the broadway production of the hit london musical 
miss saigon 
equity said it decided to reconsider actor jonathan pryce who 
won raves in the london show after receiving petitions signed by 
more than 100 of its members dick moore a spokesman for the 
union said friday the council will meet thursday 
the ban prompted producer cameron mackintosh to cancel the 
broadway run of miss saigon despite a record 25 million 
advance 
petitions went up backstage wednesday at a half dozen broadway 
shows including the phantom of the opera les miserables 
and cats urging equity to reverse the ban 
the council voted tuesday to bar pryce from appearing on 
broadway in the role of the engineer an amoral brothel owner the 
show is set during the last days of the vietnam war equity said it 
could not condone the casting of a caucasian in the role of an 
eurasian 
mackintosh took a hard line in canceling the show wednesday 
saying the debate is no longer about the casting of miss saigon 
but the art of acting itself newspaper ads appeared thursday 
listing a post office box where ticketholders could write for 
refunds 
some 40 members of the 79member council took part in vote said 
alan eisenberg its executive secretary the vote was reportedly 
close 
mackintosh said he would not take the case to arbitration 
however in an interview thursday with the new york times the 
producer said if there was a complete aboutface by equity 
under the pressure of their own membership which changed the 
atmosphere i would be happy to discuss the situation with 
anybody 
talk show host dick cavett a union member lambasted the 
councils bonehead decision in an editorial published in 
fridays times 
since when are the arts a democracy perhaps the only 
justifiable aristocracy on earth is that of the talented cavett 
wrote were laurence olivier alive and able to do othello on 
broadway would equity bar it on the grounds that black actors here 
are unemployed 
besides in barring pryce to protect one role the council 
eliminated 34 other roles in miss saigon that would have been 
filled by asians he said 
the union has jurisdiction over all performers appearing on 
broadway and must approve actors from foreign countries approval 
is routinely given to foreign actors of star quality 
equity certified pryce as a star in 1984 when it endorsed 
his appearance in accidential death of an anarchist the union 
said it rejected him this time solely because of his race 
we are talking here about color and this union responding to 
the wishes of its membership said colleen dewhurst the 
president of actors equity

a pocketsize computer helped a woman sharply 
reduce her obsessive habit of checking locks electrical appliances 
and other objects showing promise as a treatment for obsessive 
compulsive disorder a researcher said friday 
the woman who had undergone traditional therapies for three 
years showed improvement when she started using a laptop computer 
and again with a device about the size of a credit card when she 
had the urge to check something she logged on to the computer 
which offered encouragement 
the technology extends behavioral therapy into the home and 
elsewhere because when patients feel the urge to perform a ritual 
they need some help right there said lee baer of massachusetts 
general hospital in boston 
the computer approach has not been formally evaluated but a 
handful of cases gives hope that it may be a useful addition to 
standard treatment baer said 
as many as 5 million americans may have obsessive compulsive 
disorder it is a type of anxiety characterized by obsessions 
which are persistent unwanted thoughts or impulses and 
compulsions which are repetitive behaviors in response to the 
obsessions 
patients recognize their behavior is irrational but cannot

iraqi president saddam hussein in an outburst of fury against 
western efforts to devastate his economy and hem in his army today 
called on arabs everywhere to wage holy war against enemies of 
islam 
hours after saddams bellicose statement a majority of the arab 
league nations agreed to dispatch an arab force to defend saudi 
arabia and approved economic sanctions against iraq 
president bush said saddams call for an arab holy war was the 
frantic ploy of a man who is isolated in world opinion it 
wont work he said 
saddam had promised not to attack saudi arabia but today he 
called for the overthrow of the saudi royal family and urged 
attacks on the western powers who moved to defend saudi arabia in 
the wake of saddams invasion of kuwait 
burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders 
he said in a statement read by an announcer on iraqi radio and 
television the evil enemies will be defeated 
iraqs representatives at the arab summit denounced the measure 
calling for the dispatch of arab troops to saudi arabia conference 
sources said in arguments over the measure the iraqi and kuwaiti 
delegations engaged in a shouting match and the kuwaiti foreign 
minister collapsed the sources said 
of 20 arab league member states present 12 supported the 
sevenpoint resolution three including iraq voted against two 
abstained and three governments expressed reservations and took no 
position one member tunis was absent 
as the arab leaders debated saddam urged moslems everywhere to 
rescue the shrines of islam in saudi arabia including the holy 
city of mecca 
your brothers in iraq are determined on holy war saddam 
said in the statement read on iraqi tv o arabs o moslems o 
believers in god wherever you are this is your day to rise 
earlier today secretary of state james a baker iii warned nato 
allies that the world would be plunged into a new dark age if 
aggression like iraqs goes unpunished 
also today president bush told congress he hoped the presence 
of us military might in the persian gulf would deter another 
strike by saddam who set off the crisis with his takeover of 
kuwait on aug 2 
i do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent 
said bush who gave lawmakers formal notice of the troop deployment 
under the war powers act 
pentagon and administration sources said up to 250000 us 
ground troops could eventually be sent to defend iraqs strategic 
neighbor saudi arabia in what would be the biggest us military 
operation since the vietnam war 
washington also hinted at a possible naval blockade to choke off 
iraqs oil exports 
baghdad radio told the people of kuwait today the iraqi takeover 
had restored their genuine arab face and real freedom 
in iraq which imports 2 billion worth of food a year people 
fearing shortages as a result of the international economic embargo 
rushed to stock up on rice sugar cooking oil and other foodstuffs 
more than 3500 americans remained trapped in iraq and kuwait 
despite pressure from the united states to let them go the state 
department said the united states and several western allies have 
made joint appeals to the iraqi government to let citizens of their 
respective countries depart 
baker told reporters in brussels today the united states was 
very disturbed about the status of the stranded americans but 
he said we are not calling them hostagesnothing has been 
asked or demanded for their freedom 
iraq on thursday reportedly sent forces to the northern border 
with turkey and southward toward kuwait and saudi arabia 
world markets continued to register the tremors from baghdad 
stock prices were lower today in japan and london the dollar edged 
higher and oil prices were fairly steady as traders awaited new 
developments in the crisis 
baker told nato ministers the situation in the persian gulf was 
full of peril and called on the 15 us allies in the western 
alliance to examine how you might help enforce the boycott of 
iraq approved by the un security council 
it is not only economic progress that is threatened he told 
them if might is to make right then the world will be plunged 
into a new dark age 
at the arab summit in cairo egypts president hosni mubarak 
said time was running out for the arab world to act to resolve the 
crisis 
as kuwaits deposed emir looked on mubarak told arab leaders 
they must either persuade iraq to withdraw from kuwait or face a 
foreign intervention in which we will have no say or control 
it is an unbalanced and explosive situation which gets worse 
every day and holds within its folds huge dangers for us all the 
arab umbrella to get us out of this crisis represents a reasonable 
choice said mubarak who has emerged as the prime mover in arab 
diplomatic efforts surrounding the invasion 
but even before mubarak spoke saddams foreign minister tariq 
aziz insisted to reporters that kuwait is and will remain part 
and parcel of iraq iraq annexed the emirate wednesday a move 
that was condemned by the un security council on thursday 
saddam himself did not attend the cairo summit although the 
other arab nations were represented by kings and presidents 
the summit was to have begun thursday but was delayed by a day 
reportedly over a dispute over who would represent kuwait its 
iraqiinstalled government or the fallen monarch emir sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah 
in saudi arabia more us fighter planes arrived to bolster the 
buildup of us combat troops britain france and australia on 
thursday announced they were sending ships and planes to the gulf 
in response to us appeals for an international force to defend 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter 
a pentagon source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united states was prepared to put many divisions in saudi 
arabia 
we have contingency plans that could result in the insertion 
of up to 200000 to 250000 ground forces before its all done 
said the source who spoke on condition that further identification 
be withheld 
the us troop commitment in vietnam reached 550000 at its 
peak plus additional personnel in other southeast asian countries 
the pentagon reported that 50000 iraqi combat units were moving 
south inside iraq and that if they entered kuwait the total 
invasion force would number about 170000 only a day earlier the 
intelligence estimates had put the iraqi force at 100000 men 
besides the us ground forces powerful navy units were 
converging on the tense persian gulf area fifteen vessels the 
biggest of them the aircraft carrier uss independence were in the 
gulf or near its entrance about 20 more will be in mideast waters 
by next week including the battleship wisconsin bristling with 
cruise missiles programmed for targets in iraq 
even with so much firepower it would be extremely difficult for 
the forces in saudi arabia to rid kuwait of its iraqi invaders who 
are part of saddams millionman army 
iraq invaded after saddam complained that kuwaiti overproduction 
of petroleum had driven down world oil prices and iraqs oil 
revenues he also rejected kuwaits demands that iraq repay an 
estimated 15 billion in loans and he reasserted longstanding 
claims on kuwaiti territory

some of the heatresistant tiles on 
the space shuttle atlantis were damaged during a thunderstorm that 
trapped the shuttle outside a hangar for several hours nasa said 
friday 
atlantis was about to be moved inside when the storm struck 
thursday afternoon preventing workers from moving the shuttle 
until three to four hours later earlier in the day atlantis had 
been moved off the launch pad for repair of a hydrogen leak and a 
newly fixed columbia was rolled out of the hangar to take its place 
workers counted about 90 cracks or chips in atlantis tiles 
apparently caused by hail said nasa spokesman bruce buckingham 
nasa workers will fill in the small dings with a silicon compound 
each orbiter has 25000 to 30000 tiles which protect the 
vehicle from the heat of reentry into the atmosphere each tile 
costs about 2000 
a lightning bolt hit the launch pad during the storm but a 
lightning rod controlled the strike and columbia was not damaged 
nasa plans to launch columbia next month carrying the astro 
observatory it has spent two months inside the hangar undergoing 
repairs for a leak in its hydrogen fuel system

manuel noriega drew up plans during the 1970s to 
sabotage the panama canal and attack us military headquarters to 
guarantee compliance with the treaty giving the waterway to panama 
according to confiscated documents 
notes by noriega on the plan portions of which are printed in 
the september issue of new yorkbased details magazine were found 
during last years us invasion the files are currently in a 
warehouse guarded by the us army in corozal panama 
the documents indicate noriega was behind a series of small 
explosions in the old uscontrolled canal zone during 1976 when 
panama was trying to hasten negotiations with the united states 
over the canal 
during the 1970s noriega was a rising officer in the panamanian 
military intelligence service panamas thenleader gen omar 
torrijos died in 1983 in a plane crash and noriega eventually took 
control of the military and de facto control of the country he was 
ousted in december after us troops invaded 
in this operation of placing the bombs i personally received 
orders from my lt col noriega said a report by an unidentified 
officer my colonel told me he wanted 14 bombs placed as a 
symbol for the 14 us military bases 
one of the bombs failed to explode and noriega was asked by the 
united states if he knew anything about the device but denied it 
the story said 
the details article was written by doug vaughan a freelance 
reporter who was hired as an investigator by michael okane a 
defense attorney for noriega codefendant daniel miranda 
miranda is out on bond on charges of helping to fly drug money 
from fort lauderdale to panama 
attorneys for noriega who is being held here on 
drugtrafficking charges since his surrender jan 4 dismissed the 
reports 
i would be very very surprised if there were any such 
document with gen noriegas signature jon may said friday i 
dont believe it but of course it has nothing to with our case 
the canal treaty was signed in 1978 but only after torrijos 
asked noriega to draw up plans to sabotage the canal and attack the 
us southern command headquarters at quarry heights 
a note in noriegas handwriting referred to a plan called 
huele a quemado smells burnt in english which called 
for a series of commando teams to attack and sabotage the targets 
when us district judge william hoeveler who is presiding over 
the case was informed last wednesday that okane had hired a 
reporter he chastised the attorney in court and ordered him to get 
approval of his investigators in the future 
prosecutors said okane violated professional ethics by allowing 
the documents under military guard to be distributed publicly 
in its article the magazine said that the plan was continually 
updated including after noriega became head of panamas military 
in 1983 
one team was to attack the lock gates another the locomotives 
that pull ships through the canal his memo showed 
a document marked secreto said mission make inoperable 
the panama canal and areas of defense of same it said 
six commandos disguised as civilians were to attack the 
underground command center at quarry heights killing a sentinel 
then igniting a fivegallon gasoline tank 
others were to hit the canal itself 
well wait until zero hour to open fire against some ship 
passing throught the locks if no ship passes we will fire on the 
control tower according to the documents

the government on friday announced it 
would free 42 antigovernment activists arrested during the 
violence in bucharest in midjune when police suppressed a 53day 
opposition demonstration 
the prosecutorgenerals office said the reason for the 
preventative measures no longer exist it did not say when the 
detainees would go free 
the decision follows the release of student leader marian 
munteanu last week after widespread student protests on his behalf 
among those already released under the announcement was nica 
leon leader of the free democrat party and one of the rallys 
organizers 
leon freed wednesday said his sevenweek detention was a 
purely political punishment resulting from his criticism of 
president ion iliescu and his ruling national salvation front 
the detentions drew criticism at home and abroad western 
countries curtailed aid to romania after thousands of miners 
summoned by iliescu terrorized the capital beating and detaining 
presumed opponents at will 
leon 25 also said he would now try to unite all the opposition 
parties to counter iliescu iliescu a former senior communist 
party official took over in the december revolution that toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
leon described his detention as miserable and inhuman he 
said he was denied access to newspapers other than those which 
speak for the government and even out of these some articles were 
cut out 
although leons party controls only two seats in parliament he 
has been one of the governments most strident critics he was a 
leader of the 53day antigovernment rally broken up by police june 
13 
later that day demonstrators attacked police headquarters with 
firebombs prompting iliescu to summon the miners six people were 
killed in violence june 1315 according to authorities 
leon said he was beaten june 14 in front of his downtown party 
headquarters by the miners he was arrested that day on charges of 
inciting violence 
he said the military prosecution that took over his case 
saturday freed him after witnesses testified they had never seen 
me before and were forced to testify against me by civilian 
prosecutors 
prosecutors announced in june that 89 opposition activists 
arrested then would be tried since then however munteanu leon 
and several others were released without further word of legal 
action 
leon said he plans to work toward uniting the major opposition 
parties the national liberal and national peasant into an 
efficient opposition force 
the opposition parties control about a third of the twochamber 
parliament elected may 20 and dominated by iliescus party the 
opposition protesters had demanded that former communists such as 
iliescu be banned from politics for 10 years

president bush pointed friday to very 
disturbing reports of mideast violence against westerners as 
secretary of state james a baker iii accused iraq of violating 
all international norms by refusing to allow 3500 americans to 
leave iraq and kuwait 
meanwhile the state department warned all overseas diplomatic 
posts that the middle east tensions could produce terrorist 
incidents against american interests abroad it urged all posts to 
take appropriate security precautions 
the statement blamed the iraqi invasion of kuwait for the 
increased risk to americans but iraqi leader saddam hussein said 
in a fiery speech that the united states was to blame for the 
regions troubles 
as baker spoke in brussels and bush talked with reporters on the 
flight to his maine vacation home there was concern that americans 
stranded in iraq and kuwait could increasingly become part of 
saddams political calculations as he seeks a way out of his 
growing international isolation 
in addition there have been reports of rapes and other assaults 
against foreigners in kuwait by iraqi occupation forces 
iraqi officials have told the united states that only diplomats 
will be allowed to depart leaving the 3000 americans in kuwait 
and 580 in iraq with an uncertain fate 
iraq has said all borders and airports are closed but state 
department deputy spokesman richard boucher noted that large 
numbers of nonwesterners mostly arabs living in iraq have been 
allowed to leave 
the practice and the policy are different boucher said 
baker speaking to reporters at the end of a brief trip to 
europe said he was very disturbed about the restrictions on 
americans and other westerners in iraq and kuwait 
he said the term hostages is not being used to describe the 
americans in the two countries one reason he said is that 
discussions are going on with iraqi authorities for their release 
in the administrations view that distinction is important 
because the us government does not negotiate with hostagetakers 
bush too made a point of not calling the americans in the two 
countries hostages saying im not going to invite further 
harassment by elevating the value of any citizen 
asked if the united states were helpless in the situation he 
replied were not helpless no but as weve seen with hostage 
situations and i dont think this is one sometimes its very 
difficult 
another official said that if the government calls the americans 
hostages that would make it more difficult for saddam to release 
them unconditionally normally a hostage is a person who is kept 
prisoner until certain conditions are met 
so far as is known iraq has imposed no conditions for the 
release of the americans baker said they are not being mistreated 
to the best of his knowledge 
but saddam who was moving troops south to add to his invasion 
forces was far from conciliatory on friday 
burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders 
he said in a statement read by a spokesman the evil enemies will 
be defeated 
boucher said us diplomats have been in regular contact with 
iraqi authorities about the fate of the americans he said there 
was no change in the iraqi position 
most of the us concern focuses on 38 americans confined under 
armed guard to the hotel rashid in baghdad they have access to 
american consular officers and to the hotel facilities but are not 
free to leave the grounds 
in warning of a possible terrorist strike against american 
interests boucher said there was no specific information 
suggesting such an incident might take place 
if specific credible information on a threat to the public is 
received the department of state will provide information for 
travelers and other concerned parties boucher said

the american red cross brought its local blood 
services programs under national control friday announcing dozens 
of new positions and tighter supervision that it said would help 
assure a safe blood supply 
red cross chairman george f moody called the changes a 
milestone and said they were prompted by searing 
selfexamination as well as months of scrutiny by the press and 
the food and drug administration 
they symbolize a recommitment to our goal of ensuring that the 
american people can count on a blood supply that is safe and 
adequate to meet their needs he said 
fda inspectors have found several problems in the red cross 
system of reporting investigating and following up on accidents 
and errors that occur in the course of collecting and distributing 
blood 
one of the inspectors mary carden said at a congressional 
hearing last month that the national headquarters sometimes took 
months to review reports of aids cases associated with transfusions 
of blood collected by red cross centers 
stephen richards newly named executive vice president of the 
red cross on friday acknowledged procedural and recordkeeping 
problems but he added that we have not seen any evidence of 
contaminated blood being transfused into a patient as a 
result of those problems 
moody attributed some of the problems cited by the fda to a 
tremendous backlog of reports which he said is almost resolved he 
said the steps announced friday are meant to address both the fda 
criticisms and the shortcomings that came to light in an internal 
red cross study 
under the groups restructuring plan each region will get a new 
principal officer appointed and paid for by the national 
headquarters the officers will report directly to a new senior 
vice president for blood services dr jeffrey mccullough of st 
paul 
previously regional blood services directors had reported to 
their local chapters but moody said the increasingly complex 
business of blood services including relatively new tests for aids 
and hepatitis made it necessary to centralize supervision 
we have had to clarify the reporting relationship and the line 
of authority moody said 
the red cross also said it is doubling from eight to 16 the 
number of people responsible for evaluating the blood services 
offered by local chapters and following up on their accident and 
error reports 
and moody said the organization is nearly tripling its 
regulatory affairs unit in washington from five to 14 people to 
better comply with fda regulations 
the 54 red cross blood regions supply blood to more than half 
the hospitals in the country the organizations 500 million blood 
bank network is the largest in the nation 
brad stone an fda spokesman said the agency believes the new 
red cross moves will help standardize procedures and eliminate 
communications problems among the central and regional offices 
we feel that the steps theyve outlined today are a very 
significant movement toward improving the overall efficacy and 
safety of their system stone said 
fda investigators inspecting the groups national headquarters 
in washington found that for years various red cross regional 
offices had not consistently reported accidents and errors and 
even when regions did make such reports the headquarters staff did 
not always review or follow up on them 
rep john dingell who held last months hearing said the fda 
found some red cross blood centers had released infected blood 
mixed up records or violated aids testing procedures 
dingell a michigan democrat and chairman of the house energy 
and commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee said the 
organization has had serious and persistent problems with its 
procedures for testing and keeping track of this blood 
carden said she found that fdas own regulations had been 
violated she said the headquarters staff had failed at times to 
file reports on cases in which donors tested positive for hepatitis 
or were at risk for contracting the aids virus such notification 
is required even if the blood is discarded

in the killings of people who tried to flee the country 
honecker and erich mielke head of east germanys oncefeared 
secret police agency were interrogated by federal prosecutors 
said peter przybylski a justice ministry spokesman 
more than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines 
as they tried to escape from east germanys communist rule 
the government announced in june that honecker mielke and 
several border guards would be investigated on possible murder 
charges in connection with those deaths 
honecker 77 and in failing health and several other members of 
his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and 
abuse of power

the jury had appeared divided on tuesday over their apparent 
decision on one of the 10 cocaine possession charges barry faces 
after sending a note to jackson telling him they had reached a 
verdict on one count the panel balked at revealing their decision 
when they entered the courtroom 
the new note came as deliberations in barrys case resumed after 
a juror who had been hospitalized for stress returned to court 
jackson said thursday that juror deborah noel a diabetic was 
deeply depressed and overwrought but should be all right 
after a nights rest 
the seventh day of deliberations was cut short around noon 
thursday because noel said she didnt feel well 
noel a howard university hospital clerk was examined by her 
physician who could find nothing physically wrong with her 
the judge said but she was admitted to providence hospital 
if noel for some reason was unable to return jackson could 
order deliberations to continue with an 11member jury 
a 12member jury once was regarded to be a constitutional 
requirement in federal criminal trials but the supreme court has 
more recently made clear that the constitution does not require 12 
jurors for conviction 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three 
felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his drug involvement 
jackson assured the defense and prosecution that noel would be 
guarded by us marshals at the hospital the jury has been 
sequestered during the trial 
in a pretrial questionnaire noel said she generally favors 
police undercover operations because they help police and the 
fbi catch criminals she said she was uncertain whether barry had 
been treated fairly by the government 
one of the 10 cocaine possession charges against barry stems 
from the fbi sting operation in which the mayor was videotaped 
smoking crack cocaine in the hotel room of former model rasheeda 
moore last january 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy has said barry was entrapped 
on that charge because moore improperly lured him to the hotel room 
and talked him into smoking crack

saudi arabias ambassador friday lashed back 
at iraqs saddam hussein ridiculing his assertion that the moslem 
holy city of mecca has been defiled and calling the arab leader a 
liar 
asked whether arabs will believe saddams assertion that us 
troops in saudi arabia have captured their holy city prince bandar 
bin sultan said 
i dont think anyone will believe him there is 1000 miles 
between mecca and where the conflict is 
he added it is ironic that he pulled a page from the old 
speeches of khomeini a biting reference to the antiwestern 
rhetoric of saddams nemesis in his eightyear war with iran 
if anybody is to be blamed for bringing multinational forces 
to our region it is the government of iraq bandar said 
in a televised statement friday saddam appealed to arab 
religious pride in calling for unity against foreign intervention 
the saudis the iraqi president said are not only defying the 
arab and islamic nations they were challenging god the day 
they put mecca and the tomb of mohammed under the soil of the 
foreigner 
oh arabs oh moslems oh believers in god wherever you are 
this is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend 
mecca which is captive to the spears of the americans and the 
zionists 
the ambassador speaking during a picturetaking session with 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan also said he was certain 
that military units from other arab countries would join the 
usbritish defensive force in his country 
dole said later that bandar indicated arab countries were in a 
better position to participate once they had exhausted all 
diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in an arab summit that 
ended in cairo friday 
saudi arabia had no choice but to invite outside forces to help 
in its defense bandar said we are faced with a de facto 
superior power intent on aggression we could not rely on the 
words of the leaders of iraq because they had lied to us and the 
rest of the arab world many many times 
he noted that saddam had personally promised fellow arab leaders 
that he had no intention of attacking kuwait he broke his 
promise bandar said 
i just put it to you what does it look like what does it 
sound like this reminds me of the 1930s and we have learned from 
history 
and he dismissed saddams populist appeal to poor arabs to rise 
up against the regions wealthy royal families like his own 
saying that is a cheap shot he said saudi arabia has been 
among the worlds most generous countries in giving foreign aid 
and that saddam has thanked his country recently for its largesse

region to review opportunities and gauge the interest of polish 
authorities according to jacek czerwinski director for regional

a private farmer or state farm to grow its potatoes similarly it 
will hire a bakery to make hamburger buns to its specifications

the nato allies on friday unanimously 
approved us military action to guard the persian gulf against 
further iraqi aggression but steered clear of taking collective 
action themselves 
two of the allies canada and belgium prepared to announce 
their own contributions to the land force and sea armada organized 
by the united states in defense of saudi arabias oilfields and 
west germany sent four ships to the eastern mediterranean 
however manfred woerner the nato secretarygeneral announced 
after a fourhour closed meeting with secretary of state james a 
baker iii and 15 other western foreign ministers military action 
by nato as such is restricted to its area meaning europe 
still baker in a separate news conference said the united 
states britain and other nations that have sent forces to the 
region will have to coordinate their operations 
if there should be a naval blockade for example there will 
have to be a traffic cop baker said someone or some 
collection of countries or individuals will have to coordinate 
this that is something that is being considered and being 
discussed 
baker headed back to the united states after the meeting in 
brussels he will meet with president bush saturday at the 
presidents vacation home in kennebunkport maine to report on his 
trip which also included a stop in turkey 
woerner said the allies by full consensus had endorsed 
president bushs military moves in the persian gulf and sanctions 
against iraq approved by the un security council and they 
pledged to defend turkey if attacked by neighboring iraq turkey on 
thursday informed baker that us forces could launch attacks from 
turkish bases against iraq in the event of war 
baker said friday at nato headquarters that the allies had acted 
with unmistakable resolve and solidarity 
he noted that great britain and france already have announced 
the deployment of forces and said germany belgium and canada 
gave indications they will have announcements to make in due 
course 
later friday canadian prime minister brian mulroney said his 
nation will send three ships and 800 sailors as its contribution to 
a multinational force 
a us official traveling with baker commenting only on 
condition of anonymity said you will see other allied forces 
some of which will be on the ground in the mideast 
baker had told the foreign ministers at their closed session 
that iraqi president saddam hussein was a dictator engaged in an 
unrelenting buildup of missiles and chemical weapons far out of 
proportion to any conceivable threat 
asked at the news conference if he was calling for saddams 
overthrow baker said he was not going to suggest the united states 
was pursuing such a goal 
thats a matter for the people of iraq to determine that is 
who will constitute their leadership baker said but i am 
suggesting that the entire world community has risen up in almost 
complete unity to condemn the aggression that has taken place by 
iraq under the leadership of saddam hussein 
baker went on to condemn as beyond all international norms 
iraqs refusal to permit some 3500 americans and thousands of 
other foreigners to leave the country and iraqiheld kuwait 
the united states is very disturbed about the restrictions on 
the freedom of travel baker said 
he said most if not all foreigners are being prevented from 
leaving iraq and kuwait against their will he said 
however baker said since no demand had been made in exchange 
for their freedom we are not calling them hostages nor he 
said had they been mistreated as best we can tell 
he said diplomatic contacts were continuing in an effort to 
secure their freedom 
baker lauded spain italy and portugal for letting the united 
states use bases to support its deployment of troops to the persian 
gulf 
he pointed out that the nato charter precludes the allies as a 
group from undertaking military action in the gulf an area outside 
the alliances territory 
however woerner said it is very clear that an attack on 
turkey would be considered an attack on all nato nations he 
said we have been able to deal adequately with what nato terms 
outofarea operations such as the situation in the gulf 
woerner said nato will inform the warsaw pact nations of the 
discussions on friday in recent weeks warsaw pact nations have 
designated their ambassadors to belgium to act as diplomatic 
liaisons with the western alliance in reply to an invitation to 
do so issued at last months nato summit meeting

in the united states bush dismissed saddams statements as a 
rather frantic ploy by a leader backed into a corner 
the president sent a report to congress declaring i do not 
believe the involvement in hostilities is imminent in saudi 
arabia he later flew off to a 25day vacation at his home in 
kennebunkport maine 
before and after the nato meeting in brussels some us allies 
said their navies would supplement the dozens of american warships 
gathering in the gulf region led by three us aircraft carriers 
canada said it would send three ships france was preparing to 
expand its force to seven ships including the aircraft carrier 
clemenceau and australia said it would send naval units the 
british and soviets also have a handful of warships in or near the 
gulf 
for a third day friday the soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze conferred by telephone with baker soviet reports 
said but the kremlin says it will participate only in a blockade 
sponsored by the united nations 
an effective blockade could strangle the iraqi economy heavily 
dependent on oil exports most or all of which already have 
stopped iraqis clearly were unsettled by the prospect reports 
filtering out of the isolated nation told of panicky people 
hoarding rice cooking oil and other foodstuffs 
up to 50000 us troops are expected to pour into saudi arabia 
in the coming weeks in operation desert shield as it has been 
dubbed pentagon sources say contingency plans call for as many as 
250000 to be sent depending on whether a grave iraqi threat 
develops 
at least 2300 paratroopers of the 82nd airborne division landed 
in saudi arabia as the deployments first wave the air force was 
deploying about 140 f15s f16s and other warplanes 
many of the americans were taking up positions in saudi arabias 
far northeast near the kuwait border facing an iraqi occupation 
force in kuwait of between 130000 and 170000 men 
detailed descriptions of the operation were lacking in part 
because the pentagon did not dispatch a us news media pool along 
with the troops 
because of arab sensitivities some troop movements were being 
carried out with relative discretion a european reporter said for 
example she saw hundreds of young western men with short haircuts 
and civilian clothes clearly us troops arrive at the airport 
in the gulf emirate of bahrain on thursday

doorly zoo in omaha neb his brother macombo ii will remain at 
the columbus zoo 
the twins are the offspring of oscar and bridgette a breeding 
loan from the omaha zoo 
when officials learned that bridgette was expecting twins the 
zoos agreed to treat the ownership as if they were separate births 
under the agreement the omaha zoo would own the firstborn and 
columbus would take the second 
the zoos agreed the gorillas should remain together in their 
early years they lived here until they were 4 years old and 
visited omaha for several months each year 
while there has been some discussion that separating them could 
be traumatic zoo keepers believe it is safe

other gorillas said keeper beth armstrong but they are 
obviously very good buddies i think gorillas are really

jimmy hoffas attorney was convicted of 
federal taxevasion charges for failing to report money he made 
from a proposed movie about the former teamsters boss 
frank ragano 66 said he would appeal thursdays conviction on 
two tax evasion counts which could bring a sentence of 10 years in 
prison and 200000 in fines he was freed on bail pending 
sentencing 
ragano was convicted in us district court of failing to report 
83000 income on his 1982 tax return and 24000 in income the 
following year prosecutors said the ploy helped ragano avoid 
paying 24199 in taxes 
the money came from investors who bought shares of the profits 
ragano stood to receive from the life and death of jimmy hoffa 
ragano represented hoffa for 15 years and formed a partnership 
with a washington screenwriter to produce the movie the project 
was later sold to a production company but was never made 
ragano contends the march 1989 indictment resulted from his 
representation of hoffa and the late santo trafficante jr a 
reputed tampa crime boss ragano claimed prosecutors once offered 
to withhold the indictment if he provided information against 
trafficantes associates 
ragano was also convicted of tax fraud in 1974 and suspended by 
the florida bar for five years 
hoffa who once led the international teamsters union vanished 
15 years ago federal investigators have said he was probably

sandblasting on a bridge raised large amounts 
of lead dust that contaminated the homes of 11 families who had to 
be evacuated to hotels until their homes can be cleaned a city 
official said friday 
city health inspector jim wilson said residents near the 
sandblasting project at the shepard bridge had been exposed to the 
toxic lead dust from paint for three weeks 
the families including 15 children were moved to hotels 
thursday 
its a pain and a nightmare said guy vangelist speaking 
from a hotel where he was staying with his wife and three children 
the sandblasting was stopped one week ago after the health 
department found lead contamination levels of more than 27000 
micrograms per square foot on interior surfaces in some nearby 
homes 
levels of more than 800 micrograms per square foot on any 
surface are considered unsafe according to state public health 
department regulations 
the time needed to get test results the reluctance of some 
families to move and difficulty in finding hotels accounted for 
delays in getting the people out wilson said everything is 
being done that can be done he said 
wilson trained in lead paint inspections said lead poisoning 
can cause serious health problems especially in children 
the massachusetts bay transportation authority which hired jf 
white to sandblast the bridge said the contractor erred by not 
determining if the paint on the bridge contained lead 
jf white declined ti comment referring queries to the mbta 
however the contractor hired lead busters which specializes in 
removing lead to clean the houses jf white also paid for the 
hotel rooms 
lead busters said the homes could be habitable by next thursday 
depending on the amount of work to be done

seven months and there has been ample opportunity to discuss key 
issues said betty hudson an nbc spokeswoman the contract is 
on the table and we have no intention of modifying it 
there will be no salary increases when nbc puts the contract

a young kuwaiti who fled her country said 
friday that young men who stayed have been running an 
underground resistance to the iraqi invasion force 
the group has led kuwaiti efforts to stay away from work 
collect garbage and run food collectives said the woman on 
condition of anonymity 
they have decided that only the service utilities will go on 
working for the sake of the population and everyone is obeying but 
otherwise no one obeys orders from the iraqi forces to work said 
the young arab woman who worked in a kuwaiti bank and stole across 
the border into saudi arabia early friday 
local telephones bakers electricity water gasoline stations 
were listed among the services operating 
there was she said a secret code of how to conduct life and 
we are adhering to it everything is organized and that gives 
us strength 
the iraqis were able to coerce the asians or workers from other 
arab countries who often are too poor to think of leaving she 
said but there is no way that kuwaitis will cooperate with 
them 
the woman said they were organizing teams to collect garbage or 
to run the food cooperatives 
some of the young men had rushed to kaifan and shuwaikh where 
there were military barracks close to the borders seized arms 
stocks there and began military resistance but they were 
outmatched by the iraqis who have some 120000 soldiers and 350 
tanks inside the country 
the sporadic acts of resistance against the iraqis are still on 
a small scale but we are confident they would develop if they 
have to and many many would be volunteering from inside the 
country and from outside she said 
among acts of the developing resistance are graffiti on 
buildings saying no one but jaber she said 
jaber is the name of the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
who fled the country during the invasion 
we did not know the emir was alive until we heard his voice on 
saudi television on sunday it was like gods hand was balming us 
and the most terrific morale booster the woman said 
kuwaiti women stage demonstrations the iraqi soldiers let them 
be as long as they just chant god country the emir but once 
they start death to saddam the iraqis start firing in the air 
she said 
because many of the women are elderly some of them fainted at 
the sound of the guns in a demonstration on tuesday travelers 
reaching bahrain said 
the iraqis tried to dress like the kuwaitis fellow arabs in 
taking over key administrative jobs or running television 
programs according to the woman 
nonarab foreigners cant tell the difference but we know 
immediately from the accent and it is so depressing 
we can go on living but we just have to keep our nerves in 
the icebox she said 
the young woman her sister and a friend like many others had 
to depend on a driver who knew his way about the borders 
and make a dash for it across the desert if they saw iraqi 
soldiers approaching 
if iraqi soldiers spot someone heading for the border they 
shoot first at the tires then they stop you and come breaking up 
the car taking occupants out said mariam marzooq a bahraini 
executive for an american financial institution 
there were so many destroyed cars along the borders i dont 
know what they do with the occupants we succeeded in making it 
they said us and western embassies were harboring remaining 
foreigners or keeping close in touch ms marzooq said at least two 
americans a briton and 300 austrians remained in kuwait

a majority of arab league nations agreed 
friday to send arab troops to protect saudi arabia from iraqi 
aggression approved economic sanctions against baghdad and 
condemned the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the moves were by far the strongest arab steps against iraqi 
president saddam hussein since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraq a league member denounced the measures and vowed that 
baghdad would stand by its annexation of kuwait 
of 20 arab league member states present 12 supported the 
sevenpoint resolution libya the palestine liberation 
organization and iraq voted against the package algeria and yemen 
abstained and tunis was absent three governments jordan sudan 
and mauritania expressed reservations and took no position 
egypts representative to the united nations amr moussa told 
reporters details of the deployment of the arab force would be 
worked out in contacts coordinated by the leagues secretary 
general chadli klibi 
mufid shehab head of the international law department at cairo 
universitys faculty of law told reporters that according to the 
arab league charter the resolutions were binding only on the 
members who voted for them 
those nations include egypt and syria which have the largest 
arab armies in the middle east after iraq 
moussa said iraqs representative deputy premier taha yassin 
ramadan opposed and rejected the whole thing 
the gathering of arab presidents and kings had been hastily 
convened with the goal of finding a diplomatic solution to the 
persian gulf crisis in order to stave off foreign intervention 
the session quickly turned stormy conference sources said a 
shouting match broke out between delegations from iraq and the 
kuwait government it ousted during the heated argument the 
kuwaiti foreign minister collapsed the sources said 
the proposals endorsed by the arab leaders were drafted by arab 
league foreign ministers it was not clear whether an arab force 
would join the multinational force already deployed in saudi 
arabia though the summit resolution seemed implicitly to endorse 
the usled force 
the package is the toughest the arab leagues leaders ever 
ordered against an arab country in the organizations 45year 
history it marked a major diplomatic achievement for egypts 
president hosni mubarak who called the summit to counter saddams 
growing belligerence against his neighbors 
conference sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
that during the debate iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz spoke out 
harshly against the proposals and repeated iraqs insistence it 
would not withdraw from kuwait 
as the ministers were meeting saddam called on arabs to 
overthrow the saudi royal family and attack western powers 
including the united states that have sent forces to defend saudi 
arabia 
the troopdeployment measure cited a 1950 arab mutual defense 
pact that says an armed attack on one arab league member 
constitutes aggression against them all 
the delegates also cited the un charters authorization of 
joint military action to restore peace 
we have decided to respond to the request by saudi arabia and 
other gulf states to deploy arab forces to support the armed forces 
there to defend its lands and its regional security against any 
foreign attack the document said 
the arab leaders also supported the procedures taken by saudi 
arabia and other arab gulf countries as part of their 
legitimate right for selfdefense 
that statement was seen as an endorsement of the request for 
western military help in the face of the iraqi buildup 
the middle east news agency said the kuwaiti official who 
collapsed foreign minister sabah alahmed aljaber returned to 
the meeting later after resting at his hotel 
kuwaits ousted emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah whose 
family ruled kuwait for more than 230 years before being ousted by 
the iraqis was present for the morning session he sat two 
delegations over from the grimfaced iraqi delegation 
one of the two pool reporters allowed in the meeting hall said 
the 62yearold emir looked terribly depressed he looked as 
though he was near collapse 
before the afternoon session the emir returned to saudi arabia 
his home in exile leaving his delegation to speak for him 
as the conference opened egyptian president mubarak warned that 
unless arab states could unite to resolve the crisis foreign 
powers would act thousands of us troops have already moved into 
saudi arabia to protect the oilrich desert kingdom from iraqi 
attack 
the choice in front of us is clear mubarak said an arab 
act that will preserve higher arab interests and both iraq and 
kuwait or a foreign intervention in which we will have no say or 
control 
the arab league conference had been scheduled to begin thursday 
night but was delayed until friday reportedly because of a dispute 
over who would represent kuwait the iraqiinstalled government or 
exiled ruler 
the arab league had 22 members until may when the merger of 
north yemen and south yemen lowered membership to 21 they are 
algeria bahrain djibouti egypt iraq jordan kuwait lebanon 
libya mauritania morocco oman qatar saudi arabia somalia 
sudan syria tunisia the united arab emirates yemen and the 
palestine liberation organization now officially listed as 
palestine

a former top aide to us attorney 
general dick thornburgh was indicted friday on charges of using 
cocaine while employed by the justice department and lying to 
federal officials about his alleged drug use 
former us justice department lawyer henry barr was charged 
with one count of cocaine possession two counts of making false 
statements and one count of conspiracy 
a federal grand jury in harrisburg returned the indictment 
against barr it was the latest in a series of problems among 
longtime associates of thornburgh who followed him to the justice 
department from pennsylvania 
barr of suburban harrisburg was general counsel to thornburgh 
when he was governor of pennsylvania and later was assistant to 
thornburgh when he became attorney general in 1988 he resigned 
from the justice department in may 1989 
the indictment is the first of a public official stemming from a 
15month federal probe 
according to the indictment barr allegedly lied on a federal 
form that asked if he used or provided illegal drugs within the 
last five years and repeated the false statement in a subsequent 
interview with the fbi he is also accused of using cocaine at a 
suburban harrisburg home on april 8 1989 about a month before he 
resigned from the justice department 
the government also alleges that barr conspired with others to 
obtain possess and use cocaine and to conceal his cocaine 
involvement from outside scrutiny 
if convicted on all counts barr 47 could face up to 12 years 
in jail and fines of 510000 the false statement counts are both 
felonies 
barr could not be reached for comment friday afternoon no one 
answered the telephone at his mechanicsburg home but his lawyer 
charles f scarlata said in a statement that barr would plead 
innocent to the charges 
the decision to bring the charges is particularly egregious 
since mr barr did not seek the position but rather was asked to 
sacrifice his partnership in a large harrisburg law firm leave his 
family and go to washington dc scarlata said 
the ultimate irony here is there is not even a suggestion from 
any source that mr barr performed his duties in other than a 
thoroughly professional honest competent and loyal manner the 
statement said 
thornburgh said in a statement he had recused himself from the 
case upon learning of the allegations 
he called the indictment a personal tragedy for henry barr 
whom he described as a capable lawyer who devoted many years of 
his career to public service 
i have no knowledge of the particular circumstances of this 
case he said it is now up to the judge and jury to determine 
the facts of this case and their consequences for mr barr 
thornburgh said 
the indictment came less than two weeks after sen arlen 
specter rpa asked the justice department to appoint a special 
prosecutor in the case scarlata also called for a special 
prosecutor saying in a letter last week that he welcomed a review 
by a prosecutor whose judgments are not driven by media 
attention 
thornburgh and a number of top justice department officials had 
bowed out of the investigation as did us attorney james west 
wests chief assistant gordon ad zubrod has been assigned to 
prosecute the case 
in may thornburgh reassigned two top aides press secretary 
david runkel and his chief of staff robert s ross jr to less 
sensitive positions after it was disclosed that they had showed 
deception on fbi polygraph tests 
last month barry h stern an associate deputy attorney 
general resigned from the justice department when his temporary 
security clearance was revoked 
all three men served under thornburgh when he was governor 
stern was labor and industry secretary runkel was his press 
secretary and ross was a special assistant

summer home in kennebunkport maine

q hello mr president 
q whats your reaction to saddam hussein calling for a holy war 
a its not unexpected he is so isolated in the world so much 
backed into a corner by world opinion which is almost 100 percent 
against him that he has to find some mechanism to try to rally 
support and its it wont work and his problem is in the arab 
world in the muslim world as well as it is in the rest of the 
world so its a rather frantic ploy to try to gather some support 
but its going to be ineffective it will not work 
q mr president 
q mr president are you hearing anything out of the arab summit 
that encourages you 
a havent got any reports yet from the arab summit one way or 
another 
q mr president are you confident there are enough american 
troops already in saudi arabia to be able to withstand any sort of 
assault basically do you think american troops can would be 
able to win 
a to be able to withstand an assault on saudi arabia well i 
think 
q immediately 
a huh 
q immediately it happened 
a well theres no evidence of right now that saddam hussein 
would be foolish enough to cross that border but we have 
implemented the air power out there air forces saudi has strong 
air power some of the kuwaiti air force is there in saudi arabia 
other elements will be there we have a carrier there so i think 
there would i think that our fighting men that are on the ground 
there will be safe 
but i dont want to heighten concern because ive seen they 
have not presented me with any evidence that the troops that have 
already been moved forward are being reinforced or that they are 
preparing to move across the saudi border 
q ir because of all the number of troops that are obviously 
now leaving the united states inaudible can you give us more 
of an idea of the time inaudible and how long you think 
theyll be there the american people inaudible 
a no they havent even gotten there yet so i cant estimate 
how long itll be i might say since you mention the american 
people in asking them how long theyll you know how long they 
should be supported i am very pleased with the strong support for 
what weve done from the american people indeed from around the 
world i think its been very gratifying and i think it means that 
people understand that this aggression cannot go unchallenged 
so in terms of the numbers id prefer not to go into that i 
never believe that its good to pinpoint numbers of forces and 
thats of course the way dick cheney and general powell conducted 
themselves so i cant give you any help on that right now and 
im not going to even give you any estimates on it right now but 
it will be a substantial force and others will be coming in with 
more forces too 
q inaudible the sizable numbers of ground troops 
q inaudible all of their equipment suggests preparation for 
an extensive capability on the ground can you enlighten us is 
that your plan inaudible suggests that youre preparing for 
something other than a inaudible 
a listen id love to see the economic sanctions be so 
successful that the forces could be withdrawn but and i think 
they will be successful but i just cant my problem is i just 
cant estimate the time right now how long it will take but there 
will be substantial force there will be enough force to so that 
americans are protected from unwarranted attack and it wont be 
just us forces and saudi forces

q mr president there have been reports already of violence 
against foreigners inaudible kuwait and baghdad a woman was 
raped on a bus inaudible are you prepared to do anything to 
ensure the safety of the 3600 americans in kuwait and iraq 
a well i view that as a prime responsibility but youre 
right there have been very disturbing reports of violence against 
citizens of all of several countries and there was a report of a 
british airlines stewardess having been violated and humiliated by 
iraq soldiers and there are scattered reports but i will say that 
its not just against americans but i think all countries are 
concerned about the safety of their citizens 
and part of any planning has to be about how to protect 
citizens now we all know the difficulties of that if somebody is 
does violence like has already taken place as a matter of fact 
so it worries me because i do view it as a prime responsibility 
but i would say you know im not going to go beyond that and im 
not going to invite further harassment by elevating the value of 
any citizen 
q you mean youre helpless 
a im not were not helpless no but as weve seen with 
hostage situations and i dont think this is one sometimes its 
very difficult 
q mr president how can you read saddams call for jihad is 
this just rhetoric or 
a yeah its rhetorical because hes backed into a corner hes 
been isolated by the rest of the world nobody supports him and 
so hes trying to rally arab support generally the problem hes 
got is most of the arab countries violently disapprove of what hes 
done but he doesnt have many options so hes resorting to 
radical rhetoric trying to mobilize opinion but the his problem 
is everybody sees through this everybody around the world will see 
through this rhetoric 
q off mike arab leaders are meeting again today in cairo 
are you frustrated that they havent moved forward as of yet and 
actually done something 
a no no i think its going well and my talks with arab 
leaders have been very supportive but theyre its the right 
thing that you have an arab meeting of this kind i salute 
president mubarak for having stayed with the idea the more such 
meetings the better maybe just maybe and im not too 
optimistic somebody can talk some sense into this man who has been 
thoroughly censured by the rest of the world 
q is there no is there no threat from you say that saddam 
is that its rhetoric 
a yeah 
q that hes using but is there no danger that that kind of 
rhetoric is likely to inflame the saudi rank and file hearing 
a no i dont see any danger 
q words like inaudible the holy places being turned 
over to foreigners 
a i dont i think its so extreme that people that are in 
saudi arabia loyal to the king theyre not going to theyre 
not going to rise up when a cornered radical tries to mobilize 
support when he has none i mean people see this so clearly that i 
wouldnt worry about that 
q mr president speaking of the safety of americans what 
about the safety of americans outside of iraq and kuwait what are 
you being told about the possibility of terrorist attacks 
a well you always worry about that as you know ive worried 
about that for a long time long before this incident and indeed 
americans are still being held against their will probably in 
lebanon and this will continue to concern me wherever they are 
whether its in the middle east or elsewhere so i do worry about 
extremists taking extreme action 
q do you have reason to believe that is more likely now that 
saddam 
a no specific no specific reason on this case and no 
intelligence that has me alarmed but i continue to worry about it 
and we of course take the proper warning procedures in our 
various embassies but all you can do is make clear to people that 
that there are these dangers

q do you think americans need to be careful in travelling to 
others places than the middle east 
a well i think theyve always always been advised to be 
careful of travel but im not prepared to say nobody should travel 
to any place in the middle east im not prepared to say that at 
all 
q what about outside the middle east 
a id be careful wherever you go these days 
q speaking of trips did you have any concern about your own 
trip to kennebunkport that youll be able to stay on top of things 
while youre up here 
a i think were going to have a safe trip are you referring to 
the safety of the trip 
q off mike 
a no i can easily stay here we have a highly complex and 
highly efficient communications i have some of my top advisers 
here others will be coming up there from time to time i expect to 
see jim baker up there very soon and im in very close i will be 
in very close touch with pentagon officials or whoevers behind 
national security council right now itll be general scowcroft 
so im determined to that life goes on i will have a busy 
schedule busier than id like to have had of contacts in fact 
ive got a list of calls that ill be making over the next couple 
of days not all to the middle east incidentally and so itll be 
a little different than id hoped but i think im doing the right 
thing 
i think the american people want to see life go on so long as 
they understand that their president and his top officials are on 
top of a troubled situation so thats the way i looked at it and 
if i find it gets matters seem to be require my going back 
its an hour and a half to go back so i think were in pretty 
good shape on that 
q off mike 
a yeah i mean youve seen the telephone in my golf cart or 
boat word of honor well i talked you know where was it we 
talked to where was it when we were out in the fidelity last time 
staff off mike 
a no no no no well that was one yeah that was one but 
no the other day we were out in and talked overseas i believe 
it was but in any event i think its i should reassure the 
american people that the communication is extraordinarily good and 
if i found that i needed meetings with these top officials or with 
foreign officials and it would be more convenient to do it in 
washington its very easy to go back 
q any concern inaudible mr president 
a no i think the american people will support what im you 
mean on this 
q youre going youre on a vacation at the same time as 
 
a no not at all 
q thank you 
a when im going to be working normally you know what ive 
said is look if im on vacation i want to have a vacation and 
i dont want to try to kid the american people that im working 
play and play hard and then work like hell the rest of the time 
when youre in washington and i think ive done that go to work 
early in the morning go home late at night 
this one will be different because there are some tasks that i 
must undertake up here but so itll be a little itll be 
legitimately a combination of work and play but i dont want to 
deceive the american people just tell them what you think and ask 
for their support and i think people will understand that so 
thats the way thats the way i approach this 
you know what you dont want to do is appear to be held hostage

saddam hussein urged arabs on friday to 
join in a holy war to sweep from power the saudi royal family 
seize the moslem holy shrines in saudi arabia and block us 
warships sent to defend the kingdom 
saddams defiant call to take back the moslem shrines signaled 
his intentions are broader than the annexation of kuwait his 
rhetoric aimed at presenting himself as a champion of arabs and 
moslems everywhere 
by inviting us troops to protect saudi arabia the saudi 
leaders are not only defying the arab and islamic nations but 
are challenging god the day they put mecca and the tomb of mohammed 
under the grip of the foreigner saddam said in a statement read 
by a spokesman on television 
your brothers in iraq are determined on holy war without 
hesitation and without any slowing down 
we shall be victorious god willing and evil and corruption 
will be trampled wherever it is the sun will rise on the arabs and 
the moslems and god will happy after we purify our souls and land 
from the foreigners 
his mention of foreigners was a clear reference to american and 
other western forces in the region 
the statement appeared directed at arab league members meeting 
in cairo to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis caused by 
iraqs invasion aug 2 of kuwait 
saddam has been under intense economic and military presssure 
since the invasion thousands of us troops are in saudi arabia as 
part of a multinational force to defend the oilrich kingdom and a 
majority of the arab leaders voted friday to deploy arab troops to 
saudi soil they also approved economic sanctions against baghdad 
a league member 
saudi arabias ambassador in washington prince bandar bin 
sultan ridiculed saddams assertion that mecca has been defiled 
it is ironic that he pulled a page from the old speeches of 
khomeini bandar added a biting reference to the antiwestern 
rhetoric of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini saddams nemesis 
in his eightyear war with iran 
if anybody is to be blamed for bringing multinational forces 
to our region it is the government of iraq 
bandar also called saddam a liar saying he personally promised 
fellow arab leaders he had no intention of attacking kuwait 
o arabs o moslems o believers in god wherever you are this 
is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend mecca 
which is captive of the spears of the americans and the zionist 
saddam said 
this is your day to rise quickly to defend the prophet 
mohammed who carried the noble message in this noble land for 
it to remain holy 
burn the soil under their feet saddam said burn the soil 
under the feet of the aggressors and invaders who want harm for 
your families in iraq 
hit their interests wherever they are rescue holy mecca and 
rescue the grave of the prophet mohammed at medina he said 
the statement called on egyptians to bar western military fleets 
from using the suez canal he also appealed to the persian gulf 
emirates to stop american warships without specifying how 
dont let the enemy pass through the soil of egypt to use your 
waters sons of the strait of hormuz stop the fleets from moving 
sons in ras alkhaimah and sharjah saddam said referring to 
emirates in the southern gulf 
the soil of egypt was a reference to the suez canal and 
possibly to egyptian air bases that might be used by american 
forces 
addressing arabs everywhere he called for the overthrow of the 
saudi royal family 
make it clear to your rulers the emirs of oil as they serve 
the foreigner tell the traitors there is no place for them on arab 
soil after they humiliated arab honor and dignity he said 
the american forces came and saudi arabia opened its doors to 
it under the false pretext that the iraqi army will move toward 
them he said it means there are plans for aggressive 
intentions 
on the holy shrines at the saudi cities of mecca and medina 
saddam said arabs moslems believers in god wherever you are 
this is your day to jump up and defend mecca hostage of the 
americans 
the statement was read on baghdad television and monitored in 
bahrain and cyprus 
in an earlier broadcast on iraqi radio addressed to arab 
professional unions and ruling baath party members the government 
said 
every free and honorable arab is required to respond to the 
call of the arab conscience and the arab land and to choose the 
way he deems fit to strike at us interests in the arab land if 
the united states becomes bullheaded and arrogant enough to begin 
a military aggression 
we pledge to you as knights that we will make them drink 
virulent poison and will deal unprecedented blows to them so that 
the heads of the arabs will remain crowned with laurels of victory 
and glory

a high level of pesticide was found in honey eaten 
by bees that pollinate east coast crops an official of the us 
food and drug administration said friday 
federal and state officials said there was no apparent 
contamination of honey sold for human consumption 
following a complaint from beekeepers on cape cod officials of 
the state department of food and agriculture made a routine 
investigation of bee hives in rochester and middleboro on july 17 
they found 22 times the appropriate level of the pesticide 
fluvalinate in one honey sample the fda followed up with its own 
investigation 
fluvalinate legal for use in hives that do not produce honey 
for human consumption is used to kill the varroa mite which kills 
bees 
because the heavily dosed honey was not for human consumption 
no fda laws were broken said john hamilton the fdas new england 
director of compliance 
we have not instituted any nationwide testing hamilton 
said dismissing earlier reports that honey was being tested across 
the country 
hamilton noted the contaminated honey was not eaten by humans 
its the bees food 
august schumacher commissioner of food and agriculture said 
consumers were in no danger and that his agency was ensuring this 
remains the case 
these bees are not used to make honey for human food they are 
only used for pollination schumacher said 
the state agriculture officials received a complaint from 
beekeepers on cape cod that migrant beekeepers were using 
fluvalinate illegally 
the migrant beekeepers travel between the citrus orchards of 
florida to the blueberry barrens of maine their bees pollinating 
as they go 
the us environmental protection agency describes fluvalinate 
as low to moderately toxic made by the sandoz crop protection 
corp it can cause skin eye and throat irritation the epa said 
we have an ongoing investigation on the use of fluvalinate to 
make sure it is properly done and that no affected honey is sold 
to the commercial markets to the best of my knowledge this honey 
has not entered the food chain schumacher said 
as a precaution however hamilton said the fda planned to test 
honey produced by two manufacturers that used the bees from the 
contaminated hive they are mendes apiaries of punta gorda fla 
and wd fisher bee farm of mcveytown pa he said 
if that indicates a problem we will in fact expand our 
investigation he said were not aware of any contaminated 
honey thats on the market 
in the meantime he said theres no indication that consumers 
should throw out their honey

fisheries officials using small 
boats and a helicopter tried to keep dozens of stubborn pilot 
whales from returning to shore and certain death off cape 
breton friday 
several closeknit groups of about 20 whales called pods 
stayed about 1 miles off the west coast of cape breton island 
throughout the day after being coaxed back into the water thursday 
said tom kiely acting regional manager for the federal fisheries 
department 
at least two whales died thursday as fisheries officials 
tourists and residents tried to rescue dozens of whales on the 
beach near cheticamp 
rescuers doubted that the approximately 60 who lived could 
survive being stranded again because of cuts and scratches they 
suffered while thrashing around in the shallow waters 
whale expert john lien a professor of animal behavior at 
memorial university in st johns newfoundland said the whales 
may have beached themselves because they were about to die anyway 
he said it is normal for pilot whales common in the waters of 
atlantic canada to be involved in between three and five 
strandings each year 
the reasons remain unknown some believe beachings occur when a 
pod follows a sick leader ashore or when subterranean geological 
faults hamper their navigation 
pilot whales a toothed species also called blackfish are among 
the smaller members of the whale family growing up to 20 feet in 
length and weighing up to three tons

president bush declared friday that iraqs 
saddam hussein had been backed into a corner by worldwide 
outrage over his aggression with western forces gathering in the 
mideast bush warned iraq against sending out oil tankers to evade 
an economic embargo 
bush told congress he doubted outright war was imminent but he 
also said us troops would stay in saudi arabia as long as needed 
to protect its huge oil reserves 
a majority of arab league nations agreed at a stormy meeting to 
dispatch troops to saudi arabia offering the arab participation 
bush has fervently sought for a multinational effort to deter iraq 
from advancing from occupied kuwait it was unclear which nations 
would participate in the deployment which the arab league 
announcement said was in response to a saudi government request 
bush kept up his verbal fire on saddam as the administration 
pressed allies for help in breaking iraqs unlawful grip on 
kuwait bush said saddam would be foolish to invade saudi 
arabia where a growing us military force was taking up defensive 
positions 
complicating all responses by the united states was the grim 
knowledge that some 3500 americans remained trapped in iraq and 
kuwait potential pawns in what saddam described friday as a holy 
war pitting the arab world against the west 
bush called saddams declaration a rather frantic ploy to try 
to gather some support among fellow arabs he is so isolated in 
the world so much backed into a corner by world opinion which is 
almost 100 percent against him that he has to try to find some 
mechanism to try to rally support it will not work everybody 
around the world will see through this rhetoric bush said 
the president commented aboard air force one as he flew to maine 
for a 25day vacation at his kennebunkport home later in the day 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we welcome the arab 
league statement as a positive and significant statement we are 
pleased with the very strong condemnation of iraqi behavior and the 
equally strong support for kuwaiti sovereignty and the return of 
the legitimate government 
as the us military forces in the mideast grew and other us 
allies pledged new support to the defense of saudi arabia bush 
indicated he was ready to act if iraq tried to evade an 
international embargo by shipping oil outside its borders 
i would advise iraqi ships not to go out with oil he said 
the pentagon detailed more units involved in the buildup but 
gave no figures figures for numbers deployed air force f16 
fighters from shaw air force base sc and c130 transports from 
pope air force base nc the navy hospital ships mercy based in 
oakland calif and comfort based in baltimore and elements of 
the 24th infantry division mechanized from fort stewart ga 
bush said economic sanctions were hurting iraq but could be 
tightened up even more 
asked if iraq appeared ready to invade saudi arabia bush said 
theres no evidence right now that saddam hussein would be 
foolish enough to cross that border but he said saddam was 
anything but predictable the troubling thing is were up against 
a man known for his brutality and irrationality bush said 
the state department said diplomatic posts around the world had 
been urged to take appropriate security precautions out of 
concern that the mideast crisis might lead to terrorist acts 
against americans elsewhere 
you could well see terrorist groups try to take advantage of 
this bush said 
secretary of state james a baker iii carried an appeal from 
bush to the nato allies urging swift and strict enforcement of 
international economic sanctions against iraq baker said the 
stakes in the standoff go far beyond the persian gulf and the oil 
that powers the industrialized world declaring that nato faced the 
first test of its clout in the post cold war era 
we all have an interest in thwarting iraqs menacing and 
unlimited ambitions baker said after a closeddoor session of 
nato foreign ministers in brussels if might is to make right 
then the world will be plunged into a new dark age 
bush headed to maine to begin a summer vacation at his oceanside 
home but not before sending two letters to congress detailing his 
response to the iraqi invasion the greatest test of his 
presidency bush also met with defense secretary dick cheney to 
discuss the costs of the military mission and the white house said 
iraqs aggression should bring a rethinking of calls for dramatic 
defense cuts 
baker was to meet with bush saturday in kennebunkport 
bush told congress that us troops would remain on arab soil 
so long as their presence is required to contribute to the 
security of the region 
sounding a hopeful note the president said i do not believe 
the involvement in hostilities is imminent to the contrary it is 
my belief that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful 
resolution to the crisis 
but baker said there were signs that iraq was moving troops near 
its border with turkey and also sending more forces into occupied 
kuwait the us deployments continued as well with more air 
ground and sea power arriving for an effort pentagon sources said 
could ultimately include 250000 ground troops if iraq took aim at 
the saudi oil fields several us commercial airlines said they 
had been asked to help shuttle troops to the middle east 
in a fiery message broadcast on iraqi television a spokesman 
for saddam called on all arabs to attack western forces in the gulf 
and overthrow the saudi monarchy 
not mentioned by the iraqi statement were americans who are not 
being allowed to leave iraq or kuwait the administration is loathe 
to call them hostages wary that doing so would complicate efforts 
to win their freedom because any release would appear to be a 
concession on iraqs part 
im not going to invite further harassment by elevating the 
value of any citizens bush said 
britain france and australia already had promised to help the 
united states mount a multinational defense of saudi arabia the 
worlds biggest oil producer canada and west germany pledged 
friday to join the effort and baker said belgium was poised to help 
as well 
the saudi defense force is designed to deter further iraqi 
aggression with hopes for an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait pinned 
on a worldwide effort to suffocate iraqs economy 
fitzwater said the sanctions appear to have all but shut down 
iraqi oil production but us officials were still talking about a 
possible naval blockade in case bush orders that all iraqi commerce 
be halted 
the presidents second letter to congress explained the need for 
the trade embargo against iraq 
the iraqi government has tightened its unlawful grip over the 
territory of kuwait and has installed a puppet regime that in no 
way represents the people or legitimate government of kuwait 
bush said 
while designed to cripple iraqs already weak economy the 
sanctions were exacting a toll in the united states as well 
fare increases imposed by some commercial airlines because of 
higher fuel costs kicked in friday with more price hikes scheduled 
to take effect next week and the labor department in releasing 
encouraging data on price inflation during june said higher energy 
costs particularly at the gas pumps likely would drive up 
inflation in subsequent reports with the economy virtually idle 
now many economists believe higher fuel prices will be enough to 
trigger a recession

a federal judge ruled friday that the us 
government illegally kidnapped a mexican doctor for trial in the 
slaying of an american drug agent and ordered his return to mexico 
us district judge edward rafeedie said the abduction at 
gunpoint of dr humberto alvarez machain in the enrique camerena 
murder case violated the governments extradition treaty with 
mexico 
the defendant is ordered discharged and the government is 
ordered to repatriate this defendant to mexico forthwith 
rafeedie ruled 
the judge also warned the us drug enforcement administration 
that such violations of another nations sovereignty will not be 
tolerated even if they are launched in the interest of stopping the 
international drug trade 
however the judge stayed execution of his order for one week 
after assistant us attorney william fahey asked for time to 
consider an appeal in light of the significance of the ruling 
the april 2 kidnapping of alvarez at his office produced 
diplomatic tensions between the two countries mexico accused the 
united states of encroaching on its sovereignty and threatened to 
cut off antidrug cooperation 
justice department officials had no immediate comment on the 
ruling 
rafeedie stressed he was not dismissing the charge against 
alvarez but merely ruling that the case could not be tried in the 
united states he noted a long line of decisions upholding 
abductions but said those cases did not involve a formal 
diplomatic protest such as mexicos over alvarez 
the judge also referred to other abductions in the camarena 
case juan ramon matta ballesteros a honduran drug kingpin was 
taken by plane from honduras rene verdugo urquidez was pushed 
through a fence at the usmexican border and grabbed by us 
agents 
mattas lawyer martin stolar has protested his abduction but 
said honduras never formally protested the violation of its 
extradition treaty he said rafeedies ruling if upheld might 
invalidate mattas conviction last month verdugo was convicted in 
a separate trial in 1988 
in 1985 camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were 
abducted tortured and killed at a ranch outside guadalajara 
the doctor was spirited out of mexico by dea operatives to face 
charges he administered drugs to revive camarena for questioning 
while he was being tortured 
the dea gave the goahead for the abduction rafeedie said 
in a 39page decision this command was approved at the highest 
levels of the dea the united states attorney generals office was 
consulted 
rafeedie said it was clear from the testimony of two dea 
operatives that the agency paid at least 20000 in rewards for the 
alvarez abduction and continued to support the abductors and their 
families to the tune of 6000 a week in living expenses 
he rejected a government contention that the dea was not 
responsible because its agents did not personally kidnap alvarez 
the united states is responsible for the actions of its paid 
agents the judge said 
he noted that mexico sent three diplomatic letters to the us 
government protesting alvarezs kidnapping as a violation of its 
sovereignty when such a protest is made and a treaty is violated 
rafeedie said the defendant must be returned 
alvarezs lawyer robert steinberg said he felt the judges 
ruling was a warning to the dea to stop kidnapping suspects from 
mexico he said he believed the judges ruling would be appealed 
and might go as high as the us supreme court 
my fear is theyre going to take these appeals for years while 
he alvarez rots in jail he said 
although the government suggested a bail hearing for the doctor 
steinberg said the defendant has no property to post as collateral 
and probably would not win release because of fears that he would 
flee to mexico 
alvarez who was wearing a blue jail jump suit displayed no 
emotion when he heard the ruling 
asked for his clients reaction steinberg said hes numb 
the defense lawyer denied alvarez had any involvement with the 
drug trade in mexico although he acknowledged the defendant knew 
drug traffickers and was the doctor for the family of drug kingpin 
rafael caro quintero 
this man is incapable of a violent act said steinberg 
hes a jolly buffoon who liked to hang around with the big guys 
it was an honor to be invited to caro quinteros rancho 
he enjoyed being important and being invited to the house but 
half the state did including the governor of jalisco he said 
jalisco is the mexican state that includes the city of guadalajara 
he said alvarez had been the personal physician to caros 
grandfather and father 
the us justice department said earlier it was pressing its 
investigation into the murders of camarena and avelar four men 
were recently convicted in los angeles three others were convicted 
in 1988 on charges of involvement in the murder more than two 
dozen people have been convicted in mexico

looting broke out in dozens of poor 
neighborhoods friday in an angry reaction to president alberto 
fujimoris harsh austerity program 
in the villa el salvador shantytown soldiers fired over the 
heads of a stonethrowing mob of 2000 that gathered in front of 
the local market demanding that it open 
police used tear gas and clubs to control about 3000 peruvians 
in limas atevitarte section the people had been waiting for up 
to two days for subsidized sugar but the supply ran out friday 
looting began immediately after the government announced an 
extreme economic austerity program wednesday night gasoline prices 
jumped from seven cents to more than 2 the cost of many basic 
foods tripled or quadrupled 
telephone water and electricity rates will rise as will taxes 
on the rich lower import duties and a freefloating dollar are in 
store 
the program aims to slash perus 3000 percent annual inflation 
rate by eliminating subsidies the subsidies are largely 
responsible for perus huge fiscal deficit which in turn spurs the 
government to print money to cover costs 
fujimoris plan also is intended to reactivate an economy in 
which four of five people lack steady work 
at first the measures at first brought lima to a near halt 
most stores were closed thursday and buses did not run 
life in downtown lima and in the capitals wealthier 
neighborhoods was largely back to normal friday with stores open 
and some public transportation available restaurants were largely 
empty 
but the poor areas have been hard hit most people there buy 
food day to day few had money enough to buy the basics friday 
most markets were closed for fear of looting venders often 
charged double the prices in supermarkets in wealthier 
neighborhoods 
people blamed the government 
theyre strangling us albina urcaya said as she stood for 
the third day in the sugar line in atevitarte they pull us out 
of one crisis just to throw us into a much deeper hole 
julia pomachagua stood nearby caressing the head of her 
5yearold son he hasnt eaten breakfast or lunch 
the government has said it will give out food directly to the 
poor and subsidize their water and bus services 
but few municipal offices in lima had received any food by 
friday and most existing soup kitchens remained closed 
at least part of the anger friday turned against fujimori 
about a third of perus 22 million people live in deep poverty 
and most of these voted for fujimori largely because of his 
promise not to implement an austerity program 
we are ignorant people but when someone says he will help us 
we believe him said deli aguray near huaycan shantytowns 
shuttered market fujimori tricked us into voting for him and now 
hes abandoned us 
a man and a woman died thursday outside huaycans market shot 
by the owner of a nearby grocery who fired on an enraged crowd 
i dont know why he used his gun mrs aguray said friday 
we were just asking him to sell us whats in his store were 
hungry and we have to get food somewhere somehow

robert campeau the flamboyant canadian retailer 
whose empire foundered under the weight of debt was ousted friday 
as chairman and chief executive of his own company 
the campeau corps board made the announcement in a terse 
statement from its toronto headquarters campeau remains a director 
of the company but his future remains unclear 
campeau is an entrepreneur who went on a multibilliondollar 
spending spree for american department stores in the 1980s using 
borrowed money expanding his holdings to wellknown names ranging 
from jordan marsh to bloomingdales 
but his us retailing operations staggered under the weight of 
this debt and sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last january 
he has faced further pressure because of additional debts which 
include millions of dollars in personal loans and the declining 
value of the stock in his own company 
rumors had circulated recently that campeau was in danger of 
losing his position as chairman and was in fact under pressure to 
resign 
campeaus board appointed james d raymond a director of the 
national bank of canada and gary m goodman a top executive with 
olympia amp york developments ltd of toronto to the office of chief 
executive on an interim basis 
the board also named robert despres a canadian investor who has 
been on campeaus board since 1975 as interim chairman of the 
company 
the company said in a statement from toronto that it had begun a 
search for a permanent chairman and chief executive 
campeau corp spokesman richard w wertheim declined to comment 
on what changes the board planned for the future of the company he 
said while campeau would remain on the board other roles he may 
have in the future i cant say 
the changes are effective immediately he said the campeau 
board met in toronto in a special session following its first 
meeting july 30 
raymond 65 was appointed to campeaus board aug 1 he is a 
former president of claridge inc an investment firm connected 
with the powerful bronfman business family in canada 
goodman was elected to the board on july 30 he is a senior vice 
president of corporate development of olympia amp york in toronto 
despres has been on campeaus board since november 1975 he is 
president of drm holdings inc a canadian investment firm 
campeaus department store divisions federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp had a combined debt of 77 
billion when they sought protection from creditors six months ago 
much of the debt was in highinterest junk bonds to finance the 
purchases by robert campeau who bought allied in 1986 and 
federated in 1988 
he lost control of the retailing operations shortly after they 
filed for bankruptcy they are now run as a separate operation 
headquartered in cincinnati 
campeau corp lost 80 million in the first quarter of 1990 on 
top of 17 billion in losses in 1989 
the national bank of canada in january seized about 80 million 
canadian dollars in campeau corp stock owned by robert campeau 
after he missed payments on loans 
he had lost much of his personal fortune in a plunge in the 
companys stock but he failed to meet payments that would have 
allowed him to repurchase the shares and regain control of the 
company earlier this year 
before the bank seized his stock campeau and his family held 
539 percent olympia amp york a property development company still 
holds 118 percent and the remainder is publicly held

an african national congress 
leader went on staterun tv friday to contest winnie mandelas 
assertion that suspending guerrilla actions was merely a 
strategy and violence would continue 
walter sisulu said the ancs national executive committee 
decided that as from now the armed struggle meaning the 
shooting actually will stop it was decided as a wellconsidered 
decision not a mere strategy 
sisulu is a founder of the ancs military wing 
later however the anc issued a strong statement demanding that 
the government suspend the internal security act which allows 
suspects to be detained indefinitely in solitary confinement the 
anc said 151 of its members have been arrested recently under the 
law 
the organization said the arrests run counter to an agreement 
reached with the government tuesday when the anc suspended its 
armed struggle to make way for negotiations on the end of 
apartheid the government said it would review the internal 
security act and consider repealing some sections 
the anc asked that the law be suspended until parliament can 
repeal it 
in reply to a question from a tv reporter sisulu said no action 
would be taken against mrs mandela wife of anc deputy president 
nelson mandela for her comments on the suspension of guerrilla 
actions 
many people make mistakes and we would take no further 
step about the matter he said 
the south african broadcasting corp showed film of a speech 
mrs mandela made thursday night in durban at the relaunch of the 
anc womens league she said 
to suspend military action on the part of the anc is a 
strategy it does not mean the cessation of violence 
after the broadcast the anc issued a news release repeating 
sisulus comment 
anc leaders have previously disagreed with mrs mandela in 
particular when she gave support in a 1986 speech to use of the 
necklace method of killing blacks in the townships it involves 
placing a gasolinesoaked tire around the victims neck and 
igniting it 
the anc has called for a stop to necklacings usually 
administered in the past to blacks accused of collaborating with 
the whiteled government and which police say have caused about 400 
deaths since 1984 
the anc said then that mrs mandela held no position in the 
organization though she has claimed to have been an anc 
soldier 
in february 1989 major antiapartheid leaders in south africa 
denounced mrs mandela urged the black community to shun her and 
accused her bodyguards of waging a reign of terror in soweto a 
black township outside johannesburg 
one bodyguard jerry richardson was sentenced to death 
wednesday for murdering a 14yearold black youth leader who was 
held captive and beatn in mrs mandelas home according to court 
testimony 
mandela sisulu and other anc leaders were sentenced in 1964 to 
life in prison for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the 
government sisulu was freed last october and mandela last february

the air forces antichemical attack suits 
and gas masks are bulky and heavy and the saudi arabian heat could 
make them more uncomfortable two men who helped design the gear 
said friday 
but they said the equipment is the finest in the world and will 
provide ample protection from chemical weapons 
robert may director of the human protection systems division at 
wrightpatterson air force base outside of dayton that helped 
design the gear said it had been used in the field with simulated 
environments including hot climates in the united states 
its very good he said we believe its the best in the 
world 
its good protection said burnham foley deputy chief of 
the divisions chemical warfare defense branch but youve got to 
train harder to work in it 
a growing us military force is taking up defensive positions 
in saudi arabia to protect the oilrich kingdom from possible 
attack from iraqi troops that overran kuwait last week 
iraqs saddam hussein has an unknown quantity of deadly chemical 
weapons saddam used chemical weapons against iran during the 
countries eightyear war and against iraqs rebellious kurdish 
minority 
saddam also threatened in april to attack israel with chemical 
weapons in the event of an israeli attack 
may said the heat of saudi arabia where temperatures can soar 
to 120 degrees could make wearing the suits which he described as 
heavy and bulky more stifling 
theres no doubt that its not comfortable stuff to work in 
may said youre not going to be comfortable and its not going 
to be fun 
the equipment one for air crews and another for ground crews 
includes overgarments masks boots gloves decontamination 
devices chemical detectors and medical supplies the armys gear 
is different 
crews can temporarily remove parts of the gear then quickly put 
them back on again if an attack appears imminent foley said 
if someone is surprised and they dont have their equipment 
on it would be a problem foley said but our troops 
train in it and they typically have part of it on if theres any 
kind of alert status at all 
may said that the gear provides headtotoe protection and that 
the masks include vapor traps and charcoal filters and allow for 
insertion of drinking tubes he declined to say what specific 
chemical agents the suits will repel 
its designed to protect against the ones we believe to be a 
threat may said 
the 1925 geneva protocol forbade use of chemical weapons in 
battle more than 100 nations had signed the protocol by 1986 but 
production of chemical weapons never completely stopped

president bush needs to address the arab world 
to counter the demonizing statements of iraqi president saddam 
hussein an influential member of congress proposed friday 
right now we are abdicating the political rostrum in the arab 
world to saddam said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee in a statement he is demonizing 
us and we are not responding 
aspin said the president needs to make a televised address to 
the arab world explaining us aims in sending troops to saudi 
arabia and that saddam hussein is the enemy of the united states 
not the iraqi people 
first the arab world and especially the iraqi people and 
military need to be told that we will withdraw out troops if 
saddam is driven from power bluntly put we want to encourage 
a coup or an uprising aspin said 
second we need a way to offer a hand of friendship to the 
arab world in a concrete manner to counter what aspin called the 
disgusting lie that western countries stopped shipments of 
sensitive military technology to baghdad because it wants to deny 
arabs the fruits of science and technology 
we should consider spiking that lie by offering a generous 
program of scholarships for young arabs with scientific and 
technical skills 
the president spoke to the american people by television on 
wednesday an address that aspin found inadequate 
he never once mentioned that saddam hussein threatens our 
national security directly and that this is the reason we are 
deploying troops in saudi arabia 
instead aspin complained bush made the deployment sound like 
a goodgovernment exercise 
we arent sending an army halfway around the world to help 
some rich oil sheikh get back his throne aspin said 
aspin said he had written bush with his ideas but he did not 
release the letter

mayor marion barry was convicted friday on a 
single drug charge and acquitted on another the judge declared a 
mistrial on 12 counts including more serious perjury charges 
after jurors reported they were deadlocked 
an elated barry took what amounted to a victory lap around the 
courthouse grounds surrounded by supporters chanting four more 
years 
it was a stunning end to a sixweek trial that featured an fbi 
videotape of the mayor smoking crack cocaine in a sting operation 
asked why the jury deadlocked foreman edward p eagles said 
never forget that famous phrase in law beyond a reasonable 
doubt thats a very very tough standard to meet 
barry insisted all along that he had been singled out by 
vindictive federal prosecutors he and others argued that the 
government spent millions singling him out in part because he is 
black and the case exposed deep racial divisions in the nations 
capital 
the jury found barry guilty of charges that he possessed cocaine 
in november 1989 with longtime associate doris crenshaw crenshaw 
testified that she snorted cocaine with the mayor in her hotel room 
barry was found innocent of charges that he possessed cocaine on 
sept 7 1988 
the jury was hung on the three most serious counts felony 
charges that barry lied to a federal grand jury about his dealings 
with charles lewis a convicted cocaine dealer who was one of the 
governments chief witnesses 
it also couldnt agree on a verdict on the cocaine possession 
charge stemming from the fbi sting operation in the fbi videotape 
barry was seen smoking crack cocaine with former girlfriend 
rasheeda moore at the vista hotel on jan 18 juror johnnie mae 
hardeman said the panel deadlocked 66 on the charge arising from 
that night 
the single cocaine possession conviction carries a maximum 
penalty of one year in jail and a 100000 fine 
us attorney jay stephens said he would review the case before 
deciding whether to seek a new trial us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson scheduled a hearing sept 17 
in a statement that reflected the racial concerns raised by the 
trial benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp urged the 
government not to try barry again we hope that this brings this 
sad sad saga to an close he said 
a few hours after the verdict was rendered impromptu 
celebrations broke out in predominantly black areas of the nations 
capital a short distance from the mayors house motorists were 
honking their horns and shouting barry barry and four more 
years 
several churches opened for unscheduled services as word spread 
of the outcome of the trial 
all told barry was charged with 10 counts of cocaine 
possession three counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy to 
possess cocaine and conceal its use 
the mayor said repeatedly that he never used cocaine except for 
the night of the fbi sting last jan 18 it wasnt until closing 
arguments that barrys lawyer r kenneth mundy acknowledged that 
barry had used the drug even so mundy said the government had 
failed to prove the specifics of its case 
barry who sat stonefaced when the single guilty verdict was 
announced smiled broadly as jackson declared the mistrial he 
threw his arm around mundy in celebration 
as he left the courthouse barry was mobbed by supporters urging 
him to seek reelection barry had said that he would not run for a 
fourth term but there has been speculation in recent days that he 
would change his mind and run as an independent 
he is relieved obviously and this is his 202nd day chemical 
free his press secretary lurma rackley said barry who sought 
treatment earlier this year for what he said was addiction to 
alcohol and prescription drugs planned to make a statement 
saturday 
stephens was heckled as he defended the prosecution of the mayor 
he said that on the single conviction the jury had held mr 
barry accountable for his criminal conduct and he must now accept 
responsibility for that conduct 
the end to the trial came simply as the judge asked the jury 
whether it wanted to resume deliberations on the remaining 12 
counts after conferring in the jury room the panel said it was 
deadlocked 
i am prepared to declare a mistrial on the remaining 12 
charges jackson said 
mundy responded i move and jackson nodded in assent 
thirteen witnesses testified during the trial that they had seen 
the mayor use drugs cocaine marijuana and opium some 200 times 
mundy conceded the mayor was an occasional cocaine user but said 
the prosecution had relied on liars little lucifers to make 
its case and had failed to prove the charges 
several black leaders suggested that barry was prosecuted simply 
because he is a highprofile black politician among them was 
nation of islam minister louis farrakhan who at first was barred 
from attending the trial 
two whites sat on the 12member jury the jury foreman was a 
white man 
barry came to the city in 1965 a civil rights worker three 
years later after the assassination of the rev martin luther king 
jr the city erupted in its worst racial violence barry was often 
credited with cooling tempers in the aftermath 
many in the black community said they felt betrayed by the 
mayor who had made appearance after appearance preaching the evils 
of drugs to the citys youth 
the verdict is the culmination of a criminal investigation that 
began in december 1988 after the mayors visits to lewis hotel 
room in washington dc 
lewis testified that barry used cocaine and crack repeatedly on 
two trips to the virgin islands he said they also smoked crack in 
a washington dc hotel room and that they conspired to cover up 
their drug use when police began investigating a complaint that 
lewis had offered crack to a hotel maid 
lewis began cooperating with the government a year ago after he 
was convicted of drug charges in the virgin islands 
barrys lawyers depicted lewis as a liar who fabricated 
allegations of drug use to shorten his time in prison 
moore the governments star witness testified that she and 
barry used drugs together at least 100 times in hotels boats 
and homes around the city from 1986 to 1989 they were lovers for 
two years then simply partners in drug use she said 
the defense attacked moores credibility and motives she 
admitted that she was nearly broke and in trouble with the police 
when the fbi asked her to cooperate in the sting operation

general motors corp said a strike by parts plant 
workers angry at use of outside parts sources would halt several 
assembly lines from michigan to louisiana and by friday it had 
idled more than 10000 workers 
united auto workers officials said the strike by 2700 employees 
in flint proves the union is serious in its opposition to socalled 
outsourcing of parts and in its demand for job security in its 
national contract talks with the big three automakers 
negotiations on contracts to replace those that expire sept 14 
began last month 
workers at the ac rochester flint west plant walked out 
wednesday over complaints about being assigned more work in the 
same hours health and safety grievances and plans to transfer as 
many as 900 jobs to independent shops and other gm plants 
the plant makes about 65 percent of the fuel tanks for gm cars 
and trucks along with other parts such as doors for vans and 
grilles for vans and pickups 
to avoid storing large stocks of expensive parts gm plants rely 
on justintime delivery from parts plants like flint west so the 
effect of a strike spreads quickly 
gms pickup truck and sport utility vehicle assembly plant in 
moraine ohio ran out of fuel tanks and closed thursday idling 
about 3000 workers 
gms buickoldsmobilecadillac division said statements that its 
buick city plant in flint and its orion township plant in oakland 
county would close at midnight friday were premature 
today we realized we have enough material to operate on 
monday spokeswoman marsha mcgee said 
a first shift would run monday at both the 3000worker orion 
plant and the 2500worker buick city plant mcgee said the 
company will decide on further shifts then she said 
dave michels general manager of the gm truck amp bus group plant 
that assembles pickup trucks and sportutility vehicles in 
shreveport la said that plant worked only a few hours friday 
before running out of fuel tanks and sending its 2400 employees 
home 
the truck and bus groups pontiac west plant sent 2000 workers 
home friday afternoon when it ran out of tanks for the lightduty 
trucks assembled there gm spokesman john maciarz said 
gm president lloyd reuss said thursday the ac rochester flint 
west strike could affect six to eight assembly plants by monday 
negotations were under way 
weve been exchanging paperwork and talking said mike 
grimes uaw local 659 shop chairman we dont want any more 
people to suffer than have to we want our people back to work 
gm wouldnt comment on the implications of the strike on 
national contract talks job security is a major issue as the 
automakers seek to trim employment levels to cut their costs 
all i know is we have one local on strike and we have gm 
plants being affected gm spokesman john maciarz said 
outsourcing is a very serious national concern that has 
strong emotional appeal to gm workers said harley shaiken labor 
specialist at the university of california at san diego 
during past national negotiations union leaders have delayed 
strikes over local issues the strike at a key plant a month before 
the contract expires points out the mood of the workers shaiken 
said 
i think it sends a signal of the discontent of people being 
told that if you change and put out your quality and up your 
productivity well take care of you and then they turn around 
and keep shipping their work out said stan marshall uaw vice 
president and director of the unions chrysler department

about 100 prochoice abortion 
demonstrators carried signs chanted slogans and staged a 
diein to protest a visit friday night by supreme court justice 
sandra day oconnor 
oconnor addressed about 500 people at the annual banquet of the 
herbert hoover library association but in her 39minute speech 
oconnor did not touch upon the abortion issue 
instead she gave a long history of president hoovers three 
appointments charles evans hughes owen j roberts and benjamin 
cardozo during his term 
hoovers appointees were picked for their qualifications as 
jurists instead of their political ideology she said hoover 
believed firmly in the independence of the high court from 
governmental interference oconnor said 
the court underwent the most fundamental shift in 
constitutional jurisprudence in the courts history she said 
although oconnor wasnt in town to speak about abortion 
activists from both sides of the issue held demonstrations before 
the speech 
members of the reproductive rights coalition of iowa city and 
new wave a student group at the university of iowa heavily 
outnumbered those from the johnson county right to life group who 
showed up in support of oconnor 
the two groups yelled at each other and shoved signs in each 
others faces but no disturbances broke out 
oconnor who has said she finds abortion personally abhorrent 
has been considered a key vote on abortion in a 1989 ruling she 
joined a 54 majority giving states new power to limit abortions 
but she stopped short of providing a fifth vote to overturn the 
basic abortion rights ruling 
carrying a sign splattered with red paint that read sandra 
day go away gregory eiselein said he blamed oconnor for 
moving the supreme court more and more to the right 
it seems to me that sandra day oconnor has made her impact on 
the supreme court eiselein said shes leading the overturning 
of roe vs wade the landmark supreme court decision that 
legalized abortion 
members of the johnson county right to life countered by yelling 
baby killers and carried signs just outside the hoover 
associations banquet room at the holiday inn 
i think we need to stand up for whats right said kevin 
rocca of iowa city you cant just sit around and let a bunch of 
confused people who have their own ideas make policy for the rest 
of us 
during the diein about 20 men and women lay on the red 
bricks of the pedestrian mall outside the hotel a member of the 
new wave group parodied supreme court chief justice william 
renquist by dressing in a white wig and black robe stood over them 
and outlined their bodies with yellow chalk 
oconnors speech would focus on hoovers presidency from 1929 
to 1933 and his effect on the supreme court said tom walsh 
executive director of the library association 
the herbert hoover library is located in nearby west branch 
birthplace of the nations 31st president

an error of about one millimeter called 
astonishing by one expert for its large size has been found 
in a measuring device used to guide the manufacture of a flawed 
mirror on the hubble space telescope 
a nasa committee investigating the defect that has crippled the 
15 billion telescope announced thursday that the millimeter 
mistake was found while testing the measuring device called a null 
corrector 
the space telescope touted as an orbiting observatory that 
would be able to see objects up to 14 billion light years away was 
launched in april 
engineers discovered two months later that a mirror in the 
device had been manufactured wrong as a result the telescopes 
views of stars are blurred and of severely reduced value to 
astronomers

bankrupt savings and loans under government 
management effectively added 135 billion to the cost of the 
thrift bailout in the first three months of the year 
operating losses at the 350 failed but still open institutions 
rose 35 percent from the 1 billion in operating red ink a year 
earlier when the sampls were still managed privately the resolution 
trust corp said thursday 
however the operating losses were down 16 percent from 161 
billion in the last three months of 1989 the bailout agency said 
analysts said the operating loss increase from the first quarter 
of 1989 does not necessarily mean the insolvent thrifts are being 
managed poorly by the government

the justice departments challenge to 
georgias majority vote election runoff system ultimately could aid 
republican candidates in the south and southwest not blacks a 
political observer says 
the department sued thursday contending that georgias election 
runoff system has had a chilling effect on black political 
participation 
ten states in the south and southwest have laws requiring a 
runoff election if no candidate receives a majority of the votes in 
a general election 
the republican party can be made overnight in the south if 
that runoff law is eliminated said claiborne darden an 
atlantabased pollster that would do more for the republican 
party than republicans could do for themselves in 125 years 
without runoff elections darden said blacks would win more 
democratic primaries but they would lose general elections to gop 
candidates backed by white voters who previously supported white 
democratic candidates he said

the hopes of maverick congressional 
candidate bernard sanders are rising right along with voters anger 
at the washington insiders who brought them among other things 
the savings and loan scandal 
sanders a socialist trying to win vermonts only house seat 
says he wants to shake things up on capitol hill hes counting on 
public discontent with politicsasusual to help him get there 
the american people are totally disgusted with the performance 
of the us congress said sanders 
sanders is not the only challenger running against the 
establishment in an era of skyrocketing federal deficits ethical 
violations by politicians and public outrage over the sampl mess 
but hes been using the outsider theme longer and more 
successfully than most polls show him within striking distance of 
rep peter smith rvt who narrowly defeated sanders two years 
ago in a threeway race 
sanders portrays smith as a slave to big money noting that 
about half his campaign contributions this year have come from 
political action committees 
smith on the other hand portrays sanders as someone who is 
unable to work within the system and therefore would be 
ineffective it sure isnt anger and cynicism that will solve the 
problems in congress he said 
that debate over style has dominated the race 
although smith has received a 100 percent rating from the league 
of conservation voters for example vermont environmental activist 
cort richardson endorsed sanders he said smith is not a man who 
is really taking the initiative proposed and working for it you 
dont see the commitment there 
sanders antiestablishment message has not changed over many 
years and races from a marginal 1972 senate bid on the thirdparty 
liberty union ticket through eight years as mayor of burlington 
after a 1981 upset 
what has changed is the popularity of that message at least two 
independent polls taken in the state this summer indicate that 
sanders and smith are running a tight race for the house with 
democrat dolores sandoval lagging behind with between 1 percent and 
10 percent of the vote 
smith admitted hes battling the negatives that accompany 
incumbency this year 
i dont think theres any doubt that nationally there is 
concern about the incumbency and to an extent in vermont that is 
there people on the street say we wish we felt better about 
congress smith said but you cant separate yourself from 
congress i have to say heres what i have done since i have gone 
down there 
during his first term smith has demonstrated some spunk 
voting against the bush administration 51 percent of the time 
leading the call for an independent prosecutor to investigate the 
sampl debacle and promoting a crackdown on the sale of semiautomatic 
weapons 
but sanders is calling for more dramatic moves by vermonts lone 
representative 
among his priorities slashing defense spending by 40 billion 
annually nationalizing the health care system increasing taxes on 
the wealthy and corporations to pay for expanded human service 
education and environmental programs guaranteeing free public 
transportation and mandating trash recycling 
although smith began the campaign with a 130000 war chest 
carried over from the 1988 race the two matched fund raising 
during the most recent financial reporting period that ended june 
30 each raised almost 100000 
sanders recently became embroiled in a controversy when 
republicans noted that he had listed all campaign workers as 
consultants and therefore paid no taxes on those staffers 
certain taxes including social security were paid by the workers 
others including workers compensation and unemployment were not 
paid at all 
the gop charges hit close to the bone for sanders who has spent 
much of his political career championing workers causes and 
blasting those who fail to pay their fair share of taxes he is 
meeting with state and federal tax officials to determine if his 
bookkeeping methods are legal

its two hours before show time and 
guitarist lonnie mack is sitting at a table in his tour bus in the 
parking lot of a roadhouse 
hes smoking rollyourown cigarettes talking about 30plus 
years on the road and thinking ahead way ahead if the music world 
is lucky 
till i die he says responding to a question about how long 
he will keep touring and playing his oldtime rock n roll 
just keep on its my life i dont know that ill be out here 
running in a bus when im 80 years old or something but right now 
im thinking more of getting into a quieter situation and to think 
on writing some more 
ive been sort of letting that go downhill because we have 
been running the highways pretty good 
mack 49 was at fitzgeralds playing to celebrate the release 
of his new live album on alligator records live attack of the 
killer v it was recorded at the suburban chicago roadhouse in 
december 
it was the second night of a monthlong domestic tour that 
followed a stint in europe and would end with a short break before 
a trip to australia in august in the calm before another 
layitdown sweatitout jam it remains unclear just when mack 
will find time for quiet 
it doesnt seem to bother him however little does although 
the man whose music celebrates simplicity in theme and style has a 
world of opinions hes willing to share this rainy night 
the government im not really happy about where the 
governments at at this point 
the nations education system and in education you know 
im not a big believer in the educational system in this country 
right now or any country 
modern music particularly rap and heavy metal you know to 
me its a joke its a joke and its a bad joke its so obvious i 
mean the guys are making money at it and thats what theyre doing 
and theyre in it for the money and thats strictly what its 
about they aint in it to send anybody any good vibes 
whats remarkable here is macks frame of reference simplicity 
is the thread that stitches it together 
witness the new record which captures mack in the setting most 
familiar to him these past three decades on a roadhouse stage 
backed by bass drums and keyboard the result is a rollicking 
blend of rhythm and blues gospel and rockabilly that adds up to 
strippedbare rock n roll 
i like simplicity he said i think its the very thing 
that made rock n roll become what it was in the first place 
i mean you know be bop a lula youre my baby aint something 
you got to think a whole lot about 
a native of harrison ind mack has been in the music limelight 
on and off since his recording of chuck berrys memphis was 
released in 1963 he has moved from the stage to the corporate 
suite joining elektra records as an aampr man for a time and back 
to the stage and studio 
macks latest resurgence began in 1983 when he was persuaded by 
guitarist stevie ray vaughn to move to austin texas the two began 
jamming around town and across the country 
macks first alligator record strike like lightning in 
1985 was a critical success and helped him attract allstar guests 
such as keith richards ron wood ry cooder and vaughn on his tour 
since then macks career has been steady and busy 
but i want to try to get involved in something again that 
means something he said i mean music is about giving youre 
out trying to give people a good time you want them to enjoy 
themselves you know i mean if youre not you feel like a 
failure 
mack delivers his aphorisms in a southern indiana drawl that 
gives them more impact the underlying conviction comes partly from 
realizing that he needs to please himself first 
in the old days it used to be i was very concerned with going 
out and really pleasing the audience trying to figure out the 
audience do exactly what they wanted me to do do all their 
requests he said 
you do this you do everything but most generally you find in 
a large group that theres no way you can do that so the first 
thing youve got to do is please yourself and if you make yourself 
happy and you look happy and youre having a good time itll show 
usually 
commercial success is another question but once again mack is 
at ease 
a little more wouldnt hurt he said with a pause a 
little less i could still live with

the united states has achieved only limited 
success with coercive economic sanctions like those being used 
against iraq in part because of the difficulty in rallying the 
rest of the world behind them 
but saddam husseins invasion of kuwait may have changed the 
nature of the game 
in the week since iraqi tanks lumbered across the kuwaiti 
border the oildependent world with a rarely seen unanimity has 
cut off iraqi oil shipments barred all trade with iraq and frozen 
billions of dollars of kuwaiti assets to shield them from iraqi 
looting 
at the same time us forces are being deployed to the middle 
east to guard against an iraqi invasion of saudi arabia 
i would think that if this international lesson is taught 
well saddam hussein would act differently in the future 
president bush told a news conference last week a line has 
been drawn in the sand were getting strong support from around 
the world for what weve done 
the economic offensive against iraq has long and tangled roots 
in 432 bc the athenian leader pericles declared economic war 
against megara a rival greek city state history does not record 
the results 
but the results were clear in 1935 after the league of nations 
imposed sanctions against benito mussolinis italy for its invasion 
of abyssinia now ethiopia 
there was no deterrent effect although the action was seen by 
some as a public relations boon for participating countries 
british political leader lloyd george said cynically that the 
sanctions came too late to save abyssinia but theyre just in 
the nick of time to save the british government 
in the early 1980s a grain embargo imposed by president carter 
failed to persuade the soviet union to withdraw from afghanistan 
moscow found the grain it needed elsewhere 
american farmers complained they had been forced to suffer 
needlessly critics said the united states had aimed at the soviet 
bear and shot itself in the foot a phrase used repeatedly 
since then by congressional opponents of other attempts to impose 
sanctions 
in a 1985 study published by the institute for international 
economics gary clyde and jeffrey schott said economic sanctions 
had been used successfully only 39 times since 1914 in the 
remaining 69 cases they said the sanctions had little effect 
american attempts to use the economic weapon have most often 
failed because other countries could not be persuaded to follow the 
us lead 
john spanier professor of political science at the university 
of florida says sanctions work best when there is widespread 
agreement by many nations about the wisdom or necessity of 
employing them 
individual national sanctions are rarely effective he said 
in his book games nations play 
sanctions will inflict only temporary pain if alternative 
sources of supplies and export markets are available spanier 
said 
some examples of washingtons experience with sanctions 
in 1988 us sanctions wrecked the fragile panamanian economy 
but did not dislodge the countrys ruler gen manuel antonio 
noriega it took a us invasion to do that 
the longstanding us embargo of fidel castros cuba has done 
little to erode his hold on the country but has caused considerable 
economic difficulty 
bushs economic sanctions against china after the 1989 massacre 
in tiananmen square in beijing resulted in only token moderation in 
that nations policies some of those sanctions have been eased 
president carters decision to stop us purchases of iranian 
oil after the 1979 seizure of the us embassy in tehran gave an 
impression the administration was acting firmly in the hostage 
crisis but it was largely symbolic since the united states 
purchased little iranian oil 
on the other hand the sanctions imposed by the united states 
and other nations against south africas white minority government 
may have significantly slowed that nations rate of economic growth 
and been a potent psychological factor in persuading white leaders 
to deal with the black majority 
aside from iraq us economic sanctions still are in effect 
against south africa libya cuba vietnam north korea and 
cambodia 
before the kuwaiti invasion the bush administration had 
objected to proposals for sanctions against iraq 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for middle eastern 
affairs told the senate foreign relations committee on june 15 
that based on past experience we do not believe that legislating 
unilateral trade and economic sanctions would help us to achieve 
us goals with iraq 
he said then that there was no prospect then that other 
nations would follow the us lead 
the situation changed drastically after saddams troops headed 
into kuwait 
the united states was joined by the soviet union in a joint 
condemnation of iraq moscow cut off the flow of weapons to its 
erstwhile middle east ally iraqs other major arms suppliers 
including china said they would do the same 
the 12nation european economic community followed the united 
states in imposing stiff economic sanctions so did japan 
the united nations security council voted comprehensive and 
mandatory trade and business sanctions and directed saudi arabia 
and turkey to cut off the flow of iraqi oil through pipelines which 
cross their national territory 
british prime minister margaret thatcher conceded a naval 
blockade might be necessary to stop the export of iraqi oil by 
ship and bush dispatched air naval and ground forces to shield 
saudi arabia from possible iraqi attack 
while some questioned the longterm will of the united states 
and its allies to accept the sanctionrelated rise in oil prices 
others were optimistic that the sanctions would work 
sen richard lugar rind a former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee said iraqs wealth comes only from 
oil and it is a food dependent country that leaves it in a state 
of comparative weakness sanctions on food and oil will cause grave 
damage to the economy of iraq 
during the reagan administration after iraq had been accused of 
using poison gas against its kurdish minority the senate voted 
three times and the house twice to impose sanctions against iraq 
but the administration successfully squelched them on grounds 
that they would hurt us agricultural exports and hinder rather 
than enhance efforts to encourage hussein to show restraint 
senate foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell 
dri said the failure to send hussein a strong message against 
the use of poison gas may have encouraged him on the path that 
eventually led his tanks across the kuwaiti border

this isnt the first time americans have been 
forced to pay more for gas while us oil companies profited from 
turmoil in the middle east 
think back 17 years to the arab oil embargo of 1973 to lines 
at gas stations and rules restricting fillups to odd or even days 
the circumstances were different but the scenario was the same 
the nozzle of the gas pump was held to uncle sams head like a gun 
despite the jolt of that fivemonth embargo and a replay in 1979 
during the iranian revolution the united states is more dependent 
than ever on foreign countries for its oil habit 
this country went back to sleep on energy about 1980 now 
were in a defensive position and we dont have a game plan said 
david freeman a california utility executive and an energy adviser 
to presidents johnson and nixon 
we were led to believe by our leaders in the 1980s we could 
have a party we could go back to gas guzzling and we could 
continue the joyride freeman said to continue the joyride on 
arab oil is a risky proposition 
the 1973 action was a producer embargo the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries shut off the tap to the united states 
for its support of israel in the 1973 war with egypt 
whats going on today is a consumer embargo the united states 
wont take any oil from iraq because of its aug 2 absorption of 
kuwait so americans must either make up the difference somewhere 
else or make sacrifices 
although there is no shortage of oil in the united states or the 
world prices rose 18 cents a gallon at the pump by friday seven 
airlines also raised ticket prices to offset higher fuel costs 
reaction was as wrathful as it was in 1973 when most americans 
blamed the oil companies and the government for their plight and 
not the arabs according to the national opinion research center in 
chicago 
oil companies back then pocketed record profits while gasoline 
escalated from 39 cents a gallon to 53 cents before the embargo 
ended march 18 1974 
a more cynical view lays the fault for this countrys present 
difficulties to the economic greed of the oil industry the 
american association for the advancement of science said in a study 
at the time 
compare that to current charges of war profiteering 
the big oil companies have gone on a feeding frenzy this 
isnt panic this is greed said sen richard bryan dnev 
chairman of the senate consumer subcommittee 
theyre ripping us off said new york gov mario cuomo 
we think the oil companies carried out a preemptive strike 
not unlike saddam husseins strike into kuwait said ed 
rothschild energy policy coordinator for citizen action a 
national consumer group based in washington they raised prices 
and made an immediate windfall profit 
the oil companies contend they have acted responsibly this time 
and several have publicized price decreases following a warning by 
president bush against gouging 
bush also has appealed to americans to conserve oil to head off 
any future shortages he made no specific demands saying instead 
that americans everywhere must do their part 
his predecessors had to take much harsher action in 1973 the 
united states then as now the biggest consumer of oil in the 
world paid dearly for its insatiable oil thirst 
gas stations if they were able to stay open had twomile long 
queues of customers who sometimes waged fist fights for gas 
president nixon ordered stations closed on sunday and sales were 
rationed on oddeven days based on license plate numbers billions 
of ration coupons were printed but never used 
thermostats were ordered set at 68 degrees in the winter and 
the national speed limit was set at 55 mph to conserve 
the country went on yearround daylight savings time 
independent truckers outraged at seeing the price of diesel 
fuel double parked their rigs and halted shipments sometimes 
violently armed convoys of the national guard delivered goods and 
army helicopters patrolled some highways 
things eased when the embargo was lifted at least until 1979 
when the shah of iran was deposed and ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
turned off his countrys petroleum spigot 
gas prices skyrocketed from 69 cents to more than 1 long lines 
forced a reprise of oddeven rationing and angry truckers again 
shut down 
president carter wearing a symbolic sweater ordered 
thermostats at settings that would save energy he also installed 
solar panels on the white house roof to heat water 
then iran and iraq began pumping more oil to pay for killing 
each other a worldwide surplus grew in the early 1980s and finally 
resulted in a tumultuous price collapse four years ago when prices 
plunged from more than 30 a barrel to under 10 oil was cheap 
and the energy shortage was ancient history 
that situation more or less prevailed until recent months when 
iraq began making noises about raising oil prices to repay war 
debts then the iraqis invaded oilrich neighbor kuwait aug 2 and 
threatened saudi arabia owner of the worlds richest oil reserves 
once more american vulnerability is exposed 
a nation with 6 percent of the worlds population drinks up 27 
percent of the worlds oil half of the countrys oil consumption 
169 million barrels a day must be imported 
thats a bigger percentage of imports than 1973 when about 
onethird of the oil came from foreign sources and dreams of 
selfsufficiency disappeared like exhaust fumes 
oil is the nations top energy source oil accounts for 42 
percent of us energy needs and about 63 percent of all oil used 
goes for transportation mainly the 180 million cars trucks and 
buses on us highways 
in 1973 47 percent of the nations energy came from oil about 
53 percent went for transportation according to the department of 
energy 
some things have changed 
since 1973 the reliance on oil to make electricity has been 
halved 
the average car got 12 miles per gallon in 1973 and was half as 
efficient as foreign cars today the average is 278 mpg but the 
trend in detroit is back to luxury gasguzzlers 
utilities pitched better insulation weather stripping and more 
efficient bulbs and appliances to hold down increases in electric 
bills 
the government established a stock of 590 million gallons of oil 
called the strategic petroleum reserve which hasnt been tapped 
yet 
but 40 states have raised the speed limit to 65 mph president 
reagan removed those solar panels from the white house roof and 
even the oil interests see a disturbing trend back to old habits 
as long as the price wasnt too high and the product was 
available nobody has been thinking about it said joseph 
lastelic spokesman for the american petroleum institute 
youre not going to save your way out of it when you have lots 
of cars lots of air conditioners a high standard of living and 
all those wonderful things lastelic said people are not 
likely to give most of that up

british students learn all about florence 
nightingale the heroic nurse of the crimean battlefields but what 
of mary seacole a jamaican nurse who served with equal devotion in 
the same war 
therein lies the heart of an intellectual wrangle over how 
history should be taught in british schools 
one side says britains own history comes first the other 
believes that in what has become an ethnically diverse country 
one childs footnote is anothers historical landmark 
most students know about cecil rhodes the victorian empire 
builder who dreamed of a capetocairo railroad but how many have 
heard of king william dappa pepple bonny v of nigeria who was 
exiled with his wife annie from their realm and lived in london in 
the 19th century 
british children learn about anglosaxon settlers but the 
contribution of jewish settlers in the middle ages is often 
overlooked 
debate centers on a national core curriculum mandated by the 
education reform bill of 1988 in history as well as english math 
and sciencetechnology the reform limits local choices but does 
not do away with them 
the curriculum recommended by a history study group is the 
only one that has generated the heat rozina visram a former 
teacher said in an interview 
academics from high and mighty universities have thrown their 
hats into the ring no other document has been given such a long 
consultation 
those who approach history as a force in molding national pride 
and identity view the curriculum reform as a means of regaining the 
ground that has been slipping away since the liberal 1960s 
they want a return to teaching prime minister margaret 
thatchers great landmarks of british history the life of king 
henry viii nelsons victory at trafalgar the battle of waterloo 
the battle of britain 
opponents contend minority history must be included in a country 
whose ethnic minorities now total 26 million people 
children of the inner cities will not switch on to an 
allwhite male experience said sylvia collicott a senior 
lecturer at the north london polytechnic 
in the classroom you cant tell kids what to do they wont 
do that anymore they expect to be engaged they wont sit there 
and take that 
local schools have adapted to the cultural changes in bradford 
where 53 of the 231 schools have nonwhite majorities students 
learn a little of everything 
tonnie eckers children attend birkby school in kirkliees 
suburban bradford where just about every ethnic festival is 
celebrated 
its wonderful she said they come back and tell you the 
stories about various gods and all that sometimes their hands are 
covered for three days with mehandi patterns butterfly or flower 
designs painted in a reddish dye 
the reform does not prohibit local diversity and ethnic 
celebrations but critics say it makes so many detailed 
prescriptions of what should be in the curriculum that it leaves no 
room for ethnic studies 
robert skidelsky a historian at warwick university said 
history trains people for citizenship and it touches many raw 
nerves 
so vehemently have academics disagreed that some fear the 
government will abandon the history reforms 
skidelsky got into the debate when his son took a test that 
instructed him to imagine that you are a palestinian gunman 
attacking the israeli olympic team in munich 
the question was part of the empathy theory of teaching history 
which asks students to imagine themselves as players on the 
historical stage 
there were too many theories floating around skidelsky said 
in an interview pupils were becoming guinea pigs 
michael barber education policy director for the national union 
of teachers feels the curriculum is too detailed 
what we need at the national level is an interstate highway 
map of the country as opposed to a map of all the local state 
roads and footpaths said barber a former high school history 
teacher 
for instance the working groups says students aged 7 to 11 
should study invaders and settlers the romans anglosaxons and 
vikings in britain life in tudor and stuart times victorian 
britain ancient egypt and greece and exploration from 1450 to 
1550 
each topic is divided into four areas political economic 
technologicalscientific socialreligious and culturalaesthetic 
there are hundreds and hundreds of detailed prescriptions 
said ted wragg director of exeter universitys school of education 
he finds the proposals arbitrary as an example he said 
students aged 14 to 16 studying modern american history would be 
required to learn about president franklin d roosevelt and dr 
martin luther king jr but president john f kennedy and the civil 
rights movement would be optional 
detractors including the teachers union say less than the 
recommended 50 percent of class time should be devoted to british 
history 
mrs thatcher supports a heavy emphasis on british history and 
told the house of commons concentrating on the names of englands 
kings and queens statesmen and battles was absolutely right 
skidelsky feels the proposed curriculum benefits the majority 
some areas have got to adopt entirely unconventional methods but 
most people in britain are part of the great middle class bulge and 
go to a very standard school 
although the opposition labor party accused mrs thatcher of 
seeking to indoctrinate children with her own view of history 
skidelsky doesnt believe politics is involved 
the government has felt a responsiblity to increase its 
involvement because of testing which shows british school children 
are behind those in other countries he said

with the possibility of a strike at 
united parcel service of america inc businesses already have 
switched to other delivery services passing on higher costs and 
warning of slower shipments 
the two choices closest to the groundbased service offered by 
ups are the united states postal service and roadway package 
system inc of pittsburgh 
other companies such as tnt skypak federal express and dhl 
worldwide express are mainly airdelivery services with faster 
service but also higher prices 
beechmont press a commercial publishing company in louisville 
ky switched to rps because it was afraid its packages might get 
stuck in the ups system if a strike was called said beverly 
anderson a customer service representative 
she said beechmont was also using federal express for areas not 
serviced by rps and the added costs were being passed on to the 
consumer 
its not nearly as handy as ups anderson said ups came 
here every night and loaded up the skid and was gone and that was 
the end of it now theres a lot more planning 
lands end an inhome catalog giant based in dodgeville wis 
has given its customers one option of spending 5 more per shipment 
to have goods sent via federal express said spokeswoman charlotte 
lacomb 
lacomb said the apparel company has told customers reluctant to 
spend the extra money the 5 is in addition to a regular 350 
handling charge that their other option is to order the 
merchandise and have lands end hold it until the ups situation is 
settled 
the company already sends a small percentage of merchandise 
through the us postal service she said 
but the postal service announced in late july that it wouldnt 
be able to absorb upss business if there was a strike 
the teamsters union has threatened ups with a nationwide strike 
if a new threeyear contract is rejected by its 150000 members at 
ups teamsters officials will start counting ballots friday and an 
announcement of the outcome could take several days 
ups delivers more than 10 million packages a day 20 times more 
than the postal service 
the postal service has developed contingency plans that would 
restrict to four the number of parcels that any one customer could 
send and would require shippers of large numbers of packages to 
make reservations 
other companies are also turning to the postal service 
including ll bean inc an outdoor clothing company based in 
freeport maine and bruce medical supply a home medical supply 
company based in waltham mass 
to the extent we can were allocating more than we would 
normally to the postal service said ll bean spokesman kilton 
andrew ll bean sent 70 percent of its 113 million packages via 
ups in 1989 he said 
andrew said the company is using the postal service to deliver 
to points west of the mississippi 
richard najarian president of bruce medical supply which sends 
up to 1500 packages a day said once a ups contract is signed his 
company is likely to return to the familiar boxy brown trucks 
its really the only show in town najarian said 
spiegel inc of oak brook ill the nations largest inhome 
catalog company has been making contingency plans since the 
beginning of july spokeswoman mary dale walters said 
its the first time in a long time our system has been really 
put to the test but you cant survive in this business unless you 
have a degree of flexibility walters said 
she said spiegel which sends out 50000 packages by ups each 
day will send packages by other means and using other routes but 
declined to discuss specifics

hollis l harris the delta air lines inc 
veteran named to replace frank lorenzo as head of continental 
airlines holdings inc has a solid reputation in the industry and 
said hes looking forward to the new job 
i wanted to be the chief executive officer of a major us 
airline harris 58 said thursday as president and chief 
operating officer at delta he was no 2 to chairman and ceo ronald 
w allen 
allen is several years younger than harris so the chances of 
doing it at delta are very slim harris said 
harris spoke with lorenzo at a new york news briefing held to 
announce the change lorenzo the ceo of his airline holding 
company for nearly two decades told reporters his replacement is 
one of the most able in the business and said were very excited 
to be able to attract hollis harris 
terms of his new job werent disclosed but industry analysts 
said it was likely to be a lucrative deal that could make harris 
wealthy 
its a chance for him to maximize his financial net worth 
before he retires im sure he got an attractive stock ownership 
package said kevin c murphy an airline industry analyst with 
morgan stanley in new york 
lorenzo one of the most well known figures in the industry 
said he was getting out of the business after a stormy life at the 
center of major labor disputes at continental and eastern airlines 
harris entered deltas executive suites in 1969 as vice 
president in charge of facilities and became president in 1987 he 
started at the company in 1954 as a transportation agent in atlanta 
the decision to leave delta after 36 years was not an easy 
one harris said but he called the new position a challenge i 
cannot resist 
lorenzo praised his successor calling harris one of the 
industrys most experienced and highly regarded executives 
analyst murphy agreed i think its a real coup for 
continental he said 
its a loss for delta but delta has such capable layers of 
management that theyll be able to survive life will go on for 
delta murphy said 
delta officials said allen would assume harris duties 
harris will be entering a much more heated labor environment 
than he ever faced at delta where other than the pilots and 
dispatchers the employees are nonunion 
but rhea nicolls a spokesman for the local air line pilots 
association the union which represents delta pilots said harris 
would be a positive influence at continental 
after frank lorenzo everyone will be very happy to have 
hollis harris there nicolls said hes fair and honest and 
has always been a real gentleman

frank lorenzo parlayed his airline holding 
company into a leading force in the industry but along the way 
incurred the wrath of organized labor which vilified him as a union 
buster 
the inability of lorenzo and the unions to make peace with each 
other played an indirect but important role in his announcement 
thursday that he was exiting the airline business after more than 
two decades 
the 50yearold entrepreneur who came to symbolize a tumultuous 
decade of airline deregulation said he is selling most of his 
stake in continental airlines holdings inc to scandinavian 
airlines system the leading foreign carrier has held a small stake 
in houstonbased continental for two years 
lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive to be 
replaced by delta air lines inc president hollis l harris a 
highly respected manager lured to continental after a discreet 
search that started four months ago 
the negative publicity that came to haunt lorenzo and his 
company was an important element in his decision to get out 
lorenzo told reporters at a news briefing in new york 
its been perfectly obvious to me that i personally have 
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has 
taken in the process of making the changes that have been 
required lorenzo said 
this transaction allows me to step aside and allows the 
company to have a new management he said asked what he would do 
now lorenzo said take a little time to catch my breath i 
havent had much time to do that 
the departure of lorenzo marks the end of an era but it didnt 
end the criticism of him by organized labor 
we can all shout hallelujah said ej breen chairman of 
the eastern airlines pilots strike committee 
clearly nobody denies his genius to put deals together but 
as for his ability to operate airlines hes a complete 
failure breen said in a telephone interview from miami where 
eastern is headquartered the way ill remember him is as a 
tyrant who destroyed lives and walked away with pockets full of 
money and not a care in the world for what he has done 
others reacted with a similar mix of satisfaction and 
resentment the international association of machinists which has 
led the eastern strike from the start said he was largely 
responsible for the problems in his company 
frank lorenzo demolished eastern airlines wreaked havoc on 
thousands of workers lives and severely devalued continental 
airlines said john peterpaul iam general vice president our 
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next 
lorenzo will get nearly 30 million in severance payments and 
sale proceeds but that is only a fraction of what his airlines 
were worth years ago in better times 
from his plunge into the flying business in the 1960s the 
harvard mba helped pioneer innovations ranging from cutrate fares 
to the industrys first hostile takeover lorenzo built his holding 
company into the largest airline company in the country owning 
both continental and eastern 
in 1966 he and harvard classmate robert carney formed a 
financial advisory firm two years later they created jet capital 
corp which bought a controlling interest in texas international 
airlines in 1972 
lorenzo then 32 was the carriers youngest president 
his image as a union buster began when he fought organized labor 
at continental airlines and won 
in 1981 lorenzo merged texas international with continental 
after a bitter takeover battle two years later he put 
continental then the nations eighthlargest carrier under 
bankruptcy protection scrapped labor contracts and hired strike 
replacements at lower pay 
lorenzo subsequently acquired new york air people express and 
frontier airlines which have been merged into continental 
he didnt face another labor fight until he acquired eastern 
the unions waged a bitter strike against the carrier and made 
lorenzo the target of their hatred 
lorenzo lost control of eastern altogether in april when us 
bankruptcy judge burton lifland placed the airline in the hands of 
trustee martin shugrue texas air corp then changed its name to 
continental airlines holdings

the public outcry over alleged price gouging has 
apparently lead more big oil companies to trim or freeze thier 
gasoline prices with some cutting nearly a nickel a gallon 
others said they were holding prices steady and promised to 
abide by requests from president bush and lawmakers to practice 
restraint during the rising tensions in the persian gulf 
four big companies texaco inc bp america inc phillips 
petroleum co and conoco inc announced thursday they were 
trimming gasoline prices with cuts ranging from a penny to 4 cents 
a gallon the phillips reduction of 18 cents a gallon was the 
second cut in two days 
those announcing temporary price freezes included amoco corp 
unocal corp and getty petroleum corp 
the companies said they largely were responding to the recent 
easing of oil prices following a sharp runup after the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 but industry analysts said the 
companies also couldnt ignore the pubic outcries of price gouging 
and bushs admonition 
service station owners applauded the action and many were 
expected to eventually pass on their savings to motorists 
a random sampling shows that some already have lowered their 
prices 1 or 2 cents a gallon those that dont will at least keep 
their prices the same said joseph l koach executive director 
of the service station dealers of america in washington 
a spot check of gas stations thursday by the american automobile 
association of america said prices on average continued to increase 
nationally but at a much slower rate than in recent days it said 
the average price of selfservice unleaded regular was 1237 a 
gallon up 1 to 2 cents from wednesday 
unleaded gas has risen more than 16 cents a gallon since iraq 
invaded kuwait 
on wednesday atlantic richfield co froze its wholesale gas 
prices for a week and phillips petroleum co cut its price by 45 
cents a gallon after bush in a nationally televised speech urged 
big oil companies to show price restraint 
other big companies like exxon corp chevron corp mobil corp 
and shell oil co said they havent raised prices in recent days 
and would practice restraint in making any future price changes 
all the companies said any pricing decisions would directly reflect 
market conditions 
the oil companies have been denying allegations by consumer 
groups and politicians that theyve been using instability in the 
persian gulf as an excuse to drive up prices at the pumps 
the companies said the increases reflected a huge jump in crude 
prices on the open markets as well as the threat that oil supplies 
might be disrupted 
since the iraqi invasion of kuwait crude prices have 
increased approximately 35 percent and the openly traded market for 
gasoline supplies has jumped about 20 cents a gallon 
houstonbased shell oil co said in a statement 
although koach said many gas stations would be in a good 
position to pass on oil company rollbacks to their customers some 
experts said it may take some time for stations to actually realize 
any savings that is because gas deliveries vary from as little as 
once a week to as frequent as three times a week 
koach also indicated it might be hard for some station operators 
to lower prices now especially those who had been reluctant to 
pass on the previous price increases for fear of losing customers 
its economic suicide to bite the hand that feeds you said 
dennis decota owner of red hill union 76 station in novato 
calif about 35 miles north of san francisco 
decota said he had raised prices 11 cents a gallon since the 
iraqi invasion but more than half of that went to offset a recent 
gas tax instituted in california 
among the specific changes announced thursday 
texaco cut its gasoline price to resellers by as much as 3 
cents a gallon 
bp cut prices at its gas pumps by 3 cents per gallon 
conoco lowered by 3 to 4 cents its wholesale prices for 
gasoline and by a penny its price for diesel fuel 
getty froze gas prices for a week 
unocal froze prices until aug 16 
oil companies have been criticized frequently since gas prices 
soared from about 39 cents a gallon in 1973 to 53 cents a year 
later following the arab oil embargo prices climbed to 69 cents by 
1978 before surging above 1 when iranian supplies were cut off 
after its 1979 revolution 
more recently prices jumped after the exxon valdez spill off 
the alaska coast last year and heating oil skyrocketed during a 
severe december freeze despite allegations no profiteering or 
collusion by companies was proven 
in defending the price hikes companies have said that while it 
can take up to 90 days for crude oil to reach the united states 
from the middle east companies usually pay the market price in 
effect when it arrives at the refinery not the price when it was 
contracted for 
they also noted that large amounts of gasoline are purchased on 
often volatile spot markets

william h donaldson has a resume that seems to 
run on and on like a stock ticker tape 
the 59yearold securities industry veteran will need to call on 
his experiences on wall street in washington and in the ivy league 
as head of the nations largest stock exchange during what promises 
to be a turbulent 1990s 
donaldson a friend of president bush was named chairman and 
chief executive officer of the new york stock exchange on thursday 
taking over one of the highest profile jobs in american business at 
a time of rapid evolution 
he succeeds john j phelan jr who is stepping down at the end 
of the year after winning almost universal praise for calmly 
shepherding the big board through the nightmare of the october 1987 
market crash 
theres a whole slew of things donaldson said about his 
challenges in an interview after his appointment which was rumored 
for weeks on wall street was formally announced 
more specifically he cited the globalization of securities 
trading increased competition from overseas rapidly changing 
technology new regulations and 24hour trading which threaten to 
dramatically alter the 198yearold exchange 
all of that with a bottom line emphasis of maintaining the 
believability of the marketplace donaldson said the 
fluctuations of the last decade a lot of people dont understand 
it 
before he officially takes over jan 1 donaldson is expected to 
solicit advice and support from his many contacts already he 
appears to have broad support on wall street 
one of the important things is to earn the confidence of the 
people with whom hes dealing said james j maguire chairman of 
henderson brothers inc a top nyse floor firm i think hes very 
acceptable because of his broad experience not only in the 
securities industry but in politics and elsewhere 
hes a very conceptual guy said his former partner richard 
jenrette now chairman of equitable life assurance society of the 
united states he thinks through things quite carefully he will 
have interesting ideas and angles 
a native of buffalo donaldsons first job on wall street was at 
the old brokerage gh walker amp co run by bushs uncle herbert 
walker donaldson was a classmate of the presidents brother 
jonathan at yale university and is friends with the bush family 
friends describe donaldson as proper in the mold of wall 
streets stodgy old whiteshoe investment firms but not a 
preppy snob at all jenrette said he would be kind of an 
intellectual whiteshoe type at his news conference thursday 
donaldson appeared slightly stiff 
in 1959 just one year out of harvard business school donaldson 
and two friends founded donaldson lufkin amp jenrette he left in 
1973 after the company grew from its initial 100000 investment to 
the nations 10th largest brokerage 
donaldson served in the nixon and ford administrations first as 
an undersecretary of state to henry kissinger in 197374 before 
becoming special white house counsel to vice president nelson 
rockefeller in between he helped new york gov hugh carey a 
democrat pick a new administration 
it was just out of the blue donaldson said of the 
appoinment by kissinger i didnt know him i had never met him 
it was the last thing in the world i expected to do at that time 
but i did it 
donaldson helped rockefeller devise an extensive plan for the 
nation to utilize alternate energy sources the proposal died in 
congress when the carter administration arrived 
a yale trustee donaldson in 1975 helped found and served as 
dean of yales school of organization and management until 1980 
when he returned to wall street to open a private investment firm 
donaldson enterprises inc 
donaldson said his experience setting up the school which 
specializes in the public as well as private sector would help at 
the exchange a private institution with an awesome public 
responsibility 
donaldson becomes the fourth fulltime paid chairman of the big 
board since the job was created in 1972 he was tabbed by a 
ninemember search panel appointed after phelan in february 
announced plans to retire at the end of the year phelan 59 and 
chairman since may 1984 will remain an adviser for nyse relations 
with foreign stock exchanges

fear of rising inflation and unemployment coupled with anxiety 
over shrinking personal net worth will restrain retail sales growth 
for the rest of this year industry analysts say 
the nations major chain stores on thursday reported mixed july 
results with business at several big retailers getting a boost 
from price markdowns and other promotions to unload summer 
merchandise 
but industrywide results were unimpressive and a growing number 
of forecasters raised red flags about the outlook for the second 
half of the year a time when retailers do the bulk of their annual 
business 
the events over the past several weeks cause us to be much 
more concerned about consumer sentiment and consumers willingness 
to purchase aggressively said thomas tashjian a retail analyst 
at seidler amdec securities inc 
seidler amdec recently reduced its 1991 earnings projections for 
the retailers it follows and recommended slimmer holdings of retail 
stocks in investment portfolios 
jeffrey edelman who tracks retailers for the investment firm 
barclays de zoete wedd said this years steady erosion in consumer 
spending could worsen due to economic fallout from the middle east 
crisis 
inflation fears and weakness in the stock market have shaken 
confidence and caused consumers to reassess their financial health 
people already were feeling poorer because of the slide in real 
estate values 
i think general merchandise sales are likely to weaken through 
the end of the year edelman said 
sales growth was mixed last month specialty apparel chains 
mostly fared better than general merchandisers 
an index of 17 leading chains compiled by merrill lynch amp co 
indicated that sales at stores open at least a year rose an average 
of 57 percent in july from a year earlier little different from 
junes 58 percent yeartoyear gain 
we would characterize the july sales reports as mixed with 
some benefits from the seasonal weather said merrill lynch 
analyst jeffrey feiner moreover sales were aided by heavy 
promotion on the part of retailers to clear inventories as they 
move into the more important backtoschool selling season 
july typically is a cleanup month for retailers they clear out 
summer leftovers and start rolling out new autumn lines 
price cuts and other promotional activity may have slightly 
exceeded normal levels store operators were left with too much 
merchandise because mays poor weather discouraged shoppers and led 
to disappointments at the cash register 
several nationwide general merchandisers posted results that 
fell short of the industry average 
sears roebuck and co said its sales in the four weeks ended 
aug 4 rose 37 percent from a year earlier sales at stores open 
at least a year moved 31 percent higher 
these samestore results are widely regarded as the best 
indicator of a retailers performance tallies that include new 
stores can be inflated because business frequently is busier 
immediately after an opening than it ends up being over time 
sears the nations largest retailer in terms of sales volume 
last year has been struggling to keep ahead of its faster growing 
competitors 
the company on wednesday announced a major change in command in 
an apparent bid to salvage a merchandising strategy that analysts 
say isnt working edward a brennan chairman of the corporation 
will run the merchandise group ousting michael bozic who took 
over a new position as president 
by deposing bozic they are publicly acknowledging they are 
doing very very poorly said new yorkbased retail consultant 
kurt barnard 
secondranked retailer k mart corp reported its total july 
sales rose 121 percent over july 1989 but on a comparable store 
basis sales grew a more modest 22 percent 
walmart stores inc as usual beat its two bigger rivals 
total sales leaped 21 percent while samestore sales grew 8 percent 
in july the rapidly growing discounter is expected to challenge 
sears and k mart for the no 1 ranking in terms of nationwide 
revenue this year 
several specialty apparel retailers also outperformed the 
industry 
the gap inc for instance said its july sales jumped 36 
percent sales at stores open a year or longer rose 28 percent the 
limited inc said its total sales grew 19 percent while its 
samestore sales rose 6 percent

a strike by workers at a general motors 
corp parts plant forced a work stoppage at an assembly plant in 
ohio and could halt production in at least two other plants 
officials said 
the walkout at gms ac rochester division flint west plant came 
wednesday after negotiations with the united auto workers union on 
employee grievances about health and safety issues broke off 
the strike left the moraine ohio assembly plant without enough 
parts to continue producing pickup trucks and sport utility 
vehicles so gm was forced to idle about 3000 workers on thursday 
with no fuel tanks we cant assemble trucks said tony 
henderson vice president of the international union of electrical 
radio and machine workers local 801 which represents union 
employees at the moraine plant 
the 2800 flint workers make van doors and grilles pickup truck 
grilles and gasoline tanks 
gm spokesman tom tatham said there are more than 3400 workers 
employed at the moraine plant which had been producing 56 vehicles 
per hour 
two more plants could shut today gm spokesman john maciarz said 
maciarz said he was unable to say which plants might close next 
if the strike continues obviously we want to see this settled as 
soon as possible he said 
one of the plants fed by the striking flint facility is gms 
luxurycar orion plant in oakland county 
meanwhile bargainers from the company and united auto workers 
local 659 resumed negotiations thursday in an effort to end the 
work stoppage at the ac rochester west manufacturing plant that now 
threatens to shut as many as eight gm assembly plants 
in addition to the orion plant the pontiac east truck assembly 
plant may not be able to begin production of 1991 models next week 
as scheduled

chrysler corp plans to replace its 
dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim compact cars in about five years 
and is pushing back the introduction of a new luxury car an 
executive says 
glenn gardner chryslers general manager of new platform 
engineering said thursday that a new version of the spiritacclaim 
has a potential for more sales than a new luxury car so the 
introduction of the compact car was moved ahead of the luxury car 
originally chryslers new luxury car codenamed the lx was to 
be introduced shortly after its new midsize car the lh bowed in 
late 1992 for the 1993 model year 
gardner said the companys most pressing product priority was 
the lh in fact he said chrysler chairman lee iacocca wants the 
car out earlier 
mr iacocca said he wants six months cut from the 
introduction schedule i told him he cant have it gardner 
said hes a very persistent individual 
gardners comments came during the fourth day of a weeklong 
management conference sponsored by the university of michigan 
an lx is obviously one of those cars you have a chance to do 
or not do and not break the corporation gardner said 
obviously the lh is critical to the corporation 
wall street analysts have criticized chrysler for opting to 
build the viper lowvolume highperformance sports car when the 
company should accelerate development of the lh midsize car 
between the introduction of the lh and the spiritacclaim 
successor chrysler is expected to bring out a new subcompact car 
chrysler left the subcompact segment when it shut down a detroit 
assembly plant that built the dodge omni and plymouth horizon last 
february 
the spiritacclaim successor will be introduced sometime around 
1995 gardner said the cars originally were introduced in the 
spring of 1989 and are assembled in newark del 
chrysler is realigning its vehicle development programs about a 
year after iacocca said a billiondollar costcutting program would 
not alter newvehicle development plans 
our 15 billion fiveyear program remains intact and we dont 
comment on specific future products that are contained in that 
program chrysler spokesman tom houston said 
also at the conference ford motor co officially unveiled its 
46liter v8 engine for the 1991 lincoln town car which goes into 
production later this year 
the engine to be built at fords 780 million revamped engine 
plant in romeo mich is the first of the companys modular 
family of engines modular engines give manufacturers flexibility 
and cost reductions by creating a common basic engine structure 
with interchangeable components giving each kind of engine its own 
characteristics 
overall we estimate the new family of engines will share 
about 350 parts or about 75 percent of the engine said david f 
hagen general manager of fords engine division new v8 
variations will cost about 60 million to develop compared to about 
500 million for a typical new engine program 
he said the modular engine concept will be expanded to fords 
huge cleveland engine plant which will build a new series of v6 
engines to go into production in the mid1990s

bankrupt savings and loans under government 
management effectively added 135 billion to the cost of the 
thrift bailout in the first three months of the year 
operating losses at the 350 failed but still open institutions 
rose 35 percent from the 1 billion in operating red ink a year 
earlier when the sampls were still managed privately the resolution 
trust corp said thursday 
however the operating losses were down 16 percent from 161 
billion in the last three months of 1989 the bailout agency said 
analysts said the operating loss increase from the first quarter 
of 1989 does not necessarily mean the insolvent thrifts are being 
managed poorly by the government 
it may indicate the institutions are worse run or it may just 
indicate theyve had another year to deteriorate also 
interest rates have shifted making it more difficult to earn 
profits said martin regalia an economist with the national 
council of savings institutions 
the figures however underscore the need to close the thrifts 
quickly even when it must keep and warehouse the sampls inherited 
real estate sour loans and other assets regalia said 
the rtc noted that 443 million of the 135 million operating 
loss occurred in 155 institutions that in the following quarter 
were either closed or sold to new investors 
keeping these institutions open doesnt seem to help them 
regalia said it would be nice if you could say we closed them 
all down but thats what the rtc is trying to do 
the agency announced plans recently to close or sell 130 more 
failed thrifts in the second half of 1990 but unless congress 
provides more bailout funds as requested by the bush 
administration the rtc would have to drastically slow its 
operations after september and fall short of the goal 
at the same time additional sampls are failing 66 since march 
31 in the next two years the agency could end up taking over 230 
to 550 more insolvent thrifts 
total losses for the failed thrifts in the first quarter of 1990 
were 314 billion up from 267 billion a year earlier and down 
from 639 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989 
but analysts said comparing those figures are less meaningful 
because they largely reflect nonoperating losses that are booked 
when regulators force institutions to account for past mistakes and 
longdelinquent loans 
total losses are largely the accumulated losses that occurred 
two three four five years ago and are finally being 
recognized said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va 
operating losses are the cost of carrying these institutions 
its an unavoidable cost until we get rid of these turkeys 
ely said 
the rtcs firstquarter report was released two weeks after the 
office of thrif supervision said the 2505 sampls under private 
management at the end of march lost 271 million 
thus losses for the entire industry totaled 341 billion in 
the first quarter down from 36 billion a year ago and 95 
billion in the previous threemonth period it was the best overall 
result in a year and a half overall fourth quarter losses were 3 
billion worse than initially reported earlier this year

japans trade surplus shrank 103 percent in july 
from a year earlier largely due to increased imports the finance 
ministry said friday 
the ministry said the countrys trade surplus declined to 538 
billion in july from 599 billion a year earlier on a customs 
clearance basis 
imports rose 60 percent to 1850 billion from a year earlier 
while exports rose 18 percent to 2388 billion the ministry said 
the drop in the surplus marks a return to a recent declining 
trend in japans trade gap which had been steadily falling since 
june 1989 until june 1990 when it jumped 276 percent 
ministry officials said a record increase in the imports of 
finished products including an 82 percent increase in aircraft and 
440 percent increase in imports of works of art contributed to the 
rise in imports 
the officials noted concern about economic sanctions and oil 
embargoes against iraq and kuwait decided earlier in the week 
on a regional basis japans trade surplus with the united 
states narrowed 206 percent to 307 billion from a year earlier 
its surplus with the european community shrank 298 percent to 
115 billion while its surplus with asia rose 42 percent to 248 
billion the ministry said 
japan calculates its trade surplus on a customsclearance basis 
which includes freight and insurance costs in imports but not in 
exports

wholesale prices in july edged down 01 
percent the government said today in a report seen by analysts as 
the last respite from inflation before the mideast crisis sent oil 
prices soaring 
the slight seasonally adjusted decline in the labor 
departments producer price index for finished goods one stop 
short of retail followed moderate gains of 02 percent in june and 
03 percent in may 
the drop in july was even better than the 01 percent or 02 
percent rise expected by most economists 
obviously this number is history said economist donald 
ratajczak of georgia state university but what it shows is that 
heading into the oil shock inflation was tame 
the stock market shrugged off the news after 90 minutes of 
trading the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks shed 1782 
points to 274109 
wholesale prices which soared in january when a cold snap sent 
fuel oil and vegetable costs spiraling have remained virtually 
unchanged from february through july helped by six consecutive 
drops in energy costs 
for the first seven months of the defense budget would have to take 
a larger reduction

the us economy faces the twin threats of 
inflation and recession if the oil price runup caused by the 
middle east crisis continues for more than several weeks analysts 
say 
its a real monkey wrench that is creating real economic 
distress for american households and businesses said allen 
sinai an economist with the boston co an oil price increase is 
essentially a tax on consumption that causes consumers to cut 
back in other areas 
the oil shot will add a substantial dose of inflation as 
crude oil prices work their way through the chain sinai said 
the government reported today that wholesale prices in july 
edged down 01 percent but analysts predict that will be the last 
respite from inflation before the mideast crisis sent oil prices 
soaring 
the labor department noted that prices were surveyed in 
midjuly before the iraqi invasion of kuwait analysts expect the 
sixmonth respite from wholesale price increases to end this month 
at least for three or four months until the economy absorbs the oil 
shock 
the economy has been weakening for several months noted charles 
stone senior economist with congress joint economic committee 
no one is talking about a really severe recession but this oil 
situation makes things a little bit worse he said 
how much worse experts agree that depends on how long the price 
of oil remains in the range of 26 per 42gallon barrel or higher 
which is nearly double the price two months ago 
the benchmark price rose from 18 to 21 the day iraq invaded 
kuwait soared above 28 on monday and dropped back to about 26 
after it became apparent the united states would use military might 
to keep saudi arabias oil fields open 
if prices stay up for two or three months a recession will be 
a reality private analyst joel popkin said 
depending on how high the price goes this definitely raises 
the risk of recession because higher prices drain purchasing power 
out of the economy and send it to the arabs fred ribe of the 
congressional budget office said 
if the middle east situation is resolved in the near term i 
wouldnt expect a longrun impact on the economy said roy 
cordato an analyst with the washingtonbased institute for 
research on the economics of taxation the economy would suffer if 
the runup continued for more than a few months he said 
many economists and politicians dread any increase in the price 
of energy especially oil because no commodity has a greater 
influence on inflation when the price of oil goes up it affects 
the cost of fuel to plow a farmers wheat field to heat a bakers 
oven and to cool the corner grocery that raises the price of bread 
the economy measured by the gross national product has little 
growth to give up it grew at an anemic rate of 15 percent in the 
first half of the year 
richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
doubts any longrange impact on the economy assuming that other 
oilproducing countries will increase output to make up for the 
loss of iraqi and kuwaiti oil thus stabilizing prices 
but rahn said a sustained high price would worsen the recession 
that he insists already is under way the rule of thumb is that a 
price increase of 5 in place for a year costs half a percentage 
point of growth he said 
one of the most pessimistic forecasts on oil prices came from 
philip k verleger jr a visiting fellow with the institute of 
international economics he told congress joint economic committee 
earlier this week that prices could hit 45 to 50 a barrel unless 
consuming nations open their strategic reserves 
this new price shock will almost certainly trigger a recession 
in both the united states and possibly throughout the 
industrialized world verleger said real gnp will decline by 1 
to 2 percent in the current quarter and 3 to 4 percent in the 
fourth unemployment now 57 percent could rise to 75 percent by 
the middle of 1991 
another big question is how the federal reserve will respond to 
higher oil prices many conservatives contend the central bank in 
its zeal to hold down inflation has overreacted and made credit so 
tight that a recession is inevitable 
we are not contemplating recession treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady said wednesday but he repeated the 
administrations hope that the federal reserve will loosen credit 
to stimulate the economy

call for arab unity from iraqs president sent a ripple of concern 
through the market that events in the middle east may not be 
stabilizing 
the market had been moving lower as traders unloaded equities to 
hedge against any surprise developments overseas this weekend but 
prices turned sharply downward following the statement from iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
it was quite inflamatory and it added fuel to the fire in 
an already pressured stock market one analyst said 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2747 points

find its equilibrium 
in reference to the usled multinational military presence in 
nearby saudi arabia saddam called on all arabs to condemn the 
invaders and collaborators 
traders who were lucky enough to catch the market before it 
headed higher in the two previous sessions were taking profits 
before the speech was broadcast and new investors remained leary 
about coming in noted charles jensen chief tecnical analyst at 
mki securities corp 
also pressuring stocks was a negative reaction in the credit 
markets to the labor departments report showing wholesale prices 
edged down 01 percent in july

have done anything positive for the market said george boyd iii

so far this year wholesale prices have advanced at an annual 
rate of 3 percent down sharply from the 48 percent increase for 
all of 1989 but the government noted prices were surveyed in

when the indian government ended its 
37year monopoly on airlines in april visions of bellydancing 
hostesses undulated through deepak anands head 
anand one of indias new breed of capitalists has yet to 
realize his dream of sashaying stewardesses 
but he has a private airline flying in india for the first time 
since the country nationalized eight carriers in 1953 
ub air took to the skies on june 1 led by anand who is 
corporate planner for the ub group indias biggest beer brewery 
and one of the countrys largest companies 
on time every time is ub airs slogan its nickname is 
beer air in reference to the companys main product and 
anand said the airline would soon relaunch canned beer in india by 
offering ubs black label and kingfisher brews on board a first in 
india 
ub air is targeting business travelers with fares about 30 
percent higher than indian airlines anand says he is committed to 
getting people where they want to go in time for their business 
meetings 
i also wanted belly dancers anand said but i got shot 
down company officials thought dancing on board would be too 
disruptive he said 
many seem to be taking ub air seriously 
it began by flying the 180 miles from bangalore a southern city 
of hightech industries and 4 million people to mangalore a beach 
resort on the west coast since june it has added a route from 
bangalore to the eastern city of madras a round trip to hyderabad 
in central india and the capital new delhi are also planned 
as of late july the company had flown about 60 flights all of 
them have been on time a highly unusual occurrence in india the 
land of the endless wait 
when 18000 indian airlines employees went on strike july 12 
ub air responded with two special flights to madras 
it was fun to stick it to them anand said it was our 
small way of saying wake up india 
the young airline operates with a single plane a 15seater 
donnier 228100 which flies six round trips a week between 
bangalore madras and mangalore 
next month ub air pans to purchase a 19seater donnier 228201 
from druk air bhutans staterun airline it is also trying to 
lease a 77seater bae146 jet from druk 
the appearance of a private airline in indias skies highlights 
attempts made by recent governments to liberalize this vast 
nations rigid economy 
since independence from britain in 1947 india has sheltered 
itself from the world economic system erecting huge tariffs on 
items from bicycles to automobiles to soft drinks most major 
industries such as power steel transportation and communication 
were state run 
when rajiv gandhi became prime minister in 1984 he moved to 
increase indias competition with the outside world lowering some 
tariffs and pushing trade 
gandhis loss in the 1989 election to vp singh didnt stop 
this process in may the government announced a new industrial 
policy approving foreign investment as long as the foreign partner 
holds less than 40 percent equity 
the government also opened up indias staterun power industry 
to private investors and the ministry of defense published a list 
of items which could be produced domestically by private industry 
in april the government announced its open skies policy 
permitting private airlines to fly 
many thought the announcement was overdue in indias air 
industry the gap between supply and demand has been acute 
of indias three stateowned airlines air india indian 
airlines and vayudoot only air india is considered passable and 
its flights are mainly overseas one airline analyst in hong kong 
called indian airlines the worst way to travel east of iran

teamsters union officials count united 
parcel service of america inc workers ballots on a proposed new 
contract today in a vote that could start a nationwide strike 
against the giant package shipper 
company officials were optimistic that a strike would be 
averted even if the proposed contract is rejected 
the sentiment were hearing right now is an actual work 
stoppage is one of the last options being considered ups 
spokesman john flick said thursday both of us will go to great 
lengths to avoid a work stoppage 
ups officials said the results of the voting could be announced 
satrday but a man who answered the telephone at teamsters 
headquarters in washington said no announcment would be made until 
monday teamsters spokesman duke zeller in washington did not 
return calls 
members had until 10 am edt today to send their ballots to 
union headquarters in washington 
ups the worlds no 1 package handler has about 150000 
parttime and fulltime teamsters members out of a total work force 
of 230000 it delivers more than 10 million packages a day and 
made 28 billion deliveries in 1989 for 124 billion in revenue 
teamsters president william mccarthy who helped negotiate the 
proposed new threeyear contract told ups officials early in the 
negotiations that the union would call for a work stoppage if the 
pact wasnt ratified said ken sternad another spokesman for ups 
but that was one verbal comment made at one moment in time 
and weve heard very little if any of that talk since then 
sternad said 
the old contract expired july 31 and the company has agreed to 
make the new one if ratified retroactive to aug 1 sternad said 
rival shippers and ups customers have been scrambling to make 
alternate plans if a strike is called and some customers said they 
have already stopped using ups to avoid getting packages caught in 
the system during a walkout 
spiegel inc of oak brook ill the nations largest inhome 
catalog company has been making contingency plans since the 
beginning of july said spokeswoman mary dale walters 
the postal service said last month that it could not absorb 
upss business and the companys other main ground competitor 
roadway package system inc echoed that sentiment thursday 
nobody has that kind of capacity said bram johnson 
spokesman for pittsburghbased rps 
other options to ups include federal express dhl worldwide 
express and tnt skypak 
if a strike is called packages would be cleared out of the ups 
system by any means possible sternad said adding that volume had 
decreased slightly by last week 
we will do everything up to and including getting everybody up 
to the chairman of the board to get our customers packages either 
returned to them or forwarded to where they are going he said 
the proposed contract calls for higher wages benefits and 
better working conditions sternad said it would raise the wages 
for the average ups fulltime driver a minimum of 150 an hour by 
august 1 1992 from 1610 
the contract also calls for a costofliving allowance of up to 
20 cents per hour each year depending on the rate of inflation 
sternad said inflation would have to be 10 percent for the drivers 
to get the full 20 cents he said 
parttime workers who start at 8 or 9 an hour would receive 
150 more sternad said 
company contributions for health benefits and employees 
pensions currently at 8300 a year for fulltime workers would 
increase to 10500 by the end of three years sternad said 
the proposal also offers a onetime bonus to be paid within the 
first month of ratification of 1000 to fulltimers and 500 to 
parttimers he said 
sternad said there has never been a national strike against ups 
which has had a national teamsters contract since 1979 but 
sporadic work stoppages and strikes have occurred regionally 
the mostv recent and biggest was in 1976 when 18000 workers in 
15 northeast states walked out for 13 weeks

transportation secretary samuel skinner is 
calling in airline executives to discuss the impact of sharp rises 
in jet fuel prices that led nearly every major carrier to announce 
fare increases 
some increases went into effect today but passengers on most 
airlines have until next wednesday to book flights in advance at 
current fares 
skinner wrote several airline presidents on thursday asking 
them to make appointments with him next wednesday thursday or 
friday to discuss how higher jet fuel prices following the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait are affecting airline finances and the public 
delta united and usair all announced 53 percent fare increases 
thursday that are to take effect in five days several other 
airlines announced increases earlier 
northwest dropped a planned 8perflight fuel surcharge and 
announced a 10 percent fare increase instead which it amended to 
53 percent late today american on thursday scaled back its 
increase from 10 percent to 53 percent 
other airlines that have announced increases include america 
west midway pan am southwest trans world and the trump shuttle 
prices of jet fuel shot up from a level of 70 to 75 cents a 
gallon before the invasion to 80 to 90 cents this week airline 
officials said 
the government has no power to regulate fuel prices or airline 
fares but skinner earlier asked all transportation companies to 
show restraint in raising rates in response to increasing fuel 
costs 
i am concerned about the effect of the rise in fuel costs 
both on the financial position of the industry and on the traveling 
public skinner said in a twoparagraph letter to several airline 
presidents he asked the officials to brief him on the situation 
airline ticket prices are going up and we want our passengers 
to know why jet fuel prices have gone through the roof robert 
j aaronson president of the industrys air transport association 
said at a news conference thursday 
aaronson said he expects all airlines to honor advance tickets 
sold before the price increases take effect calls to several 
carriers indicated that tickets bought before the increases would 
be at lower prices even for flights several months away 
many carriers already had sold 30 percent to 40 percent of their 
seats over the next two months before the announcements aaronson 
said 
the fare hikes come at a time when domestic air travel has shown 
little increase over last year and some airlines have reported 
first and secondquarter declines in profits it also comes toward 
the end of the summer vacation season after which travel volume is 
expected to drop 
while the industry struggles to hold down costs and to keep 
people flying at reasonable prices we are faced with these new 
enormous fuel bills aaronson said 
a 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil results in a 
3 cent increase in the cost of a gallon of jet fuel which in turn 
costs airlines 500 million a year the industry spokesman said 
with crude oil up from 22 a barrel last week to 26 a barrel on 
wednesday the increased costs would total 2 billion 
but aaronson noted that crude oil prices were declining thursday 
and he said if jet fuel costs follow the industry is likely to 
lower fares 
he said a bush administration proposal to increase domestic 
ticket taxes and a housepassed bill to impose passenger charges at 
airports would add to the cost of air travel 
although the airline industry has not taken a unified stand on 
the taxes aaronson said to put it mildly if ever there was a 
wrong time to raise taxes on airline passengers it is now

north carolinas attorney general filed a 
lawsuit friday against exxon corp charging the oil company with 
deceptive trade practices since the iraqi invasion of kuwait last 
week 
attorney general lacy thornburg charged that exxon is quoting 
wholesale prices which it fails to honor and is imposing 
retroactive wholesale price increases superior court judge robert 
farmer signed an injunction to halt the practice 
a spokesman for exxon said officials were unaware of the lawsuit 
and had no immediate comment 
north carolinas action follows the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
which set off a spiral of higher gasoline prices across the united 
states 
the lawsuit is based on an investigation by the attorney 
generals office which uncovered documents showing that exxon had 
raised its wholesale prices by as much as 6 cents a gallon after 
having already contracted and sold the gas at the lower price 
thornburg said records indicate that in some cases distributors 
had picked up loads and already made deliveries to service stations 
before being informed of the price hikes 
documents show that some oil and gas distributors have suffered 
significant losses by relying on exxons alleged misrepresentation 
of price thornburg said 
according to the lawsuit because the exxon distributors dont 
know whether exxon will impose retroactive price increases on gas 
which they have already purchased the distributors must build a 
cushion into their resale prices 
ultimately the public pays the price thornburg said 
when exxon or any other company unfairly raises its prices to the 
distributors it sets off a chain reaction of price increases which 
hit the consumer in the pocketbook

the kellogg co is taking nabisco brands 
to court over shredded wheat contending nabisco is trying to crush 
kelloggs plans to introduce a more nutritious cereal 
kellogg has been planning since june to put its whole grain 
shredded wheat on the market this month with the claim its very 
simply the most nutritious shredded wheat you can buy 
the company contends the shredded wheat has 33 percent more 
dietary fiber and more thiamine riboflavin niacin iron vitamins 
b6 and b12 folic acid magnesium and zinc with no sugar or salt 
than the famous shredded wheat manufactured for 89 years by new 
jerseybased nabisco brands a division of rjrnabisco 
but on july 27 attorneys for nabisco told kellogg that it too 
had developed a more nutritious shredded wheat with nearly 
identical nutritional value as the new kellogg product that would 
be on the market in midaugust 
nabisco sent a letter to kellogg saying the battle creek 
company must take immediate steps to avoid any false claims of 
nutritional superiority for its fortified shredded wheat cereal on 
packaging advertising point of sale and any other materials 
whatsoever 
instead kellogg filed suit aug 3 in us district court in 
kalamazoo 
the company contends nabisco had known since early june that 
kellogg was preparing to spring the new shredded wheat onto the 
market but said nothing kellogg had been sending samples and 
promotional materials since that time to various test markets 
that nabisco should wait for 89 years and a competitive 
challenge from kellogg before manufacturing its own unsugared 
fortified shredded wheat biscuit was itself suspicious the suit 
says but kellogg has learned other facts which clearly 
indicate that nabisco set out to copy both the features of and 
marketing strategy behind kelloggs new cereal in a cynical attempt 
to prevent vigorous competition in a sector of the market for 
readytoeat cereals that it has dominated for so long 
nabisco spokesman mark gutsche said friday the company denies 
the charge and called the lawsuit a reaction to nabiscos own 
threat of legal action 
he said the companys new cereal spoon size plus shredded 
wheat a fortified version of its regular product already has been 
sent to grocers 
nabisco is absolutely confident that kellogg will be stopped 
from confusing consumers that its new cereal is the most nutritious 
shredded wheat he said reading from a prepared statement 
kellogg spokesman neil nyberg said the company is asking the 
court to rule that its product claims are legal and that nabisco 
may not sue kellogg over those claims

the united auto workers union has 
rejected proposals that would give workers a stake in the 
financially struggling chrysler corp and would establish a new way 
to figure profit sharing a uaw official said friday 
uaw vice president stan marshall said a third company proposal 
which would establish a multiemployer healthcare trust is still 
under consideration 
the three concepts were introduced by chrysler vice president 
anthony st john on july 20 the day national contract negotiations 
began between the uaw and general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler current contracts covering more than 450000 workers 
60000 of them at chrysler expire sept 14 
marshall said friday that the union had rejected the employee 
ownership plan and the socalled gainsharing proposal 
its pretty close to being laid to rest from the unions 
position he said were rejecting unless the membership said 
differently 
marshall said he expected union members to agree with the 
bargainers position 
however uaw negotiators are likely to hear about the two 
proposals later 
im sure all those discussions will come up again at the 
bargaining table chrysler spokesman tom houston said 
st john offered few details about the proposals for the 
employee ownership program or the gainsharing scheme 
currently chrysler workers nationwide receive annual 
profitsharing payments if the companys north american earnings 
are high enough 
st john said the gainsharing program would alter that by 
including other factors such as employee attendance and 
productivity it also would be operated on a plantbyplant basis 
rather than nationwide 
he said the two programs along with the multiemployer 
healthcare trust would save chrysler money although gm and ford 
officials have been cool to the ideas 
you dont hear about buying in to the corporation or 
gainsharing until they the companies are in trouble marshall 
said they are willing to include workers in their misery 
chrysler said it made 180 million during the second quarter 
down 472 percent from last year wall street analysts have 
forecast that the company will lose a substantial amount of money 
in the third quarter because of a minivan production interruption 
marshall speaking at a management conference sponsored by the 
university of michigan criticized st john harshly for talking 
about the three proposals to reporters before discussing them with 
the union he said negotiations got off to a rocky start partly 
because of that 
since then marshall said the atmosphere at the talks has 
improved but distrust remains between the union and management 
in a speech to the conference marshall endorsed an expansion of 
joint labormanagement programs and said the union would consider a 
threecrew twoshift manufacturing schedule 
the unions leadership once before backed such a plan at 
chryslers car assembly plant in st louis the uaw overwhelmingly 
rejected the proposed change 
shortly after chrysler announced it would close the plant in 
late september

hj heinz co has signed chief executive 
anthony jf oreilly to a fiveyear contract that includes options 
to buy 4 million shares of stock officials said friday 
we see it as a way to put a handcuff on tony oreilly and keep 
him at heinz said james mcdonald a board member who heads the 
compensation committee for the pittsburghbased food giant 
under the agreement oreilly cannot exercise the option to buy 
the stock until 1995 oreilly only would earn a profit on the 
stock if the price exceeds the options exercise price of 2987 
this does not pay off unless the stock does mcdonald said 
unless the company continues to perform it cant be a good deal 
for him 
heinz stock closed friday at 33 
the board struck the agreement to keep the 54year old chairman 
and chief executive at the company which has grown steadily under 
his 11year tenure into a 6 billion company 
mcdonald said oreilly has become increasingly attractive to 
other companies because of his record oreilly introduced weight 
watchers and other lines and began an aggressive marketing campaign 
in the united states and abroad 
if you look at his performance it has been outstanding 
mcdonald said 
other terms of the contract which must be approved by 
shareholders at next months annual meeting remain the same as 
last year when oreilly earned 534688 in salary and other 
compensation and about 14 million in bonuses

masasachusetts dark economic picture thursday by announcing a 90 
million plant to produce film for its new electronic imaging 
products 
the plant in new bedford will employ more than 100 people and is 
expected to be built by late 1992 polaroid officials said it would 
be the companys largest investment in a manufacturing plant and 
its products should help lift the companys weak profits 
chairman i macallister booth said the expansion also reflected 
polaroids confidence in the commonwealth of massachusetts as a 
great place to do business 
recent events have shaken the business climate in that state a 
oncebooming economy has tumbled increasing unemployment state 
government wrestled for months with a fiscal crisis before raising 
taxes and cutting programs 
the expansion may be a needed shot for polaroid its instant 
film business has been lackluster and the company must find new 
products to stimulate sales said alex henderson an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
polaroid last month reported drops in second quarter operating 
income net earnings and worldwide sales 
booth said electronic imaging products are a key element in 
our growth strategy that includes making devices that can be 
used in hospitals to give doctors instant images when they examine 
patients 
the company is set to test the products later this year and 
begin selling them in 1991 
polaroid looked at sites around the world after choosing new 
bedford where the company operates another plant that employs 500

instability in massachusetts but it wasnt enough of a factor to 
send us outside the state he said 
gov michael dukakis and business leaders hailed polaroids 
announcement as a positive signal to other companies john gould 
president of associated industries of massachusetts called it a 
lightning rod that could help the state attract other

shareholders of shearson lehman hutton holdings 
inc on thursday approved the wall street firms merger with its 
parent american express co 
shearson said the merger will take effect at 1201 am friday 
at a shareholders meeting 9159 percent of the votes cast were 
in favor of the merger said shearson spokesman steven faigen 
since american express owns almost all the shares the vote was a 
formality 
shearson is the parent company of the retail brokerage shearson 
lehman brothers and the investment bank lehman brothers the 
divisions recently were created by american express out of what 
formerly was known only as shearson lehman hutton 
earlier this year american express took greater control of 
shearson after it experienced internal turmoil and weak financial 
performance the financial services company increased its ownership 
of shearson ousted its chairman peter a cohen and injected more 
than 1 billion in fresh capital the merger is the final step in 
that process 
shearson lost an industry record 915 million in the first 
quarter in part because of expenses to pay for a restructuring 
that includes about 2000 layoffs most wall street firms have been 
forced to cut back because of an industry slowdown since the 1987 
stock market crash 
a large part of shearsons problems were due to overexpansion in 
the 1980s when the firm acquired the brokerage ef hutton amp co 
and the investment bank lehman brothers inc 
at the shareholders meeting shearsons chairman and chief 
executive officer howard l clarke said the company does not 
expect to take any additional restructuring charges faigen said 
in addition shearson said it does not expect it will require 
any additional cash infusions by american express the spokesman 
said

two federal judges in cleveland and texas on 
friday consolidated thousands of asbestos liability lawsuits in a 
first step toward resolving claims against manufacturers for worker 
deaths and illnesses 
the joint classaction ruling was issued by federal district 
judges robert m parker of beaumont texas and thomas d lambros 
of cleveland following a meeting of judges to consider ways of 
clearing a burgeoning asbestos case backlog 
more than 100000 lawsuits are filed in state and federal courts 
nationwide against companies that produced asbestos a mineral used 
widely for insulation that causes cancer and other respiratory 
illnesses 
the need for a multicourt cooperative effort to dispose of 
these cases is compelling parker and lambros said in their order 
the transaction costs are unacceptable thousands of claimants 
die before they can get their cases resolved trials have become 
repetitive with the same issues and the same products being 
litigated time after time they said 
the judges consolidated all pending asbestos liability cases in 
their jurisdictions into one case it is the first such grouping 
made by judges handling the asbestos docket 
parker lambros and eight other federal judges held an 
extraordinary meeting friday in washington they heard proposals by 
plaintiffs and defense lawyers for taking steps to clear the 
asbestos docket the order was approved by all the judges although 
it was issued by parker and lambros who have the most cases 
im not sure it will result in a national class being 
established but its a step in the direction of having a forum 
created so that an equitable solution to the problem can be arrived 
at said louis robles a miami plaintiffs lawyer handling 1000 
asbestos claims 
parker and lambros also scheduled a sept 14 hearing in 
cleveland to discuss certifying a national class action in texas 
consolidating all pending asbestos lawsuits nationwide that 
hearing also would examine which companies have too little money on 
hand to pay claims against them 
the judges order does not stay on any pending asbestos 
litigation parker and lambros said they want to establish 
procedures to determine defendant companies national or regional 
share of asbestos to apportion their liability 
many of the claims involve exposure dating to the 1930s and 
40s much of it during world war ii at government shipyards the 
government to date has avoided liability for asbestos diseases but 
is being challenged in several courts 
separately a courtappointed adviser is new york is developing 
a plan to restructure the manville trust the trust which was 
created after manville corp was driven into bankruptcy court by 
thousands of asbestos claims is out of money to pay new claims 
further spending by the trust has been frozen until sept 6

perrier bottled water hasnt reappeared 
in large quantities in the city where discovery of benzene 
contamination in the famous drink stopped distribution in 120 
countries 
progress also apparently has been slow in reintroducing the 
drink in some other areas as well 
weve got our work cut out for us said jane lazgin 
spokeswoman for the perrier group of america the waters us 
distributor 
we have to earn their customers trust again thats our job 
we feel our first step was the best one to take now it will take 
an educational campaign 
its been six months since a local health official discovered 
traces of the chemical benzene in perrier samples prompting the 
worldwide recall the company began reintroducing the water into 
the united states in some areas in april 
hellen berry who works for beverage marketing of new york an 
industry consulting firm said it will take a long time for perrier 
to restock all of its customers 
they have to restore the entire pipeline she said that 
includes a stores shelves as well as the back rooms and 
warehouses 
ms berry estimated the companys sales for may were about 67 
percent of what they were in the same month last year she also 
said the benzene scare could have a longlasting impact on perrier 
sales 
before this most restaurants stocked only one brand of 
bottled water she said now im being told their customers 
expect them to offer more than one 
patrons at charlotte restaurants are discovering perriers still 
difficult to get 
i cant find it and you know how upsetting that can be to the 
owner of a french restaurant said daniel quillec owner of chez 
daniel my customers are asking for it 
at elis another popular charlotte eatery owner larry campbell 
has switched to another bottled water quibell 
as far as i know its not available and no ones been asking 
for it he said of perrier 
one grocery store said it has been selling perrier for about a 
week 
it isnt blowing off the shelves said janice keifer 
assistant manager at the fresh market it looks like people got 
used to rival products quibell and lacroix 
another store manager said she expects the first shipment of 
perrier next week 
the company says it resumed distribution in charlotte on june 15 
in february perrier announced an international recall after 
benzene traces were found in some samples by mecklenburg county 
environmental lab director tom ward 
in his small lab which tests 25000 water samples a year ward 
routinely uses perrier as a diluting agent when he found benzene 
in six bottles he notified the food and drug administration and 
sent it two unopened bottles from the same batch the fda found 
similar levels of benzene in the samples 
perrier which eventually traced the contamination to naturally 
occurring benzene that inadvertently had not been filtered from the 
water responded by ordering the dumping of 160 million bottles 
including 72 million in the united states and halted distribution 
to 120 countries last month the company said the recall had cost 
it nearly 150 million 
before the recall perrier was the nations biggest selling 
imported bottled water brand and third overall 
according to the research firm beverage marketing corp perrier 
had 57 percent of the overall 22 billion bottled water market in 
the us in 1988 it trailed only arrowhead at 77 percent and 
sparklettes at 59 percent 
ms lazgin said the company wants to regain about 80 percent of 
its us markets by next august the company does not disclose its 
sales 
we gave ourselves 18 months to do it so were doing well after 
six months considering we were out of the market so long she 
said

gold futures prices raced to their highest levels in nearly five 
months friday as fiery rhetoric from iraqi president saddam hussein 
reignited fears that a middle east war would wreak economic havoc 
on the west 
on other markets petroleum futures soared soybeans rallied 
strongly while wheat futures plunged and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 1110 to 12 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in august at 
39690 a troy ounce the highest spotmonth settlement since march 
19 
silver futures settled 111 cents to 127 cents higher with 
august at 4969 a troy ounce 
the gold market surged after saddam in an outburst of fury 
against western efforts to devastate his economy and hem in his 
army called on arabs everywhere to wage holy war against 
enemies of islam 
hours after saddams statement a majority of the arab league 
nations agreed to dispatch an arab force to defend saudi arabia and 
approved economic sanctions against iraq 
the developments triggered a runup in oil futures and a drop of 
more than 40 points in the dow jones industrial average both of 
those moves supported the gold market which tends to attract 
investors during times of inflation and economic and political 
uncertainty 
gold is getting helped twice once by the political 
instability in the middle east and once by the price of crude 
oil said jim paul chief commodities analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
gold has rebounded with increasing momentum since tumbling below 
345 an ounce in june and paul said the chart patterns on which 
many large institutional investors and commodity funds make their 
trading decisions indicate the precious metals are likely to move 
higher 
but he cautioned were not trading gold and silver were 
trading political events in the middle east and we dont know 
whats happening next

on the chicago board of trade after the agriculture department 
issued a lowerthanexpected harvest estimate 
the market dropped from its highs on spillover selling from the 
grain pits where a large wheat sell order sparked a dizzying 
plunge late in the session 
they hit it hard it was a big mess in there said john 
frazier director of agricultural trading for gerald inc in 
chicago 
analysts said the strength in soybeans was mainly a reaction to 
thursdays usda report 
the government projected a soybean harvest of 184 billion 
bushels about 20 million less than expected 
the usdas estimate for the corn harvest 785 billion bushels 
was about 70 million lower than expected

gold prices climbed friday in heavy trading 
after iraqs call for an arab holy war against western forces in 
the persian gulf region 
the dollar meanwhile finished lower against most major 
currencies despite the possibility of an escalation of middle east 
hostilities that could disrupt oil flows from that region and 
damage economies 
analysts said weakness in the us economy and the prospect of 
lower us interest rates weighed on the dollar trading was 
described as light 
gold for current delivery jumped 1110 a troy ounce to close at 
39690 on new yorks commodity exchange in later dealings 
republic national bank in new york quoted a bid for an ounce of 
gold at 39625 as of 4 pm edt up 1065 from thursdays late 
bid 
david ryan chief bullion trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
said trading volume was heavy and reflected a feeling that 
tensions are getting worse instead of better in the wake of 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
as arab leaders gathered for a meeting friday in cairo egypt 
iraqi president saddam hussein called on arabs everywhere to attack 
western forces in region overthrow the saudi royal family and take 
back the moslem holy sites in saudi arabia 
but a majority of the arab league nations attending the cairo 
meeting later agreed to send troops to protect saudi arabia from 
iraq approved economic sanctions against baghdad and condemned the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
ryan said saddams call for a holy war against western forces 
really played on traders nerves today 
he said gold was bid higher higher because of its perceived 
safety in times of distress and as a hedge against inflation likely 
to result from the recent sharp increase in oil prices since iraqs 
move against its neighbor kuwait 
earlier in the day gold prices rose by smaller amounts in asia 
and europe in what analysts there attributed to shortcovering by 
professionals who bought gold to fulfill earlier agreements to sell 
it 
gold rose to 39125 a troy ounce in london from 38525 late 
thursday and to 39050 an ounce in zurich from 38500 late

thursday on new yorks comex silver for current delivery rose 
112 cents an ounce to 4969 
in the currency markets the dollar fell in new york trading 
against every major currency except the japanese yen and the 
canadian dollar after turning in a mixed performance on foreign 
exchange markets overseas 
we saw dollar weakness at the close of the european session 
and it carried over to new york said marc chandler a currency 
markets analyst at mms international in chicago 
chandler said the dollar is suffering because of the weakness in 
the us economy the likelihood of rising inflation and chances 
that us interest rates will fall while rates in germany may rise 
he said the dollar would probably be even lower were it not for 
the persian gulf situation some investors turn to the dollar 
during international strife on the theory that it offers more 
security than other currencies 
the danger for the dollar now is for a protracted and costly 
us involvement in the persian gulf chandler said 
the dollar rose to 15040 yen in new york from 149805 yen late 
thursday in tokyo the dollar edged up 007 yen to 14975 yen the

president bush signed legislation friday that 
extends his authority to begin pumping oil from the nations 
strategic petroleum reserve into the market should iraqs invasion 
of kuwait disrupt world oil supplies 
the bill passed by congress shortly before lawmakers left for 
vacation last week temporarily extends the energy policy 
conservation act which established the 580millionbarrel 
stockpile of unrefined crude oil in response to the 197374 arab 
oil embargo 
without the extension bushs authority to pump crude oil from 
the stockpile to relieve shortages would expire aug 15 while 
congress is out of town 
the stockpile stored in salt caverns along the louisianatexas 
coast has been accumulated at a cost of more than 20 billion over 
the last decade 
the system could now replace 80 days of oil imports according 
to the senate energy committee that cushion has fallen from 110 
days in the middle 1980s because of growing us dependence on 
foreign crude 
congress and the administration have been battling the last 18 
months over whether to increase the reserve to 1 billion barrels 
bush has opposed increasing the reserve beyond 750 million barrels

now that frank lorenzo is leaving continental 
airlines the question remains whether the carrier can rise above 
the problems it accumulated on its way to the top 
lorenzos departure may have stemmed the flow of harsh criticism 
from organized labor but the carrier still faces other obstacles 
heavy debts and a bitter strike at sister carrier eastern 
airlines have hurt business and continental still suffers from an 
image problem but despite those hurdles several analysts said 
friday there is room for optimism 
it is a fairly lowcost provider with a different kind of 
management it could be a very powerful airline said industry 
analyst andrew geller of pnc financial corp in philadelphia 
i think it definitely has a better future now or a heightened 
chance of a better future with this happening geller said 
whether i think its a survivor i dont know yet 
continental airlines holdings inc formerly known as texas air 
corp announced thursday that lorenzo was selling most of his 
stake in the company to scandinavian airlines system and resigning 
as chairman and chief executive 
lorenzo will be replaced by delta air lines inc president 
hollis l harris 
the houstonbased company once commanded 20 percent of the 
domestic airline market through its ownership of continental and 
its sister carrier miamibased eastern 
robert j joedicke of lehman brothers in new york said the 
carrier has several advantages and disadvantages as it moves into 
the postlorenzo era 
its labor costs are lower than the industry average whoever 
takes it over is blessed with a lowcost airline he said they 
can be quite competitive among the major carriers 
the companys debt however sort of counterbalances that 
joedicke said its success he said depends on whether management 
can realign the structure of its debt which totaled some 48 
billion as of march 31 
joedicke also said he believes harris will make strides in 
improving service which should help attract additional business 
travelers 
they kind of had a reputation of bad service that they were 
slowly getting rid of this may hasten that said thomas canning 
of standard amp poors in new york 
canning said harris is well respected in the airline industry 
and should be instrumental in polishing continentals tarnished 
image 
but continental also faces problems common throughout the 
airline industry including high fuel costs sagging traffic growth 
and increased competition he said 
continental he said needs to attract a loyal following and 
obtain a larger share of the flying public he said that except for 
lorenzos surprise departure he doubted there would be any major 
changes immediately

consumers will pay an average 23 percent more 
for general motors corp cars and trucks in the 1991 model year as 
gm on friday joined the other two big three automakers in 
announcing price increases 
chrysler corp said last week that its 1991 cars jeeps and 
minivans would cost 09 percent more than this years models while 
ford motor co said a week earlier that its 1991 cars would cost an 
average 32 percent more than this years fords trucks will cost 
36 percent more 
while gms price increase isnt expected to keep pace with 
inflation the company doubts its profits will suffer 
there are a couple of dynamics to determine profit other than 
hiking prices said terrence p sullivan manager for sales and 
financial reporting 
if you have a modest price increase you can increase profit 
by increasing sales and cutting costs he said 
sullivan said gm would likely release prices for various models 
early next week he said 19 percent of the increase is to cover 
health care and production costs and 04 percent is for installing 
airbags on several models 
the price comparisons are for comparably equipped vehicles but 
yeartoyear comparisons are difficult because automakers pad 
prices to allow for incentives 
during the past several years each of the big three has offered 
a variety of incentives mostly cash rebates and lowinterest 
financing to help sell its vehicles 
sullivan said the cost of incentives at gm were about the same 
as at ford and chrysler about 1000 per vehicle 
the cost of incentives come directly out of profits during the 
last three weeks the big three have all blamed incentives for 
cutting their secondquarter earnings 
overall big three profits tumbled 433 percent in the 
apriljune quarter this year compared with the same 1989 period 
chryslers earnings dropped to 180 million 472 percent less than 
earnings for the 1989 second quarter 
ford said it made 7707 million in the second quarter down 45 
percent from the yearearlier period while gm reported 
secondquarter earnings fell 40 percent to 9001 million 
nonetheless sullivan said dealer inventories are at lower 
levels than they were at this time last year when gm increased its 
incentives to get vehicles off the showroom floors 
this year there is no need for a big yearend announcement of 
incentive packages sullivan said 
there are rebates on most vehicles now but theyre not as big 
or as aggressive as before

bond prices slipped friday in light volatile 
trading as participants took profits and fears grew that a war 
could erupt in the middle east traders said 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 1132 point or 344 
per 1000 face amount its yield which rises when prices fall 
rose to 879 percent from 875 percent late thursday 
the yield on the 30year bond due in august 2020 which was 
auctioned thursday as part of the treasurys quarterly refunding 
also fell 1132 point in whenissued trading 
traders said the market had little reaction to a report showing 
inflation moderated last month the government reported that 
wholesale prices in july edged down 01 percent 
analysts said the report which normally would be positive for 
the bond market was discounted because it occurred before the 
middle east crisis sent oil prices surging 
the market disregarded it as old news said kevin flanagan 
a money market economist with dean witter reynolds inc the 
mideast situation is not going to go away 
instead bond prices were sent lower by bondholders who sold 
issues to take profits after the treasurys quarterly refunding 
which concluded thursday said gib clark chief trader at daiwa 
securities inc 
in addition investors concerned that the iraqi situation could 
escalate were unwilling to hold large amounts of bonds over the 
weekend furthering the selloff clark said 
the market has been concerned that the turmoil and resulting 
rise in oil prices could heighten inflation which erodes the value 
of fixedreturn securities such as bonds 
also influencing bond prices was a rumor that the federal 
reserve would inject money into the banking system to lower 
interest rates clark said lower rates benefit bonds 
the fed did add some funds but only to make a technical 
adjustment in the monetary supply flanagan said the size of the 
injection made it clear the central bank had not changed its 
tightmoney policy he said 
the market was a little disappointed about that clark said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged to lsqb point lower intermediate 
maturities fell from 332 point to 516 point and longterm issues 
were down by as much as rsqb point according to telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 098 to 115300 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 761 percent as the 
discount fell 2 basis points to 738 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills fell to 764 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 
727 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 765 percent as the 
discount fell 3 basis points to 715 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each

a us district court judge friday set a aside a 
159 million jury verdict against gte products corp calling for 
a new trial in a case filed by an inventor who claimed the company 
stole his idea 
the jury in june had awarded the money to george panagiotou a 
former rock band manager who had charged gte appropriated trade 
secrets for his cool lamp which is used in movie studios 
gte had maintained that panagiotou failed to show that any trade 
secrets existed or a contract had been breached 
judge john j mcnaught set aside the verdict but panagiotous 
attorney sydelle pittas said an appeal is likely 
it was a big award but we feel that the grounds on which it 
was set aside are not valid and are confident of winning an appeal 
of the judges decision she said 
a spokesman for gte said the company is pleased with the judges 
decision gte welcomes the retrial and the opportunity to 
completely vindicate itself the company said in a prepared 
statement 
panagiotous lawyers had argued that he started developing the 
cool light when he realized how uncomfortable performers were under 
the heat of movie studio lamps in the 1970s 
his cool lights were used in the production of numerous popular 
television shows the trial originally filed in california in 
1984 brought such television stars as ed asner and michael landon 
to testify on panagiotous behalf 
panagiotou has since started a successful home video light 
company in los angeles

the market back from its worst levels 
analysts had expected traders to lighten their stock holdings 
ahead of an uncertain weekend but a flurry of heated statements

and higher interest rates to pressure stocks lower 
things got very nasty as investors flocked to safe havens

think that the market had found an equilibrium and that the middle 
east crisis was showing signs of stabilizing 
the amount of stock selling began to trickle down said gene 
jay seagle a vice president at gruntal financial inc as 
evidenced by the sessions relatively light volume most 
investors who wanted out are pretty well out 
but what fanned the downturn according to johnson was 
saberrattling from all corners 
the market was hit with a flurry of news beginning with a 
statement from iraqi president saddam hussein urging other arabs to 
wage holy war against america 
elsewhere arab leaders in cairo said they would send troops to 
help protect saudi arabia while denouncing the iraqi invasion in 
addition a number of nations were poised to send troops to join 
us forces in the arabian desert 
so far the game seems to be going against saddam which is 
positive for the market seagle said 
traders ignored a report showing wholesale prices declined a 
betterthanexpected 01 percent in july it was an 
extraordinarily good number but the markets behavior dramatized 
how much the focus is on the middle east johnson said

the treasury department said friday a 368000 
civil penalty had been assessed against the national bank of 
washington because of what the government said were improper 
currency transaction reports discovered during a money laundering 
investigation 
the penalty was assessed before the government took over the 
bank on aug 1 after its parent washington bancorporation filed 
for bankruptcy protection from its creditors 
the treasury said the penalty was based on the banks failure to 
file currency transaction reports as required by the bank secrecy 
act most of the violations were discovered during a federal 
undercover operation it said 
despite an earlier warning by treasury and the involvement of 
its former senior vice president in money laundering nbw continued 
to rely on a woefully inadequate bank secrecy act compliance 
program which led to a number of violations and created a situation 
rip for money laundering said assistant secretary peter k 
nunez who announced the fine 
the penalty is the maximum authorized

the stock market tumbled and oil prices climbed friday as 
belligerent rhetoric by iraqi president saddam hussein unnerved 
investors and heightened fears of an oil shortage 
were still seeing an underlying tension swelling in that 
region said randall rothenberg a oil broker with dean witter 
reynolds inc in new york the situation has not been averted 
the stock market closed the week with its worst performance 
since monday as virtually all sectors except gold and oil were 
battered by tensions in the middle east 
the dow jones average of 30 bluechip industrial stocks fell 
4233 points to 271658 extending its weekly drop to 9307 points 
analysts had expected some selling by investors reluctant to 
hold on to stocks in case of further developments over the weekend 
but saddam called for a holy war against western forces 
while arab nations agreed to dispatch troops to saudi arabia where 
us forces are positioned in what president bush called a defense 
against iraqi invasion 
bush raised tensions by warning iraq against sending out oil 
tankers to evade an economic embargo he also said saddam would be 
foolish to invade saudi arabia 
those events created jitters in the oil futures market on a 
belief they might lead to further disruptions of oil supplies from 
the middle east a critical source of world fuel a supply shortage 
would boost demand in turn pushing up prices 
on the new york mercantile exchange the september contract for 
us crude oil rose 56 cents to 2623 per 42gallon barrel crude 
oil has risen nealry 6 per barrel since the iraqi invasion aug 2 
among refined petroleum products traded on the merc the 
nearterm contract for home heating oil soared 284 cents to 7261 
cents per gallon the september contract for unleaded gasoline 
jumped 303 cents to 7945 cents per gallon 
in addition to saddams speech oil futures prices were helped 
by a statement by venezuela denying it planned to raise output to 
cover production by iraq and kuwait western nations have embargoed 
oil from the two nations 
meanwhile gasoline prices at the pump dropped for the first 
time since iraq invaded kuwait the automobile association of 
america said the average price of unleaded fuel nationwide was down 
03 cent friday to 125 a gallon 
on other financial markets gold for current delivery jumped 
1110 a troy ounce to close at 39690 on new yorks commodity 
exchange the dollar was lower against most major currencies 
despite the threat of escalating hostilities 
gold rose because it is viewed as a safe haven in times of 
distress and as a hedge against inflation likely to result from the 
sharp increase in oil prices 
bond prices fell as traders reduced their portfolios before the 
weekend the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 1132 point or 
344 per 1000 face amount and its yield rose to 879 percent 
earlier in tokyo the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 28618

the venezuelan energy and ministry on 
friday denied reports that it had ordered the state oil industry to 
raise output to cover iraq and kuwaits opec quotas 
until this moment the minister has not ordered any increase 
and our production is still limited to our opec quota of 1945 
million barrels per day of crude a ministry spokesman told the 
associated press 
however a new order could be given later on depending on 
opec agreements he added 
venezuela will not make any unilateral hikes and in any case 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries is awaiting word 
from arab leaders on the success of their peace efforts before 
changing the level of output the spokesman said 
energy minister celestino armas is in constant touch with 
other opec ministers the cartel has yet to make any decision about 
making up for iraqs 31 million barrels per day and kuwaits 15 
million the spokesman said 
but depending on what happens in the arab world minister 
armas may make an announcement within a day or two he said 
reports from new york and elsewhere had indicated that the state 
oil monopoly petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa had already 
ordered its subsidiaries to raise output by around 500000 bpd 
however by law the ministry imparts instructions to pdvsa 
which cannot raise production on its own 
according to a recent nationwide test venezuela has the 
capacity to produce between 26 and 27 million barrels of oil per 
day excluding heavy crudes its reserves are sixth in the world 
not counting oil in the orinoco bitumen belt 
venezuelas opec limitations have led to friction between the 
ministry and pdvsa which has advocated overproduction to finance a 
20 billion program to expand the oil and petrochemical industries 
over the next 10 years 
a main goal is to raise production capacity to 35 million 
barrels per day by 1995 and to 4 million by 2000

kentuckys third largest independent coal company said friday it 
was notifying more than 800 workers of possible layoffs in october 
the united mine workers which won the right to represent south 
east coal co workers last month dismissed the announcement as a 
scare tactic designed to influence upcoming contract talks 
south east president harry laviers jr made the announcement in 
a onepage press release he and other south east officials could 
not be reached by telephone for comment 
we hope not to have to layoff everyone economics will 
determine that but we are not currently in a position to determine 
which employees or how many will be affected laviers said 
therefore we believed it was necessary to notify all 
employees 
south east has underground mines and a coal processing plant in 
kentucky it has about 740 hourly workers the rest are managers 
foremen office staff or engineers 
the statement said south east believes more than 50 employees 
will be laid off by oct 12 the company was notifying all workers 
to comply with a federal law that requires companies to give 
workers 60day notice of impending layoffs
