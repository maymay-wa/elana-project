when a pair of yellow moleskin pants went 
up in flames so did a 25year holiday tradition 
every christmas the trousers were hauled back and forth across 
the southern minnesota community between the homes of 
brothersinlaw larry kunkel and roy collette every year the 
packaging was goofier 
this year an epitaph delivered with the ruined pants saturday 
told the story 
sorry old man here lies the pants an attempt to cast the 
pants in glass brought about the demise of the pants at last 
back up to 1964 when this got started 
kunkels mother gave him the pants yellow moleskin a strong 
cottontwill fabric supposedly good for minnesota winters kunkel 
found out they stiffened up in the cold so he gave them to 
collette the pants werent warm enough to suit collette so he 
handed them back to kunkel 
back and forth the pants went each christmas until collette 
upped the ante one year he encased them in concrete 
thats when the wrapping began to get out of hand a truck tire 
filled with nine tons of concrete a weldedup 600pound safe a 
17foot concretefilled rocket a crushed automobile a 225pound 
steel ashtray a fourton rubiks cube a totaled station wagon 
jammed with 170 steel generators 
along the way news stories about the pesky pants attracted 
attention from all over the us and from as far away as europe and 
australia 
this year it was collettes turn to deliver the pants his 
inspiration encase them in 10000 pounds of jagged glass that he 
would deposit in kunkels front yard it would have been a great 
one really messy kunkel said thursday 
collette shipped the pants to a friend in tennessee who manages 
a glass manufacturing company while molten glass was being poured 
over the insulated container that held the pants an oversized 
chunk fractured transforming the pants into a pile of ashes 
so the ashes were deposited into a brass urn that now graces 
the mantel in kunkels home 
its over he said too bad but once they were destroyed 
thats it 
collette isnt so sure 
listen larrys the most competitive person i know i wont be 
surprised if i get the ashes back in something next year

attorney general dick thornburghs decision to 
close an internal investigation into a news leak about an fbi probe 
of rep william h gray iiis office got a sharp rebuke from gray 
and from sen joseph r biden jr who says the leak investigation 
should continue 
thornburgh wrote biden the senate judiciary committee chairman 
that investigators had been unable to identify with certainty the 
original source of disclosures to cbs reporter rita braver about 
grays office financial affairs and therefore will not prosecute or 
fire anyone 
the leak occurred at the end of may while gray dpa was 
seeking election in the house as majority whip and it prompted 
accusations from democratic lawmakers that thornburghs aides were 
the source of a political leak 
thornburgh said in fridays letter to biden ddel that 
investigators also told him the nature of the confirmations 
alleged to have been forthcoming to ms braver were uncertain 
he said he accepted the investigators conclusion that it 
would be futile and impossible to pursue a prosecution based on the 
available evidence 
therefore he told biden the case would be closed without 
prosecution and without firing any department employees 
gray said the failure of this investigation raises the white 
flag of surrender to those in the department of justice who use 
false leaks to defame innocent citizens the leaks in this case 
were designed to harm me but their real victim was the integrity 
of our criminal justice system 
biden meanwhile said thornburgh was failing to pursue the 
investigation as he had said he would when he testified last june 2 
before the judiciary committee 
during that hearing biden said in a statement thornburgh said 
that if his departments criminal division did not turn up enough 
evidence for criminal prosecution the office of professional 
responsibility would complete the investigation and recommend 
appropriate sanctions against those who can be identified 
in addition biden said that although thornburgh wrote that he 
was told the opr concurred with the criminal divisions decisions 
the judiciary committee staff had gotten a different story from opr 
although opr was consulted at various points during the 
investigation it has never seen the criminal division report or 
any of its conclusions and therefore could not have and has not 
concurred in those conclusions biden said furthermore it is 
also the judiciary committee staffs understanding that the 
criminal division did not conclude that disciplinary action was 
unwarranted 
biden concluded the proper course is for opr now to 
determine if any disciplinary action is warranted 
thornburghs spokesman david runkel said the attorney general 
believes the findings do not justify further investigation by the 
opr and he disputed bidens contention that opr had not concurred 
in the criminal divisions conclusions 
i dont know whom sen biden or his staff has been talking to 
but that statement is clearly at odds with what the attorney 
general was told by the criminal division runkel said 
opr chief michael e shaheen does not have a listed telephone 
number and could not be reached for comment 
about two weeks after ms bravers broadcast that the fbi was 
conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations regarding 
personnel and expenditures in grays office the justice department 
stated that gray was not a target of the investigation and was 
cooperating with the probe 
gray who was elected whip said he had been told by fbi agents 
from the philadelphia office in a memorial day interview that they 
were looking into the possibility that one of his employees held a 
noshow job nothing more has been heard of that investigation 
thornburgh told biden that 11 fbi agents devoted approximately 
385 days to the investigation interviewing members of the us 
attorneys office in philadelphia the philadelphia division of the 
fbi fbi headquarters the criminal division and the attorney 
generals office 
he said about 30 other persons also were interviewed including 
members of congress aides to gray confidential sources and 
several reporters ms braver declined to be interviewed or 
otherwise cooperate with this investigation thornburgh said 
ms braver could be not reached for comment the cbs washington 
bureau said she was on vacation

the federal communications commission is 
investigating claims that some companies are charging backyard 
satellite dish owners as much as 20 times more than cable systems 
for the same tv programs 
the fcc said friday it had disturbing evidence that cable 
operators were receiving preferential treatment from satellite 
carriers for the programs cable operators provide by coaxial cable 
to their subscribers 
because this evidence raises serious concerns about the 
competitive nature of this market and the impact on consumers 
the commission said it would conduct an inquiry into the matter to 
determine if remedies were needed to protect the nations 25 
million dish owners 
this is a great victory said larry helland attorney for 
the valhalla nybased american home satellite association 
helland said the new fcc inquiry finally would force satellite 
companies to justify their rates to backyard dish owners 
the fccs decision for an inquiry grew out of an investigation 
of possible discrimination by satellite companies against 
distributors of tv network and socalled superstation programming 
congress in the 1988 satellite home viewer copyright act ordered 
the fcc study which the commission completed friday just before 
its dec 31 deadline 
the commission said that based upon the information it had 
gathered from nine companies the prices satellite carriers charged 
distributors did vary but the fcc could not determine that there 
was unjust or unreasonable discrimination 
it added we do not foreclose the possibility that cable 
operators are exercising undue market power to the detriment of 
earth station owners and distributors and that its new inquiry 
would look into that issue and take remedial action if necessary 
the fcc cited comments from the dish owners association and the 
national rural telecommunications cooperative an organization of 
550 rural electric cooperatives and small telephone systems in 47 
states that distributes a package of tv programming known as 
rural tv to 30000 backyard dish owners 
according to the telecommunications cooperative eastern 
microwave proposed to charge nrtc 134 per month per subscriber 
for the signal of wwor new york and wsbk boston the cooperative 
told the commission that eastern charges cable systems 18 cents to 
20 cents per month for wwor and wsbk 
eastern microwave in a letter to the cooperative said the 1988 
satellite act applied only to discrimination among distributors to 
earth station owners and that rates charged to other classes of 
users are irrelevant the commission said 
the cooperative also told the commission that southern satellite 
systems charges nrtc 79 cents per subscriber per month for 
superstation wtbs atlanta while offering the same service to 
cable systems for 4 cents to 10 cents per month per subscriber 
the cooperative said netlink charges 325 a month per 
subscriber for five denver network and superstation signals while 
denver cable systems get netlinks feed for 58 cents per subscriber 
per month 
our inquiry suggests that cable operators are paying 
substantially less than distributors to home earth stations for the 
same programming the fcc said the limited evidence that is in 
this record does not support a conclusion that the wide disparities 
between distributor and cable operator rates have been justified 
bob phillips chief executive officer of the national rural 
telecommunications cooperative said he was anxiously awaiting a 
further inquiry so we can establish the discrimination between the 
home dish market and the cable market and we can gain some 
relief 
backyard dish owners may pay from 3 to about 20 a month for tv 
programs and the average cost of the dish and descrambling 
equipment is about 2500

the red meat in crude plastic packs 
being carted into bucharests crowded dimly lighted stores looks 
unappetizing but for people accustomed to a diet of pigs feet it 
might as well be chateaubriand 
this isnt new ive stood in lines like this before said 
furniture worker marim ghedzu as he waited in a long queue for meat 
this week but theres almost never been anything like this in 
romania i would stand here even if the pieces were small 
under nicolae ceausescu this meat went for export much of it 
to the meatstarved soviet union in exchange for the raw materials 
needed to fuel the industries the dictator built to fulfill 
selfaggrandizing dreams of transforming agricultural romania into 
a major industrial state 
according to an economist writing in the daily newspaper 
adventarul this week at least 12 billion was wasted on 
investments in these projects 
for the most part this money was paid back through food exports 
to the west or the export of petrochemicals made with romanian oil 
and the raw materials from the soviets iran and anywhere else 
ceausescu could buy oil and gas in exchange for food 
romania once the breadbasket of southeastern europe became a 
land of ration cards and bare shelves emigres recall going six 
months without eating a piece of meat or even seeing butter 
that has changed since the anticeausescu revolt erupted dec 15 
in the western city of timisoara where demonstrators massacred by 
ceausescus security forces called for bread along with their 
freedom 
before he was executed ceausescu put food on the shelves in a 
lastditch attempt to appease his unruly populace 
it didnt work but the new government swiftly took measures to 
ensure the people who fought for freedom and ousted ceausescu dec 
22 felt some immediate relief from the burden of oppression and 
privation 
on dec 23 romanias new rulers announced they were ending 
rationing and food exports and lifting draconian restrictions on 
heating and lighting homes and offices 
corruption had always bent those and many other rules in romania 
under ceausescu but people nonetheless froze in homes and offices 
shivering in overcoats at their desks and donning gloves and hats 
to sit and watch the opera before it and all other public 
entertainments tv included shut down at 10 pm 
marin sorescu one of romanias bestknown writers proudly 
showed off his beautiful 19thcentury home in old bucharest friday 
at least now i can bring you in here because it is warm he 
beamed as snow swirled down outside 
citrus fruits unseen in ages have appeared on shop shelves 
butter previously rationed to as little as 7 ounces a month 
cheese unappetizinglooking sausage and even that previously 
unpurchasable luxury coffee are on sale 
western diplomats say the goods come from special warehouses 
where they were stored either for export or for distribution to the 
communist elite 
corneliu bogdan first deputy foreign minister in the new 
government said friday the leadership has tried to ease life 
without disrupting the national economy 
ending ration cards banning food exports and curbing oil 
exports fell into that category as did the popular decisions to 
declare jan 2 an extra new years holiday and extend students 
vacation by 11 days to jan 14 
more basic economic questions and overall strategy are not 
expected to be resolved until a new government takes power 
following free elections in april for that task romanians hope to 
avoid mistakes made in the earlier reforms of poland hungary and 
the soviet union 
silviu brucan a former foreign minister and member of the new 
leadership said last week romania should learn from the soviets 
and feed its people before reforming industry 
with romanias fertile soil that should be easier to achieve 
than in the soviet union where weather makes farming difficult and 
60 years of state agriculture have killed off most peasant 
traditions 
yet it may take a while before stores measure up even to the 
standards of 10 years ago 
on friday night a vegetable store that for three years has had 
virtually nothing to sell was offering potatoes beets leeks 
apples and dried fruit 
previously unseen lemons were being sold down the street 
its better but its not great said dina cristescu 22 
we are still waiting we are a country that waits always 
slushing around in the damp dirt left by shoppers braving a 
daylong snowstorm about 20 men and women jostled in a queue for 
the only other product on sale crude and unappetizing salami 
in between the vegetable and the salami shop another crowd 
waited for chocolate and sweets 
around the corner at least 40 people bearing the fruits of a 
days shopping waited in the dark street and muddy slush for the 
rare treasure of a taxi to get it all home

the navy is seriously considering limiting 
purchases of its prized 12 billion trident submarine to every 
other year in reaction to intense budget pressures for the new 
fiscal year a senior pentagon official says 
the service also is proposing to put two of its four battleships 
in mothballs as it fights to retain at least 14 aircraft carriers 
president bush is scheduled to deliver his 1991 budget to 
congress on jan 22 and he may be called upon to make the final 
calls on the controversial suggestions 
were robbing peter to pay paul the pentagon official said 
of the current budgetjuggling exercise he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the fiscal 1991 spending plan is considered a key barometer of 
the pentagons ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters 
on capitol hill and in the office of management and budget 
white house budget planners have told defense secretary dick 
cheney he can spend a little more than 292 billion in the new 
budget year which begins next oct 1 
the navy like other services is being forced to trim programs 
it deems successful such as the trident in order to meet these 
goals said the senior official 
asked whether the service was looking at stretching out the 
annual purchases of the strategic submarines to every other year 
the official said were seriously considering it 
the subs billiondollar price tag has made it easy prey for 
lawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclear 
weapons programs amid the warming of relations with the soviet 
union 
in november the electric boat division of general dynamics 
corp in groton conn won a contract to build the 17th trident 
submarine navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii has told capitol 
hill he expects to request full funding for the 18th trident 
submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget 
but due to its high cost and complexity funds for the submarine 
are stretched out over several years and garrett made no mention 
about longterm procurement funds for additional submarines 
id put my money on some type of stretchout said another 
defense department official asked about the trident programs 
future 
the official said it was premature to talk about an end to 
the program and said that if an everyotheryear purchase policy 
is adopted it may not even compromise the longterm number of 
submarines widely expected to be 24 
the services world war iiera battleships also have become 
targets of budget cutters on capitol hill particularly in the 
aftermath of last springs explosion aboard the uss iowa which 
claimed 47 sailors lives 
even the chief of naval operations adm carlisle a trost 
admitted at one congressional hearing that the future of the four 
warships was up for grabs in the budget debate but the navy 
leadership is loathe to let the warships go the senior official 
said 
nobody not the army not the marine corps not the navy 
wants to give those ships up the official contended arguing 
that their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a president 
calls for a little gunship diplomacy 
the 91 budget plan calls for putting two in mothballs but 
wed still have two and we want to hang onto those he said 
the official did not specify which of the four ships would be 
retired 
the second defense department official noted that congressional 
pressure may work against mothballing the battleships since their 
home ports were to be dispersed among four states under a revised 
program 
our phones rang off the hook from lawmakers unhappy about 
trosts suggestion of the ships possible demise the official said 
the senior official said the navy is fighting to save at least 
14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year 
one carrier the world war iiera midway is scheduled for 
retirement next year which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14 
tell me which commitment are we supposed to walk away from 
the official asked pointing out that the us commitment to sail 
the indian ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive persian 
gulf havent changed 
the official also said the navys requirements most probably 
will increase as the service is asked to place more power on the 
high seas to advance the nations war against illicit drug 
traffickers

the drug enforcement administration rejecting 
a recommendation of its own chief judge has refused to relax 
restrictions on marijuana 
the order by administrator john c lawn published friday in the 
federal register means that marijuana will continue to be listed 
under schedule i of the controlled substances act for substances 
with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical 
application where it has been classified since the act was passed 
in 1970 
norml the national organization for marijuana law reform 
petitioned three years ago to have the substance reclassified to 
schedule ii meaning it would remain unavailable to the general 
public but could be prescribed by doctors for limited purposes 
the deas chief administrative law judge francis l young 
recommended sept 6 1988 that marijuana be placed on the less 
restrictive schedule calling it one of the safest 
therapeutically active substances known to man 
young cited a number of medical experts and patients as saying 
marijuana helped suppress nausea and vomiting experienced by cancer 
patients receiving chemotherapy and was effective in controlling 
muscle spasms of patients with multiple sclerosis 
the evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has 
been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers 
of very ill people and doing so with safety under medical 
supervision young wrote it would be unreasonable arbitrary 
and capricious for dea to continue to stand between those sufferers 
and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this 
record 
lawn in his order said that young failed to act as an 
impartial judge in this matter 
he appears to have ignored the scientific evidence ignored 
the testimony of highly credible and recognized medical experts 
and instead relied on the testimony of psychiatrists and 
individuals who used marijuana the administrator said 
he also said that young in his findings of fact ignored any 
evidence presented by the government 
mr lawn found that there was a lack of credible evidence to 
support a conclusion that safety efficacy and acceptance had been 
demonstrated for the medical use of marijuana the dea said in a 
news release 
young could not be reached for comment 
donald fiedler national director of norml said the ruling 
is arbitrary and capricious because it means doctors now dont have 
that tool available to use marijuana as a medicine denying access 
to medicine to those who need it is hypocrisy in the worst sense 
the dea said physicians and scientists will be able to continue 
to file proposals with it and with the food and drug administration 
for further research on medical aspects of marijuana

the energy department after months of study 
has dismissed the possibility of any cracking in one of the three 
reactors at the savannah river nuclear weapons complex studies of 
the two other reactors are planned for next year 
the determination of no cracking in p reactor is a major gain 
for the department which is in the midst of a 166 billion 
program to repair and modernize the three reactors they have been 
closed for more than a year for safety reasons 
discovery of cracking in any of the reactor vessels likely would 
put them permanently out of service since the 35yearold vessels 
are virtually irreplaceable 
the savannah river reactors are the nations only source of 
tritium a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads tritium decays 
at a rate of 55 percent a year so supplies in warheads must be 
replenished periodically or the bombs cease to function 
barring any unforeseen problems such as vessel cracking energy 
secretary james d watkins hopes to restart k reactor by next fall 
the second l reactor by december 1990 and the third p reactor 
in the spring of 1991 
the savannah river complex is located near aiken sc 
last september engineers of westinghouse savannah river co 
which runs the plant under an energy department contract began 
using a sophisticated new technology called ultrasonic testing to 
check for cracks in the reactor vessels 
westinghouse and watkins initially said completion of the tests 
was not a precondition to restarting the reactors but watkins 
changed his mind in late september after westinghouse reported a 
potential sign of cracking in p reactor a few days later he 
announced that the irregularity was an existing weld repair that 
would not affect the reactors safety 
the p reactor testing was completed oct 30 
in fridays report on results of ultrasonic testing at p 
reactor westinghouse said there were no signs of cracking 
although several irregularities were found it said these 
irregularities were determined to be weld repairs done during 
manufacture of the vessel or other harmless abnormalities 
in no case do any of these findings represent a concern with 
respect to the structural integrity of the tank the report said 
in ultrasonic testing highfrequency sound waves are passed 
through the reactor vessel walls and any abnormalities including 
cracks show up as breaks in the waves 
becky apter a westinghouse spokeswoman said friday that 
ultrasonic testing at k reactor was scheduled to begin in 
midjanuary but that it probably would be set back a week or 10 
days because of delays in other work at the reactor

the agriculture department says farmers saw 
prices rise again in december and are winding up 1989 as a year of 
recordhigh prices eclipsing the old 12month record set five 
years ago 
prices farmers got for raw products rose 07 percent from 
november to december leaving the monthly average 21 percent above 
the level of december 1988 
higher prices for hogs cattle milk and eggs were mostly 
responsible for the increase from the november average the 
departments agricultural statistics board said friday in its final 
report of the year lower prices were reported for lettuce 
oranges cotton and broilers 
most of the price information was collected at midmonth before 
the latest freeze that swept into florida and texas destroying 
citrus and vegetable crops the preliminary figures will be revised 
next month 
the report said the december milk price was the highest on 
record and that the average for hogs was the highest since october 
1987 
john buche of the departments national agricultural statistics 
service said the preliminary 12month price average for all farm 
commodities about 147 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison 
is the highest on record 
the previous high index reading was 142 percent in 1984 he 
said the 1988 average was 138 percent 
no new figures were provided on prices farmers pay to meet 
expenses due to budget restrictions those are computed every 
three months in october the prices paid index averaged 29 
percent more than a year earlier 
on dec 20 the departments economic research service issued 
income estimates showing that net cash income of farmers in 1989 
may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 billion compared with a 
revised estimate of 572 billion in 1988 
department economists say the decline is due mostly to larger 
expenses as they put more land back into crops and to reduced 
federal payments 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
department projections for 1990 show net cash income likely 
will exceed 50 billion for the fourth consecutive year 
consumer food prices are estimated by usda economists to have 
risen about 57 percent this year the sharpest rise since 1981 
they project food prices may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990 
based on the preliminary figures the december price index for 
livestock and poultry rose 24 percent from november and averaged 
97 percent more than a year ago 
the meat animal portion of the index was up 29 percent from 
november and 84 percent from december 1988 dairy prices rose 25 
percent from november and 18 percent from a year ago 
department economists predict milk output will increase in 1990 
and that the record price levels will recede 
earlier friday the department announced a 50cent reduction in 
the federal price support of milk beginning jan 1 to 1010 per 
100 pounds the cut was ordered to help stem an expected rise in 
surplus production in 1990 
under the dairy price support program usda buys surplus butter 
cheese and nonfat dry milk to bolster the price of milk at the 
farm with a lower support for 1990 officials say less surplus 
production will be bought 
crop prices overall declined 16 percent from november and 81 
percent from december 1988 including lower prices for fruit 
commercial vegetables and cotton food grains wheat and rice 
were up 27 percent from november but averaged 19 percent below a 
year ago

the new panamanian government plans to present 
economic recovery proposals to the united states next week that 
will cover damages including looting that occurred when us troops 
overthrew dictator manuel antonio noriega says the new ambassador 
to the united states 
the new ambassador carlos rodriguez said friday night that 
panamanian experts working with an interagency us team have 
not quantified anything and we are not demanding anything 
asked about reports that war damage would amount to 3 billion 
to 10 billion he replied it is not possible to quantify 
matters with that degree of precision 
the economic recovery proposal was designed prior to the 
military action to restore panamas economy but it has been 
updated to reflect the military action rodriguez said in an 
interview 
there were damages including the chorillo area and merchants 
who suffered looting from the interruption in police services he 
said 
reports from panama say supporters of noriega set fire to the 
chorillo area inhabited by many poor people near his old 
headquarters some 13000 people took shelter in a nearby athletic 
complex 
the chamber of commerce in panama city has estimated damages 
from looting alone in that city at 2 billion 
a team of us experts already has gone to panama and hopes to 
make a presentation to the press on tuesday of the same 
proposals being put forward to the united states government 
rodriguez said 
us sanctions against the noriega regime over the past two 
years have caused that nations economy to shrink by an estimated 
10 percent to 15 percent annually some analysts have said 
some estimates put unemployment above 20 percent and the 
country of around 2 million people has a foreign debt estimated at 
56 billion 
cash totaling 50 million was flown into panama on friday from 
the united states part of frozen assets now released panama has 
no national currency of its own and uses us dollars for all its 
transactions

workers feel insecure about their jobs and worry 
about layoffs in 1990 an informal callin survey found and an 
economic forecaster called it a very reasonable fear 
about 600 of the 1100 people who phoned in during a oneday 
survey were employed and 44 percent of them felt 1990 would bring 
significant changes for them in the workplace said the surveys 
sponsor challenger gray amp christmas an international 
jobcounseling firm 
workers calling from as far away as los angeles detroit boston 
and philadelphia said they worried about losing jobs to hostile 
takeovers economic decline and cutbacks and foreign competition 
challenger said 
people are worried that the security they once had is no 
longer there john challenger sales and marketing director for 
the chicagobased company said friday 
the survey conducted thursday is unscientific because it 
reflects only the views of people who called in rather than a 
random sampling of the population 
an economist at the wefa group a consulting firm in bala 
cynwyd pa said the surveys results could be expected 
its a very reasonable fear said john hagens who 
specializes in shortterm economic forecasting there will be 
more cuts in 1990 and fewer new hires than weve had in 89 and 88 
and 87 
for the first time in many years the national unemployment 
rate will rise hagens predicted in a telephone interview 
the adjusted national unemployment rate stood at 54 percent in 
november 
layoffs and early retirement plans in bluechip companies like 
american telephone amp telegraph co and international business 
machines corp and throughout the computer and automobile 
industries are signals that growth in employment is slowing hagens 
said 
he predicted employment growth in 1990 will be only 15 percent 
about half the 1989 rate 
challenger with 16 offices in the united states and europe 
counsels people who have been fired and referred by their former 
companies each year during the week after christmas the firm 
advertises its telephone number and opens phone lines to counsel 
individuals for free 
the survey results are compiled from information the firm 
collects during the callin 
the majority 59 percent of the working callers to the survey 
were under 40 and earned an average of 30000 to 50000 said 
james challenger johns father and president of the company 
about 58 percent of the workers also indicated they would be 
willing to leave their city to find new work which shows americans 
learned to enlarge the scope of their job search during the last 
recession james challenger said 
unemployed workers who called 76 percent of whom were 30 or 
older worried they wont be able to find jobs quickly in 1990 and 
sought tips on job hunting and interviewing said ann marks a 
consultant at the company 
you hear real worry from people ms marks said its 
tough to be out of work any time but especially during the holiday 
season 
the average time a person went unemployed in 1989 was 32 
months she said but 85 percent to 90 percent found equal or 
better paying jobs 
workers who find themselves unemployed in 1990 need to be 
extremely aggressive in the narrowing and highly competitive job 
market ms marks said 
youve got to get plugging go out and see the employers and 
call if they dont she said

the christmas freeze that devastated 
much of south floridas winter vegetable crop has left thousands of 
migrant farm workers economically out in the cold 
families of workers from mexico and central america gather here 
each winter to pick crops from immokalee in south central florida 
to the tip of the peninsula hoping to pay their expenses and 
escape the bitter weather but this year they find themselves 
broke and unemployed 
they incur expenses coming down said ada rojas who helps 
migrant workers solve their problems once they get here they are 
in very bad shape christmas is gone by and they have very little 
money 
the record christmas weekend freeze killed up to 90 percent of 
the winter vegetable crops in south florida just as the migrants 
arrived the cold also heavily damaged the citrus of central 
florida but much of that can be turned to juice 
the crowd at the everglades labor camp on friday was signing 
petitions to get government help in paying their rent and for basic 
expenses while they wait the six to eight weeks for another round 
of vegetable crops to mature 
it hit at a very bad time said jeanee elswick director of 
the states migrant labor program 
about 2000 migrants live at the drab camp of white trailers 
lined up behind a chainlink fence amid open fields that border the 
everglades it is one of three camps for migrants in dade county 
florida officials want them to travel 200 miles north to help 
with a desperate citrus harvest but acknowledge the lack of 
housing would be a problem in the citrusrich counties 
migrants earn up to 35 on a productive day so affordable 
housing is critical 
trailers at the everglades camp rent for 50 a week but afford 
enough room for the large families of the farm workers 
food stamps were already being distributed in the camp 
were not satisfied only with food stamps said ramon 
salinas a veteran of the camp if we have to go all the way to 
tallahassee we will we have to pay rent utilities buy clothes 
for the kids 
the idle crowd at the everglades camp included bored children 
wearing mickey mouse shirts and grandmothers in sneakers ready to 
work many of the families have up to six and seven children 
gov bob martinez declared a disaster statewide thursday and 
asked the federal government to approve lowinterest loans for 
farmers but hes still collecting information before asking for a 
presidential disaster declaration that could bring emergency 
unemployment benefits 
the freeze also idled about 15000 farmworker families in texas 
rio grande valley plans to open four centers for displaced 
agricultural workers have been postponed while the american red 
cross the texas department of human services and hidalgo county 
work out details 
about 60 percent of the rio grande valleys 80 million citrus 
crop was lost to the freeze 80 percent or 20 million worth of 
the regions remaining vegetable crop was destroyed

the countrys revolutionary leadership 
scrapped harsh food and gasoline rationing rules enforced by 
executed dictator nicolae ceausescu but invited other communists to 
join in reshaping romania 
the governing council of the national salvation committee which 
took power dec 22 during a popular uprising backed by the army 
moved to take full control of the country friday and to prepare it 
for free elections set for april 
it also promised to remain in the sovietled warsaw pact 
military alliance and to honor other international commitments 
meanwhile the army said it had begun to try ceausescu loyalists 
who waged fierce battles against army forces and citizens during 
the revolt 
romanias interim president ion iliescu signed decrees to lift 
rules allowing motorists only 8 gallons of gasoline a month and 
another that eliminated food rationing that kept people from eating 
meat for months at a time 
the government also halted food exports a key part of 
ceausescus harsh economic policies and citrus fruits coffee and 
other items have appeared on store shelves for the first time in 
ages 
iliescu also did away with a rule that banned private citizens 
from meeting with foreigners or from offering them board and 
lodging 
earlier in the day the revolutionary government changed the 
countrys official name from the socialist republic of romania 
to just romania and removed the communist symbol from the flag 
however budapest radio in hungary quoted iliescu as saying in 
an interview that members of the communist party will have a role 
in a new democratic romania 
we are in a situation in which we have to ask all of our 
societys forces to act in unity and to join forces iliescu said 
many communist party members are indispensible he said 
ionescu told a news conference that several thousand forces 
loyal to ceausescu had surrendered or been captured 
however several hundred other members of ceausescus dreaded 
securitate remained in hiding defying an order to surrender or 
face execution said cazimir ionescu a vice president in the 
national salvation committees 145member governing council 
the council had ordered the securitate holdouts to surrender by 
500 pm thursday or face death 
the military council which takes orders from the fledgling 
government issued a last call for surrender by 
antirevolutionary forces it said those who refuse to do so will 
face trial and be summarily sentenced 
an army statement said its forces were in full control in all 
parts of the country and that military tribunals set up to 
try the special police forces had begun their work and will 
continue to try all acts of terrorism 
it gave no indication of how many trials had been held 
romanias uprising began on dec 15 with demonstrations in 
timisoara the protests spread and ceausescu and his wife elena 
fled their palace in bucharest on dec 22 after the army sided with 
the citizens 
the couple was captured a day later then shuttled about in a 
constantly moving armored car for the last three days of their 
lives britains independent television news said it quoted capt 
mihail lupoi identified as a senior army official as saying that 
ceausescu was kept in the moving car to prevent rescue attempts 
the ceausescus were executed monday after they were convicted at 
a secret trial of crimes against the state during his 24year rule 
romanias former defense minister was given a heros funeral on 
friday gen vasile milea died of a gunshot wound dec 22 senior 
officers have said 
before fleeing ceausescu had denounced milea and claimed he had 
committed suicide but romanias new leaders say he was executed 
for refusing to order army troops to fire on demonstrators 
mileas funeral in a small hall at the military academy was 
shown on national tv 
the new leadership received support and recognition friday from 
several western countries including the united states a special 
envoy of president francois mitterrand of france met with first 
deputy president dumitru mazilu 
romanias new leaders are likely to meet the leaders of the six 
other warsaw pact countries for the first time in sofia bulgaria 
on jan 9 
the sovietled eastern trading bloc comecon also meets for its 
annual congress on that day 
it will be the first time that the leaders of the seven warsaw 
pact countries will gather since all of their nations embraced 
democratic reforms

student demonstrators who helped 
topple communist dictator nicolae ceausescu say they will take to 
the streets again if the provisional government strays from the 
path of democracy 
students were among the antigovernment protesters who shouted 
down ceausescu at an official rally in palace square on dec 21 
and they were among those killed when security forces opened fire 
now in the days following the ouster and execution of ceausescu 
the students say they have an obligation to those who have fallen 
to guarantee the reforms 
we dont have any weapons but to protest we can do nothing 
but strike said diana ghionea an education student and veteran 
of the bloody demonstrations that helped trigger the revolution 
we have two representatives in the provisional government if 
they the others dont listen to them we will be organizing a 
protest and a strike said diana voicu another young veteran 
student demonstrations are new to a country where ceausescu 
crushed dissent movements during his autocratic 24year rule 
its nobility around here to be able to say you were in the 
square on thursday said ms ghionea referring to the day they 
shouted down the dictator 
i was almost killed three times over that weekend but my 
friends saved me pulling me aside in the shooting she said 
older romanians praise the students for their courage telling 
reporters that nothing would have started would have been 
possible without the students 
but the students worry that the people will settle for too 
little they hope for the best from the selfproclaimed provisional 
government but intend to hold it to its promise of free elections 
and national reform 
there is change now the people are so happy to get rid of 
ceausescu that they think anything will be better said ms 
ghionea 
we didnt have food until now and now we have tv we had only 
two hours of tv now we have eight the old people think this is 
freedom they think what do the students want this is not 
freedom 
other students at the university nodded approval as the young 
women told reporters that the students have a debt to all of those 
who died in overthrowing the dictatorship 
the students met thursday to form the democratic student league 
a group they say will push for educational reform and seek 
educational assistance from abroad for the university 
ms ghionea and ms voicu insisted the league would be 
apolitical seeking only to improve the educational system it 
seeks to shorten the hours in class from 10 to eight a day to 
raise education standards to end political interference in the 
curriculum and end compulsory military training for women 
ceausescu wanted to keep us in class so long that we would not 
have time to meet and to think said ms voicu 
the students said they will not allow the league to become an 
instrument of their political dissent because educational reforms 
are so vital 
but they emphasize that does not mean the students will not 
become political that they will not take to the streets again to 
try to preserve their vision of the revolution 
ms ghionea echoes the voices of so many other older romanians 
we cant go back again she says we cant

the national institutes of health is scrapping 
proposed conflictofinterest guidelines that stirred controversy 
among scientists and will begin laboring anew to draft new options 
officials say 
the guidelines proposed for the federal research agency last 
september were an attempt to ensure the integrity of 
governmentfunded projects by preventing researchers from having a 
financial interest in the outcome of their work 
but many scientists said the proposal would hamper efforts to 
turn academic research into commercial products and could cost the 
united states its competitive edge in biomedical research 
the proposal suggested that nih grant recipients disclose their 
and their families financial interests and said governmentfunded 
researchers should have no equity interest in any company that 
would benefit from their research it also proposed barring 
researchers from sharing information with companies until it is 
publicly available 
nih received more than 600 comments on the proposal said nih 
spokeswoman ann thomas 
dr louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and 
human services said friday that he has asked nih to submit to him 
new options that properly treat potential abuse while keeping the 
research process free of unnecessary burdens and disincentives

to come and heal the centers founder says 
this is about americans helping americans veterans helping 
veterans ken smith president of the vietnam veterans workshop 
in boston said friday in announcing the opening of the shelter 
all these guys ever wanted to do is come home he said 
smith who was overcome by emotion as he made his remarks was 
surrounded by fellow veterans as he stood in the room that will be 
home to the shelter starting jan 8 
this is my dream and its very unusual to see your dreams 
come to fruition he said 
the vacant downtown facility had been a clinic run by the 
veterans administration it was awarded to the boston veterans 
group under federal legislation that provides excess government 
property for helping the homeless 
the shelter will have space for 100 beds and it will offer 
counseling on drug and alcohol abuse housing job searches and 
veterans benefits the shelter also plans to offer workshops on the 
history of vietnam to help veterans understand their involvement in 
the war 
this is a place to come and heal to come heal the pain and 
network with other veterans smith said 
mayor raymond flynn who participated in the ceremony noted 
that the veterans who returned from world war ii were greeted with 
many federal programs to ease their adjustment 
yet at the same time there was no period when we have had as 
little money spent on housing as the time when the vietnam vet came 
back to america flynn said 
about 1200 veterans in boston are homeless and about 30 
percent of the nations homeless are veterans smith said 
i work in an ambulance at night and i see a lot of homeless 
veterans smith said i was finding my brothers sleeping on 
grates seeing people sleep under the bu boston university 
bridge 
many still suffer the mental effects of combat violence he 
said and others are too proud to seek help 
but he said the homeless shelter should help people overcome any 
shame since they will encounter and be assisted by other veterans 
the shelter will operate with volunteers and private donations 
officials estimate the annual cost of running the shelter will be 
at least 350000 
one of the volunteers at the shelter eric morse of cambridge 
was himself a homeless veteran until smiths group helped him find 
a job and a place to live last year 
during the time he was homeless morse said he roamed the 
streets and went to different shelters but he had trouble finding 
anyone to help him 
veterans care for each other more he said

president daniel ortega in managua friday night also ordered 
the embassy to cut its service and administrative staff from 320 
people to 100 people it was not known how many staffers are 
american 
ortega said the diplomats will be given 72 hours to leave the 
country after their names are made public 
it was not immediately known if the head of the embassy charge 
daffairs john leonard was among those to be ordered to leave 
nicaraguas ambassador to panama antenor ferrey said american 
troops searched his residence for about two hours he said he and 
several other people waited outside during that time

us embassy and military officials said they had no information

american troops have surrounded the embassy since the dec 20 
invasion that toppled dictator manuel antonio noriega but they had 
not assembled outside the the residence a cluster of three homes 
in an uppermiddle class neighborhood people living near the 
residence said friday they heard gunfire and shouts ordering people 
to come out of the residence 
ferrey said ortega told him by telephone that nicaraguas 
sandinista government planned to protest the incident at the united 
nations and the organization of american states 
ortega said in announcing the expulsions that the incident was 
unheard of they acted arrogantly like rambos 
this violates the principal foundations of the 
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions ferrey told a news 
conference the north americans are going to pay for it 
ferrey said he returned from nicaraguas embassy at 610 pm 
est to discover about 60 us troops had cordoned off several 
blocks surrounding the residence 
the unidentified us army colonel told ferrey to go inside the 
residence then the troops used a megaphone to order everyone 
inside to evacuate within five minutes ferrey said 
the colonel said he had been given orders to search the 
residence for weapons ferrey said a us c130 transport plane 
and a helicopter flew overhead 
the nicaraguans eventually came outside and about 30 of the 
american soldiers went inside ferrey said adding he was prevented 
from accompanying the troops they searched the whole house he 
said 
ferrey described the five rifles as only light arms used to 
defend ourselves 
he said the colonel ordered the arms placed in a us military 
truck but later gave them back and apologized saying there had 
been a mistake 
the troops left the area of the residence shortly before 930 
pm est ferrey said the us troops had fired shots into the air 
before he arrived 
in the nicaraguan capital of managua a staterun voice of 
nicaragua report cited embassy employees as saying the troops 
fired in the air and intimidated the people inside and forced 
them to come out with their arms in the air 
on thursday cuba protested that its ambassador and another 
diplomat had been detained an hour by troops surrounding the cuban 
embassy us officials denied the ambassador had been detained and 
said the other official had forgotten his diplomatic credentials 
which eventually were retrieved 
a senior us embassy official said thursday that under the 
terms of the vienna convention governing diplomatic procedures 
us troops had the right to search those entering and leaving 
missions for weapons and nondiplomatic personnel

that 20 american diplomats will be expelled in retaliation for an 
incident at the nicaraguan embassy in panama 
ortega also ordered the embassy to cut its service and 
administrative staff from 320 people to 100 people it was not 
immediately known how many are american 
the 20 diplomats will be given 72 hours to leave nicaragua after 
their names are made public ortega said in the announcement 
broadcast nationwide by a government radio network 
the announcement came just hours after nicaraguas amabassador 
to panaman antenor ferrey said us troops surrounded his 
residence in panama city ordered all personnel inside to evacuate 
and searched the building for weapons 
ortega called the diplomatic incident unheard of 
the troops seized five rifles inside the residence that ferrey 
said were there for selfdefense a us army colonel in charge of 
the operation later apologized and returned the rifles ferrey said 
they acted arrogantly like rambos ortega said of the 
incident we were at grave risk a politicalmilitary clash with 
the united states which has maintained an aggressive attitude 
against latin american countries 
ortega claimed the us soldiers stole more than 2000 and 
took away some clothes from the residence 
us embassy and military officials said they had no information 
on the incident 
ortegas announcement also said the us embassy will be forced 
to compact its 220 of its personnel of 320 leaving only 100 in 
service this was taken to mean that another 220 embassy 
employees mostly nicaraguan administrative and service personnel 
will also be forced to leave their jobs 
it was not immediately clear if the embassy had that many 
support personnel the phones of the embassy and the homes of 
several senior officers were either not answered or rang busy 
us diplomatic representation in nicaragua was lowered when 
ortegas leftist sandinista regime expelled ambassador richard 
melton and eight other american diplomats in july 1988 accusing 
them of meddling in nicaraguas affairs 
the government accused the diplomats of inciting street 
demonstrations against the sandinista regime the us denied the 
accusation 
since then the embassy has been headed by charge daffairs john 
leonard and relations have not been too cordial 
diplomatic tension between the countries has been increasing 
since us troops invaded panama on dec 20 and deposed strongman 
manuel antonio noriega 
american troops have been surrounding the nicaraguan embassy 
offices in panama city along with those of the cuban and libyan

the united states praised the vatican 
on friday for its efforts to ease gen manuel antonio noriega out 
of the vatican mission where he has taken refuge and us forces 
detained two more top aides to the increasingly isolated former 
dictator 
the vatican said however it would take steps which it did 
not specify if us harassment of the papal embassy and noriega 
does not stop 
the nuncio is doing his best to convince general noriega to 
abandon the nunciature on his own by himself said joaquin 
navarro vatican spokesman in rome at the same time he cannot 
force noriega to leave nor can he consign him to us forces 
for noriega leaving the embassy would be tantamount to 
surrendering to us troops posted 10 feet from the gate the 
troops are inspecting all cars including that of papal nuncio 
sebastian laboa 
president guillermo endara said he expects noriega to be 
invited out of the nuniciature soon thats what we want he said 
this would be within days 
us forces detained noriegas personal doctor and chief 
economic adviser bringing to six the number of top aides that have 
been arrested or have surrendered by leaving the embassy the last 
48 hours those reported in custody include michael harari an 
israeli security adviser and close aide to noriega 
late in the afternoon us troops turned down the volume on 
music that has been blaring through the neighborhood around the 
embassy the music was still loud but not as deafening at 150 
yards as before 
us troops later surrounded the residence of nicaraguan 
ambassador antenor ferrey and refused to let reporters within 100 
yards shots were fired nearby but their origin could not be 
determined 
the ambassador at an evening news conference said all personnel 
inside were ordered to evacuate and the premises were searched for 
weapons 
this violates the principal foundations of the 
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions ferrey said the 
north americans are going to pay for it 
in nicaragua later friday president daniel ortega said 20 
american diplomats will be expelled in retaliation for the 
incident which he called unheard of 
ortega also said the us embassy will be forced to compact 
its 220 of its personnel of 320 leaving only 100 in service it 
was not immediately known how many are american 
ferrey said american troops that searched the building for about 
two hours seized five rifles inside the residence ferrey said the 
guns were for selfdefense 
a us army colonel in charge of the operation later apologized 
and returned the rifles ferrey said 
the troops left the area about 930 pm est after staying about 
four hours witnesses said more than 60 troops had arrived at the 
residence in trucks and armored cars 
us embassy spokesman william barr said he knew nothing of the 
incident air force col ronald sconyers at southern command also 
said he had no information 
in a separate incident a cuban diplomat press attache jorge 
sosa chacon was briefly detained by american soldiers and then 
released it was the second such detention in as many days at the 
cuban embassy 
the first members of the countrys new security forces were 
patrolling streets friday a us military source said most had 
been members of noriegas dismantled defense forces although 
nearly all noriegas top officers are believed jailed in military 
installations run by the united states 
also friday the remains of an american teacher were discovered 
in panama and his daughter blamed panamanians for his death 
the american the third us civilian to die since the conflict 
began was identified by his daughter as raymond dragseth a 
teacher at the panama canal college a defense department facility 
dragseth was reported to be the uncle of richard paul a defense 
department dependent who was killed a week ago an american who was 
working in panama as a school teacher candy helin was killed 
shortly after the invasion began 
carolyn dragseth appearing at a news conference from panama 
broadcast by cnn television blamed panamanians for the abduction 
of her father saying they just took my father i dont know 
why 
they came here looking for americans she said cnn said 
raymond dragseth was abducted from the familys apartment several 
hours after the american invasion began dec 20 
at the united nations the general assembly adopt a resolution 
by a 7520 friday that strongly deplores the us invasion 
sponsored by nicaragua and cuba the resolution demands the 
withdrawal of 26000 us troops and calls the military action a 
flagrant violation of international law 
the new panamanian government under endara voted against the 
resolution 
in other developments estimates of the damage in the looting 
spree that tore through panama city after the attack climbed to 2 
billion according to the chamber of commerce 
panamanians continued working to recover from the chaos and 
destruction that followed the us invasion newspapers ran ads 
asking people who looted merchandise to bring back the goods and 
offered rewards with no questions asked 
the toppled strongman was holed up inside the twostory embassy 
keeping largely to his room and speaking to few people according 
to a parish priest familiar with conditions inside the nunciature 
speaking at a news conference endara said noriega is staying 
in the same room sleeping in the same bed watching the same 
television i watched when i took refuge there endara also took 
refuge at the embassy after noriegas henchman botched the may 7 
presidential election won by endara 
endara also announced 50 million had been flown in by plane 
from the united states friday as part of the panamanian assets 
released after being frozen by the bush administration last year to 
pressure noriega economically 
during the night the troops flooded the embassy with light and 
on friday added a loudspeaker to their outdoor stereo system 
the music which includes rap and rock prevents journalists in 
a nearby hotel from eavesdropping but the noise also seems intended 
to get on noriegas nerves and includes numerous taunting songs 
navarro said disturbances created by us troops were not 
helping talks and hinted measures would be taken 
if this is going to continue further steps will be taken by 
the vatican navarro said without elaborating 
in corpus christi texas where president bush is vacationing 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater played down the deadlock 
its a very difficult situation very tense circumstances 
they are managing a difficult situation fitzwater told reporters 
for the first time since the invasion there was no fighting 
reported 
when noriega showed up at the papal nunciature christmas eve he 
created a diplomatic problem for all sides 
the united states and panama say noriega is a criminal wanted 
on drug trafficking charges in florida not a political refugee 
and therefore the nuncio has no obligation to keep him

an appeals court has overturned the murder 
conviction of a man who said police beat him and put a plastic bag 
over his head to make him confess 
the court said that when a defendant is injured in custody the 
prosecution must show by clear and convincing evidence that the 
injuries were not inflicted as a means of producing the 
confession 
a threejudge panel of the 1st district illinois court of 
appeals ruling thursday ordered a new trial for gregory banks 
banks testified that while police interrogated him in 1983 sgt 
john byrne hit him with a flashlight while his hands were 
handcuffed behind his back and stuck a pistol in his mouth 
threatening to shoot 
banks also said sgt peter dignan then a detective said we 
have something for niggers then put a plastic bag over his head 
for more than a minute while detective charles grunhard kicked him 
banks said that when dignan put the bag over his head again about 
10 minutes later he confessed 
dignan testified he tackled banks when he tried to escape while 
handcuffed but the appellate court cited testimony from a doctor 
at cook county hospital that banks injuries werent of a type that 
would be inflicted in a tackle 
dignan said people convicted of murder often claim they were 
brutalized and called the allegation that police used a plastic 
bag ridiculous 
banks is a huge fellow and hes guilty as sin dignan said 
he did flee and i tackled him i got an elbow in the face and i 
punched back 
banks was convicted in 1984 of robbing and killing leon barkan 
in a drugrelated dispute cook county circuit judge robert l 
sklodowski sentenced him to 50 years in prison 
sklowodski said that in making his ruling he had to evaluate 
the credibility of the witnesses he said he took into account the 
fact that banks was appearing in repeat offenders court were 
defendents have two previous felony convictions

by us troops of the nicaraguan ambassadors residence in panama

given the us diplomats 72 hours to leave the country 
he also said he had ordered the us mission to reduce its 
support staff from 320 people to 100 many people who work at the 
embassy are nicaraguan nationals 
a nicaraguan government source said there were about 35 
accredited us diplomatic personnel in nicaragua 
attempts to reach us embassy officials by telephone were not 
immediately successful 
earlier friday nicaraguan ambassador antenor ferrey said us 
troops surrounded his residence ordered all personnel to evacuate 
and searched the premises for weapons us officials said they had 
no information on the incident 
they acted arrogantly like rambos ortega said we were 
at grave risk of a politicalmilitary clash with the united states 
which has maintained an aggressive attitude against latin american 
countries 
ferrey said he and nine other people waited outside the 
residence while about 30 american troops searched the building for 
about two hours 
the soldiers seized five rifles that ferrey said were there for 
selfdefense a us army colonel in charge of the operation later

nicaraguan government sources who insisted on anonymity said 
that foreign minister miguel descoto was conducting unspecified 
diplomatic contacts with us charge daffaires john leonard 
the foreign ministers of spain and mexico and venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez 
the sources said descoto also contacted top officials at the 
united nations and the organization of american states but the 
sources refused to give details concerning these contacts 
leonard is the top us diplomat in nicaragua 
the united states has not had an ambassador to managua since 
july 1988 when the leftist sandinista government expelled 
ambassador richard melton and seven other american diplomats to 
protest alleged american interference in an opposition rally in the 
city of nandaime 
the united states responded by expelling nicaraguan ambassador 
carlos tunnerman 
diplomatic tensions between the two countries increased after 
the dec 20 us invasion of panama and the overthrow of gen 
manuel antonio noriega the sandinistas placed the armed forces on 
maximum alert after the invasion 
american troops surrounded the nicaraguan cuban and libyan 
embassies in panama city following speculation that pronoriega 
loyalists had sought refuge in the missions 
nicaragua responded by briefly positioning military units around 
the us embassy in managua then withdrew them 
earlier this week the sandinista government barred a state 
department plane from making its monthly supply run to the us 
embassy in managua the aircraft normally carries mail books and 
supplies for the embassy px

the head of the communist party renewed his 
attack on reform movements while officials took steps to halt 
students display of support for romanias revolution 
the chinese communist party and china are at a critical moment 
and we should continue to keep the domestic political situation 
stable party general secretary jiang zemin said friday 
the fight against bourgeoisliberalism is a longterm and 
strenuous task he told a party forum in a speech described as 
important by the official radio and television which reported on 
it at length a summary was issued by the xinhua news agency 
it was jiangs first publicized speech since romanias hardline 
communist leadership was ousted last week by a popular uprising 
chinese college students celebrated by putting up several protest 
posters 
authorities since have increased surveillance and political 
study 
jiang said the party showed its strength by crushing 
prodemocracy protests in june and smashing the efforts by 
hostile foreign forces to foist on china a socalled peaceful 
evolution away from socialism 
bourgeoisliberalism is the catchphrase for western democratic 
ideas in private chinese party officials have denounced eastern 
europes turn from communist rule as bourgeoisliberal and 
revisionist 
in his publicized comments jiang did not mention romania or the 
democratic changes that have swept the rest of eastern europe 
however his remarks appeared to be directed at the challenge 
presented by these changes 
he also said the party needs to perfect its leadership and 
strengthen ideological education and discipline 
the rampant corruption which has come to public notice in 
recent years has aroused the discontent of the masses jiang 
said and effective measures should be adopted to resume the 
close ties the party once maintained with the masses of the 
people 
despite repeated campaigns in recent years however the party 
has shown itself unable to wipe out corruption stemming from party 
members privileged position in society 
xinhua said jiang stressed that the party should trust the 
masses of the people and depend on them absolutely however 
police have stepped up patrols on beijing college campuses since 
the romanian uprising

police said today they believe vietnamese boat 
people may torch their detention centers or take hostages to 
prevent authorities from forcibly repatriating them to their 
impoverished homeland 
police also said officers may have to open fire on boat people 
if violence in the squalid camps worsens 
the comments came one day after boat people in the chi ma wan 
detention center armed with molotov cocktails homemade swords and 
stones attacked security forces sent to conduct a weapons search 
if police are attacked in closed quarters police will be 
justified to open fire barry deegan deputy regional commander 
of the marine police said at a news conference on the riot 
about half of the 3227 boat people at the camp already have 
been denied refugee status and are considered illegal immigrants 
facing forced repatriation 
the hong kong government claims they do not qualify for refugee 
status because they did not flee persecution but instead sailed 
into this british colony to seek a better life 
since a first group of 51 boat people were forcibly repatriated 
earlier this month there have been several demonstrations against 
the program at chi ma wan and other camps 
police issued a statement today that said male inmates are 
believed to have prepared a number of contingency plans to counter 
any moves by the authorities to remove them 
such plans include lighting fires inside the camps stoning 
the authorities arming themselves with homemade weapons and 
possible hostage taking the statement said 
deegan said some of these tactics were used friday by boat 
people who threw stones 40 molotov cocktails and burning blankets 
at police and prison officers other vietnamese used swords and 
lances 
police fired more than 140 tear gas cannisters to disperse the 
mob deegan said fourteen boat people and 24 police officers and 
guards were injured twentyfive vietnamese were arrested 
prison officers found more than 700 weapons many made from 
water pipes laundry racks and bed posts 
about 44000 vietnamese who sailed into hong kong after midjune 
1988 face repatriation if they cannot prove they fled persecution 
some 12000 others in the camps who arrived earlier were 
automatically granted refugee status and can be resettled overseas

about 33000 japanese crowded into tokyos 
international airport as the new year holiday exodus began and 
about 420000 people are expected to head for hawaii hong kong and 
other vacation spots 
the estimated total is up 106 percent from the same period a 
year earlier said akihiro furukawa of the japan travel bureau a 
major japanese travel agency 
government officials have said travel represents one of the most 
promising areas for japan to increase its imports and offset 
its trade surpluses 
japans travel deficit stood at 19 billion in 1988 when the 
countrys merchandise trade surplus reached 95 billion according 
to japanese figures 
the transportation ministry said friday an estimated 964 
million japanese have traveled abroad this year up 142 percent 
from a year ago 
hawaii is the most popular new year destination expected to 
draw 68000 japanese travel agents say another 49000 are bound 
for the us west coast and 13000 for canada they said 
other popular destinations are taiwan south korea singapore 
thailand and the south pacific 
many japanese never take the vacations to which they are 
entitled meaning their only time off from work comes during the 
new year holiday and a string of public holidays in late april and 
early may with perhaps some vacation days used to stretch those 
periods 
many companies remain closed this year from friday through 
thursday although some japanese began their travels last weekend 
the average japanese will spend 2800 if souvenir shopping is 
included on an average sixday stay abroad furukawa said 
a booming domestic economy is fueling the travel surge he said 
this countrys strong currency makes foreign travel relatively 
cheaper for japanese too the japanese yen has climbed from about 
242 yen to the dollar in late 1985 to the current 143 yen

a gas explosion at a power station named 
hellgate shot balls of flame hundreds of feet into the sky blacked 
out thousands of buildings and traffic lights and brought subways 
to a halt 
two people were killed and 30 injured 
it was like the war of the worlds everybody was 
panicking said angel rivera 27 who rode a bus through bronx 
streets that were left without traffic signals friday afternoon 
it was a real scary sight 
an estimated 450000 subway commuters joined the chaos on the 
streets when trains were stopped because the signals went out 
electricity to the subway tracks was uninterrupted and 
conducters brought the trains slowly to the nearest station where 
transit workers guided commuters out of darkened stations with 
flashlights 
power was blacked out for five hours to more than 130000 
customers in a twosquaremile area on manhattans upper east side 
and in a threesquaremile area of the bronx 
while large parts of the city were unaffected the upper east 
side and the bronx were clogged with huge traffic jams as the 
blackout shut off traffic signals by rush hour traffic officers 
were posted at many intersections 
the power loss stopped subway service throughout the bronx and 
part of manhattan for more than six hours and delayed commuter 
trains to neighboring westchester county and connecticut 
a pillar of smoke was visible throughout the metropolitan area 
from the fire at consolidated edison cos hellgate station on the 
east river in the bronx 
authorities said a utility workers backhoe ruptured a 26inch 
natural gas line causing the explosion heat from the fire melted 
the backhoe about 50 cars also were destroyed 
outside the power plant the body of lou seminerio a mechanic 
in his 50s was found about 25 feet from the backhoe it was 
unclear if he was the one operating the machine said utility 
spokeswoman laurie hanson 
a teenage boy suffered a heart attack when he jumped into the 
frigid east river to escape the flames and he died friday night 
said capt jeffrey armstrong of emergency medical services six of 
the 30 people who suffered injuries were seriously hurt he said 
the explosion left a crater 25 feet wide and 10 feet deep 
we heard a roar saw a ball of fire and the building started 
to shake said jay escudero 44 who was in a lunchroom at a 
depot a quartermile away when the gas line ruptured 
when he and other workers ran outside you could feel the heat 
where we were standing three or four hundred yards away 
escudero said it sounded like when thunder hits but the roar 
instead of subsiding like with thunder kept getting louder and 
louder 
the roar sounded like niagara falls said john mulligan a 
fire department spokesman 
bronx borough president fernando ferrer said the explosion 
unleashed all hell 
hundreds of firefighters some in fire boats battled the blaze 
in freezing weather 
about an hour after the explosion workers cut off the gas 
feeding the fire by closing three valves on the gas main utility 
spokeswoman pat richardi said 
when the valve was turned the flames got smaller and smaller 
and smiles got bigger and bigger said paul laddomada 41 who 
works for the department of environmental protection a halfmile 
from plant 
hellgate station is a former generating plant that controls 
electrical service for parts of the bronx and manhattan and is a 
crossover point for gas and power lines richardi said it is near 
hell gate a section of the east river known for its dangerous 
currents 
the fire spared the switching station itself but the intense 
heat ruined several power lines causing the power outages 
people flooded hardware stores in search of flashlights 
batteries and candles when regular candles ran out they bought 
birthday candles some restaurants coped by lighting candles 
others closed 
at the metropolitan museum of art about 20000 people found 
themselves groping in semidarkness relieved only by emergency 
lights guards flashlights and light from skylights most museum 
visitors remained calm 
were troupers weve certainly had our share of blackouts in 
new york said marianne ranick and its another story for the 
end of 1989

workers slowed by huge slabs of 
concrete today searched for more victims of australias most 
destructive earthquake and police said they believed there were 
six bodies in the debris of one building 
ten people are known to have been killed in thursdays quake 
and 142 were injured 
demolition crews today started bulldozing heavily damaged 
buildings and 100 more army troops were dispatched to patrol 
streets and prevent looting in newcastle a major industrial center 
75 miles north of sydney police said at least 50 buildings may 
have to be torn down 
the temblor measured 55 on the richter scale and seismologists 
called it unusually strong for australia 
rescue efforts centered on the newcastle workers club where 
two floors collapsed onto a basement parking lot during the 
earthquake 
police said the work was hampered today because the concrete 
slabs that formed the floor were so heavy a wall also threatened 
to collpase 
police spokeswoman jo watts said the bodies workers expected to 
recover were in this wreckage however workers did not expect to 
reach the bodies until sunday she said 
there are also nine cars in the basement but weve located and 
contacted seven of the owners two we couldnt get the numbers 
of she said 
ms watts said the 10 victims already identified were local 
people 
emergency teams which have been working nonstop since the 
quake hit had an especially tiring day 
they started to remove sections of the wall where they believe 
people are trapped but it started to give way because of the time 
spent trying to remove the heavy concrete slabs 
initial estimates put the damage at 1 billion and an official 
of the australian insurance industry council said the damage could 
run into hundreds of millions of dollars 
australias biggest earthquake was at meeberrie in remote 
western australia in 1941 and measured 77 on the richter scale a 
gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the 
ground motion recorded on a seimograph 
every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in 
magnitude a quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage and 
one measuring 6 can cause severe damage

the soviet union china and spain joined 
most latin american nations in condemning the us invasion of 
panama and demanding a swift withdrawal of us troops 
on a vote of 7520 with 40 abstentions the general assembly on 
friday passed a resolution that deeply deplores the dec 20 
invasion and calls the action a flagrant violation of 
international law 
general assembly resolutions are not binding and have no legal 
force but they carry moral weight as the will of the international 
community 
us ambassador m james wilkinson said before the vote that the 
resolution was unbalanced he said it failed to mention the alleged 
drug trafficking crimes of ousted dictator manuel antonio noriega 
and his suppression of democracy 
the united states has no interest in military presence in 
panama beyond our obligations under the canal treaties wilkinson 
said the forces recently deployed will withdraw as rapidly as 
panamanian forces can restore security we are confident this will 
take place in a short time 
he said the international community should recognize that the 
freely expressed will of the panamanian people has opted decisively 
for the president guillermo endara government and rejected the 
despotic drug trafficker manuel noriega 
endara was believed to be have won the panamanian elections 
earlier this year but the results were voided by noriega who is 
holed up in the vatican embassy in panama 
later panamanian envoy leon abadi abadi who switched sides 
from noriega to endara denounced noriega as a narcoterrorist 
who placed his interest above those of the panamanian people the 
career diplomat denounced the tyrant dictator who rejected the 
democratic election of may 7 
panama voted against the resolution and cuba denounced abadi 
for changing sides 
countries the sided with the united states and voted against the 
resolution included portugal australia belgium britain canada 
denmark france italy japan the netherlands new zealand 
norway turkey 
the assembly meeting in emergency session at the request of 
cuba and nicaragua heard a dozen speakers over two days denounce 
the us action some called it an example of gunboat diplomacy 
the government in panama meanwhile apparently won a limited 
victory in a battle over un credentials in a compromise between 
the envoys representing the noriega regime and the government of 
president guillermo endara the panamanian deputy envoy abadi was 
allowed to speak after the vote 
although he switched sides abadi still holds credentials from 
the noriega government 
endaras choice for un envoy eduardo vallarino is not yet 
accredited to the world body

two soldiers made a tragic mistake 
in causing an artillery accident that killed three soldiers and 
wounded 24 but they wont be courtmartialed their commander said 
safety violations that caused the sept 27 accident were 
insufficient reason to prosecute sgt edward c tyler of 
washington dc and spec nickoles w holly of canton ohio maj 
gen raphael j hallada said friday 
tyler and holly were accused of dereliction of duty and 
negligent homicide and faced up to 15 months confinement loss of 
wages and badconduct discharges if convicted on both charges 
my decision that trial by courtmartial is not the appropriate 
course was based on the evidence on the spotless records of tyler 
and holly and on my determination that the accident was a tragic 
mistake resulting from a momentary violation of safety procedures 
rather than a criminal act said hallada commander at fort sill 
officers who investigated the accident at a rifle range in 
southwest oklahoma said one of five rounds fired from a 105mm 
howitzer during a training session contained the wrong powder 
charge 
the round overshot its target and exploded behind a group of 80 
soldiers lined up in formation to leave the range 
two of the injured soldiers remain hospitalized in serious 
condition 
hallada said he met with tyler and holly and their commanding 
officers in to review the actions that led to the accident 
the two soldiers know that they caused the accident the 
officers know that this happened on their watch hallada said 
these were very emotional meetings every one of them would give 
anything to have that round back 
investigators said holly a cannoneer in the howitzer crew 
prepared the powder charges before the rounds were fired and was to 
remove excess powder bags when a lesser charge was fired he was to 
display the bags to his section chief tyler 
the investigators concluded that holly failed to do this with 
one of the five rounds and that tyler didnt catch the error 
but hallada said i was not convinced a jury would find that 
holly and tyler blatantly disregarded what a reasonably careful 
person would have done under the circumstances

the fbi believes a letter claiming responsibility 
for bombings that killed a federal judge and a lawyer is authentic 
but agents still know nothing about the organization that sent it 
the letter was sent to atlanta television station waga and 
disclosed thursday 
we believe the letter received by waga is authentic because it 
contained information which has not been made known to the public 
and which is known only to someone closely associated with the 
construction and mailing of the bombs and to law enforcement 
said william l hinshaw special agent in charge of the fbi 
investigation 
the atlanta journal and constitution quoting unidentified 
sources reported friday that the letter contained an identifying 
code identical to that in followup letters sent to the bomb 
targets the newspaper didnt elaborate 
naacp southeastern regional director earl shinhoster said a 
letter sent to his office after a teargas bombing postmarked aug 
21 also contained that numerical code he said other letters 
associated with the bombings also have that code 
theyre all the same he said if you see one you can 
rest assured that if theres another one it also has a code 
the letter to waga referred to the case of julie love a white 
atlanta woman who was abducted in july 1988 and whose body was 
found last summer two black men were arrested one has pleaded 
guilty to murder and other charges and the other is awaiting trial 
the letter said us circuit judge robert s vance and savannah 
lawyer robert robinson were assassinated in reprisal for ms 
loves death it said two more prominent members of the naacp 
also would be killed in reprisal 
vance was killed at his alabama home on dec 16 robinson was 
killed in savannah two days later 
the letter said that any time a black man rapes a white woman in 
alabama florida or georgia the states served by the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals on which vance sat a federal judge an 
attorney and an officer of the national association for the 
advancement of colored persons would be killed 
the fbi in atlanta asked anyone with information on the group 
calling itself americans for a competent federal judicial system 
to call a hotline established for tips in the case 
agency spokesman diader rosario said friday that some calls had 
been received since news of the groups letter broke thursday the 
information received so far however was nothing exciting 
rosario said he refused to provide details 
certainly it the group is something brand new for us and 
another link in the chain rosario said 
the letter also condemned the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
for granting the blacks demand for white teachers for their 
children leading fbi agents to reinterview the lead plaintiff 
in a 21yearold schooldesegregation case 
they showed me some of the letters that had been written and 
they asked me for names of people that i know who would send 
letters like that said the plaintiff roger mills who also is a 
member of the dekalb naacps executive committee 
mills said he would review his stockpile of hate mail to see 
whether any of it is similar to the letter sent to waga 
benjamin hooks the naacps executive director said the 
threatening letter is intended to intimidate the group to strike 
fear in our hearts 
it will not succeed we intend to go about our business but 
we will most certainly be taking precautions hooks said from the 
naacp national headquarters in baltimore

police had tears in their eyes when they booked a 
9yearold boy who allegedly sold crack cocaine to an undercover 
officer an official said 
the 3foot11 95pound youngster was arraigned friday in 
roxbury district court on juvenile delinquency charges he was 
released to the custody of his grandmother with whom he has been 
living because his mother is in prison police said 
the boys name was not released 
it was a very sad and traumatic thing to see a little 
9yearold boy sitting in the station arrested for drugs deputy 
superintendent robert hayden said i saw some veteran officers 
with tears in their eyes over this incident 
among the youngest children arrested around the country on crack 
charges have been a 10yearold detroit boy in august and a 
10yearold boy on long island in new york in january 
boston police said they sought an arrest warrant for the 
teenager whom the 9yearold identified as the supplier of the 
crack 
the little boy would go out and sell until the end of the 
night when he would reach the older person who would give him 
money for the sales work hayden said the boy told police he had 
been selling for about two weeks 
the 9yearold had 68 in his pockets probably from drug sales 
when he was arrested thursday night police said 
he was kind of scared hayden said he was crying 
police said they will ask to have the boy turned over to the 
department of social services charles dickerson a police juvenile 
officer said the youngster needs better supervision than he gets 
from his grandmother 
hes used to getting out there and staying with the older 
kids dickerson said hes been seen at 11 pm with older 
kids 
hayden said three undercover officers went thursday night to a 
corner in bostons roxbury section where there had been reports of 
heavy drug activity hayden said one officer was approached by the 
boy who said whats up 
what do you got asked the officer 
the boy reached into his pocket and handed the officer what is 
believed to be crack the highly addictive form of cocaine after 
the arrest officers found 80 small bags of crack near the 
intersection 
hayden said the feeling we were left with was with all the 
shootings and terrible things we see this has affected us the most 
because he is supposed to be innocent 
he is supposed to be worried about what he got for christmas

the vatican today declared it did not intend 
to block the course of justice by giving refuge to ousted 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega who is wanted in the united 
states on drug trafficking charges 
the vatican secretariat of state also said in a communique that 
it was continuing to examine the case with us authorities in a 
spirit of serene collaboration in hopes of finding a 
mutuallyacceptable solution 
it was the second day in a row that the vatican issued 
statements defending its actions in the noriega case but it was 
the first official comment by the secretariat of state the holy 
sees highest administrative body 
the vatican has been under pressure by us authorities to hand 
over noriega who sought asylum in the vatican embassy in panama 
city on christmas eve after eluding thousands of american troops 
who invaded dec 20 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said friday the vatican could 
not hand over noriega to the americans but was urging him to leave 
the embassy on his own 
todays statement said the vatican and us authorities have 
agreed to continue to remain in close contact to examine together 
in a spirit of serene collaboration the various aspects of the 
complex case and the possibility of arriving at a just solution 
which will be mutually satisfactory 
the communique stressed that in giving refuge to noriega the 
papal nuncio in panama did not intend to block the course of 
justice regarding a person accused of serious crimes but to promote 
the end of a conflict that could have gone on indefinitely in 
the form of guerrilla warfare 
navarro declined to comment on the state of the negotiations he 
said the vatican still had not received a formal request from the 
new panamian government to hand over noriega 
earlier navarro said the loud music played by us troops 
outside the vatican embassy in panama was not helping talks on what 
to do with noriega 
if this is going to continue further steps will be taken by 
the vatican navarro said without elaborating 
the rap and rock music which has included numerous taunting 
songs seemed intended to torment noriega 
us troops turned down the volume late friday afternoon

parliament has repealed a constitutional 
amendment that allowed the government to suspend basic human rights 
in punjab state where sikh extremists have killed more than 7500 
people in the past seven years 
the decision taken late friday night in the final hours of the 
first parliament session convened under prime minister vp singh 
was largely a goodwill gesture 
the amendment passed in march 1988 when rajiv gandhi was prime 
minister would have expired march 30 1990 many of the measures 
imposed under it had already been lifted earlier by the gandhi 
government in hopes of easing the punjab situation 
singh has promised to seek a political solution to the punjab 
problem and has already traveled to the rich northern farming state 
in hope of opening new talks with sikh militants 
sikh extremists advocating creation of an independent nation 
for their faith in punjab have killed at least 1806 people in the 
state this year including 25 since singh took office dec 2 
the victims include hindus the countrys largest religious 
group as well as fellow sikhs considered traitors or 
nonsupportive of the militant movement 
parliaments lower house voted 3601 to repeal the 59th 
amendment to the constitution and the upper house cast a unanimous 
140 votes in favor of repeal the repeal will become effective as 
soon as it is accepted by president ramaswamy venkataraman whose 
post is primarily ceremonial 
gandhi who is now the opposition leader in parliament said 
earlier his congress party would not oppose repeal 
the policymaking lower house of which singh and gandhi are 
members had 525 seats at stake in the november election singhs 
national front and its allies have 277 seats while the congress 
party has 193 
the 59th amendment had allowed the government to declare a state 
of emergency in parts or all of punjab thereby enabling the 
government to invoke other antiterrorism laws that permit arrest 
without charge and indefinite detention these laws remain on the 
books 
singh who is a hindu like all of his predecessors as prime 
minister led his national front coalition through the november 
election with pledges to seek a political solution to punjab 
sikhs who have a slight majority in punjab have complained of 
discrimination against their faith and culture by hindus 
nationally sikhs comprise only 2 percent of indias 880 million 
people while hindus account more about 80 percent 
the sikh faith has roots in both hinduism and islam

rebels in northern ethiopia claimed today 
that they killed or wounded 8200 government soldiers and captured 
2220 more while overrunning the garrison town of debre tabor 
the rebels announced the fall of the garrison in northwestern 
gonder province earlier this week in addition to the capture of two 
towns in shoa province to the south 
the government has made no comment on the reported fighting but 
diplomats in the capital addis ababa say the rebel claims of 
capturing the three communities appear to be true 
reporters have been denied access to the region and the 
reports especially regarding casualties cannot be independently 
verified 
in clandestine radio broadcasts earlier in the week the rebels 
of the tigre peoples liberation front put the government toll for 
all three towns at nearly 3000 killed wounded or captured 
but in a broadcast monitored in nairobi today the insurgents 
claimed far higher government losses in debre tabor alone 
none of the broadcasts heard through the week mentioned rebel 
losses 
if the rebel reports of government losses are true the 
sevenday battle for debre tabor would mark the biggest defeat in 
more than a year for the forces of president mengistu haile mariam 
the tigrean rebels opened a new offensive in late august after a 
sixmonth lull in their 14yearold war to topple mengistus 
government they now control all of their home province of tigre 
and have made signigicant advances into wollo gonder and shoa 
provinces to the south and west 
like the government the tigrean insurgents are marxists their 
leaders have spoken frequently and paradoxically of wanting a 
democratic government patterned after that of communist albania 
the government faces an even older insurgency in the 
northernmost province of eritrea where rebels have been fighting a 
seccessionist war for 28 years however there has been little 
activity in that region in recent months

innocent victims of a turf battle among drug dealers near a housing 
project 
eric reed 17 and dwayne faust 16 both of the borough of 
queens were charged with murder assault weapons violations and 
reckless endangerment said sgt tina mohrmann a police 
spokeswoman

a nearly empty northwest airlines dc10 took off 
for detroit today despite a bomb threat that persuaded 105 people 
to cancel their bookings leaving just 42 people on board 
the paris to san francisco flight with change of planes in 
detroit carried 14 crew members and 28 passengers three of whom 
were journalists making the trip to report on the threatened flight 
a steady stream of passengers had changed their travel plans 
after hearing news reports of threats against flight 51 in 
retaliation for the bombing convictions of two palestinians 
northwest offered to allow passengers to change to other flights or 
airlines with no penalty 
the plane left charles de gaulle airport at 245 pm 845 am 
est more than two hours late because of fog 
close scrutiny of every piece of hand luggage being put aboard 
caused a brief initial delay but then the plane was held up by fog 
that was disrupting all flights at the airport and caused some 
flights to be canceled 
the saudi newspaper asharq alawsat reported today that spanish 
authorities had information that moslem extremists planned to use 
surfacetoair missiles to attack arab and french passenger planes 
the newspaper quoting investigators in madrid said the 
information was developed following last months seizure of arms 
caches apparently intended for terrorist attacks in europe 
spanish police have refused to comment on similar reports in 
spanish newspapers saying their inquiry is confidential there was 
no indication of a connection between the saudi report and the 
northwest flight 
many passengers requested transfers to other flights when they 
arrived at northwests checkin desk at midmorning today 
i would have been on pins and needles the whole way said 
camille major 21 of madison wis who was headed home after 
three weeks in europe 
six hundred dollars isnt worth my life she said my 
vacation was bad and this just tops it off 
the hsia family of foster city calif near san francisco 
arrived at the airport about 10 am unaware of the bomb threat 
the family of four held discussions about whether to change 
airlines 
my mom changed her mind three times but were going said 
17yearold eddie hsia baseball cap tipped back on his head my 
dad follows what my mom says 
security at the airport was extremely tight as armed officers 
of the air and border police and riot police with leashed dogs 
shepherded the passengers through scrupulous checkin procedures 
each piece of luggage was xrayed on freezeframe video machines 
even a small souvenir bust of napoleon was put on the belt and 
xrayed separately 
the dc10 can hold 284 passengers northwest originally had 130 
seats booked but cancellations started pouring in friday after 
news reports described the bomb threat against the plane 
northwest announced the threat thursday but said the fbi asked 
that no details be disclosed 
abc news quoting sources it did not identify reported thursday 
night that a man with a middle eastern accent made the threat 
to northwests detroit office saying the bombing would be in 
retaliation for life sentences given two palestinians convicted in 
sweden of charges connected with a string of bombings in europe 
one of the two abu mohammed talb is a suspect in the december 
1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 which exploded over lockerbie 
scotland 
he and codefendant marten imandi were sentenced to life for 
their part in the 1985 bombing of a northwest office in copenhagen 
that killed one person and wounded 20 one of four bombings in 
denmark and the netherlands for which they were convicted 
in washington federal aviation administration spokesman john 
leyden said officials were working with northwest and with the 
french authorities to ensure there is extra security on the 
flight 
pierre quilici deputy chief of frances air and border police 
said us authorities had passed on word of the threat several days 
ago he said he could not disclose any special security measures 
planned to protect the flight 
airline spokesman robert gibbons said northwest originally 
agreed to a request by security agencies not to make the threat 
public but then a report of the threat came out of europe 
the faa has a policy of not alerting the public to security 
threats unless they are very specific and the flight involved is 
not being canceled the northwest threat appeared to meet 
conditions that would allow disclosure

parliament today restored polands 
historic name that had been changed by the communists 45 years ago 
and amended the constitution to drop the leading role of the 
communist party in state affairs 
senators rose and sang god who watches over poland and the 
national anthem after voting 790 with two abstentions to make the 
constitutional changes 
parliaments lower house the sejm had approved the changes 
friday by a vote of 3741 with 11 abstentions senate approval is 
needed for measures to become law 
the senate vote confirmed restoration of the republic of poland 
as the countrys official name from the peoples republic of poland 
imposed when the communist party took power in 1944 
on friday the senate approved 11 economic laws passed on two 
previous days by the sejm which were backed by the solidarityled 
government and aim to create a marketeconomy and reduce inflation 
the amendments restore democratic language and traditions 
changing a phrase that called poland a socialist society to a 
citizens society 
the senate also favored the sejm decision to restore the crown 
that symbolizes polish sovereignty and unity that graced the head 
of the eagle on the national emblem until the communist takeover 
after the senate vote an eagle with a crown brought two weeks 
earlier by an unknown farmer was hung in the senate hall 
the farmer who name was not noted when he made the gift to the 
senates human rights commission said the eagle was the only 
souvenir he had of his father 
the amendments give citizens the right to create political 
parties until now the communist party the democratic party and 
the peasant party were the only legally recognized parties 
the ammended constitution now guarantees protection of private 
property 
the amendments eliminate or modify articles which are 
inconsistent with democratic reform until a new constitution can be 
written 
the critical pieces of legislation include two key laws on 
unemployment designed to protect workers the government estimates 
that as many as 400000 people could become unemployed as a result 
of the radical economic program 
the other new laws regulate activities of the national bank 
credit policy joint ventures foreign capital hard currency 
customs and taxation 
the hard currency law aims to create internal convertibility of 
the zloty which means poles eventually will be able to use zlotys 
in hard currency stores that now exist throughout poland 
another goal of the law is to make the zloty a convertible 
currency on the world market but first the official rate of the 
zloty must converge with an unofficial legal rate finance ministry 
officials say this must happen gradually 
on wednesday parliament passed a law regulating financing of 
state enterprises and one limiting the growth of wages a measure 
designed to hold down inflation now running at 900 percent

twelve people were killed and 12 
injured when an apartment building collapsed under the weight of 
three stories that were added to the structure illegally police 
said today 
rescue workers ended their search early today after pulling the 
last four bodies from the rubble police said 
the building which collapsed late friday night was inspected 
recently after cracks appeared in some of its walls residents 
said the government architect who examined the cracks did not 
condemn the building they said 
the sixstory building located in the middleclass residential 
district of glim originally had three stories police said but 
they said its owners added another three stories without obtaining 
building permits 
the foundations of the house designed to support only three 
stories apparently could not withstand the weight of another 
three said a police officer speaking on condition of anonymity

the fatalities included a family of four related to the 
landlord two 2yearold children a man and his wife two women

wearing a tuxedo with a floppy bow tie oliver 
l north tackled peter and the wolf with the same gritty 
squarejawed bravado that he mustered when he confronted his 
irancontra inquisitors in a bemedaled marine uniform 
this time there was no quavering voice no mistyeyed evocation 
of god country and duty instead north gave a lively 
wellrehearsed narration of sergei prokofievs classic musical tale 
for children embroidered with nasty growls and reassuring smiles 
the audience of 1000 ollie oglers and music lovers including 
norths probation officer greeted his musical stage debut in the 
capital hilton hotel ballroom friday night with cheers applause 
and flashing cameras 
he won the grownups but he lost the kids they sat on the front 
row squealing and shrieking at the costumed animals 
oliver north convicted felon in the irancontra affair was 
upstaged by the big bad wolf 
it was right nice said aquil robinson 12 what i liked 
best was when the wolf ate the duck 
yeah man agreed his 6yearold brother yusuf 
north clearly enjoyed his halfhour performance with a 46piece 
orchestra and dancers from the american contemporary ballet the 
highlight of a holiday concert sponsored by the beethoven society 
a local musical group 
the retired marine colonel and former white house national 
security aide who is appealing his may 4 conviction on three 
felony charges appeared onstage as a favor to maria fisher an 
85yearold cultural doyenne of washington who is founder and 
president of the beethoven society 
even though north reportedly charges 25000 for every speech he 
makes mrs fisher said he performed friday night for free 
mrs fisher said she admired north when she watched his 
nationally televised testimony at the congressional irancontra 
hearings in 1987 they became friends when they met later at a ball 
at the organization of american states she said 
about three months ago she got the idea of introducing 
classical music to innercity children and north accepted her 
invitation to narrate peter and the wolf 
when the word got out people called me and said how dare 
you shame on you hes a criminal but it takes all sorts to make 
a world doesnt it besides hes a good friend of mine she 
said 
in a preconcert interview mrs fisher said i dont know 
about his talents as a narrator but i know hes got a good 
speaking voice i watched those hearings and im sure he can read a 
script 
north said it was his first stage appearance since he performed 
in a high school production of how the west was won in his 
hometown of philmont ny nearly 30 years ago 
i think i was the bad guy he said 
the audience friday night included norths probation officer 
ralph ardito and 100 youngsters from save our youth a private 
nonprofit antidrug program for innercity children where north is 
carrying out his sentence of 1200 hours of community service 
he also was sentenced to two years probation and fined 150000 
after his conviction of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress shredding government documents and accepting an illegal 
gratuity 
ardito said norths stage appearance will not reduce his 
required hours of community service even though children from save 
our youth were in the audience 
conductor richard weilenmann praised north for a very good 
performance with nary a missed cue 
some narrators are exaggerated and overblown but he read very 
naturally as if he were reading to his own children weilenmann 
said 
another enthusiast in the audience was robert w owen who 
formerly was norths liaison with nicaraguan contra rebels during 
the clandestine attempt to channel military aid to the 
antisandinista forces 
it was wonderful said owen who brought his 2yearold 
daughter katie ollie may have a new profession

here is the text of a statement 
the us southern command issued saturday concerning an incident 
involving the nicaraguan ambassador to panama 
with good cause us soldiers entered and searched what is now 
claimed to be the alleged home of the nicaraguan ambassador to 
panama in the el dorado section of panama city around 6 pm last 
night 
acting on reliable information from a panamanian citizen that 
the house contained a large arms cache soldiers from the jtfsouth 
joint task forcesouth moved to the location and surrounded it 
occupants of the house were notified by loudspeaker to evacuate the 
building 
after the request was ignored warning shots were fired into the 
air at this point a man identifying himself as the nicaraguan 
ambassador mr antenor ferrey drove up he stated tht the 
building was his quarters and had diplomatic immunity 
when asked for credentials the man provided a blue identity 
card indicating that he had left his red diplomatic identity card 
at the embassy the unit continued to secure the area and requested 
guidance from higher headquarters 
information provided by the american embassy indicated that the 
residence of the nicaraguan ambassador was located in a highrise 
apartment building edificio villa magna at punta paitilla rather 
than the building surrounded by us forces 
based on this information that the house was not covered by 
diplomatic immunity the commander on the scene informed mr ferrey 
he had received authorization to search the house and intended to 
do so 
mr ferrey instructed the occupants four men and three women 
to come out of the house mr ferrey also stated that there were a 
few weapons in the house asked if these men were his personal 
security force mr ferrey responded that they were members of his 
family the commander of us forces at he scene was directed to 
confiscate all weapons 
at 710 pm all individuals and confiscated weapons were 
released and us forces left the premises 
there was no damage to the house or injury to the occupants it 
should be pointed out that the weapons and munitions found were in 
fact an arsenal far in excess of a few weapons we were told were 
in the house 
it is obvious that mr ferrey was less than candid with us 
regarding the quantity of weapons present

vice president dan quayle says hes not just a 
potted plant in the bush administration and that he now knows 
what it takes to be president 
quayle also says he thinks he had a fairly easy first year 
as vice president because of low expectations that followed the 
media hazing he got when george bush picked him as a running mate 
last year 
in an interview with the associated press quayle said he 
expects the coming year to be more challenging he likened himself 
to a high jumper and said that this year the bar will be 
elevated 
the vice president described his principal achievements so far 
as establishing myself in this office establishing the loyal 
relationship i have with the president being a team player that 
makes a contribution to the president 
despite sniping from some administration officials who privately 
dismiss him as irrelevant quayle insists he is a contributor to 
policy deliberations 
i spend a great deal of time with the president quayle 
said we have a very close personal loyal relationship im 
not as they say a potted plant in these meetings 
his selfassessment is not shared by everyone in the white 
house one top administration official called quayles 
contributions to policy making marginal the official speaking 
on condition of anonymity said quayle rarely says anything 
during group meetings with bush advisers when he does he can be 
counted on to espouse the conservative line officials say 
conversely many others in the administration say the vice 
president has acquitted himself well despite occasional 
malapropisms he has not fulfilled critics predictions that he 
would stumble and embarrass the administration with major gaffes 
he meets with bush daily sits in on intelligence briefings and 
frequently attends meetings bush has with world leaders or domestic 
groups he is chairman of the presidents space council and the 
competitiveness council focusing on ways to spur business growth 
he takes his cue from bush who as vice president never revealed 
his advice to thenpresident reagan declining to disclose his 
conversations with the president 
he generally hews wordforword to the administration line but 
on occasion quayles conservatism has surfaced with a more 
hardline tone than bushs statements particularly regarding the 
soviets 
most recently quayle took a tough view of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev saying the united states should not let 
gorbachevs magnetic personality obscure true soviet intentions 
quayles remarks came just after bushs dec 2 summit meeting 
with the soviet leader where us officials stressed themes of 
trust and cooperation 
quayle discounted the notion he has been instructed to placate 
conservatives leery of bush or that he differs with bush policy 
its the ageold game that is played in trying to find some 
distinction between the president and vice president he said 
asked why he has been more outspoken than bush was as vice 
president quayle said that while he patterns his vice presidency 
after the george bush model there is emerging the dan quayle 
model 
quayle said that today he would probably give about the same 
answer as he did in a major campaign debate last year if asked what 
he would do if he were propelled into the oval office by the death 
of the president 
at that time he said he would pray for himself and the country 
and then call a meeting of cabinet members and top presidential 
advisers 
ive been on this job approaching a year now i know what to 
do now if that tragic event should occur looking back im not 
sure the answer would be much different i know what the 
president does on a daytoday basis how he goes about the job 
im there im present hes always told me one of the 
important roles of the vice president any vice president is to be 
prepared 
believe me i know what to do 
quayle had a chance to perform under fire during the recent coup 
attempt in the philippines that occurred when bush and his top 
advisers were on their way to the mediterranean superpower summit 
he conducted an allnight meeting of national security council 
principals monitored events and kept a flow of information going 
while bush dispatched us fighter planes to back up embattled 
philippine president corazon aquino 
quayle didnt get much publicity for his role but he said 
there was a job and i did it its just not something that 
you talk about 
still quayle continues to languish in public opinion surveys 
and suffers a steady stream of comedians jokes maligning his 
intelligence 
i dont worry about it he said

the teenage revolutionary guard found 
no guns in the reporters rented ford but there were those six 
suspect bulgarian apples in the trunk to make sure they werent 
bombs he placed one on the ground and stomped it into applesauce 
at another roadblock farther down a man with a menacing 
mustache and a murderous mien peered at a reporters us passport 
and frisked him finding him harmless the guard seized the 
reporters shoulders and overcome with the days emotion planted 
moist kisses on each of his cheeks 
the uprising against nicolae ceausescu was not your 
runofthemill revolution 
on the first evening of upheaval the american reporter found a 
mildmannered hospital worker who had had enough of dictatorship 
ill help you he said but first i must drop this off he 
indicated a large yellow sports bag its full of molotov 
cocktails 
but for the chilling omnipresent mayhem it was less a 
revolution than spontaneous freeform theater of the absurd and 
everyone wanted a role 
checkpoints blossomed at subway stops street corners and 
doorways on boulevards downtown they were three to a block 
sometimes soldiers manned them but not usually 
at one a 9yearold blond boy examined a reporters papers 
nodding gravely he was armed with a short stick better suited to 
jabbing toads on a summer afternoon 
at another six scowling teenagers circled a car and aimed 
ak47 assault rifles at the passengers from their awkward nervous 
gestures it seemed doubtful any of them knew a safety catch from a 
trigger 
in firefights the dictators diehard killers held off 
illtrained soldiers and amateur revolutionaries often amid a 
tragicomedy of errors 
during a nightlong siege of the television station a woman 
popped regularly from the elevators to assure all occupants that 
things were under control once however she emerged shrieking 
hysterically defending soldiers were in a fierce gunbattle with 
their own men across the road 
near the television which was simultaneously the heart of the 
revolution and the seat of its provisional government paranoia ran 
wild 
racing against a deadline a carload of journalists stopped for 
a thorough search guards poked into the car battery and examined 
coins in pockets from a short distance guards at a second 
roadblock watched weapons ready finally cleared the car rolled 
on only to be searched again by the second group 
the paranoia was murderous late one night cbs crews outside 
the television station watched army guards open fire on a lone 
pedestrian walking toward them in the dark over the deadly rattle 
his last words were hardly audible dont shoot im a doctor 
cbs correspondents martha teichner and bob simon saw the scene 
because sentries held them at gunpoint against a tank from 1115 
pm to 6 am finally they resorted to playing on the old 
latinobalkan machismo 
simon told them that teichner was getting sick 
the minute the words sick and woman got together 
everything changed teichner said they took us inside laid 
blankets over me and found some candy suddenly the same guys who 
were trying to kill us were giving us these little sweets 
throughout the revolution the leitmotif was an unceasing string 
of communiques and serious talk from television immediately 
renamed television free romania 
at the most dramatic moments the screen showed ceausescu and 
his wife elena bundled out of an armored personnel carrier and 
put on trial finally they were shown shot against a wall and 
their bullettorn bodies were pictured closeup 
mostly it was discussion from time to time the talking heads 
were replaced by snatches of opera christmas carols or an 
occasional tom amp jerry cartoon as doctors sewed up wounds and 
commandos routed out terrorist snipers snow whites dwarfs sang 
whistle while you work 
but on thursday night romanian television ran its first 
fulllength western feature film in some time and people gazed at 
their screens in rapt attention sometimes solemnly 
it was charlie chaplins the great dictator

this horn of africa nation one of the 
poorest in the world is not a great place for tourists especially 
those with cameras 
take a snapshot on a mogadishu street and theres a good chance 
your camera and film will be confiscated by police 
it is all part of the elaborate security system established by 
president mohammed siad barre in his 20 years of authoritarian rule 
an associated press reporter who recently interviewed the 
president inside his walled heavily guarded compound in mogadishu 
asked aides if he could be accompanied by a local photographer 
well its all highly complicated said one wed have to 
get clearance from the board of censors and that could take some 
time maybe we can get the presidential press unit to take a 
picture 
the presidential press unit didnt although it taped the 
interview on a highquality reeltoreel recording machine 
apparently to be sure the quotes were accurate 
at another interview with a lesser government official an 
unidentified man seated himself next to the reporter took notes 
and disputed the journalists use of certain words in framing his 
questions 
he was from state security the reporter was told later seems 
the official being interviewed had spoken too frankly to a west 
german television crew a few months earlier and was now being 
monitored 
a visiting yugoslav journalist rosa grce of the zagreb 
newspaper vjesnik complained to an information ministry official 
that she couldnt even find postcards depicting mogadishu scenes 
all i find are pictures that could have been taken anywhere in 
africa she said 
this is africa said the official

the lights are going out in president 
mohammed siad barres dingy crumbling capital 
after 20 years of often ruthless rule the aging siad barre who 
is believed to be in his 80s is isolated internationally and beset 
by strife in his country 
his power most foreign observers agree now extends no more 
than 140 miles outside this seaside city built three centuries ago 
by an arab ruler 
beyond that its a no mans land of war and banditry says 
one western diplomat 
but one foreign diplomat notes that those who oppose siad barre 
may well have trouble agreeing on anything beyond their opposition 
to him the diplomat said there is no obvious person with the clout 
or charisma to replace siad barre and lead the nation to a more 
stable future 
strategically located at the tip of the horn of africa on the 
eastern approach to the red sea somalia used to be wooed by both 
the soviet union and the united states 
but the soviet union abandoned somalia in favor of rival 
ethiopia in their 1977 war over the ogaden long a disputed 
territory on their central border 
now the united states which happily picked up siad barre as a 
client when moscow dropped him has tired of his human rights 
abuses and stricken him from its list of friends 
washington has withheld or canceled more than 50 million in aid 
dating back to 1987 britain france and other western donors also 
have slashed funds 
their growing unhappiness reached a peak in july when siad 
barres personal bodyguards marked by their redfringed berets 
crushed protests in the capital according to diplomats the guards 
then rounded up 47 civilians took them to a nearby beach killed 
them and buried the bodies in the sand 
that came little more than a week after the united states 
dedicated a new 35 million embassy the largest in subsahara 
africa with a compound that boasts three swimming pools and a 
ninehole golf course 
by the end of 1990 plans call for slashing the embassy staff of 
about 430 in half reflecting the sharp reductions in aid and the 
number of people needed to administer it 
tribal rebellions in the north and south of the nation and clan 
warfare in the center have sapped somalias treasury and helped 
produce a sharp drop in export earnings never large to begin with 
they have fallen from about 100 million in 1986 to an estimated 
60 million in 1989 
all of this has left siad barre with a bankrupt economy an 
annual inflation rate of 120 percent an unpayable foreign debt of 
2 billion and a growing chorus of discontent that reaches even 
into many government offices 
many of those offices barely function the bureaucrats who man 
them forced to find other sources of money on the outside or to 
sell government services and favors to supplement their meager 
incomes 
siad barre has tried to defuse the growing opposition to his 
regime by appointing a commission to rewrite the constitution to 
permit multiparty elections late in 1990 a step his critics say is 
too little too late 
he also has offered to enter into unconditional peace talks with 
his armed opponents especially the somali national movement which 
has routed government forces in much of the north of the country 
he had no takers 
the opposition sees the government as crumbling thats why 
theyre probably in no hurry to talk said another diplomat who 
like the first spoke on condition he not be identified 
siad barre faces another smaller insurgency in southern somalia 
that surfaced only early this year it has been largely stalled in 
recent months by a rainy season that ends in january when renewed 
fighting is widely expected 
the southern group known as the somali patriotic movement has 
spoken of a possible alliance with the northern insurgents who 
have been fighting off and on since 1981 but there is no evidence 
of unity between them 
in mogadishu where robberies and burlaries are soaring as the 
desperately poor take to crime to meet their needs public services 
are virtually nonexistent and many neighborhoods are almost always 
without electricity because it is said the diesel fuel needed to 
run the citys only power generator is siphoned off and sold by 
government employees 
siad barre whose exact age is unknown but is thought to be in 
the 80s bemoans the loss of western aid and denies the 
welldocumented human rights abuses that led to its reduction 
its no good to abandon your friends in a time of need he 
said in an interview in a luxuriously furnished conference room in 
one of the many buildings that dot the large walled compound in 
which he lives and works 
on the question of human rights abuses he replied it is 
baseless whats the use of arguing about it it is being used as a 
means to reach a certain goal we do not believe it is fair

at least 13 people were injured police arrested 50 people 
according to israel radio 
police said some demonstrators shouted propalestinian slogans 
setting off two charges by policemen into largely palestinian 
groups some demonstrators shouted palestine is arab and the 
moslem rallying cry allahu akbar god is great 
for the most part however the israeli european and 
palestinian participants in the peace chain joined in chants of 
we want peace and carried balloons with the rallys slogan 
1990 time for peace 
some 15000 people about a third more than organizers had 
expected turned out for the human chain around the stone walls 
of jerusalems old city twelve hundred people came from europe for 
the rally most of them italians 
the crowd probably could have encircled the wall of the old 
city a distance of more than 4000 yards but participants were 
unevenly distributed with the activists five deep in some areas 
and up to a dozen yards apart in others 
after the activists linked hands thousands of balloons were 
released into the air to drift over the city 
people stood silently for about 15 minutes then some 
participants broke into a rousing version of we shall overcome 
and chanted two states for two people 
rally organizers said the goal was to prove that dialogue 
between israelis and palestinians can lead to peace in the middle 
east the rally was sponsored by italian peace groups israels 
peace now and palestinian activists 
faisal husseini a palestinian leader in jerusalem complained 
that army roadblocks on the outskirts of jerusalem kept many 
palestinian from attending 
i know that if the road were opened we would have had double 
or triple the number you are seeing husseini told reporters as 
he joined the gathering 
he described it as a very historic moment and added that it 
should be a message for israelis to look at the palestinian as an 
individual and learn that you can build peace with him 
a womans peace march on friday also part of the 1990 time 
for peace program was broken up by police firing tear gas and 
swinging nightsticks after an outlawed palestinian flag was raised

the following is the text of a statement 
issued saturday at the vatican regarding former panamanian leader 
manuel noriega the statement was translated from italian by the 
associated press 
regarding the case of gen manuel antonio noriega who took 
refuge in recent days in the apostolic nunciature of panama the 
secretariat of state declares 
in the course of the consultations that have taken place in 
recent days between the holy see and us authorities over the case 
of gen noriega the two parties have agreed to continue to remain 
in close contact to examine together in a spirit of serene 
collaboration the various aspects of the complex case and the 
possibility of arriving at a just solution which will be mutually 
satisfactory keeping in mind that in receiving mr noriega in the 
apostolic nunciature the apostolic nuncio did not intend to block 
the course of justice regarding a person accused of serious crimes 
but to promote the end of a conflict that in previous days had 
caused so much destruction and so many victims and could have gone 
on indefinitely in the form of guerrilla warfare

a babble of voices rose from the filthy 
streets as hands dipped into crushed cartons of cigarettes and 
shoes bags of bras golden bracelets dangled from eager fingers 
on display for shoppers in the impromptu looters market 
one dollar one dollar a man cried flicking his wrist at a 
pile of pastel polo shirts 
four thieves surrounded a shopper a knife glittered a wallet 
vanished into the hands of a skinny boy who ran and dodged like an 
allstar wide receiver 
a us soldier rounded the corner he was robbed he was 
robbed excited voices cried gesturing at the victim the 
soldier listened to the tale and shrugged 
its returning to normal he said 
the slums of colon are glutted sated with booty from the 
frenzied looting sparked by the us invasion of panama on dec 20 
people dont want any more tvs they dont want any more 
betamaxes now they want money said the new provincial governor 
leopoldo benedetti 
reality is beginning to dawn you cant eat televisions stereos 
are indigestible colon is in shambles 
there is going to be unemployment and when you have hunger 
you have social unrest life could become unbearable said 
alfonso esquivel the colombian consul and one of the citys senior 
diplomats 
while us troops ringed colon last week looters gutted its 
shops and stores and cracked open the warehouses and dockside 
terminal where goods from the colon free zone the worlds 
secondlargest duty free port are stored 
colon is an occupied city that put out the welcome mat its 
merchants begged us troops to enter to save their city from 
chaos and the citys new leaders are in no hurry for the 
occupation to end 
they need help picking up the debris from the fall of gen 
manuel antonio noriegas dictatorship 
they have a moral obligation to help us get back to normal 
said businessman rafael arosemena vice chairman of the joint 
council set up to get colon back on its feet 
this roughandtumble port city on the atlantic end of the 
panama canal unraveled with the sudden intensity of a tropical 
storm 
the us troops landed attacked several defense forces 
installations and sealed off the city in the predawn hours of 
wednesday dec 20 
when dawn broke colon was a city without law noriegas defense 
forces which includes the local police had fled flinging open 
the jailhouse doors as they went 
the looting cut across class barriers in this city of about 
60000 known for some of the meanest slums and most predatory 
street thieves in latin america 
i saw a doctor i know drive by with his bmw stuffed with 
loot esquivel said 
the rampage lasted two days 
they were coming in by the hundreds bruce motta jr whose 
family trades watches and whiskey in the free zone said as he 
surveyed the debrislittered streets of the zones auxiliary 
warehouse area at france field 
they were running with televisions they were running toward 
the jungle but they wouldnt put those televisions down he said 
in the main part of the free zone about 150 plucky arab traders 
and their sons fought off looters for days killing at least three 
people and wounding several more 
my luck was i had guys who knew how to use guns from the 
invasion of lebanon one prominent merchant said asking that his 
name not be used 
by the time us forces entered the free zone on the afternoon 
of dec 22 the looting was almost over and colon was a wreck 
benedetti and several defense forces officers who had been 
trying to fend off looters began gathering up arms from the 
townspeople and the defense forces troops in hiding within two 
hours they had arranged a surrender delivering several truckloads 
of arms 
the commander of the us forces col john brooks and his 
staff took one look around and realized they had to change gears 
within hours they had come up with project cooperation a plan for 
the rebirth of colon 
the occupation force began arranging relief supplies medical 
care health and sanitation services they set up a joint council 
with the officials president guillermo endara appointed to replace 
the old noriega regime 
theyre super people they are very self reliant brooks 
said of colons new leaders the thing they want is security 
within a week more than 300 of the former defense forces 
personnel had been signed up for a new security force about a 100 
were put on active but unarmed duty and began joint patrols with 
us troops 
details of the corruption that flourished under noriega began 
shaking loose as the dictators allies rushed to align themselves 
with the new order 
the manager of a trading company that served as a slush fund for 
noriega turned himself in professing his eagerness to cooperate 
with the new government 
as a semblance of order returned colon woke up like a drunk 
after a binge benedetti and others began to realize how profound 
the damage has been 
crucial government offices like customs houses had been 
destroyed normal commerce had come to a halt merchants were faced 
with huge uninsured losses the port was shut down banks were 
closed 
the prospects for even deeper poverty and unemployment were grim 
colon is a city with too many problems benedetti said 
there are 60000 people 40000 of them have problems

from harvard to the hard rock cafe to hollywood 
people concerned about highway carnage on new years are promoting 
the designated driver researchers say the idea is catching on but 
habits do not change easily 
we are helping reduce the number of highly intoxicated drivers 
on the road said micky sadoff national president of mothers 
against drunk driving but were not going out of business 
sadly 
using 1988 figures federal officials at the centers for disease 
control in atlanta estimate that by the end of the holiday period 
stretching from dec 21 to jan 2 885 people will have died in 
alcoholrelated crashes 
on new years day the researchers calculated 58 percent of 
traffic deaths involved drinking compared with 39 percent 
yearround 
one death described by police as alcoholrelated did get wide 
attention last week that of new york yankees famed player and 
fivetime manager billy martin who died at 61 in a christmas day 
crash near his home in upstate new york while riding in a pickup 
truck driven by a friend but in most cases the public takes 
little note of such deaths experts say 
weve become accustomed to a large background level of 
carnage said terence chorba an epidemiologist who wrote the cdc 
report 
chorba noted that the number of alcoholrelated traffic deaths 
in the holiday season are the equivalent of several airliners 
crashing 
but in traffic fatalities one person dies here one there 
he said it isnt perceived by the public to have the same type 
of epidemic proportions 
the national highway traffic safety administration reports that 
traffic fatalities related to alcohol have declined the past 
several years both in actual numbers and as a percentage of total 
highway deaths 
last year an estimated 18502 people were killed in 
alcoholrelated crashes or just under 40 percent of all traffic 
deaths in 1982 20360 people died in alcoholrelated crashes or 
46 percent of all highway deaths 
to further the shift in drivers habits the harvard school of 
public health has focused its efforts the past couple of years to 
promote designated driver programs around the country 
for example harvard has persuaded television networks and 
hollywood studios to use dialogue in which characters who have been 
drinking let someone else do the driving 
cheers and family ties were among the popular television 
shows depicting designated drivers last season including alex 
keaton the brash young family ties character played by michael 
j fox growing pains scriptwriters had a character seriously 
injured in an alcoholrelated accident 
at the beginning of last years television season in september 
1988 a gallup poll conducted for harvard found that 62 percent of 
respondents said they regularly appoint a designated driver when 
drinking with friends a followup poll at the end of the season in 
june showed the figure climbing to 72 percent 
i dont take those numbers literally said jay winsten 
assistant dean at the harvard school of public health i think 
its strongly biased by respondents who want to give the socially 
acceptable answer but theres been a shift in public perception of 
what a socially acceptable answer is 
winsten says tough talk is still needed to combat drunken 
driving 
it needs to be viewed by the public as a major source of 
violent crime he said until it is viewed by the public that 
way were not going to solve the problem 
a roper poll published in july found 89 percent of respondents 
saying the designated driver is a good or excellent way to cope 
with drunken driving that was the highest level of support among 
several options such as running public service advertisements 
using random police roadblocks and holding servers legally 
responsible 
some businesses have encouraged use of designated drivers during 
the holiday season 
crum amp forster insurance group in basking ridge nj sent 
designated driver cards before thanksgiving to its 2200 
employees entitling them to a free nonalcoholic drink at a 
participating restaurant 
in california where a new law in 1990 lowers the threshold at 
which a person is legally drunk some 100 marin county restaurants 
and bars have agreed to serve free coffee and soft drinks to 
designated drivers even video shops are offering free tape rentals 
to sober drivers 
in boston the hard rock cafe is sponsoring a contest from new 
years eve until st patricks day in which patrons will be 
encouraged to designate a driver the driver will receive free 
nonalcholic drinks and when the contest ends one of them will be 
chosen at random to receive two free tickets to london 
were not discouraging drinking said sharri miller 
secretary at the restaurant were offering a safe alternative 
home 
winsten said some groups such as young men who go out drinking 
together are the toughest to influence even though they represent 
one of the highest risk groups 
youre not going to change them without a cop with a billy 
club he said

professor iosif nikolaevsky standing in line for 
some cherry wine at a moscow food store doubted hed be able to 
get hold of champagne for his new years eve toast 
he shrugged and said if i cant get champagne ill drink 
tea 
for most muscovites shopping for the traditional new years eve 
family feast is the toughest it has been in memory and what hurts 
most is the shortage of champagne geese chocolates and other 
holiday delicacies 
its the hardest this year sighed pensioner lydia 
sergeyeva handling the jar of murky fruit compote she had just 
bought in the gastronom on central moscows kutuzovsky prospect 
and recalling past years when she could purchase meat and sausage 
easily 
like a dozen other shoppers interviewed in the store she blamed 
supply problems on perestroika mikhail s gorbachevs program of 
reforms but accepted them with equanimity its a transitional 
period its natural for there to be breakdowns she said but 
were optimists 
nearby a young man walked up to the display of dirtencrusted 
withered carrots pickedover cabbages and giant jars of pickled 
tomatoes and shook his head its a nightmare he said what 
to do 
the prospect of toasting the new year without the old bubbly so 
concerned the official news agency tass and government newspaper 
izvestia that they launched investigations into the champagne 
shortage 
not to raise a glass of champagne at new years such a thing 
was not demanded even during the toughest time of the campaign of 
total sobriety tass complained saturday 
gorbachev brought in an antialcohol campaign soon after coming 
to power in 1985 but it faded after bootleg brewing mushroomed and 
state income shrank from lost vodka sales this years champagne 
shortage was clearly not engineered by government teetotalers 
tass reporters went from store to store in search of the sparkly 
stuff but encountered only embattled salespeople angry customers 
wine factory workers who claimed to have fulfilled their production 
plans and store managers who maintained they had never received 
shipments 
the baffled reporters finally explained the shortage with 
typical moscow accusations much of the champagne went to the 
privileged elite and shoppers from out of town snatched up the 
rest 
izvestia however went deeper in its search in an article 
headlined will we have champagne on new years eve it 
determined that the soviet union for all its fame as an exporter 
of vodka and golden champagne produces yearly only about one 
bottle of champagne per person 
glass factories using technology unchanged since 1926 put out 
less than half the bottles needed each year further limiting 
champagne producers the newspaper said 
the izvestia report echoed the government line on the reason for 
widespread shortages gorbachev and other party leaders say the 
period of stagnation under past leaders left the countrys 
industrial base in dangerous disrepair made people lose their 
taste for work and left them indifferent to quality 
delicacies and gifts are freely available in the markets where 
farmers craftsmen and private cooperatives sell their wares at 
prices they set themselves but freemarket prices tend to horrify 
soviets used to state subsidies on most food and small necessities 
slaughtered piglets at one of the capitals 28 farmers markets 
were going for 100 rubles or 160 each the labor daily trud said 
and cucumbers and tomatoes cost about 15 a pound 
if it keeps on like this then in order to buy food for a 
holiday well have to save money all year the newspaper said

fierce fighting between congress and president 
bush this year over cancellation of a handful of conventional 
weapons is a harbinger of the battles expected over the next 
military budget lawmakers say 
secretary dick cheney opened an ugly door said rep john 
rowland rconn looking ahead to the certain strife when the 
pentagon chief delivers his fiscal 1991 defense budget to congress 
in late january 
cheney touched off a tidal wave of dire predictions in the 
pentagon and concern in congress when he directed the military 
services to consider possible cuts amounting to 140 billion to 
180 billion for fiscal 1992 to 1994 
on closer examination the potential cuts in a 199294 defense 
department wish list reflected a pentagon realization that its 
future spending levels would not differ significantly from the 
amounts congress approved during the past five years defense 
analysts and lawmakers say 
white house budget planners have told cheney he can spend a 
little more than 292 billion in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
that means the budget would not keep pace with inflation which the 
administration estimates is averaging 41 percent congress 
approved 286 billion in fiscal 1990 
when congress weighs the new budget it will have to consider 
whether to reduce military spending even further 
lawmakers balked this year when cheney proposed a military plan 
for fiscal 1990 that eliminated 10 conventional weapons programs 
including the marine corps v22 osprey and the navys f14d jet 
fighter but left strategic programs such as the b2 stealth bomber 
relatively intact 
the fiscal 1990 defense budget that emerged from congress 
restored some of the money for the conventional weapons cut funds 
significantly for the strategic defense initiative and trimmed the 
budget for other hightech programs 
the nearly twomonth process left some lawmakers shaking their 
heads in disgust 
in my roughly 20 years involved in this ive never seen such 
forceful if not ruthless lobbying sen john warner of 
virginia ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee said of the wrangling over the f14d jet fighter 
but those skirmishes will seem like childs play when congress 
tackles the next budget most observers say 
the chairman of the house armed services committee took a swipe 
at the bush administration on thursday charging that it bungled 
the announcement of future defense cuts by failing to spell out a 
military strategy 
rep les aspin dwis said that without a strategy the 
administration faces the likelihood of lawmakers concerned with 
parochial interests crafting the defense budget 
i think it will be the most contentious in years 
especially with the shrinking budget and in light of whats going 
on in eastern europe said rep ike skelton dmo an armed 
services committee member 
it will definitely be bloodier said john isaacs of the 
liberal group council for a livable world 
although all the budget numbers and possible weapons cuts have 
not been hammered out and wont be officially until the budget 
arrives on capitol hill likely reductions in the fiscal 1991 
budget have emerged in recent weeks 
to date they include 
slightly more than 292 billion in pentagon spending which 
would mean the military budget wont keep pace with inflation 
according to defense department sources who requested anonymity 
stretching out production of the b2 stealth bomber program 
which could raise the per plane cost of the radarevading aircraft 
from 530 million to as high as 1 billion 
cancellation of the armys m1 tank according to congressional 
sources who asked not to be identified 
reduction of the current troop strength of 21 million by about 
275000 and elimination of three army combat divisions five and a 
fraction air force fighter wings and about 60 naval vessels from a 
fleet of 562 
the defense budget for fiscal 1990 requires cheney to consider 
substantial troop cuts by reducing the military personnel account 
by 461 million cheney must report to congress by jan 1 to 
explain how he will meet the cut 
also on the chopping block again is the v22 osprey which 
congress delayed a decision on by approving 255 million in 
research and development money for the tiltrotor aircraft in 
fiscal 1990 
the pentagon recently ordered the navy to cancel production 
contracts for the osprey although congress had freed up more than 
300 million in production money for the aircraft that had been 
appropriated in fiscal 1989 
and the associated press reported friday that the navy is 
seriously considering limiting purchases of its 12 billion 
trident submarine to every other year 
the battle lines being drawn between congress and the 
administration are obvious according to lawmakers and defense 
analysts interviewed in the last two weeks in the past the 
administration has trimmed the defense budget by eliminating or 
stretching out conventional programs popular in many districts 
while continuing funds for research and development of strategic 
programs 
during the peacetime buildup of the reagan administration when 
few programs suffered there were few complaints 
in the last six to eight years there was a lot to go 
around said rowland a member of the house armed services 
committee who got the dough was making the pie 
but without a clear threat from eastern europe and pressure to 
reduce the defense budget parochial interests in congress will 
clash with administration attempts to maintain a significant budget 
for strategic programs 
our military priorities are wacky said sen carl levin 
dmich a member of the senate armed services committee where 
were eliminating or prematurely terminating or stretching the 
production of useful modern conventional weapons systems in order 
to produce an mx missile the fight will go on the battle will go 
on this will not be easy

mcdonalds customers in minnesota are losing 
a privilege dating from a kinder gentler time that is unheardof 
for fastfood customers in most states paying for their burger and 
fries with a personal check 
starting monday companyowned outlets of the fastfood chain 
throughout the state will stop accepting checks but its not bad 
checks its the high cost of living thats to blame 
the decision was prompted by the mounting cost of check 
processing said steve kopel operations manager for mcdonalds 
regional office in bloomington 
were a highvolume pennyprofit business he said 
processing can cost 6 to 10 cents depending on where the bank is 
located and while losses from bad checks are part of the problem 
we really havent seen a great increase he said 
company officials said the idea of paying by check for a 3 big 
mac meal has been unheardof in other states other national 
fastfood retailers said minnesota is one of the few states where 
they will take checks 
though companyowned mcdonalds are nixing checks restaurants 
operated by independent licensees can set their own check policies 
said kopel some already have banned them he said 
consumer reaction to the policy will be closely monitored by 
company executives through january were going to certainly 
apply some common sense to this kopel said 
some of mcdonalds competition such as the companyowned white 
castle and burger king restaurants have long refused to accept 
checks even in minnesota companyowned taco bells in minnesota 
recently quit taking checks 
minnesota remains one of the few places in the country where 
other major fast food chains such as kentucky fried chicken and 
arbys continue to accept them 
the problem here is if you dont accept checks people will 
walk away said judy cook president of the minnesota retail 
merchants association minnesotans assume its their right to pay 
by check rather than cash even for the smallest amount she said 
by contrast she said people on the east and west coasts 
dont write checks for under 10 
it may be that minnesota is a more trusting community cook 
added 
but not everyone can be trusted some merchants complain that 
the number of worthless checks coming their way has increased over 
the past few years she said

us military authorities today 
defended their search of the nicaraguan ambassadors residence but 
a senior us embassy official said it was a mistake and that steps 
were being taken to apologize 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega retaliated for the search of 
the ambassadors residence friday by ordering the expulsion of 20 
us diplomats 
in washington the state department said today that the soldiers 
who searched the home found a large cache of weapons but returned 
them when they realized the residence was occupied by a nicaraguan 
diplomat 
the state department said nicaraguas response was an 
irresponsible overreaction intended to reduce the us embassys 
ability to monitor the fairness of general elections scheduled in 
nicaragua on feb 25 
in another development the vatican promised to work toward 
resolving the crisis over ousted leader manuel antonio noriega 
in rome the vatican today declared it did not intend to block 
the course of justice by giving refuge to noriega who is wanted 
in the united states on drug trafficking charges he has been in 
the vaticans panama city embassy since sunday four days after the 
united states invaded panama 
the vatican secretariat of state also said in a communique that 
it was continuing to examine the case with us authorities in a 
spirit of serene collaboration in hopes of finding a mutually 
acceptable solution 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said on friday the vatican 
could not hand over noriega to the americans but was urging him to 
leave its embassy in panama city on his own the vatican also 
demanded that us troops stop harassing the vatican mission with 
loud music navarro warned that further steps will be taken by 
the vatican if the harassment continued 
the rap and rock music which has included numerous taunting 
songs seemed intended to torment noriega us troops turned down 
the volume late friday afternoon and it stopped this morning 
nicaraguan ambassador antenor ferrey said about 60 us troops 
ordered him seven nicaraguan staff members and two panamanians to 
leave his residence on friday while american soldiers searched the 
house for two hours 
neighbors of the residence in northeastern panama city said 
soldiers fired shots in the air a us c130 transport plane and a 
helicopter flew overhead 
this violates the principal foundations of the 
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions ferrey told a news 
conference the north americans are going to pay for it 
they acted arrogantly like rambos ortega said in managua 
ortega announced late friday in managua that his government was 
ordering 20 us diplomats to leave nicaragua within 72 hours and 
reduce its support staff from 320 employees to 100 it was unclear 
whether any of the support staff were americans and whether they 
also would have to leave the country many members of the support 
staff are nicaraguans 
the united states does not have an ambassador in managua and it 
was not also immediately known whether us charge daffaires john 
leonard the top us diplomat would be expelled 
american troops have been surrounding nicaraguas embassy but 
not the residence since the dec 20 us invasion the troops have 
also ringed the cuban and libyan embassies on a hunch noriega 
associates might seek refuge 
us air force col ronald sconyers a southern command 
spokesman said today that the search of the house friday was based 
on reliable information from a panamanian citizen that it 
countained a large arms cache 
reading from a statement he said the search was made with 
good cause and said the official nicaraguan embassy residence was 
listed as being an apartment in another part of the city thus it 
was the position of the united states that the house searched did 
not have diplomatic immunity 
ferrey told reporters that he moved more than a year ago and 
that he argued for 75 minutes with the commander of the operation 
asking him to doublecheck his information but that the commander 
refused 
the front wall of the house bears a large nicaraguan seal 
a senior us embassy official said at a press briefing today 
it was a mistake we do not go into diplomatic residences 
speaking on condition that his name not be used the official 
said the troops did not know it was a diplomatic residence until 
the search was well under way and that when they realized it they 
apologized and left 
the had no orders to search if they knew it was the 
ambassadors residence the official said 
he said the united states would take appropriate steps in 
terms of an official apology but he did not say what those steps 
might be 
he said the nicaraguan response of expelling us diplomats from 
managua was disproportionate 
ferrey said the troops seized five rifles that were for 
selfdefense then returned the arms with apologies however a 
watch and 1000 in cash appeared to be missing he said 
sconyers said there were many more weapons there including four 
uzi machine guns 11 ak47 rifles grenades and antitank weapons 
the state department statement said the cache included four 
uzis six rocketpropelled grenade launchers 12 ak47s three hand 
grenades 10 fen rifles 17 bayonets 1 m1 carbine one shotgun 
four rocketpropelled grenade sights one light antitank weapon 
27 rocketpropelled grenade rounds approximately 1300 rounds of 
ammunition of various caliber 
the state department said the soldiers entered the residence 
after receiving a tip that arms were hidden there and that the 
weapons they found were clearly in excess of normal requirements 
for defending the residence 
when it was determined that the residence was that of a 
nicaraguan diplomat the weapons were returned the nicaraguan 
government claims that the nicaraguans were mistreated during the 
search are not accurate there was no damage to the house or 
injuries to the occupants the state department said 
despite the fact that we expressed our regrets about the 
incident which involved a substantial weapons cache the 
nicaraguan government has taken the decision to expel the majority 
of us personnel assigned to our embassy in managua and to reduce 
drastically the number of nicaraguan employees 
this is an irresponsible overreaction and clearly motivated by 
nicaraguan desires to reduce the size of our mission by reducing 
our mission drastically the nicaraguan government hopes to curtail 
severely our ability to monitor the fairness and openness of the 
elections

if a country like romania were just an 
ordinary person applying for a mortgage or a loan bankers would 
consider him or her an excellent risk 
but romanias prospects are uncertain 
the country has a welleducated work force good land and 
mineral resources almost no foreign debt and a surplus in world 
trade but it will need massive credit to switch from a controlled 
communist economy to something more like a free market system 
the problem for world lenders is that romanias past behavior 
under communist dictator nicolae ceausescu gives little clue to 
what it will do in the future under a government whose shape cannot 
yet be foreseen 
with a person you can look at past behavior said pietra 
rivoli an assistant professor of business administration at 
georgetown university with a country you look at ability to pay 
 
the united states has an enormous debt but its able and 
willing to meet its payments she said 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the congressional joint 
economic committee predicted that a large flow of goods and money 
will be needed in eastern europe if market prices are to be set 
free from the control of communist governments 
goods also are needed to keep inflation down 
those countries have a goods shortage he told reporters 
last week when you free prices youll have a terrible inflation 
unless they have goods from the west 
vladimir tismaneanu who came to this country from romania told 
a television interviewer that ceausescu paid off his countrys 
foreign debt because he did not want anyone to be in the position 
of a creditor objecting to human rights abuses in romania 
when tismaneanu left in 1981 romania owed foreigners more than 
10 billion by last year the debt was less than 28 billion 
to get that reduction ceausescu imposed a severe austerity 
program exporting as much as possible including romanias 
normally abundant food supply to get the necessary cash 
the central intelligence agency calculated that romania was the 
only major country in eastern europe where per capita income 
declined in 1988 its figure was the lowest in the region 5490 
tismaneanu said this situation opens the possibility for loans 
john steinbruner who directs foreign policy studies at the 
brookings institution was sceptical 
romania has been very very isolated he said in an 
interview 
its internal development is primitive there will be a 
response to appeals for help but it will be aid rather than 
investment theyll have to show a fair amount of political 
stability and responsible policy before theres any investment 
the soviet union hungary poland and yugoslavia all are 
installing new policies meant to attract foreigners into joint 
ventures and other projects that will bring new capital and 
knowhow 
romania lags far behind them according to kate holder research 
associate at the center for strategic and international studies 
the provisional government has no idea what to do she said 
there wont be any economic reform until after the election in 
april i cant imagine anyone considering investment in romania 
yet

the germanys have joined forces to keep 
rallies by neonazis from ruining the first new years that germans 
on both sides of the border can celebrate together 
east germany on saturday opened new border crossings to make it 
easier for germans to cross over into their neighboring country to 
mark the end of a momentous year and the beginning perhaps of a 
new era of closeness 
west german chancellor helmut kohl in a televised new years 
message to be aired sunday credited the reform movements in the 
soviet union poland and hungary for making the democratic 
revolution in east germany possible 
this past year has brought the unity of our fatherland a good 
deal closer kohl said after decades of division awareness of 
the unity of our nation is alive 
in another interview to be published sunday west german 
president richard von weizsaecker said a joint head of state for 
east germany and west germany is conceivable 
but in the interview with the hamburgbased newspaper bild am 
sonntag weizsaecker cautioned that germans in both states must be 
patient in bridging the divisions 
kohl and other conservatives have fueled a confrontation between 
those who support reunification and those who feel east germany 
should remain independent 
ultraright activists planned to use the more relaxed border 
procedures during the weekend to infiltrate east german border 
towns and demonstrate for reunification according to officials in 
the west german city of fulda 
viking youth a neonazi group fashioning itself after the 
hitler youth has appealed to radical sympathizers to cross into 
east germany from hesse state with flashlights and fireworks to 
stage a noisy demonstration the fulda officials said 
erwin maisch of the west german border patrol in fulda and 
regional police chief karl ball told reporters west and east german 
authorities agreed to increase patrols in the area 
east german officials warned last week of an increase in 
neofascist incidents during the past year because of the dizzying 
pace of reforms massive protests in east germany ousted the 
hardline leadership in a matter of weeks 
a new years eve gathering of the viking youth has been 
forbidden by fulda regional council chief fritz kramer who warned 
that rightwing demonstrations could lead to violent 
consequences 
several hundred women from both sides of divided berlin 
demonstrated along east berlins famed unter den linden 
thoroughfare saturday to protest fascism 
the demonstrators led by eva rohmann of the east german state 
womens organization denounced vandalism by rightwing extremists 
who last week targeted a soviet war memorial in the suburb of 
treptow 
neonazi desecrations have reportedly been on the rise in east 
germany in recent months but officials claim most of the 
disturbances are created by radicals from west germany 
participants in the peaceful prodemocracy rallies held in 
leipzig each monday contend that many banners pressing for 
reunification are the work of west german ultrarightists 
west german border authorities said saturday they were informed 
of at least 20 temporary pedestrian crossings opened along the east 
german border with bavaria state to facilitate the heavy traffic 
expected on the holiday weekend 
more than 350000 east germans arrived in west germany in the 
two days prior to noon saturday and more than 50000 west germans 
crossed into northern east germany authorities said

staterun radio and tv dropped without explanation 
last weeks broadcast of the countrys most popular program whose 
controversial and freewheeling shows have been a lightning rod for 
conservative criticism 
one youth newspaper moskovsky komsomolets complained saturday 
that the decision to pull the twohour vzglad program from the 
friday night schedule smacked of the heavyhanded preglasnost 
censorship of the media in a word to spit on public opinion 
and forget about it 
alexander lyubimov one of the creators of vzglad or view 
said by telephone that the directors of gostelradio made a 
decision to reduce the amount of political programming on the eve 
of the new year 
he refused to comment further on the decision 
vzglad has used the freer atmosphere of glasnost to tackle 
touchy subjects in spring members of the communist party central 
committee expressed outrage when stage director mark zakharov 
suggested on the program that lenins body be removed from display 
in a mausoleum on red square and buried 
since then the idea has gained some public support among soviet 
intellectuals 
boris nepomnyashchy director of the nationwide radio network 
mayak that is another branch of the state radio and tv complex 
told listeners during a live callin program saturday that the 
vzglad program for friday was not ready and would be shown 
shortly after the new years holiday his secretary said 
instead of vzglad viewers were shown a program dedicated to 
the work of leningrad theater director igor vladimirov television 
sources said the decision to pull the friday edition of vzglad 
was made thursday only the communist party daily pravda was able 
to make a lastminute change in its program listing 
sources close to vzglad said the program would be back on 
the air jan 5 but that tv schedules in the future would list only 
youth program in their late evening time slot allowing 
different programming to be substituted at the last minute 
they denied moskovsky komsomolets report that plainclothes men 
had entered the programs studios and seized all copies of the 
intended program which the newspaper reported was to be a parody 
of the stodgy nightly tv news program vremya 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
program was to air a piece on human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov who died dec 14 and a historical review of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform effort 
soviet media have come under pressure lately from gorbachev and 
other officials to narrow the scope of the public debate about the 
soviet past and instead try to build a consensus on how to solve 
difficult social and economic problems 
but one vzglad source speculated that the cancellation of 
the program was instigated by gorbachevs conservative foes to make 
the soviet leader look bad before a public that would assume the 
program only could be canceled on his authority 
moskovsky komsomolets also claimed that a black list of rock 
groups that should not be shown on soviet tv was circulating at the 
state television studios

a federal appeals court rejected the claim 
by three battered women that the city of butler discriminated 
against them by limiting the number of people who could live at a 
shelter proposed in a residential neighborhood 
but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals sent the case back to 
district court to consider whether the city would be equally fair 
if it banned such shelters from other types of neighborhoods 
three battered women using fictitious names filed a class 
action suit challenging the city councils refusal to approve an 
application by the volunteers against child abuse center of butler 
county to use a building it had contracted to buy the suit was 
thrown out and the women took the case to the appeals court 
in an opinion last week the appeals court held that the 
ordinance limiting transitional dwellings to six residents not 
counting staff members was not arbitrary and thus did not violate 
the plaintiffs constitutional rights of free association and due 
process 
the ordinance was rationally related to the legitimate 
government objective of controlling density in a residential 
neighborhood the court said but in areas other than 
singlefamilyhome neighborhoods such a ban might not prove to be 
as rational the court said in returning the dispute to the lower 
court 
the plaintiffs had argued a shelter that did not house 12 to 15 
women and children was economically unfeasible

parliament deputies on saturday demanded 
more democracy and improvements in the economy as they debated 
whether to give a vote of confidence to the new government of prime 
minister mudar badran 
lawmakers predicted that approval of badrans 25member cabinet 
was likely in the vote sunday despite the tough attacks on his 
government 
the debate caps a revival of life in the parliament last month 
jordan held its first general elections in 22 years 
king hussein on dec 4 named badran to form a new government 
the cabinet he formed will have the task of negotiating with 
parliament on new legislation but first it must win a vote of 
confidence from parliament 
twenty members of the moslem brotherhood the largest bloc in 
the 80man parliament said in a joint statement they would abstain 
unless the government agreed to stricter islamic laws quick repeal 
of martial law reinstatement of public officials fired for 
security reasons and a ban on liquor sales in public places 
including aboard royal jordanian airline flights 
the large number of deputies rising to address parliament forced 
speaker suleiman arar to postpone a vote on the question until 
sunday 
abdullatif arabiyyat delivering the brotherhoods joint 
statement said brotherhood deputies had told badran earlier that 
they would cooperate with a strong clean government although 
efforts to agree on ministerial seats for the brotherhood collapsed 
and then we were faced with a surprise a government that 
was much below the level of our aspirations and the aspirations of 
the people he said 
hundreds of people jammed the public galleries for the debate 
sometimes applauding deputies below about 100 others demonstrated 
in front of the building to demand immediate freedom for political 
prisoners 
even some steadfast loyalists of the king said they would vote 
against the new government despite a series of measures by badran 
to loosen martial law restrict the security forces and free the 
press 
former royal court chief thouqan hindawi accused badran of 
helping create the kingdoms debt crisis during earlier terms as 
prime minister from 1979 to 1983 and he said it was difficult to 
determine how the money was spent 
where is the rest of the money mr badran asked hindawi 
who resigned as king husseins chief aide to run for parliament in 
november during jordans first nationwide election since 1967 
economic problems caused by the debt crisis led to four days of 
rioting in april that toppled the government of thenprime minister 
zaid rifai and led hussein to launch a series of liberalizing 
measures 
many jordanians allege that government corruption caused much of 
the economic problems 
since taking office badrans government has eliminated some of 
the security checks for passports and work permits and has stripped 
most of the work from martial law courts as well as liberalizing 
the press 
but many of the deputies speaking saturday demanded full repeal 
of martial law imposed during the 1967 war with israel and 
legalization of political parties banned more than 30 years ago 
some also called for investigations into the countrys economic 
distress and trials of those deemed responsible

champion garri kasparov surpasses american bobby fischer to become 
the highestranked player in history 
according to the biannual ranking list published by the 
international chess federation on friday and effective from jan 1 
kasparov is rated 2800 
fischers highest rating based on scores against other 
internationally ranked players was 2785 
it gives me great pleasure said kasparov the 26yearold 
soviet champion at some level its important for the chess world 
that this belongs to the current world champion to a real player 
not a ghost 
some experts had suggested fischer could never be bettered 
kasparov said but now people can see that chess does improve 
fischer overwhelmed boris spassky in the 1972 world championship 
finale in rekyavik iceland but refused to defend his championship 
crown in 1975 for more than 17 years the eccentric genius now 
46 has lived a reclusive life in pasadena calif and has not 
competed in public 
its a stupendous achievement said grandmaster larry evans 
a former us champion who seconded fischer during his climb to the 
top speaking by telephone from his home in reno nev i would 
still like to see a match between fischer and kasparov but its a 
vain hope 
kasparov has maintained his level of achievement for many 
years while fischer simply disappeared evans said 
fischer and i belong to different times kasparov said 
you cant compare players from different epochs 
in 1975 former world champion mikhail botvinnik declared in 
the hands of this young man lies the future of chess 
eleven years later kasparov defeated archrival anatoly karpov 
in their second title duel and became at 22 the youngest 
titleholder in history 
when kasparov crushed grandmaster tony miles 5505 in a 1985 
match miles exclaimed i thought i was playing the world 
champion not some 27eyed monster who sees everything in all 
positions 
impatient outspoken and decisive kasparov publicly criticized 
soviet sports officials a year before mikhail s gorbachev allowed 
greater openness 
kasparov has a british manager to look after his business 
interests appears live on western talk shows and has been 
interviewed by playboy magazine 
in march he married maria aratova a 24yearold english 
translator for the novosti news agency 
in october he overwhelmed deep thought the world computer 
champion 20 in a match in new york 
his remaining ambition he said is to beat karpov 
convincingly the personal and professional rivalry between the 
two has already stretched over a recordbreaking 131 games the 
38yearold karpovs rating fell back on the new list to 2730 
kasparov also is involved in battles away from the board 
following a longrunning and bitter dispute with the chess 
federation president florencio campomanes of the philippines 
kasparov in 1986 created an association of grandmasters known as 
the gma to give palyers a greater say in the running of their game 
its aims he said are to raise the image and financial status 
of chess to the highest possible level to get real support for the 
game 
at a meeting of the gma in december grandmasters accepted by 4 
to 1 a resolution from kasparov calling for the gma to take control 
of the 1990 world championship final 
the chess federation has given the match to lyon france but if 
kasparovs move succeeds the second half of the 10week title duel 
could be staged in the united states likely venues are new york 
los angeles san francisco and chicago 
there is no doubt i will play in the united states kasparov 
said

there is historical precedent for the vatican 
agreeing to turn over a fugitive to the united states although the 
holy see maintains it cannot surrender ousted strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega from its embassy in panama 
the vatican adopted an entirely different position when asked to 
turn over one of the suspected conspirators in the 1865 
assassination of president abraham lincoln john h surratt jr 
surratt a young confederate spy who had conspired with john 
wilkes booth to abduct lincoln in 1864 fled after booth shot 
lincoln on april 14 1865 
surratt a devout catholic changed his name to john watson and 
joined pope pius ixs zouaves regiment in late 1865 or early 1866 
the unit was part of the army that defended the papal states at 
that time an independent country about the size of west virginia 
against claims by italian nationalists 
surratt was located in 1866 with the help of an informer who 
recognized him and reported to us authorities whereupon 
secretary of state william h seward notified secretary of war em 
stanton 
as we have no treaty of extradition with the papal government 
it is proposed that a special agent be sent to rome to demand the 
surrender of surratt seward wrote stanton on may 28 1866 
accordingly the us envoy to the vatican rufus king sought a 
meeting with the popes foreign minister cardinal antonelli to tell 
him about surratt 
his eminence was greatly interested by it and intimated that 
if the american government desired the surrender of the criminal 
there would probably be no difficulty in any way king wrote 
seward on aug 8 
several months later having ascertained that watson was indeed 
the fugitive surratt seward instructed king to ask the cardinal 
whether his holiness the pope would now be willing in the 
absence of an extradition treaty to deliver john h surratt upon 
authentic indictment and at the request of this department for 
complicity in the assassination of the late president abraham 
lincoln 
so eager was the vatican to help the united states that it did 
not even wait for an official request and ordered surratt arrested 
immediately 
some surprise perhaps may be expressed that surratt was 
arrested by the papal authorities before any request to that effect 
had been made by the american government king wrote seward 
vatican authorities gave me to understand that the arrest was 
made with the approval of his holiness and in anticipation of any 
application from the state department 
the surratt and noriega cases are similar in that the vatican 
still doesnt have an extradition treaty with the united states 
or panama but the two incidents differ in another significant way 
in the present instance the vatican says its embassy cant 
under international law give up an asylumseeker to a third 
country the united states it can only give up noriega to panama 
the vatican says if it decides noriega doesnt qualify as a 
political asylum case 
surratts case didnt end with papal cooperation however for 
the fugitive proved to be wilier and more agile than the six men 
sent to escort him from his regiment to rome on nov 8 1866 
the arresting officer reported to his superiors that surratt 
alias watson leapt from a height of 23 feet on a very narrow 
rock landed on a garbage heap and disappeared 
king received repeated assurances and documentation from 
cardinal antonelli proving the vaticans good faith in the affair 
and describing efforts to locate surratt in fact several days 
after the escape the papal war minister gen kauster called to 
inform me of a rumor which had reached him that a wounded surratt 
had checked himself into an italian hospital near the papal 
frontier king wrote seward 
a us diplomat gave chase from rome but missed surratt who 
had set sail for egypt on nov 17 1866 
surratt eventually was tracked down in alexandria and a us 
warship brought him back to the united states 
a postscript to the affair 
surratts mother mary who ran a boarding house that booth and 
his coconspirators had used as a meeting place was hanged along 
with three other group members 
surratt was tried by a civil court in washington in 1867 he was 
freed by a hung jury

president bush today said today the us military 
search of the nicaraguan ambassadors residence in panama city 
was a screwup but added that the heavy arsenal found in the 
home makes you wonder exactly what our young men are up against 
down there 
the president speaking to reporters after an 18hole game of 
golf at the houston country club said that apologies were being 
made to the nicaraguan government for the episode but bush said 
life goes on 
when you find those kind of weapons caches even though i 
think in retrospect that we shouldnt have gone in there it makes 
you wonder exactly what our young men are up against down there 
bush said i dont know what they need rocket launchers for in a 
mans house 
its a screwup and they us military officials in panama 
have expressed their regrets that it happened bush said he 
added that it shouldnt have happened and thats been explained 
to the nicaraguans 
bush also said that he was not seeking a fight with the vatican 
and that he hoped that rhetoric could cool down on both sides of 
the stalemate over the fate of deposed panamanian dictator manuel 
antonio noriega who has sought refuge in the vaticans embassy in 
panama 
if need be ill get on the phone with the holy father bush 
said adding i dont think it will come to that we have good 
relations with the vatican 
however bush added they have a history of giving asylum to 
people who are fleeing even thugs like noriega 
the president said he was ending the year satisfied that 
conditions are stabilizing in panama despite the standoff on 
noriegas future the man at least is off the streets bush 
said 
earlier today white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked if 
the united states would retaliate for the expulsion of its 
diplomats from nicaragua said no course of actions been set 
defending the us military search of the residence where the 
nicaraguan ambassador was staying fitzwater said we didnt know 
it was an ambassadors residence 
they got a tip they were looking for arms and they found 
arms fitzwater told reporters in houston we were looking for 
arms caches were finding them all over panama city arms caches 
are turning up everywhere 
its part of the standard moppingup operation discovering 
and confiscating these weapons is important to maintaining the 
peace and in line with all the reasons we went into panama in the 
first place fitzwater said 
he said the people in the home did not identify themselves when 
us troops arrived to conduct the search 
on fridays 7520 vote by the united nations general assembly 
condemning the us invasion of panama fitzwater said we felt 
we did the right thing for the right reasons 
the administration disputed friday a vatican claim that the 
united states is an occupying power in panama but it also 
sought to sooth building tensions with the roman catholic church 
the vaticans doing a fine job fitzwater said we 
appreciate their efforts we continue to work with them in a very 
positive way we think that theyve taken a very serious and 
constructive role in this episode 
the vatican has refused to turn over noriega holed up in the 
vatican embassy in panama city since christmas eve to the united 
states despite insistent us demands that he be brought to 
florida to face drugtrafficking charges 
on his flight to houston aboard air force one on friday the 
president waved and grinned at reporters traveling with him but had 
nothing to say 
and fitzwater made it clear the white house preferred to have as 
little as possible to say about the tense standoff or about 
negotiations on noriegas future 
theres just not much that we have to say or want to say while 
this is going on he told reporters 
after arriving here bush had dinner with secretary of state 
james a baker iii and scowcroft at a private houston club 
on sunday bush was to travel to san antonio to visit two 
military hospitals wilford hall air force medical center and 
brooke army medical center where many of the more than 300 troops 
wounded in panama are being treated 
the president was to return to washington late new years day 
after a halfday fishing excursion in alabama 
bush and hunting companions baker and houston oilman william 
farish bagged 20 quail during their hunting excursions on farishs 
10000acre ranch near the south texas town of beeville fitzwater 
said 
baker also caught a 19pound turkey which was cleaned and 
dressed and brought to houston by the president we eat our 
game fitzwater said 
animal rights demonstrators had staged a protest outside the 
ranch claiming bushs hunting did not square with his kinder but 
gentler rhetoric 
although fitzwater said the administration wanted to avoid 
further confrontation with the vatican state department spokesman 
richard boucher in washington took issue with the vaticans 
description of the united states as an occupation force in panama 
we are down there with the consent of the government of 
panama the legitimately elected leaders of panama boucher said 
that means were not an occupying power 
fitzwater had said talks with roman catholic church officials 
were proceeding in a positive vein and refused to be drawn into 
an argument with the vatican 
on how long it might take to end the stalemate fitzwater said 
we cant predict how long it will take well just go calmly 
along 
meanwhile bush on friday sent warm congratulations to 
vaclav havel on his election as president of czechoslovakia 
the white house said the election of the once dissident 
playwright marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in 
eastern europe

parliament on saturday approved sweeping 
democratic reforms that for the first time in 45 years allow the 
formation of new political parties protect private property and 
scrap the communists guaranteed leading role in society 
lawmakers also restored polands historic name and national 
emblem both changed after the sovietbacked communists took power 
in 1944 
in an emotional end to the sessions work members rose and sang 
the national anthem and god who watches over poland 
the two houses of parliament had met in almost constant session 
over the past four days passing the most radical economic reforms 
ever attempted in the east bloc and creating a more democratic 
constitution 
i am optimistic solidarity prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki told reporters during a reception in parliament when 
asked what he thought the coming year would bring 
the constitutional amendments give citizens the right to create 
independent political parties until now the communist party the 
democratic party and the peasant party were the only legally 
recognized parties in poland solidarity which began as a labor 
union has become a de facto political party 
the amended constitution also guarantees the protection of 
private property much of which was seized by the communists at the 
end of world war ii 
the senate approved the changes on a 790 vote with two 
abstentions the sejm as the lower house of parliament is called 
adopted the amendments 3741 with 11 abstentions late friday but 
senate approval of sejm votes is required for bills to become law 
the amendments drop or modify articles in the constitution 
inconsistent with democratic reforms introduced since solidarity 
scored a stunning victory in june elections that led to formation 
of the east blocs first noncommunist government 
the amendments restored the republic of poland as the countrys 
official name from the peoples republic of poland which was 
imposed by the communists four decades ago 
a smiling announcer on the late afternoon news program 
teleexpress greeted viewers in the republic of poland 
following similar action in other formerly rigid communist 
countries in eastern europe the parliament deleted a 
constitutional clause that guaranteed the leading role of the 
communist party in society 
the amendments also restored democratic language and traditions 
changing a phrase that called poland a socialist society to a 
citizens society 
in addition the prewar crown that graced the head of the eagle 
on the national emblem was restored the crown symbolizes polish 
sovereignty and unity 
after the senate vote an eagle with a crown brought two weeks 
earlier by a farmer was hung in the senate hall 
the farmer whose name was not noted when he made the gift to 
the senates human rights commission said the eagle was the only 
souvenir he had of his father 
in addition to their legislative sessions polands political 
leaders who less than a year ago were at odds with each other met 
to exchange greetings for the new year 
solidarity leader lech walesa met saturday with communist party 
leader mieczyslaw f rakowski mazowiecki met with communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski on friday after cardinal jozef glemp 
made the first postwar visit by a polish primate to parliament 
on friday the senate approved a package of 11 economic laws 
backed by the solidarityled government to create a marketoriented 
economy and reduce inflation 
if successful the economic package which covers credit policy 
joint ventures foreign capital hard currency customs and 
taxation will transform economic life in poland 
two laws on unemployment are designed to protect the 400000 
workers the government estimates could lose their jobs as poland 
makes the difficult transition to a market economy the plan is 
likely to result in the closing of some inefficient enterprises 
other laws regulate financing of state enterprises and limit the 
growth of wages a measure designed to hold down inflation now 
running at 900 percent

bargainers for the united mine workers and the 
pittston co continued marathon negotiations saturday as they 
pushed for an end to a bitter strike thats idled coal miners in 
three states since april 
the two sides returned to the table about 9 am saturday after 
meeting behind closed doors at a washington hotel until about 230 
am said herb fishgold an aide to mediator wj usery 
saturdays daylong bargaining session was the fourth since 
christmas 
both sides were under a gag order imposed by usery and it was 
unclear whether the same kind of progress was made during the 
latest round of negotiations as was reported during the 
prechristmas meetings 
usery a former labor secretary named by labor secretary 
elizabeth dole to mediate the coal talks said last week hed like 
to have a tentative settlement by new years day for miners in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky 
at the umw office in castlewood va district 28 president 
jackie stump said he had been telling striking miners if it does 
happen it will be great but just dont depend on it 
even if pittston miners start off the year with a new contract 
things wont be the same as before in the coalfields before the 
bitter dispute stump said 
its going to take a while and maybe a long time for the 
wounds to heal stump said 
some 1700 coal miners in the three states are on strike against 
pittston the union said the companys decision to end 
contributions to a united mine workers retirement and health plan 
and job security were the main issues the miners had worked 14 
months without a contract before the strike began april 5 
the violencemarred walkout was prompted by pittstons refusal 
to contribute to the umws industrywide fund for miners 
retirement and health plans for some 130000 pensioners pittston 
the nations largest coal exporter says it cannot afford the 
payments other us coal companies make because it faces greater 
costs in sending coal abroad 
union leaders said other coal companies also would refuse to pay 
into the benefit plan if pittstons attempt to stay out held up 
the umw has given each striker about 200 a week in benefits 
and the union said it would give strikers a 1250 christmas bonus 
the union is facing fines totaling 635 million for violating 
court orders limiting picketing and other strike activities 
pittston has hired replacement workers but production has been 
well below prestrike levels the company reported its coal 
operations lost 36 million in the second quarter of 1989 and 98 
million in the third quarter compared with profits of 9 million 
and 74 million in the respective quarters of 1988

a political party that favors lithuanian 
independence from the soviet union has been formally recognized by 
the republic making it the first legal noncommunist party in the 
country acvitists said saturday 
the new party is the 2000member party of democrats of 
lithuania which advocates full autonomy for the baltic republic of 
37 million people said pyatrus pechelunas a member of the party 
presidium 
the party supports neither socialism nor capitalism but believes 
lithuanians should choose an economic system after the republic 
achieves independence he said from the lithuanian capital vilnius 
alternative political parties were illegal until early december 
when the lithuanian parliament eliminated a section of the 
constitution guaranteeing the supremacy of the communist party and 
substituted a multiparty system for the small republic 
noncommunist parties have cropped up elsewhere in the soviet 
union but remain illegal lithuanias baltic neighbors latvia and 
estonia are expected to vote in january on similar constitutional 
amendments permitting multiple political parties 
also registered friday was the independent communist party of 
lithuania a party congress voted 855160 last week to break away 
from the soviet communist party and support independence for the 
baltic republic 
the registration of the two lithuanian parties also was reported 
saturday in the moscowbased sovietskaya rossia newspaper 
the moves in lithuanian have brought furious complaints from 
kremlin leaders who delegated president mikhail s gorbachev head 
of the soviet communist party to travel to lithuania in the near 
future to discuss the controversy 
meanwhile conservative communists formed a provisional 
leadership for a communist party that would remain an integral part 
of the soviet one tass reported saturday the group opposes 
independence said vladislav shved a secretary of the 
provisional central committee in an interview with the defense 
ministry newspaper red star 
the newspaper quoted shved as saying the group hoped gorbachevs 
visit would swing wavering communists back into the kremlins 
embrace 
gintautas alksninis of sajudis the main lithuanian activist 
group estimated the promoscow group has the support of 
approximately 20 percent of the 204000 communist party members in 
lithuania 
alksninis speaking by telephone from vilnius said numerous 
political parties are signing up members in lithuania and they 
should be registered soon the social democrats are the largest of 
the noncommunists he said 
the first election pitting alternative parties in lithuania will 
be the republics parliamentary election feb 24 
in the first election with multiple candidates in march those 
backed by sajudis trounced conservative communists who had held 
positions of power for decades sajudis as a broadbased 
prodemocracy group includes members of various parties including 
progressive communists 
the growing independence of the baltic nations and other soviet 
republics presents gorbachev with one of his most pressing 
problems his advocacy of reform since taking power in 1985 helped 
fuel movements that toppled hardline governments in hungary 
poland czechoslovakia romania east germany and bulgaria this 
year 
but gorbachev faced with the same sort of reform movements that 
he encouraged elsewhere is trying to slow such nationalism to 
prevent the breakup of the soviet union

nicaraguas expulsion of 20 american diplomats 
from managua after us troops found an arms cache at a nicaraguan 
diplomats residence in panama city was an irresponsible 
overreaction the state department said saturday 
the expulsion order from nicaraguan president daniel ortega was 
clearly motivated by nicaraguan desires to reduce the size of our 
mission before nicaraguan elections in february the state 
department said in a statement 
by reducing our mission drastically the nicaraguan government 
hopes to curtail severely our ability to monitor the fairness and 
openness of the elections the statement said 
the wide array of weapons discovered during fridays search of 
the residence were returned when us troops determined they had 
searched the residence of a nicaraguan diplomat the state 
department said 
shortly after the search ortega said 20 american diplomats were 
being expelled from managua in retaliation for the incident 
nicaraguas ambassador to panama antenor ferrey said us 
troops surrounded his residence in panama city ordered all 
personnel outside and searched the building for weapons 
the state department said us troops were reacting to 
reliable information regarding an arms cache when it searched the 
residence it was occupied by individuals who turned out to be 
members of the nicaraguan diplomatic mission the department said 
ferrey had said five rifles were seized and later returned by 
us troops with apologies but the state department said saturday 
that us troops located weapons in excess of normal requirements 
for defending the residence 
the state department said the cache included four uzi machine 
guns six rocketpropelled grenade launchers 12 ak47s three hand 
grenades 10 fen rifles 17 bayonets one m1 carbine one shotgun 
four rocketpropelled grenade sights one light antitank weapon

michael white takes over as mayor this week 
beginning the task of pursuading developers to give as much 
attention to neighborhoods in the 1990s as they did to rebuilding 
the downtown in the past decade 
some of the citys neighborhoods look like germany in 1945 
he said 
white 38 says he has been dreaming of being mayor since he was 
a teenager 
ive sought this prize for 24 years said white the 
things ive done have basically been designed to get me where 
im going to be monday he said in an interview last week 
white resigns as a state senator effective sunday before being 
sworn in monday he also has been a cleveland councilman and 
columbus housing director 
as mayor he succeeds george voinovich who has held the post 
since 1979 voinovich has been credited at least partly with 
steering cleveland out of financial default and sagging esteem his 
is now seeking the gop nomination for governor 
white beat a fellow democrat city council president george 
forbes in a nonpartisan race in november after a bruising 
campaign during which white was called a slumlord he acknowledged 
he had rental properties that need repairs 
early in a fiveman primary the citys most heavily contested 
mayoral race in more than a decade white was considered a long 
shot 
forbes chose the mayoral race over seeking reelection to city 
council where he had reigned as president for 16 years he is 
returning to private law practice 
during the voinovich and forbes era the cleveland skyline 
expanded with office towers a lake erie harbor project and the 
startups of two bank skyscrapers hotels a shopping mecca and a 
rock and roll hall of fame theres also talk of a new baseball 
stadium 
voinovich said pointedly that he and forbes are leaving with 
the lights on and the cranes hanging 
but white says the downtown renaissance hasnt improved the 
quality of life in many of clevelands neighborhoods he promised 
that his administration would foster growth on both sides 
i think that what i bring to the office is kind of a view of 
balance he said our neighborhoods are falling apart some of 
them look like germany in 1945 
you cannot have a great town with only a great downtown there 
has to be a balancewe will continue to lose people in this town if 
we do not restore the quality of life at the neighborhood level 
in the past 20 years the citys population has declined to 
550000 from 800000 
other problems include a nearly 50 percent dropout rate in the 
city school system 40 percent of the population living below the 
federal poverty level shabby public housing with maintenance so 
poor that the city had to name a new housing authority director to 
get federal aid and drug peddling and other crimes common in big 
cities 
one of whites goals is to add about 240 officers to bring the 
citys police force up to 2000 
others are establishing a better environment for small 
businesses building more housing and continuing to encourage what 
he sees as improvement in race relations in a city where the 
blackwhite population is roughly even 
white also said he favors tax abatement to encourage economic 
growth but said he would wring from developers as many 
stipulations beneficial to the city as he could such as certain 
percentages of jobs given to clevelanders and funding for 
neighborhood improvements 
more than 200 million in tax abatements have been granted to 
developers of downtown in the past two years 
if we build 100 new buildings but six or seven out of 10 of 
those jobs continue to go to suburbanites then we havent made any 
progress he said and today six out of 10 jobs in cleveland 
go to people who dont live here thats why we have so much 
poverty 
ive said to the business community yes i will help them 
with economic development but they must help me with the creation 
of new jobs

when a group that claimed responsibility for two 
mail bomb assassinations made a blanket death threat against naacp 
officials that blanket might well have been dropped over earl 
shinhosters head 
shinhoster southeastern regional director for the naacp has 
emerged as a potential target of someones apparent grudge against 
his group and the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
ive always understood very clearly the security implications 
for what i do shinhoster said friday night 
these folks are deadly serious whether this is isolated 
whether its one or two issues involved shinhoster said im 
less concerned about reasons here as i am about how to deal with 
it 
im really concerned for shinhoster and others with the 
naacp said charles king an atlanta civil rights activist 
this is very serious for them but the rest of us i dont 
think were that much at risk 
shinhosters jurisdiction in the national association for the 
advancement of colored people includes georgia alabama and 
florida the three states that make up the 11th circuit of the 
federal appeals court 
package bombs killed 11th us circuit judge robert vance on 
dec 16 and savannah ga lawyer and civil rights activist robert 
robinson two days later two others were intercepted at the 11th 
circuit building in atlanta and the jacksonville fla naacp 
office 
in august a mailed teargas bomb went off in shinhosters 
office injuring eight people at about the time letters declaring 
war against the 11th circuit popped up at several television 
stations 
and a threatening letter much like the one in which 
americans for a competent federal judicial system claimed 
responsibility for the bombs that killed vance and robinson 
arrived at shinhosters office shortly after the teargas did 
i think it was very specific and targeted shinhoster said 
i dont think it was happenstance 
authorities have confirmed that the letters appear to come from 
someone involved in the mail bombings 
shinhoster said that link means he probably will be greeted by 
guards police and fbi agents wherever he goes at least in the 
immediate future on friday he said police officers met him at 
the airport in savannah where he went for a funeral 
when i got back on the plane they put me on the plane he 
said 
james d williams national spokesman for the baltimorebased 
naacp said the organization has taken extra security precautions 
he would not specify 
we believe that this latest incident is an effort to 
intimidate our association to strike fear in our hearts said 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks it will not succeed we 
intend to go about our business but we will most certainly be 
taking precautions

president bush called the ransacking by us 
troops of the nicaraguan ambassadors residence in panama city a 
screwup that should not have happened but questioned why the 
sandinista envoy was up to his eyeballs in rocket launchers 
grenades and automatic weaponry 
at the same time bush predicted the diplomatic standoff with 
the vatican over the fate of deposed panamanian dictator manuel 
antonio noriega soon would be resolved to the united states 
satisfaction 
bush winding up a yearend vacation told reporters after a 
round of golf that the death of a lot of our kids in the dec 
20 invasion of panama has made him determined to bring noriega to 
justice not let him slip off into exile in a third country 
bush said us military authorities have apologized to 
nicaraguan ambassador antenor ferrey for the incident friday which 
has led nicaragua to order 20 us diplomats out of their country 
its a screwup and they have expressed their regrets that it 
took place bush said at the 18th hole of the houston country 
club after finishing a round with national security adviser brent 
scowcroft friend will farish and golf pro doug sanders 
but bush said the arms cache that us troops found inside 
ferreys house makes you wonder exactly what our young men are up 
against down there i dont know what they need rocket launchers 
for in a mans house 
id like to know what the mans doing with rocket launchers 
and grenades and uzis and automatic weapons up to his eyeballs in 
his house the president said having said that we should not 
have gone into that diplomatic premises 
in washington the state department said the cache included four 
uzi machine guns six rocketpropelled grenade launchers 12 
ak47s three hand grenades 10 fen rifles 17 bayonets one m1 
carbine one shotgun four rocketpropelled grenade sights one 
light antitank weapon 27 rocketpropelled grenade rounds and 
approximately 1300 rounds of ammunition of various caliber 
the weapons were in excess of normal requirements for 
defending the residence the state department said a department 
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity declined to 
define normal requirements for defending a residence 
the official also declined to say what types of weapons us 
envoys in places such as managua might have at their homes calling 
it a security question 
earlier saturday the vatican which on friday had called the 
united states an occupying power issued a conciliatory 
statement saying talks about noriegas fate continued between the 
holy see and us authorities in a spirit of serene 
collaboration 
the vatican predicted they will eventually yield a just 
solution which will be mutually satisfactory it said the papal 
nuncio in allowing noriega into the embassy never intended to 
block the course of justice regarding a person accused of serious 
crimes 
bush said i think its time to cool it on both sides he 
said he would personally call pope john paul ii if need be 
bush said the church has a long history of granting asylum even 
to thugs like noriega 
we have a complicated threeway conundrum at this point 
bush said i really believe this matter will be resolved one way 
or another to the satisfaction of the united states 
bush even cracked a joke about the loud rock n roll music the 
us troops encircling the vatican embassy have been playing 
apparently to harass noriega the blaring loudspeakers were turned 
off saturday 
i think it aggravated the people inside it was stopped 
bush said it would have aggravated me ill tell you im not into 
rock country music maybe thats different 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
they did not know it was a diplomatic residence we do not enter 
diplomatic residences 
fitzwater said bush had no advance knowledge of the us 
soldiers raid on ferreys home 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega in ordering 20 us 
diplomats out of his country in 72 hours and slashing the us 
embassys support staff from 320 to 100 said they acted 
arrogantly like rambos 
bush was spending the weekend in his adopted hometown after 
three days of fishing and hunting in south texas he and barbara 
bush were flying to san antonio on sunday morning to visit soldiers 
wounded in panama they were to spend new years eve in their hotel 
suite at the houstonian 
fitzwater asked about the lopsided united nations vote friday 
condemning the us invasion of panama and demanding immediate 
withdrawal of the occupation forces said we felt we did the 
right thing for the right reasons 
fitzwater said the ambassadors house was raided because us 
military authorities got a tip there was an arms cache inside 
they were looking for arms and they found arms fitzwater 
said 
we were looking for arms caches were finding them all over 
panama city arms caches are turning up everywhere he said 
the united states and nicaragua expelled each others 
ambassadors in an earlier diplomatic dustup last year the united 
states had about 35 accredited diplomatic personnel in managua

a steep staircase off palace square 
descends into a black labyrinth of dank narrow tunnels the secret 
passages of a paranoid state 
the dark underground corridors were dug clandestinely on the 
orders of nicolae ceausescu the communist dictator who apparently 
grew to fear the consequences of his increasingly repressive 
24year rule 
a week ago when the army moved against ceausescu the 
dictators dreaded special police used the tunnels to move freely 
under the withering machinegun fire in the square above 
soldiers and civilians armed with ak47 assault rifles guard the 
entrances now nervous army patrols comb the tunnels fearful they 
will find terrorists as they call ceausescus police lurking 
in unknown passages 
it is still dangerous said one soldier who carefully 
examined the passports of three western journalists at the entrance 
to a tunnel 
officials of the provisional government say the tunnels near 
palace square are only part of a vast network that extends for 
miles beneath the capital 
the passages connect major government buildings and lead to 
communications bunkers or to underground stores of food weapons 
and ammunition 
this tunnel was used by terrorists the ones for the president 
are much wider said a provisional government official who along 
with an armed escort of four men took the reporters on a brief 
tour 
the bricklined tunnel used by the police was about a yard wide 
and less than two yards high 
it stretched out beyond the range of his fading flashlight to an 
intersection with another that also vanished into darkness toward 
the royal palace 
the tunnels for the president are about 5 meters wide and they 
are lined with marble said the official who didnt want to give 
his name after giving the reporters the unauthorized tour 
oh no you cannot go there he said to reporters who 
inquired about ceausescus tunnels they are still too dangerous 
we are conducting demolitions he said in halting english 
declining to elaborate 
the secret passages are dark and ominous symbols of a paranoid 
state that hardened itself against its people there are others 
when soldiers shot away the windows on the top floor of the royal 
palace they exposed concrete walls built to withstand the heavy 
machinegun fire 
liviu axente a photojournalist from focsani showed two western 
reporters pictures of a huge underground bunker in that city 125 
miles north of the capital 
they security forces have bunkers like this in every 
district he said they intercepted every telephone call read 
everyones mail 
there are hidden microphones in my house he said he showed 
reporters pictures of the munitions including sophisticated 
automatic weapons he said were found in the bunker and given to 
the army 
he also had pictures of the electronic eavesdropping equipment 
and of a vast collection of security files placed in boxes stacked 
to the ceiling 
photographs of the inside of the files showed photocopies of 
intercepted letters and postcards and of reports on monitored 
telephone calls 
it has been just a week since the popular revolt ousted seized 
and executed ceausescu outraged romanians are still struggling to 
uncover the extent of the madness of ceausescus golden era 
ceausescu lived in an opulent villa with gold leaf and marble 
floors in the entrance way and golden fixtures in the bathrooms 
tapestries and paintings in gilted frames adorn the walls and 
crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling 
he dined extravagantly by the light of candles burning in golden 
candelabras 
his people had to wait in long lines with their ration cards to 
buy substandard food in an agriculturally rich country 
when the people protested demanding bread and reform his 
special police opened fire the tunnels underground bunkers and 
windows reinforced with concrete suggest ceausescu knew one day 
the people might say enough 
he was a monster one young soldier said near the tunnel 
entrance

opponents of plans to put a 40 million 
lowlevel radioactive waste dump near this farming community say 
they have just begun to fight while others see the project as an 
economic shotinthearm 
well fight this technically politically and legally 
opponent lowell fisher said saturday 
fisher the leader of a group called save boyd county said it 
felt like a death in the family friday when a developer us 
ecology announced it had selected a 320acre site about two miles 
west of this community of about 580 residents for construction of 
the dump 
the aboveground system of concrete vaults would store lowlevel 
radioactive waste such as contaminated gloves and equipment from 
nuclear power plants and hospitals from nebraska kansas 
oklahoma arkansas and louisiana 
many had figured the site would be ruled out for its location 
five miles from south dakota and therefore remote from the other 
four states in the central interstate lowlevel radioactive waste 
compact 
sen tom daschle dsd called the decision unsound and said 
he would fight it 
but ken reiser one of the leaders of the proponent people for 
progress said he was elated at the prospect of economic 
development and the estimated 30 to 40 jobs the facility could 
bring to the area 
this is one of the best things since electricity came into 
this county or the day my dad changed from using a horse to using a 
tractor to farm reiser said saturday 
us ecology officials said they chose the boyd county location 
over two others in southern nebraska because it was the best choice 
geologically the company already has options on the land 
opponents say the tract contains wetlands and any leaks could 
contaminate nebraskas groundwater 
since boyd county was named as a finalist site opponents have 
boycotted businesses owned by supporters sought to recall a county 
supervisor and posted nohunting signs on their land in an 
attempt to get hunters to protest consideration of the site 
at the us ecology office in butte manager bob wittry handed out 
job applications saturday even though the company wont even submit 
its license application to the state until july 
lavaun johnson said that the office on buttes main street was 
the first to open in nearly a decade butte once boasted five 
grocery stores and several car dealerships she said 
today its mostly two bars a lumber company a villageowned 
restaurant and the post office she said 
her husband owen johnson called the announcement an economic 
shotinthearm to the mostly farming community 
it might bring some of our native sons and daughters back home 
to work he said weve seen nothing but ag up here for 
years and bad times on the farm have taken their toll 
us ecology has promised that the five states and their utilities 
and other companies that generate waste will pay 300000 a year to 
butte and boyd county until the facility is built and up to 2 
million each year the facility is used that money is in addition 
to tax revenue and economic benefits produced by the facility

president jose eduardo dos santos of 
angola on saturday offered a new plan for ending his countrys 
civil war that calls for elections within five years 
but eduardo dos santos said his regime still was committed to 
socialism and oneparty rule he also rejected a ceasefire plan 
offered by president mobuto sese seko of zaire who is trying to 
mediate the conflict 
the angolan president outlined his proposal in a new years 
message portions of which were broadcast on lisbon radio 
he called for a ceasefire and for rebels and government 
soldiers to allow people and goods to move safely around the 
country 
the proposal includes recognition of the legitimacy of the 
current government it also called for incorporating the rebels of 
guerrilla leader joseph savimbi into the angolan army 
in addition the president called for the participation of all 
angolans in the affairs of the nation and for legislation on the 
right of association 
he proposed a census of the population and a revision of 
election legislation leading to national elections within five 
years 
but he added that his proposals did not imply abandoning 
angolas socialist vocation or oneparty system 
the two sides have been fighting a civil war since portugal 
granted independence to angola in 1975 
savimbi is backed by the united states and south africa and the 
government is supported by cuba under a peace accord signed 
december 1988 cuba agreed to withdrawn troops from angola and 
south africa was to relinquish control of namibia 
however the the angolan government and savimbis forces have 
been unable to reach a ceasefire accord 
mobuto mediated a ceasefire agreement between savimbi and 
eduardo dos santos on june 22 in gbadolite zaire but the truce 
collapsed soon afterward later talks ended in deadlock with 
renewed fighting 
in his speech the angolan president rejected new proposals for 
a ceasefire reportedly put forward within the past few days by 
mobuto 
eduardo dos santos said that the proposed ceasefire omitted 
provisions agreed upon during the gbadolite meeting 
he said the truce verification provisions in the mobuto proposal 
were more suited to conventional rather than guerrilla war 
earlier this week savimbi said government forces had launched a 
major offensive against rebel strongholds in the south 
the angolan president made no reference to the reported fighting 
in the south according to the reports reaching lisbon but the 
portuguese news agency lusa earlier quoted angolan government 
officials as denying a major offensive was under way

contra military leaders pledged saturday to work 
with international observers to limit violence as nicaragua 
prepares for elections in february 
one observer group said the announcement was important because 
preelection violence has been escalating in nicaragua and talks 
between contra rebels and the ruling sandinistas have broken off 
international organizations are working to agree on ground rules 
for monitoring and ensuring the fairness of the feb 25 elections 
there is not full confidence that there will be a free 
election process said israel galeano the contras military 
chief of staff our conviction is serious to maintain support for 
all observers 
he said at a news conference that he has 6000 fighters in the 
countryside and they will take a totally defensive position in 
the days leading up to the elections 
but the commander said pulling contra forces out of nicaragua or 
confining them to isolated areas for the elections would require a 
similar commitment to keep sandinista troops on bases and that 
proposal has been rejected in the past 
galeano whose nom de guerre is commander franklin made the 
comments at a session with contra director aristides sanchez and 
osorno coleman a miskito indian resistance leader known as 
commander blaz 
coleman said he believes the sandinistas have tried to inhibit 
the election process in eastern sections of the country by limiting 
registration but he said the people he represents support the 
election process 
sanchez predicted victory for the opposition because no one in 
the world would believe the people are so masochistic that they 
would elect this government 
leaders of the center for democracy one of the four groups that 
will monitor the elections arranged the rare appearance by the new 
military leaders 
center president allen weinstein said the contra military 
leaders pledge to limit violence was a breakthrough that could 
resolve an impasse between the sandinistas contras and other 
opposition groups 
this is the first statement with a monitoring group present 
in which they commit themselves fully to the democratic process 
weinstein said 
he said all of the monitoring groups the organization of 
american states the united nations the atlantabased carter 
center of former president carter and the center for democracy 
would meet in january 
we hope to develop a series of ironclad procedures accepted 
by the government all candidates and the different opposition 
groups he said 
after the observer groups meet representatives of the 
sandinistas contras and civilian opposition groups will be 
invited no specific dates have been set 
weinsteins center said the contras have agreed to help 
investigate any violent incidents to have been perpetrated by any 
of the parties in the nicaraguan conflict including their own 
fighters 
the setting of rules for the election process has become more 
urgent because of incidents such as a dec 10 confrontation in the 
nicaraguan town of masatepe between sandinista and opposition 
supporters 
election campaign observers said supporters of the leftist 
government violently disrupted a rally held by backers of 
opposition presidential candidate violeta chamorro 
sandinista supporters reportedly charged the rally armed with 
machetes and clubs the candidates motorcade fled town one man 
died of machete wounds and another halfdozen were hospitalized 
the bush administration cited the incident as evidence the 
sandinistas who lifted a unilaterally declared ceasefire nov 1 
will find an excuse to avoid holding fair elections 
but weinstein of the center for democracy said the new contra 
statement could help bring both sides together for a fair ballot 
theres 60 days theres plenty of time he said

part of david richmonds 1990 vacation 
will be spent drinking orange juice at a lunch counter in downtown 
greensboro it should be a lot easier than it was 30 years ago 
on feb 1 1960 richmond was one of four black freshmen at 
north carolina aampt state university who walked into the downtown 
woolworth sat down at the whitesonly lunch counter and demanded 
service 
the lunch counter manager said no and the store manager said 
no but the students refused to leave 
thus began a movement 
in the weeks ahead sitins would spread to lunch counters in 54 
cities across nine southern states they eventually shattered one 
of the more visible racial barriers of everyday life and achieved 
one of the earliest victories of the budding civil rights movement 
what happened in 1960 served to launch people of the city and 
nation on a relentless pursuit of human dignity said claudette 
burroughswhite cochairperson of the greensboro sitin 30th 
anniversary committee 
the committee is leading several biracial groups in celebrating 
the actions of richmond and fellow students ezell blair franklin 
mccain and joseph mcneil 
the commemorative events from jan 31 to feb 3 include 
banquets symposiums a student march from the aampt campus and the 
unveiling of a plaque outside the store the four former students 
also will have their bronzed footsteps set in the sidewalk 
richmond and his three sitin colleagues once again will take 
seats at the lunch counter as they have done at previous 
anniversary celebrations 
we didnt do it for the glory or heroics richmond said 
it was just something that was spontaneous something we talked 
about collectively i dont think any one of us singularly would 
have done it the four of us were like a unit we have remained 
close through the years 
today he quietly goes about his duties as housekeeping 
supervisor at a greensboro health care center 
the others have left the area mccain is an executive with the 
celanese corp in charlotte blair who has changed his name to 
jibreel khazan lives in new bedford mass mcneil is a stockbroker 
in new york 
the reenactments give richmond a chance to chat with ima evans 
the lunch counter manager who was working at the bakery counter the 
day the students came in 
we are very good friends richmond said we have appeared 
on a couple of programs together 
ms evans who is white said the sitin put woolworth employees 
in an awkward situation the black employees were sympathetic to 
the students as were some of the white workers but they werent 
allowed to serve blacks 
i felt they deserved to be served as much as anyone ms 
evans said but it was policy all over 
the greensboro sitins eventually involved hundreds of students 
each day they showed up at woolworth and at the kress 
fiveanddime store down the street causing an uproar at city hall 
and in the business community 
after months of sitins meetings and negotiations woolworth 
and later kress agreed to integrate their lunch counters

nicaraguas ambassador said saturday 
that he tried for an hour to convince us troops his home was a 
diplomatic residence before 60 troops entered walking under a 
large nicaraguan emblem 
a us embassy official said the soldiers didnt know the 
residence was diplomatic quarters and the united states later 
apologized for the entry 
nicaraguas sandinista government retaliated against the us 
action by expelling 20 american diplomats and ordering the us 
embassy in managua to reduce its support staff from 320 to 100 the 
state department called that an irresponsible overreaction 
us troops have been posted around the embassies of cuba 
nicaragua and libya since soon after the invasion to capture gen 
manuel antonio noriega began dec 20 
on saturday noriega remained at the vatican mission which was 
surrounded by american troops 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
troops entered the house to search for weapons 
the troops had no orders to do that if they knew it was the 
ambassadors residence a senior us embassy official said 
nicaraguan ambassador antenor ferrey said he argued with the 
troops for more than an hour and asked them to call american 
diplomatic and military officials before they entered the house 
about 6 pm friday 
the estimated 60 troops who searched the house in the fourhour 
operation had to walk under the seal 
the embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
soldiers apparently did not see the emblem however a military 
spokesman said that while they may have seen it it was not a 
sufficient indication of diplomatic immunity 
ferrey moved to the house more than a year ago 
president bush said the united states had apologized for the 
incident 
its a screwup and they us military officials in panama 
have expressed their regrets that it happened bush said after a 
golf game at the houston country club 
but he questioned why there were large amounts of weapons in the 
residence 
six rocketpropelled grenade lauchers were among the weapons 
found the state department said in washington the cache also 
included four uzi machine guns 12 ak47s three hand grenades 10 
fen rifles 17 bayonets one m1 carbine one shotgun four 
rocketpropelled grenade sights one light antitank weapon 27 
rocketpropelled grenade rounds and approximately 1300 rounds of 
ammunition of various caliber 
a communique from the southern command said the soldiers entered 
with good cause after receiving a tip from a panamanian citizen 
that there were weapons in what is now claimed to be the alleged 
home of the nicaraguan ambassador to panama 
according to the military account 
ferrey drove up after troops had ordered people in the house to 
evacuate and fired warning shots into the air he provided an 
identity card but indicated he had left his red diplomatic 
identity card at the embassy it said 
troops at the residence checked with their superiors and were 
told the ambassadors residence was in an apartment building at 
another location 
based on the information that the house was not covered by 
diplomatic immunity the commander on the scene informed mr ferrey 
he had received authorization to search the house and intended to 
do so 
the residents and weapons were released afterwards 
the embassy official said he understood the search stopped as 
soon as people at the house produced diplomatic credentials and 
if that isnt the case we have a double apology to make 
he said the action was not a mistake until the house was 
identified as one with diplomatic immunity 
he rejected the possibility that the raid was intended to be a 
signal to noriega hiding out in the embassy of the vatican since 
christmas eve that diplomatic immunity there might not protect him 
indefinitely 
nicaragua claimed the us soldiers stole more than 2000 and 
took some clothes from the residence 
in nicaragua the government gave the american diplomats 72 
hours to leave leaving 15 in the country the minimum set by 
international agreement most of the support staff is nicaraguan

a romanian washing his car was taken hostage by 
dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife as the couple tried to flee 
the revolt that toppled them a newspaper said saturday 
the man who said he was forced to drive the couple around while 
elena ceausescu held what he believed to be a gun to his head 
eventually was instrumental in their capture the newspaper 
liberation reported 
the ceausescus were executed on christmas day 
the leftist daily in a report from bucharest said nicolae 
petrisor an employee at a merchandise distribution center in the 
city of tirgoviste north of the capital described the experience 
in an interview 
petrisor was described as a man of about 40 years old living in 
the village of vacaresci about four miles from tirgoviste 
the ceausescus had fled their palace by helicopter early on dec 
22 in the face of a massive uprising by protesters and rebellious 
army units they were reported captured a day later in the city of 
tirgoviste 
petrisor said the ceausescus took him hostage as he was washing 
a car on dec 22 then forced him to drive them around tirgoviste 
for several hours seeking a safe hiding place liberation reported 
the dictator in the front seat of the black dacia 1301 tx was 
often in tears such as when they were nearly captured by guards at 
a factory petrisor was quoted as saying 
he kept saying in my youth there was nothing here i did 
everything for them i did everything for them i saw tears running 
down petrisor said according to liberation 
elena ceausescu seated behind the driver was much calmer at 
times holding to his neck a cold metal object that he assumed was a 
pistol the newspaper said 
eventually petrisor stopped at a plant nursery where he knew 
people and was told by ceausescu to seek help the newspaper said 
he went in and told about a dozen people watching the revolution 
unfold on television that he had the ceausescus outside in his car 
according to the account 
everybody laughed because the television had already 
announced the arrests of the couple liberation said 
but eventually his look of panic persuaded them they invited 
the ceausescus into an office then locked them in and called the 
army the newspaper reported a convoy came quickly and took the 
couple away probably to the nearby barracks it said 
the ceausescus trial and execution was announced three days 
later on christmas day 
in vienna meanwhile austrian interior minister franz loeschnak 
said marin ceausescu the late dictators eldest brother who was 
found hanging in the romanian trade mission in vienna on thursday 
was likely a spy 
loeschnak said in an austrian radio interview there were 
indications marin ceausescu was active in the intelligence service 
of his country 
marin ceausescu 74 has been working as his countrys trade 
delegate to austria since 1973

a northwest airlines dc10 landed without 
incident saturday despite a bomb threat that prompted more than 
threequarters of the passengers to cancel their reservations on 
the flight from paris 
this is probably a safer flight than any other to be on 
said jennifer ruskin a 20yearold junior at the university of 
michigan in ann arbor the interviews now with all the media are 
probably the scariest part of the flight 
only 22 passengers and nine crew members were on board flight 
51 said northwest spokesman kevin whalen who was on the flight 
airline officials in paris said earlier that the plane carried 28 
passengers and 14 crew members 
we landed on the runway then we taxied out at least a quarter 
of a mile then we were bused to the terminal whalen said 
no one on board was forced to work this flight whalen said 
of the crew i slept most passengers enjoyed a lot of personal 
attention it was almost like having a private airplane 
the plane left charles de gaulle airport in paris earlier 
saturday and landed at detroit metropolitan airpiort in romulus 
shortly before 5 pm est an airport spokesman said the jet can 
hold 284 passengers 
a telephone caller said the flight would be targeted to avenge 
the life sentences given two palestinians convicted in a series of 
european bombings including an attack on a northwest airlines 
office 
the planes departure was delayed two hours by fog and intensive 
security checks 
i wasnt worried a bit especially after all the security we 
went through to get on the flight said mike matour 22 of 
philadelphia they checked our bags two and three times and then 
they checked us 
norman luck a reporter sent on the flight by the london daily 
express said he was a little concerned after the plane took off 
he said whalen told the passengers that once we were on board 
and those doors shut that the plane was safe but i dont really 
know about that because throughout the flight i watched the 
attendants keep checking the sky cabs the cupboards and underneath 
the seats 
some of the 105 passengers who canceled said in paris that 
northwest should have informed them earlier of the threat 
theyve had my telephone number since yesterday morning 
locally and nobody had called me with any information of any 
kind said ken reichenbach of portsmouth va what ive 
learned ive learned from thirdhand information 
the airline said friday it would rely on the media to spread 
early word of the bomb threat some passengers learned of it only 
upon arriving at the airport saturday 
i would have been on pins and needles the whole way said 
camille major 21 of madison wis who was headed home after 
three weeks in europe six hundred dollars isnt worth my life 
my vacation was bad and this just tops it off 
northwest said passengers could change to other flights or 
airlines with no penalty and most accepted the offer 
security officers inspected every piece of hand luggage before 
the passengers boarded causing a brief initial delay from the 
scheduled 1240 pm departure 
armed officers of the air and border police and riot police with 
dogs shepherded passengers through scrupulous checkin procedures 
each piece of luggage was xrayed on freezeframe video machines 
even a small souvenir bust of napoleon was put on the belt and 
xrayed separately 
all carryon luggage was searched by hand the hsia family of 
foster city calif near san francisco waited 45 minutes before 
they were cleared for passage to the departure lounge 
on thursday night abc news quoting sources it did not 
identify reported that a man with a middle eastern accent called 
northwests detroit office and said flight 51 would be bombed in 
retaliation for the convictions and life sentences given two 
palestinians convicted in sweden this month in a series of bombings 
one of the two mohammed abu talb is a suspect in the december 
1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
he and codefendant marten imandi were sentenced to life in 
prison for their parts in the 1985 bombing of a northwest office in 
copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 20 they also were 
convicted in three other bombings in denmark and the netherlands 
it was not clear when the threat was received 
pierre quilici deputy chief of frances air and border police 
said us authorities passed on word of the threat several days ago 
northwest spokesman douglas miller in st paul minn said 
northwest informed the faa fbi cia and foreign agencies of the 
threat and was advised by the fbi not to disclose any other details 
about the threat including where or when it was made 
the airline announced the threat thursday after reports of it 
emerged in europe 
the federal aviation administration and airlines have come under 
pressure to disclose security risks after the lockerbie bombing 
which killed 270 people a threat against pan am before that flight 
was circulated within the us government but was not made public 
faa spokesman john leyden said friday us airlines receive 
about 300 threats each year

martin marietta was forced saturday 
to postpone for the ninth time the first commercial launch of its 
titan 3 rocket once again because of highaltitude crosswinds 
streaking up to 102 mph 
the rocket is to boost communications satellites into orbit for 
the japanese communications satellite co and the british ministry 
of defence 
liftoff originally was scheduled dec 7 but a technical problem 
delayed one launch effort and the rest were scrubbed because of 
high winds 
the winds had been acceptable earlier saturday but the speed 
increased throughout the day as a series of weather balloons shot 
into the sky 
when the countdown reached the fiveminute mark the launch team 
held it for 50 minutes while officials assessed lastminute balloon 
data it showed 102 mph winds at 34790 feet about 30 mph too high 
for a safe titan passage 
a 10th attempt was scheduled for 707 pm sunday night

two frantic weeks of investigating a series of 
mail bombs that killed a judge and a civil rights leader have 
produced shadowy outlines of a racist plot against the judicial 
system but uncertainty about who is responsible and when another 
attack could come 
a person or group calling itself americans for a competent 
federal judicial system claimed responsibility for killing us 
circuit judge robert vance on dec 16 and savannah ga lawyer and 
civil rights leader robert robinson two days later 
a letter to an atlanta television station last week threatened 
steppedup violence and claimed the justice system was lenient 
toward blacks who attack whites 
protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority 
than granting the blacks demand for white teachers for their 
children the letter said 
fbi agents wouldnt say what leads they have gotten from bomb 
fragments and a hot line set up for tips they also would not 
discuss a published report that the letter to the tv station 
contained an identifying code identical to one in followup letters 
sent to the bomb targets but agents confirmed the letters 
contained information known only to investigators and whomever was 
involved in the bombings 
authorities said they had never heard of americans for a 
competent federal judicial system but the threats have been taken 
seriously around the southeast 
an anchorwoman who received the letter sent to atlanta station 
waga received police protection an naacp official involved in a 
21yearold school desegregation case mentioned in that letter said 
the fbi warned him he might be a target 
the desegregation case involves the dekalb county schools and a 
telephone caller to the bomb hotline threatened dekalb police 
earlier in the week 
we did have a call from the fbi telling us they had some 
information and we should alert our officers to use extreme caution 
and to be extremely alert said margaret jones spokeswoman for 
the 650officer department she would not elaborate on what the 
caller threatened 
the 600 southeastern branches of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people are all taking precautions said 
regional director earl shinhoster he would not elaborate but 
mentioned that police escorted him on and off a plane when he went 
to savannah 
security also is being bolstered for the jan 15 celebration of 
the birthday of the rev martin luther king jr who was 
assassinated in 1968 
specialists in terrorism and criminal psychologists say whoever 
sent the bombs if not caught is likely to strike again after 
police and media attention lessens 
what holds an organization like this together if it is an 
organization is they are actionoriented people without action 
the organization disintegrates said brian jenkins a consultant 
on terrorism and managing director at kroll associates a los 
angelesbased international investigative firm 
you could see an attack next month or six months from now 
he said in a telephone interview 
william l waugh an associate professor of public 
administration at georgia state university who specializes in 
international terrorism said some terrorist groups seek mainly to 
spread fear and this one may use continued threats as its means of 
operation 
standard terrorism creates a credible threat and after a 
while only the threat makes people nervous he said after a 
while they can wait longer and longer between violent acts 
dr dave davis a forensic psychiatrist who works for the secret 
service said the letter to waga reflected a mind filled with 
anger low selfesteem and a willingness to kill for attention 
hes really a sicko if i had to take a guess right off id 
say he was a paranoid person davis told the atlanta 
journalconstitution 
the experts said a small group probably was involved if the 
bombings were the work of more than one person 
most times you become a terrorist because you have a cause 
and nobody will listen to you said bill bailey president of 
threat management associates a houston security service theyre 
politically way out of the mainstream if they do catch them they 
probably will fit around the dining room table 
in addition to the fatal bombs a bomb was intercepted in 
jacksonville fla where vance was involved in a desegregation 
case and another in atlanta all carried georgia postmarks the 
letter to waga had an atlanta postmark as did followup letters to 
victims 
the likelihood with the way its been organized is that 
theyre a splinter from another group waugh said these are 
ideas that dont just come out of the blue 
pat clark director of the klanwatch operations at the southern 
poverty law center in montgomery ala said friday that the 
organization has identified more than 230 hate groups in the united 
states but none calls itself americans for a competent federal 
judicial system 
jenkins said the theme and language of the letter reflected 
racism and xenophobia common to the ku klux klan and its spinoffs 
klan groups have vehemently denied involvement 
jenkins said the only way to stop the threats was to catch those 
involved 
one thing weve learned from dealing with terrorists is we can 
displace the risk spread it around jenkins said but somebody 
has to go out there and apprehend the people and put them out of 
business

panamas roman catholic bishops on 
saturday urged the vatican to hand gen manuel antonio noriega over 
for trial in the united states or panama calling him the author 
of abominable crimes 
noriega under us indictment for drug trafficking took refuge 
in the vatican embassy on christmas eve four days after the united 
states attacked panamanian military bases and installed a civilian 
government 
it is quite justifiably feared that should he be set free in 
any part of the world mr noriega would in a short time be causing 
turmoil conflict and violence in this already longsuffering 
nation the bishops said in a letter to pope john paul ii 
meanwhile us officials said troops searching for weapons 
caches made a mistake friday when they searched the nicaraguan 
ambassadors residence 
a senior us embassy official said the soldiers left as soon as 
they realized they were on diplomatic premises 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government retaliated by ordering 
the expulsions of 20 american diplomats and telling the us 
embassy in managua to cut its support staff the state department 
called the response an overreaction designed to reduce the us 
presence before elections set for feb 25 
president bush told reporters in houston that the search was a 
screwup it shouldnt have happened and thats been explained 
to the nicaraguans 
in its letter to john paul the panamanian bishops conference 
described noriega as the author of abominable crimes 
the mere possibility that the former general not be taken 
before justice provokes justified fear in members of the church 
the bishops said in the communique translated into english by 
church officials 
they indicated it did not matter whether he was tried in the 
united states or panama as long as there were guarantees for his 
personal and physical safety the death penalty was excluded and he 
received a fair trial 
the letter defended the practice of political asylum but added 
this is a very special case 
a church source said papal nuncio sebastian laboa the vaticans 
ambassador in panama approved the letter 
the official soviet news agency tass on sunday paraphrased a 
communique by the bishops of panama as saying the national 
leadership of the catholic church and the papal nunciature agreed 
to hand over gen noriega shortly 
tass did not say when the communique was released or if it was 
referring to the same one sent to the pope the report which could 
not be confirmed by any other source did not specifically say 
whether noriega should be turned over to the united states or to 
panama 
in rome vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said noriega could 
not be handed over to us authorities but that the vatican was 
urging him to leave the mission on his own 
if noriega does so he can assume us troops surrounding the 
mission would arrest him immediately the troops posted as close 
as 10 feet from the embassy gate have been searching departing 
vehicles for nondiplomatic personnel 
in response to vatican protests us troops saturday turned off 
the loud rap and rock music that they were blasting near the 
mission in an apparent attempt to harass noriega 
i am sympathetic to the papal nuncios plea that the music was 
keeping him awake while noriega slept the senior us embassy 
official said 
the us search of nicaraguan ambassador antenor ferreys 
residence heightened tension with the sandinista government which 
has long predicted a us invasion in nicaragua 
the us embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
contended the troops did not know the house was a diplomatic 
residence ferrey said he argued with us troops for 75 minutes 
before they went in asking them to call american diplomatic and 
military officials 
a communique from the southern command said the troops had 
good cause to make the search based on a tip and that they 
thought the nicaraguan envoys residence was somewhere else ferrey 
said the residence was moved to its current location about a year 
ago 
the us official said american troops courteously withdrew 
when it was determined the situation was a diplomatic one 
troops found caches of assault rifles antitank weapons 
grenades pistols and ammunition in the house the military said 
the weapons were not taken 
the united states has surrounded the embassies of cuba 
nicaragua and libya to prevent noriega associates from seeking 
asylum but it had not ringed the nicaraguan envoys residence 
the us embassy official corrected an earlier statement that 
noriega adviser mike harari had been arrested he said agents 
arrested someone they thought was harari but determined it was not 
him it was not immediately clear if the man was released 
israel television meanwhile reported that harari was in 
israel it cited family sources 
panama citys international airport closed to all but relief 
flights since the invasion will open to commercial traffic on 
sunday with flights by the panamanian airline copa a copa 
spokesman said 
also saturday us soldiers searched the offices of the spanish 
news agency efe and several homes in the neighborhood 
andreu claret the agencys panama director later said some of 
the soldiers told him they were looking for a suspected looter who 
according to neighbors had been hiding in a neighboring house

a us official on saturday called the 
expulsion of 20 us diplomats from nicaragua drastic and 
unjustified retaliation for a search by us troops of the 
nicaraguan ambassadors home in panama 
on friday night president daniel ortega gave the diplomats 72 
hours to leave he also ordered the mission to reduce its 
administrative staff from 320 to 100 most of those employees are 
nicaraguan nationals 
we were at grave risk of a politicalmilitary clash with the 
united states which has maintained an aggressive attitude against 
latin american countries ortega said 
the action came after us troops invaded the nicaraguan 
ambassadors house in panama city despite his protests a senior 
us official in panama city called the search a mistake and said 
troops did not know they were in a diplomatic residence 
the nicaraguan foreign ministry said 15 us diplomats would be 
allowed to remain in the country the minimum prescribed by the 
vienna convention 
the measure of the sandinista government is drastic and 
unjustified said louis falino a spokesman for the us embassy 
in managua who spoke to the associated press by telephone falino 
was on the list of those expelled 
president bush said in houston on saturday that an apology had 
been made 
its a screwup and they us military officials in panama 
have expressed their regrets that it happened bush said he 
added that it shouldnt have happened and thats been explained 
to the nicaraguans 
us officials said soldiers were acting on a tip that a large 
cache of weapons was stored at the home soldiers returned the 
weapons after realizing it was the nicaraguan diplomats residence 
the state department said 
the search of ambassador antenor ferreys residence in panama 
city was outrageousinsolent and violated principles of 
international law ortega said 
they acted arrogantly like rambos ortega said 
he claimed the us soldiers stole more than 2000 and took 
some clothes from the residence us reaction to the charge was 
not immediately available 
tension between the two countries increased after the dec 20 
us invasion of panama and the overthrow of gen manuel antonio 
noriega if it does not ease it could give ortega an excuse to 
cancel presidential elections set for feb 25 
we have never discarded the possibility of a us invasion 
of nicaragua said manuel rodriguez political adviser at the 
nicaraguan embassy in panama he spoke before the search looking 
down on us troops manning barricades of wire and sandbags at the 
embassy and checking identification on a side street 
its just that the results would not be the same as in panama 
it would cost them a lot more 
nicaraguas sovietequipped military is the largest force in 
central america 
the united states has not had an ambassador in managua since 
july 1988 when the leftist sandinista government expelled 
ambassador richard melton and seven other american diplomats to 
protest alleged american interference in an opposition rally in 
nicaragua 
the united states responded by expelling nicaraguan ambassador 
carlos tunnerman 
us soldiers circled the nicaraguan embassy in panama last week 
in case noriega sought refuge there nicaraguas foreign ministry 
then ordered the us embassy in managua surrounded

known as the nicest guy on the bloc in 1989 
get it bloc block 
the procrastinators club got it and made several other somewhat 
tongueincheek predictions for 1989 saturday 
as usual the procrastinators were very late with their 
prognostications and right on the mark 
were perfect club president les waas said saturday 
weve never made a mistake yet i dont know why that is i guess 
because we spend a whole year putting them together 
the rich the famous the infamous the political and the sports 
inclined will have a rough and rocky 1989 the club said

country in search of a pineapple 
the procrastinators club established in 1956 by employees at a 
philadelphia advertising agency has been making its 
johnnycomelately predictions for at least 20 years waas said 
but still the members have trouble convincing folks the club has 
highpowered crystal balls 
we go out on a limb some of these predictions are 
unconscionable nobody ever believes us some of these are pretty 
farfetched waas said 
waas said he has been president or rather acting president 
of the club since it began 
the nominating committee hasnt reported back yet he said 
wouldnt it be somehing if i wasnt made president 
the club which claims 6500 members worldwide and another half 
million who havent gotten around to joining yet is currently in

explained

donald trump will somehow get his name in the paper 
jim bakker will be rewarded by not having to live with tammy 
faye for the next 40 years 
jerry ford will turn out to be right on his statement that

israel paid thousands of dollars in cash to 
nicolae ceausescu for every romanian jew he allowed to emigrate an 
israeli newspaper reported 
for years ceausescu received between 5000 and 7000 for 
every visa issued to jews and some 5060 million ended up in the 
dictators own pocket yediot aharonot said in its weekend edition 
ceausescu was executed on christmas day 
quoting reliable sources the paper said official agencies 
responsible for immigration in israel including the foreign 
ministry and the quasigovernmental jewish agency acknowledged 
ceausescu was paid but would not give specific figures 
israeli officials reportedly knew of the payoffs for years but 
they dared not expose or publicize it for fear it would halt 
immigration from romania yediot said 
our interest was the protection of the jews in romania and not 
what kind of dictator ceausescu was the paper quoted an 
unidentified official involved in the deals as saying 
according to the paper the money given ceausescu was raised by 
various jewish organizations it said reliable sources in the us 
jewish community had confirmed that ceausescu received the money 
for the past 20 years 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post said the money was handed 
over in suitcases filled with us dollars 
the head of the immigration committee in the knesset or 
parliament michael kliner told yediot that helping bring romanian 
jews to israel meant saving lives and therefore all necessary 
steps were kosher 
a spokesman for the foreign ministry motti amichai said the 
ministry knew of no such deals with romania 
repeated telephone calls to the spokesman for the jewish agency 
went unanswered 
on wednesday israel announced its support of the new bucharest 
regime but refrained from personally criticizing ceausescu who had 
been highly regarded here for maintaining a longstanding alliance 
with the jewish state 
ceasescu was the only east bloc leader to maintain ties with 
israel after the 1967 middle east war when others broke links and 
sided with the arabs 
about 400000 romanians have immigrated to israel since its 
founding in 1948 and some 1500 have immigrated each year for the 
past 10 years

attorney general dick thornburghs decision to 
close an internal investigation into a news leak about an fbi probe 
of rep william h gray iiis office got a sharp rebuke from gray 
and from sen joseph r biden jr who says the leak investigation 
should continue 
thornburgh wrote biden the senate judiciary committee chairman 
that investigators had been unable to identify with certainty the 
original source of disclosures to cbs reporter rita braver about 
grays office financial affairs and therefore will not prosecute or 
fire anyone 
the leak occurred at the end of may while gray dpa was 
seeking election in the house as majority whip and it prompted 
accusations from democratic lawmakers that thornburghs aides were 
the source of a political leak 
thornburgh said in fridays letter to biden ddel that 
investigators also told him the nature of the confirmations 
alleged to have been forthcoming to ms braver were uncertain

for the same tv programs 
the fcc said friday it had disturbing evidence that cable 
operators were receiving preferential treatment from satellite 
carriers for the programs cable operators provide by coaxial cable 
to their subscribers 
because this evidence raises serious concerns about the 
competitive nature of this market and the impact on consumers 
the commission said it would conduct an inquiry into the matter to 
determine if remedies were needed to protect the nations 25 
million dish owners 
this is a great victory said larry helland attorney for 
the valhalla nybased american home satellite association 
helland said the new fcc inquiry finally would force satellite 
companies to justify their rates to backyard dish owners
