the jury in leona helmsleys tax evasion trial 
ended a third day of deliberations without a verdict monday after 
rehearing testimony from liquor salesmen who said they gave 
kickbacks to the hotel magnate 
the jurors in manhattans federal court deliberated 8 hours in 
the third day of discussions they had deliberated about 15 hours 
over the weekend 
mrs helmsley 69 is charged with evading 12 million in 
federal taxes by charging personal expenses including renovations 
at her connecticut mansion to her businesses 
her codefendants former aides turco and joseph licari are 
charged with assisting in the scheme 
mrs helmsley is charged with 41 of the 47 counts in the 
indictment including conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue 
service tax evasion signing false personal returns aiding in the 
filing of false corporate returns mail fraud and extortion 
conspiracy 
the panel on monday asked to rehear testimony from two liquor 
salesmen who testified that they were forced to kick back a 
percentage of their sales to keep accounts at helmsley hotels 
the testimony relates to the most serious charge against mrs 
helmsley conspiracy to commit extortion which carries a 20year 
prison sentence upon conviction 
the jurors also asked to hear the portion of her attorneys 
closing argument which described the payments as rebates and the 
prosecutors rebuttal on that issue 
judge john walker jr however told them they could not hear the 
closing arguments because they are not considered evidence 
the jury has been sequestered since closing arguments began 
wednesday they heard from 44 prosecution witnesses and four defense 
witnesses during the twomonth trial

a sixth man was arrested and charged monday in 
connection with the shooting death of a 16yearold black youth who 
police said was attacked by a batwielding gang of whites in 
brooklyn 
joseph serrano 20 surrendered to detectives and was charged 
with firstdegree assault firstdegree riot aggravated harassment 
menacing and civil rights violations said officer edward feeney a 
police spokesman 
in the neighborhood of bensonhurst meanwhile where yusef 
hawkins was shot to death wednesday night there were signs that 
tempers were cooling off following two days of racial confrontations 
about a dozen blacks led about 150 white residents on a short 
walk through the streets where the killing occurred dozens of 
people angry over a third day of demonstrations in their 
neighborhood stood facing the demonstrators but were quieter and 
less confrontational than residents of the predominantly white 
community had been saturday and sunday 
before the start of the march seven catholic priests gathered on 
a street corner and led about 75 bensonhurst residents in prayer 
the rev arthur minichello a local pastor said they were 
praying for the family of the victim 
this is the community of bensonhurst not the idiots that are 
down the block said 26yearold james tancredi 
police are also investigating whether a seventh man who could be 
a suspect in the shooting on wednesday may have fled to italy the 
new york times reported in its tuesday editions 
detectives however still believe that 18yearold joseph fama 
whose parents were born in italy and who holds dual american and 
italian citizenship remains in the united states the newspaper 
said 
fama was identified by a witness as the triggerman in the attack 
in a related development monday a 22yearold construction 
worker was freed on bail after pleading innocent to charges he tried 
to intimidate the woman who authorities believe may have 
precipitated the attack by befriending the black youths 
cosmo camia of brooklyn was arrested saturday after he twice 
drove by the home of gina feliciano and allegedly yelled threats 
camia charged with two felony counts of intimidating a witness and 
two counts of harassment both violations faces up to four years in

surfing long associated with 
gidget the beach boys and emptyheaded frivolity is being used by 
some young christians to spread the gospel 
we like to call it surfing for jesus said james gould a 
youth counselor at a christian ministry in fort lauderdale im 
sure the lord approves 
the calvary chapel surfing association now with about 70 
members throughout south florida intends to incorporate christian 
teachings into the youth culture of surfing gould said 
theres still a drug problem with some of our kids said 
gould but mostly we have just good christian kids who happen to 
surf surfing has always had a bad rap 
for the past year the group has met once a month on a beach for 
bible readings and prayer a sign says they are ambassadors of 
christ 
the final prayer said gould is for a good set of waves and 
protection from sharks 
i dont think its gods will that anyone be attacked by a 
shark but if it is then it is said gould 33 who has been 
surfing seriously for about three years god created the beach 
the waves and the sky theres a special spiritual feeling being out 
there waiting for a wave 
in goulds small office at the chapel a mile from the beach 
crosses and religious symbols hang next to photographs and surfing 
trinkets such as a figurine of garfield the cartoon cat riding a 
wave 
one of goulds boards has the decal jesus team usa 
you just have to say we are christs ambassadors to the 
surfing scene said gould 
rob craft 17 said the surfing is what got me into all this 
i never thought of mixing church and surfing but you can really do 
it 
but there are some who do not make the connection 
willie smith said an airbrush painter balked at writing jesus 
rules on smiths board andre letast said others just turn a deaf 
ear 
sometime they say get away from me i dont want to hear that 
jesus stuff he said but i think deeply of him hes always 
with me and i want other people to know he can be with them too 
the idea of surfing for jesus began in the mid1980s in a calvary 
chapel church in costa mesa calif which has taped telephone 
messages to tell members about the next surfing contests 
up the coast in ventura calif professional surfer chris burke 
is organizing christian surf retreats for youths in mazatlan 
mexico the first camp this year had 50 participants and the next 
four are sold out said burke next september surfers for missions 
international is planning a retreat in tahiti 
when i was growing up surfing there was nothing like this you 
know it was the laidback laissezfaire attitude said burke 
24 a member of the us amateur team from 1984 to 1986 it just 
sort of hit me that i could use surfing as a way to evangelize 
gould said he believes if jesus were a late20th century figure 
he would be a surfer or a rock musician and take part in other 
youthoriented activities to help teens with problems of drugs and 
alienation 
jesus would probably not even use a board said gould hed 
probably get out there and ride the waves in his bare feet

it rests in pieces in a grimy corner of a 
museum warehouse in suburban silver hill md long forgotten by the 
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable 
bomber in the skies 
reassembled it would look like a huge vampire bat or a 
stubtailed manta ray underlying its design was the notion that the 
enemy wouldnt see it at all because this jetpowered flying wings 
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves 
rather than reflect them 
no the northrop b2 bomber the worlds most expensive airplane 
hasnt already become a dustgathering relic although some 
critics convinced the albatross is the only seacreature to which 
it should be compared wish that were so 
the astonishing lookalike in silver hill is indeed a stealth 
warplane but it was secretly built and testflown 45 years ago by 
nazi germany 
for all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word stealth 
since it was introduced to the us military vocabulary in 1980 the 
b2 and such radarevading relatives as the f117a fighter represent 
concepts which by aviation standards are almost ancient 
the b2 has been financed until this year out of the pentagons 
mysterious black budget for eight years the taxpayers spent 
224 billion without knowing it and without knowing what they were 
getting for it 
what they got when it was finally nosed heavenward in july was 
a strange plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably 
wont fly much higher much farther or any faster than the strategic 
air commands old reliable the b52 
the b2 is 17 feet tall 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172 
feet it is powered by four general electric f118 engines 
virtually the same engines as used on the f14 fighter but without 
afterburners its range is 6900 miles without refueling and 11500 
miles with one midair refueling it will have a maximum takeoff 
weight of 350000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50000 pounds of 
bombs or missiles nuclear or conventional 10000 pounds less than 
the b52 private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to 
55000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 08 to 085 or about 530560 
mph 
theres nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers 
what is dazzling presumably is the stuff the air force wont talk 
about the stealth technology computerized flight controls 
quiet onboard radar and other electronic systems possibly 
employing fiber optics designed to withstand the electromagnetic 
interference generated by nuclear blasts 
the air force wants to spend an additional 50 billion or so to 
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company northrop which for 
years hadnt made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter the 
f5 
former pentagon procurement chief robert b costello who left as 
undersecretary of defense in may wanted to scuttle the program in 
an interview with the washington post he said he told thendefense 
secretary frank carlucci last year that its being brought to you 
by the same company that brought you a series of troubled 
programs including guidance systems for the mx and airlaunched 
cruise missiles what makes you think theyll do better with the 
b2 
eight days after the b2s maiden flight july 17 pentagon and 
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by 
the justice departments fraud unit concerning northrops billing 
practices on the project the company said it was unaware of the 
probe 
northrop chairman thomas v jones says without reservation that 
the b2 is an extraordinary success defense secretary richard 
b cheney calls it absolutely vital to strategic deterrence 
president bush says doing without it would be devastating to 
armscontrol negotiations with the soviets 
the security and secrecy surrounding the project have been 
phenomenal perhaps rivaled only by elements of the star wars 
program and the manhattan project that developed the atomic bomb in 
world war ii northrop removed it from the rest of its own 
organization forming a new division called advanced products and 
housing it at a closed auto plant in pico rivera calif it 
surrounded the plant as well as the sister assembly complex at 
palmdale calif with fences topped by razor wire 
according to costello security has accounted for 5 percent of 
the costs to date with more than 224 billion spent so far that 
amounts to more than 1 billion 
the tight security imposed additional costs efficiency suffered 
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didnt know 
what their subordinates were doing i couldnt even ask one 
former northrop official told the los angeles times last year for 
all i knew they were going to the movies every day 
some could have when employees were hired they could not go 
directly to work until their security clearances were finished many 
were assigned for weeks to makework jobs in an area of the plant 
they nicknamed the drunk tank 
unbeknownst to the public the biggest snag occurred halfway 
through the sevenyear design period when the air force changed its 
mind about the b2s mission the pentagon originally ordered a 
highaltitude bomber now it wanted one that could penetrate at low 
levels as well probably because it was fearful the soviet union was 
developing the same new radar technology called othb for over the 
horizon backscatter the still supersecret radar system the 
pentagon has privately acknowledged offers new possibilities for 
detecting stealth airplanes though it is said to be ineffective 
within 500 miles 
northrops designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower 
altitudes where turbulence is greater that took a year and another 
1 billion an additional sixmonth delay was necessary for other 
design changes related especially to the engine inlets in 1987 
two years before congress began public debate over funding for the 
b2 the pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years 
in the face of grammrudman budget restrictions cheney has 
postponed production yet another year the pentagon now hopes to 
build all 132 planes by 1999 versus the original target of 1995

in 1986 thensecretary of defense caspar weinberger offered no 
hint of the design delays and escalating costs when he testified 
before congress that the program is on schedule the technology is 
wellunderstood and working and we expect the system to be 
operational in the early 1990s 
weinberger was also far off the mark when he offered congress the 
first public figures about the planes cost the b2 he said would 
cost 277 million for each plane and the entire program would tally 
about 366 billion just two years later the pentagon went back to 
congress weeks before the b2s first test flight with figures 
roughly doubling weinbergers 530 million per plane total program 
cost of more than 70 billion 
with those numbers now out in the open some in congress are 
questioning whether the united states can afford the plane that gen 
bernard p randolph head of the air force systems command calls 
nothing less than a quantum leap into the 21st century 
for all the secrecy surrounding the b2s hightech features 
there is no dark secret about either the stealth concept itself or 
the flyingwing design each is nearly as old as powered flight 
simply put the stealthiness of an airplane or any other weapons 
system is measured by its ability to thwart an enemys capacity to 
detect it by whatever means it is a matter of degree there is no 
such thing as total stealth pure invisibility remains the exclusive 
domain of science fiction 
hauptmann petrocz von petroczy probably qualified as the inventor 
of the stealth airplane when at a time when the unaided human eye 
was the principal aerial tracking device he removed the fabric 
covering of an etrich taube monoplane and replaced it with 
transparent celluloid the engine and skeleton still showed but 
residents of the austrian countryside had to strain to make out the 
wraithlike source of the noise generated by petroczys test flights 
that was in 1912 two years before an englishman john w dunne 
took to the skies in an airplane with no tail no fuselage the 
first flying wing aircraft designers from hugo junkers to john w 
northrop have been entranced by its possibilities despite repeated 
setbacks ever since

the first stealth test of northrops 
flyingwing jet bomber was a remarkable success trouble was four 
decades ago nobody much cared 
shortly before the air force canceled its order for the strange 
yb49 the late 1940s forerunner to the b2 northrop test pilot max 
skelton flew a grand tour of air defense stations in the west 
nobody found him until he was directly overhead says 
flyingwing historian tim wooldridge of the national air and space 
museum so even then the air force knew that that kind of 
airplane was difficult to detect the sad part is that they didnt 
continue the testing 
eventually the lesson began to take hold though the air force 
still wouldnt bring itself to embrace the flyingwing design for 
decades speed and manueverability remained paramount objectives 
through the 1950s and 60s though stealthiness gradually moved 
higher on the priority list 
despite representations of the b2 and its fighter counterpart 
the f117a as the only stealth aircraft in the world the 
antiradar technology has been honed and shared by many other planes 
in the us arsenal some of which remain even more secret than the 
b2 itself the aging u2 spy plane and its successor the sr71 
blackbird featured composite coatings the b1 and the f117a 
represent advances in wing and body blending as well as the 
radarabsorbent materials on their skins 
contrary to popular belief the marriage of stealth technology 
with the flying wing with its slender and hence naturally stealthy 
profile also goes back decades dating almost to the birth of radar 
sir robert watsonwatt the british radar pioneer said as early 
as 1935 that the aerial defense applications of his new technology 
could be stymied by future bombers designed to reduce their radar 
reflectivity he and other engineers recognized that stealth would 
have not so much to do with the size of the airplane but with its 
shape and the materials used to cover it 
in world war ii as the united states and great britain 
aggressively improved radar technology german scientists led the 
way in exploring methods to counter it including coatings designed 
to absorb rather than reflect radar energy these radarabsorbent 
materials or ram for short were first used to shield the snorkels 
of german submarines from detection by radarequipped aircraft too 
late really the engineers turned their attention to their own 
aircraft 
almost by happenstance britain had already delivered a painful 
lesson to the third reich about bombers and stealth technology 
early in the war the tiny de havilland company had answered the 
panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a 
cheap twoengine machine out of plywood spruce and balsa it was 
initially scoffed at but the mosquito which carried nary a 
defensive gun had the lowest loss rate of any world war ii bomber 
thanks to its speed flying altitude and the nearly invisible 
flicker it produced on radar screens 
that lesson in mind the brothers walter and reimar horten 
working with a supersecret luftwaffe group known as sonderkommando 
9 set out to build a supermosquito one even stranger in design 
they came up with a flying wing powered by two jet enginesburied 
behind the cockpit but too late the hoix the only prototype to 
fly in early 1945 was destroyed when one of the engines failed a 
neverflown copy rests at the national air and space museums 
storage complex at silver hill md 
it is a remarkably cleanlooking airplane says wooldridge a 
museum official and the author of winged wonders the story of 
flying wings 
the test models were covered with plywood but production 
versions were to have a skin mixing plywood sawdust charcoal and 
glue a compound expressly intended to absorb radar waves the 
hortens had built a highloadbearing plane combining jet power the 
lowprofile shape of the flying wing and integral ram it was the 
b2 of its day 
more frightening to contemplate is how the war might have turned 
if germany had managed to deploy a larger model that the hortens had 
actually started to assemble in april 1945 the hoxviii it was an 
enormous sixjet flyingwing bomber designed to fly at least 7400 
miles with an 8000pound bombload were it not for hitlers 
imminent defeat that aircraft rivaling the size of the b2 might 
have flown to bomb new york city or washington 
unlike germanys rocket scientists the horten brothers were 
rebuffed in their bid to pursue their breakthroughs for the allies 
after the war most us warplane manufacturers focused on the 
obvious alternatives to stealth for making their craft less 
vulnerable more speed higher altitudes heavier armor and 
onboard defenses 
meanwhile jack northrop the founder and longtime design leader 
of the california company that bears his name waged a lonely 
campaign for something entirely different though the horten 
brothers headed for virtual exile in argentina would not have 
thought it so

baghemaidan afghanistan ap convoys of trucks headed from 
the soviet border to kabul roll down the salang highway past the 
bombedout villages of an 11year war that has changed forever the 
landscape of this rugged country 
the war between the marxistgovernment and the usbacked 
guerrillas is reflected in almost every turn 
a recent trip along a section of the road showed that guerrillas 
havent yet carried out their pledge to cut the strategic link 
between the soviet union and the afghan capital 
heavily laden trucks of every vintage were rumbling south from 
hairatan just across the oxus river from the soviet union carrying 
ammunition fuel wheat and other goods to kabul 
vehicles loaded with food supplies and even a yellowandwhite 
kabul taxi were heading north on the 260mile journey back to the 
soviet border 
every day almost 800 trucks travel along the salang in both 
directions and sometimes as many as 1000 said col barakat ullah 
deputy regional commander south of the salang pass 
he said guerrillas tried unsuccessfully to cut the salang after 
the last soviet troops rolled up the highway on feb 15 ending 
their near decadelong involvement in the war 
but for the last five months there has been only sporadic 
shelling around this post which is 16 miles south of the salang 
tunnel and about 60 miles north of kabul he said 
during the trip there were no sounds of hostile gunfire in this 
strategically important area overlooking the hindu kush mountains 
which is heavily infiltrated with guerrillas 
a vanload of local afghans provided the only real noise firing 
their rifles into the air in a traditional welcome for the 
journalists as they rode on top of three armored personnel carriers 
through the town of jabalassaraj about 50 miles north of kabul 
barakat said the guerrillas were feuding among themselves and 
were too weak to attack the government has made deals with most 
local guerrilla commanders not to attack the convoys and in the past 
two months 600 guerrillas in the area have switched their support 
to the government he said 
professor burhanuddin rabbani head of the fundamentalist 
jamiateislami guerrilla group said late last month that 
pakistanbased rebels were trying to develop a coordinated strategy 
to cut all major roads in afghanistan 
right now the salang the most hotly contested road of the war 
is the only major highway operating with a semblance of normalcy 
the two other major roads out of kabul have more serious 
problems the jalalabad road running southeast from kabul to the 
pakistani border is open but mainly to military traffic and a 
limited amount of civilian vehicles which travel under military 
escort 
the logar and ghazni roads running south to pakistan have been 
closed for more than a month cutting off supplies of wheat and 
produce to the open market in kabul and sending prices soaring 
the guerrillas who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors said they want even higher prices to force kabul residents 
to evacuate so they can attack the city 
but as long as the salang stays open a total blockade is 
impossible 
in the past three weeks the governments stockpile of wheat in 
the kabul silo has grown from 8000 metric tons to 27000 metric 
tons wellinformed sources said 
most was shipped down the salang by truck from hairatan but some 
was flown to kabul by soviet transport planes which arrive on an 
average of about 30 per day the wheat is crucial to avoiding a 
repetition of last winters shortages 
even though the military appeared relatively confident soldiers 
along the highway were reinforcing posts and building new security 
areas where sheep once roamed and wild grass grew 
dozens of tanks were poised to fire and soldiers stood on 
commanding hilltop positions along the mountainous road which 
barakat said the government established after the soviet withdrawal 
during the war dozens of once thriving hillside villages were 
caught in crossfire in the final stages of the soviet withdrawal 
they were finally reduced to rubble in a combined afghansoviet 
sweep to ensure that guerrillas would not use them to fire on the 
departing convoys 
like the blackened of tankers and trucks littering the sides of 
the road and the banks of the salang river running alongside they 
are reminders that the scars of war will last long after the 
fighting ends

ramstein west germany thomas wenzel says a broken watch that 
belonged to his fiance is forever frozen at a most chilling time 
the exact moment she died 
karin schneider was among thousands of people who flocked to the 
ramstein us air base one year ago to watch a spectacular air show 
she was among 70 who died when a flaming jet plunged into the 
horrified crowd 
i have to learn to forget but i cant because of karin says 
wenzel 24 a university student from the nearby village of 
erfenbac i ask myself over and over whether she suffered for a 
long time or whether she died instantly 
only her pocketbook and watch are left the watch stopped at 
the exact second of her death it was 345 in the afternoon 
it was sunday aug 28 1988 an elite team of 10 italian stunt 
flyers were executing a complex move for the thrilled masses below 
two aircraft suddenly collided then a third 
all crashed with one sleek jet bursting into a fireball and 
rocketing downward into the crowd below 
the three pilots were among the dead at least 450 were injured 
since then the ramstein disaster has prompted a national debate 
over air safety 
some critics insist rescue efforts were bungled by lack of 
coordination between west german and us authorities 
others use the tragedy to build their case against lowflying 
aircraft in west germany the bulwark of the us military presence 
in western europe but american and other nato officers point out 
that the italian frecce tricolori team was a stuntflying group that 
had nothing to do with lowlevel flights 
never again and stop lowlevel flights read some of the 
banners during an aug 13 protest march sponsored by a leftist group 
called let us not forget the demonstrators about 1000 of 
them carried 70 crucifixes symbolizing the dead 
later the group watched a mock hearing complete with fivemember 
jury that severely criticized west german and us officials 
involved in planning the air show that attracted more than 300000 
people 
one of those who testified was edna kreutzer who complained 
that officials are refusing to compensate her for the lost wages she 
was expecting from her 23yearold son aloysius one of the 61 west 
germans killed 
he was a miner with a good job and he made a lot of money 
the 52yearold saarland woman said later she works nights bundling 
newspapers to help make ends meet 
the zdf television network says officials have received 1500 
claims for compensation but that so far only half of them have been 
settled it said 81 million has been paid out but that the total 
sum will be several times higher 
wenzel told the associated press his injuries were limited to 
seared lungs and singed hair even though he was standing near karin 
at the time of the crash many other survivors suffered nearly 
incapacitating burns 
in bonn conservative lawmakers are at odds with the leftist 
social democrats over the direction of a special commission that has 
been investigating the crash but the social democrats brush off the 
criticism that it is using the commission in hopes of exploiting 
antimilitary sentiment in next years national elections 
we want to be sure that ramstein never occurs again said 
social democrat defense expert erwin horn 
as part of the observances for the anniversary nato nations are 
grounding all military missions in the normally crowded skies over 
west germany on monday 
the us air force held an anniversary remembrance for the 
victims including the four americans who died on friday at the 
sprawling ramstein base 
west german state lawmakers planned an ecumenical prayer service 
for sunday in ramstein 
and the italian stunt team planned to make its first appearance 
since the disaster performing at an air show in belgium on sunday

rivalries between hispanics and other americans have 
crowded out issues in the tight emotioncharged race for the us 
house seat left vacant by the death of democratic rep claude pepper 
voting tuesday is expected to be by ethnic more than party 
lines with hispanics rallying around a havanaborn woman trying to 
become the first cubanamerican in congress and most nonlatin 
whites and blacks turning out for a brooklynborn jewish attorney 
that scenario indicated in polling would result in a photofinish 
race 
while pepper a national advocate for the elderly and poor who 
died may 30 at age 88 overwhelmed opponents for 27 years and drew 
no opposition last year tuesdays special election is the 
culmination of one of the most bitter campaigns florida has seen 
attorney gerald richman making his first run for elective 
office defied political pundits and his own partys local hierarchy 
by winning the democratic nomination by a landslide in an aug 15 
runoff 
gop nominee ileana roslehtinen a state senator put together a 
wellorganized wellfunded campaign featuring appearances by 
president bush and vice president dan quayle 
the presidents son jeb bush is her campaign chairman and the 
republican party is trying to add to its momentum in florida and 
increase its 108 majority in the congressional delegation 
however richman charged charged from democratic dark horse to 
running neckandneck with ms roslehtinen in a campaign in which 
he repeatedly said this is an american seat he called ms 
roslehtinen a rightwing extremist 
ms roslehtinen said richman was running a campaign of racism 
and bigotry and she refused to debate him during their twoweek 
campaign 
richman whose thin inexperienced campaign staff was beefed up 
by national party help after his nomination said his theme has been 
for all the people and that the american seat comment means 
voters shouldnt choose by place of birth 
it was republican national leader lee atwater who set the tone by 
saying the party wanted to elect a cubanamerican richman says 
he calls the bigotry charges a phony issue my opponent has 
cleverly fanned the flames and used it as an excuse not to debate 
adding to the ethnic heat was an aug 20 comment by the rev 
thomas ferguson chairman of the black republican caucus as he 
toured churches with ms roslehtinen he said mr richman does 
not believe in god like we do 
and in the campaigns final weekend a spanishlanguage flier 
went out to hispanics in the 18th district reading 
we want mr gerald richman to understand one thing we too 
are americans no we werent born in brooklyn new york like him 
no we dont speak english the same way he does 
jeff eller spokesman for richman called the flier bald 
hypocrisy 
overall they have similar views on most issues but they differ 
sharply on some emotional issues such as 
abortion ms roslehtinen favors more restrictions richman 
favors more choice with polls indicating most voters are 
prochoice ms roslehtinen says abortion is not a congressional 
issue 
orlando bosch ms roslehtinen has argued for freedom for the 
anticastro militant considered a hero by many cuban exiles richman 
says bosch called a terrorist by us officials should be deported

the lower mississippi river region is so poor 
that one section is called americas ethiopia and a federal 
commission is seeking new ways to help its dying towns and end 
generations of dependence on welfare 
there are counties with more than a quarter of the work force 
idled a lack of capital to attract new jobs and waste of human 
resources like teenage mothers with sickly babies and adults who 
cannot read or write 
unlike a foreign country in need the region of 214 counties in 
seven states covered by the study gets neither enough sympathy from 
washington nor bailouts from international financiers says wilbur 
hawkins jr executive director of the lower mississippi delta 
development commission 
its nice well and dandy to take care of foreign nations 
hawkins said but here we are in america we can afford to send 
money to poland to the caribbean nations but not to the delta 
there is a lack of care about the deltas problems a lot of 
unconcern said one commission member rep ed jones dtenn i 
think the southern people are concerned and now its time for the 
nation to be concerned 
the commission members represent arkansas illinois kentucky 
louisiana mississippi missouri and tennessee and are appointed by 
the states governors congress assigned the commission to come up 
with a 10year plan for government and private action to lift the 
region out of poverty 
geographically a rivers delta is at its mouth the 
mississippis is the area below new orleans where it spills into the 
gulf of mexico but congress noting common problems of the mostly 
agrarian poor counties stretching from southern illinois to the tip 
of louisiana grouped the seven states under the common heading of 
delta in creating the commission 
the region has long relied on agriculture river commerce and 
industries that have suffered because of overseas competition the 
river is lined by rich farmland and dotted by small waterfront 
towns like helena and a few population centers like memphis 
tenn which have some prosperity 
of the 11 million people in the region 40 percent fall below 
federal poverty guidelines according to sen dale bumpers dark 
more than half the residents of northwestern mississippis tunica 
county which earned the americas ethiopia nickname live below 
the poverty level 
across the mississippi at lee county ark the per capita income 
is 6542 the hospital was closed for lack of money 
at lakeview ark south of helena rampant teenage pregnancy 
prompted distribution of contraceptives at the school health clinic 
but the program was curtailed for lack of funds 
one stumbling block to national action is a lack of awareness 
about the delta hawkins said during a recent meeting in 
washington hawkins said he asked why more federal contracts go to 
puerto rico than mississippi 
puerto rico is just as american as mississippi hawkins 
quoted an official as responding then in his next breath he 
said what can you make what can you do 
the swampy land lining the big muddy was drained and pioneered by 
plantation owners over the last century rich in deep topsoil and 
natural resources poor in capital the delta counts agriculture as 
its dominant industry 
but wealth never trickled down from the landowners residents 
many of them sharecroppers stayed poor and got poorer with the 
changing fortunes of farming which has a reverberating effect in 
the littlediversified economy 
the commissions preliminary proposal for a 10year improvement 
plan to be presented to congress in october was compiled during 
the past six months it runs more than 70 pages and is packed with 
new statistical data hawkins says the congressional mandate calls 
for a final report in may 1990 
hawkins also says the mandate bars any release of details until 
congress gets the report 
but longtime delta residents say the regions problems can be 
boiled down to one word money money to attract jobs train workers 
and battle conditions that smother hope and erode families 
hawkins recently scouted phillips county for a site for the 
commissions latesummer meeting in arkansas at elaine as he 
walked down a gravel road toward timeworn houses he was surrounded 
by curious youngsters 
what are yall doing this summer hawkins asked 
nothing replied 12yearold james ellis 
hawkins hoisted another child 2yearold bryant hart into his 
arms 
we want to make his tomorrow better that is what this is 
about he said you ask what this boys life is going to be like 
this is the future generation his future depends on the success 
of what we do

the nations new social security chief 
gwendolyn s king is taking charge with a mixture of grace and 
grit stressing compassion for the public and vowing to snarl like a 
junkyard dog if anyone tries to siphon trust fund reserves 
when i say i want more responsive service i dont want to just 
sit back and answer questions i want to be out there on the 
forefront figuring out how we can help people better mrs king 
said in an interview 
sworn in aug 1 as commissioner of the social security 
administration mrs king commands an agency second in size only to 
the defense department ssa provides monthly social security 
benefits to 38 million americans and distributes supplemental 
security income checks to another 4 million needy people who are 
aged blind or disabled 
mrs king a 48yearold former congressional state and federal 
employee who breezed through senate confirmation proceedings said 
one of her first concerns was how do you get your hands on the 
levers of an agency that has 65000 employees 
she is working to improve service to retirees and other 
beneficiaries protect social security reserves for future 
generations and boost morale in a work force slashed by 20 percent 
during the reagan years 
part of what i am doing is letting people at social security 
know that the important part of their job is doing it right with 
accuracy and consideration and with some compassion she said 
i go ballistic when i hear that people have been rudely treated 
social security employees in recent years have complained that 
heavy staff reductions made it impossible for them to do their jobs 
right but mrs king who replaced dorcas hardy as ssa chief said a 
modernization program will ease workloads 
a nationwide tollfree telephone network will be in full force by 
oct 1 allowing more people to take care of simple transactions by 
phone and giving office workers more time to handle complex 
problems she said 
congressional critics have complained that the new telephone 
lines now serving more than 60 percent of the country too often 
are busy and that employees sometimes provide inaccurate information 
mrs king said she wants to expand programs to find homeless and 
needy people who may not realize they are entitled to social 
security or ssi benefits 
she also wants to encourage employees to steer people who are not 
entitled to social security benefits toward other government 
assistance for which they might qualify such as meals on wheels or 
public health services 
in addition to her responsibility to todays social security 
beneficiaries mrs king also must safeguard the growing trust fund 
reserves needed to finance benefits when the baby boom generation 
begins to retire 
while the tight budget situation in washington tempts some to 
talk about using the reserves for other purposes mrs king said the 
predominant sentiment is to leave the trust funds untouched 
one of the best communicators ive ever seen has been the 
junkyard dog who by simply baring his teeth and snarling sends a 
message that everybody understands mrs king said ill be that 
junkyard dog for the trust fund ill just make sure that if i see 
it coming ill start snarling so loud and so hard that it wont 
happen 
another thing mrs king plans to fight is any attempt to remove 
ssa from the department of health and human services and make it an 
independent agency governed by a board 
several members of congress are backing such a plan as a way to 
give ssa greater clout and isolate it from political infighting but 
mrs king said it would only deny social security representation 
within the cabinet and weaken its leadership 
i dont think this is the time to start tampering with a system 
that is working she said its not broken theres no need to 
fix it social security is on a roll

a twostory house east of london has been 
identified as britains oldest inhabited residence and the only 
domestic building surviving from before the norman conquest of 1066 
it has been in continuous use for 1000 years and is still lived 
in 
dr nicola smith of the historic buildings and monuments 
commission writing in the weekly country life magazine said the 
40footlong house called priors hall at widdington had previously 
been dated from the 13th century 
but the discovery of saxon stonework under the plaster showed it 
was probably built in the 10th century she said 
the building may originally have been a church or chapel dr 
stone said 
the saxons came from germany and dominated britain in the 600 
years before the norman conquest when they were known as 
anglosaxons 
some of their churches and farm buildings have survived

the kremlin cannot trust the polish army in 
case of an eastwest european confrontation but neither can 
western war planners bank on polish troops breaking ranks with their 
soviet allies during a conflict experts say 
it is an unreliable force i think that has been the soviet 
general staff calculation for years and i think it has got to be 
even more the conclusion now that the communists have lost control 
of the polish government said a ross johnson a former rand corp 
expert on warsaw pact military forces who now heads radio free 
europe 
unless the soviets have firm control of polish rail lines they 
would face grave difficulties waging a ground war in europe 
according to analysts who have studied the issue for the pentagon 
ian cutherbertson a british expert on eastern europe said 
the soviets long have realized the unreliability of the polish 
armed forces most of them are earmarked to protect soviet 
communications lines in poland for the group of western forces 
the halfmillion soviet troops in east germany 
the chances that polish or other warsaw pact units actually would 
see combat in a european war would be greatly diminished if soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev carries out his proposal to reduce 
soviet troop levels eastern europe from 625000 to 350000 while 
cutting red army tank forces in half president bush has proposed 
smaller cuts in atlantic alliance forces 
gorbachev is in the process of withdrawing the forces that 
would give the soviets surprise capability said a us 
intelligence analyst 
questions about the loyalties of the polish army began long ago 
although the emergence of a solidarity government marks a watershed 
in western perception of the issue 
poland has the second largest military in the warsaw pact with 
just over 600000 army and uniformed police forces including 
reserves according to a 1986 rand study written for the pentagon by 
a former polish officer michael sadykiewicz now a consultant in 
london 
according to sadykiewicz and other analysts with access to 
intelligence data kremlin war plans call for most of the polish 
forces to guard rail and communication lines that would be needed to 
reinforce frontline soviet units in east germany 
as many as 1 million soviet troops would move across poland in 
the event of war occupying the country along the way according to 
some western estimates 
many polish generals including president wojciech jaruzelski 
were trained in the soviet union but loyalty to the kremlin 
decreases down the ranks of the mainly conscript army said johnson 
and cutherbertson a scholar at the institute for eastwest security 
studies in new york 
they had conscripts coming directly out of solidarity and there 
is evidence that they were seen as much less reliable than the 
conscripts of the 1970s said johnson 
but analysts cautioning against the assumption that the polish 
army will refuse to fight alongside the soviets cite contradictory 
evidence of polish loyalties 
solidarity chairman lech walesa and the new polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki have given assurances that the communist party 
will head the defense and interior ministries which control the 
military and the police and that poland will remain in the warsaw 
pact 
additionally president wojciech jaruzelski the communist leader 
who declared martial law against solidarity on dec 13 1981 
remains president with the power to declare a new state of 
emergency 
the army in cracking down on solidarity eight years ago proved 
that it could be used by the government against popular unrest 
however one defector ryszard kuklinski a former colonel in the 
polish armed forces has written that jaruzelski long resisted 
kremlin pressure to use the military against the independent trade 
union 
the uncertainty of polish loyalties has led the kremlin to assign 
just over half of polands military and police units to defend the 
internal front against domestic unrest said sadykiewicz 
drawing on his years in the polish military 
a smaller group including elite and maritime paratroop units 
would advance with soviet forces on a socalled second echelon 
front across the baltic and into denmark away from the main 
battleground germany according to sadykiewicz and other experts 
red army generals have planned to position soviet forces in 
front of beside and even behind the polish forces to ensure that 
they would advance across western europe in step with any soviet 
offensive said johnson

criticism of casualties of war reflects the 
continuing american conflict over the vietnam war says director 
brian de palma rather than a fundamental problem with his films 
portrayal of the war 
the film starring michael j fox and sean penn depicts the rape 
and murder of a vietnamese woman by american soldiers and is based 
on a 1969 report in the new yorker magazine 
veterans organizations say the film promotes false stereotypes 
about american soldiers conduct in the war while other critics 
have characterized it as gratuitously violent 
ive got many letters from veterans who say the movies 
completely accurate about the kind of things that went on there 
de palma told reporters sunday at the world film festival so the 
thing was divided then and its divided now 
he said that because of his critics various political agendas 
they arent really paying attention to anything that appears on 
the screen 
de palma 48 said americans needed to make movies about vietnam 
to continually remind ourselves that we make mistakes and that we 
can make them again 
de palmas next project is a screen adaptation of tom wolfes 
novel bonfire of the vanities de palma said he didnt know who 
would get the coveted role of the books protagonist stockbroker

to the war games being right here in the neighborhood

other with paintpellet pistols the zoning change would allow the

its the kind of thing you should try it to get a feel for

and poultry for consumers 
but department economists say consumer demand and prices are

retail food prices in general are expected to rise an average of 5 
percent to 7 percent this year from 1988 when the increase was 41 
percent 
prices for red meats poultry eggs fresh vegetables and 
processed vegetables rose sharply during the first half of the 
year he said although most of these will decline in the second 
half overall food prices will be about steady 
historically this years increase is the sharpest since 1981 
when food prices climbed 78 percent 
according to the current forecast for 1989 retail beef and veal 
prices which with pork are measured on an allcut basis are 
going up an average of 4 percent to 6 percent compared with a 55 
percent increase in 1988 
pork prices may hold steady or even decline by as much as 2 
percent from last year and pork prices reflecting a downward 
crunch on hog farmers dropped 3 percent in 1988 ending several 
years of rising prices 
behind the scenes far from the supermarket counters shopped by 
consumers some important developments are taking place 
cattle inventories at the beginning of july indicated probable 
herd expansion says the september issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine the number of beef cows that have calved was unchanged 
while replacement beef heifers increased 4 percent from a year 
earlier 
but that involves longterm expansion simply because of the 
biological clock it takes nine months for a newly bred heifer to 
deliver a calf and another 15 to 20 months before the calf is grown 
up for slaughter and turned into supermarket beef 
july surveys indicated that onfarm supplies of feeder cattle 
younger steers and heifers that could be sent to feedlots for 
further growth were up 1 percent from a year earlier 
improved forage conditions have helped producers hold back on 
sending feeder cattle to feedlots this summer allowing more animals 
to be kept in pastures instead 
the high prices currently necessary to bid feeder cattle away 
from pasture may be too great to ensure profitability in the 
feedlots without much lower grain prices the report said 
according to usda estimates feed grain production will rebound 
sharply from last years yieldshriveling drought led by a 49 
percent jump in corn output to around 735 billion bushels as of 
aug 1 indications 
corn market prices are projected to drop to an average of 185 
to 230 per bushel in the marketing year that will begin sept 1 
from 250 to 260 estimated for 198889 
extensive price specials in june and july especially for 
lowervalued cuts pushed retail beef prices down after rising for 
six months the report said but with lower beef output this fall 
prices are expected to rise again in the fourth quarter a period of 
seasonally greater demand 
looking at the hog situation the report said producers are in 
for lower market prices as slaughter picks up seasonally in 
september 
weekly kills could approach 19 million head by november 
compared with a midsummer rate of about 15 million the report 
said this will put downward pressure on fresh pork prices 
prompting packers to bid less for hogs 
market hogs that sold in the high 40s per 100 pounds at 
midsummer could decline 10 before bottoming out this fall the 
report said prices in the fourth quarter could average in the high 
30s per hundredweight close to yearearlier levels 
although feed costs are expected to decline this fall returns 
to hog producers likely will remain below breakeven the report 
said the extended period of poor returns could cause producers to 
reduce breedings below previous intentions 
cutbacks in breeding farrowings this fall would reduce pork 
production after the first quarter of 1990 
meanwhile broiler producers have stepped up production which 
led to a summer decline in wholesale prices analysts said those 
prices are likely to keep declining this fall as more broilers go to 
market total output is expected to be up 6 percent to 7 percent 
from 1988 
turkey production is expected to rise 4 percent to 5 percent this 
year wholesale prices of hen turkeys in the eastern markets 
averaged 65 cents per pound in july down five cents from a year 
earlier 
however prices are expected to strengthen as retailers buy 
additional turkeys for holiday consumption 
poultry prices at the consumer level overall are expected to 
rise an average of 6 percent to 8 percent in 1989 compared with a 
72 percent gain in 1988 those include prices of all birds sold at 
retail 
egg production is expected to drop only 2 percent this year 
instead of the 3 percent decline estimated earlier the report said 
profits have improved and have spurred some rebuilding of flocks 
the new york wholesale price for grade a large eggs rose from 
about 76 cents per dozen in july to around 85 cents by august 
compared with the high 60s a year earlier the report said prices 
are expected be in the range of 80 to 82 cents in the third quarter 
and then decline to 68 to 72 cents in the fourth 
over the entire year usda economists predicted that retail egg 
prices will average 15 percent to 20 percent more than in 1988

jesse jackson is relaxed one of washingtons 
newest residents he is biding his time gone for the moment is the 
fiery preacher of the campaign trail but the provocative language 
remains 
his voice low wearing blue jeans and boots the twotime 
presidential candidate dodges questions about his political future 
especially about talk that he will run for mayor of washington next 
year 
jackson has moved his home and office from chicago to the 
capital but thats as far as hell commit himself publicly its 
not an appropriate time to discuss a mayoral bid he says 
but he drops tantalizing hints im not interested in being a 
mayor under occupation thats not very attractive he said does 
that mean he wont run for mayor theres no race in 1989 is 
the answer 
jackson calls washington the cradle of democracy and the last 
domestic us colony 
what he means is that the district of columbia is a city 
controlled by congress although district residents can vote for 
president they have only one nonvoting delegate in the house of 
representatives 
jackson wants washington to become the 51st or 52nd state 
depending on whether puerto rico votes for statehood when a 
plebiscite is held there in 1991 
congress is an occupying power it can appropriate land 
restrict the budget the mayor is under occupation he has no 
ability to influence congress except through sympathy and when 
theres none of that 
there is very little sympathy in congress for jacksons old 
friend from the days of their 1960s civil rights marches mayor 
marion barry 
the threeterm mayor has been dogged by questions about his 
behavior he has been questioned about his association with a man 
later convicted of selling drugs and two of his top aides have been 
convicted of stealing from the city 
washingtons record drugrelated killings its high infant 
mortality rate and the citys budget deficit have prompted congress 
to commission a critical study of the capitals management rather 
than elevating it to statehood it has been suggested that the mayor 
be replaced by a lesspowerful city manager 
jackson is appalled residents of washington must be made full 
partners in democracy he said 
he reels off statistics alaska wyoming delaware vermont and 
north dakota have smaller populations than washingtons 650000 who 
pay federal taxes like everyone else 
this is taxation without representation even beijing and 
moscow are represented in their legislatures jackson said 
with an area of 6825 square miles the district would be less 
than onetenth the size of rhode island by far the smallest of the 
50 states 
jackson shrugs that off statehood for the predominantly black 
district will open the senate to black americans who are not 
currently represented in the chamber he said 
would he like to be senator jackson or maybe governor jackson 
thats not the issue here he said 
jackson who has never held public office has said he will not 
challenge barry but political observers suggest the beleaguered 
mayor may step down some time next year and leave jackson a 
virtually clear field that in turn could preclude a third bid by 
jackson for the democratic partys presidential nomination in 1992 
some suggest that without the oftencontroversial jackson on the 
democrats left wing the party might stand a better chance of 
uniting and capturing the white house in 1992 after more than 10 
years in presidential exile 
but jackson refuses to be drawn into such speculation 
i stand a good chance of winning the presidential nomination 
if i choose to run in 1992 he said im on an upward curve

political literature is booming as the 
bans and restrictions imposed by chiles rightwing military 
government appear to be coming to an end 
books ranging from gabriel garcia marquezs latest to 
controversial political essays have become bestsellers and 
literary experts believe the trend will continue because of the 
outgoing government of conservative president gen augusto pinochet 
after seizing power in a bloody 1973 coup pinochet decreed a 
total ban on political activities congress was closed political 
parties disbanded and severe censorship on books and the news media 
were enforced 
in the last few years however most bans have gradually 
disappeared as the nation has prepared to pick a successor to 
pinochet the vote in the first presidential election since 1970 
is scheduled for dec 14 
political activity now is virtually free bringing a boom to 
political literature 
experts say the long period they lived without access to a 
variety of freely published information left chileans ripe for the 
wave of political literature 
the public was thirsty for political information said 
ignacio gonzalez a journalist who authored the day allende 
died one of the most successful books in chile in 1988 
the novelized book is a vivid wellresearched account of events 
at the government house on sept 11 1973 the day pinochet toppled 
elected president salvador allende allende a marxist died in the 
takeover 
gonzalez book sold 11000 copies in three months a notable 
figure in this small south american country where sales of 3000 
books is considered a bestseller 
i think people reacted with enthusiasm because of the 
attraction of learning things that had been forbidden to them for so 
long gonzalez said in an interview 
even more successful was the silent revolution a report on 
the achievements of the pinochet government by joaquin lavin a 
conservative economist 
published in december 1987 lavins book sold over 150000 copies 
in 11 months becoming the secondlargest selling book in chiles 
history lavin claims he said it places second only to farewell 
to the 7th regiment a novel based on the 1879 war that chile won 
over peru and bolivia 
an official at the chilean book chamber said that although no 
precise figures have been compiled lavins claim appears correct 
i just tried to tell chileans how the country is that they live 
in these days lavin said the book shows them how their country 
has changed 
gonzalez and lavin believe public interest on political books 
will survive the end of military rule 
book records show that at least three political titles have 
appeared in the weekly lists of 6 topselling books for over a year 
the bestselling nonpolitical book in recent months was the 
general in his labyrinth a biography of simon bolivar the 
venezuelanborn liberator of south america by colombian nobel 
prizewinning author gabriel garcia marquez the book has sold 
65000 copies in eight months 
experts say its too early to determine the effects the 
availability of political books is having on chileans 
among the leading books on political matters in recent years are 
those by gonzalez and lavin 
also gen prats memoirs by gen carlos prats the army 
commander under allende who was assassinated in exile in argentina 
published postumously the buchi phenomenon a 
bigraphicalpolitical study on hernan buchi the progovernment 
presidential candidate in the december election moscow here the 
soviet union and perestroika as seen by a chilean journalist 
bernardo de la masa yes or no a study prior to last octobers 
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend 
pinochets rule until 1997 by hermogenes perez de arce a

add moldavia to the ranks of the 
kremlins ethnic headaches the majority moldavians are pressing to 
make their romanian dialect the official language of this soviet 
republic 
leaders of the moldaviandominated peoples front see a language 
law to be debated tuesday by the republics supreme soviet or 
parliament as the first step toward emulating three baltic 
republics drive for political and economic autonomy 
activists of the opposing yedinstvo or unity movement fear it 
will be the first step toward discriminating against minority 
russians ukrainians bulgarians jews and christian turks the way 
moldavians have been put down for years 
an estimated 250000 to 300000 people rallied sunday in this 
capital waving flags and banners boosting ethnic demands similar 
crowds are expected outside government buildings tuesday to await 
the supreme soviets decision 
mikhai ghimpu acting chairman of the peoples front recently 
said the language law is a matter of national survival 
when a language disappears a people disappears he said 
we reached that point every day everywhere its russian 
although 64 percent of the republics 42 million people are 
moldavians they make up only 43 percent of kishinevs population 
the law would make moldavian a dialect of the language spoken in 
neighboring romania the official language it would also restore 
the latin alphabet that the soviet dictator josef stalin replaced 
with cyrillic when the soviet union forcibly took the land from 
romania in 1940 
leaders of the peoples front see the adoption of the language 
law as vital to protecting moldavian culture they are one of many 
soviet ethnic groups who have been agitating for more autonomy from 
the kremlin 
more than 1 million residents in the baltics linked hands last 
week in a giant chain to protest a sovietnazi pact of 50 years ago 
that led to the soviet annexation of estonia latvia and lithuania 
estonia has declared partial sovereignty from moscow 
on sunday the communist party daily pravda said the need for a 
moldavian language law was obvious 
said pyotr shornikov a leader of yedinstov we are divided by 
a fundamental question our attitude toward democracy they demand 
preference we demand equality 
both sides say their movements aim for broad economic reform of a 
republic once ruled by leonid i brezhnev and termed by shornikov 
one of the epicenters of stagnation but they say their opposite 
stands on the language law makes it difficult to cooperate 
we read stories about apartheid in south africa where people 
are barred from any work except manual labor if their skin is the 
wrong color pyotr zalozhnikov a 45yearold russian worker said 
by telephone from tiraspol this is what this law would do to all 
people here who are not moldavians in one day well be made 
deafmutes our children will have no future 
the peoples front says the transfer to moldavian will be 
gradual over about five years and that officials will be able to 
get by learning a few key words for official situations 
communist party chief semyon grossu has given his backing to the 
language law virtually ensuring its passage 
in tiraspol whose 200000 people are almost 90 percent russian 
speakers almost all factories shut down after publication of the 
final draft on aug 20 said strike committee member vsevolod 
yampolsky dozens of other factories shut down in bendery rybnitsa 
and komrat he said 
ghimpu a 37yearold lawyer sees the moldavian peoples front 
following the baltic lead to push for limiting the inflow of 
nonmoldavians more economic independence and tougher residency 
requirements 
asked his opinion of the estonian election law that drew a strike 
by thousands of russian workers and censure from the kremlin for 
tightening residency requirements for voting and running for local 
office ghimpu said i envy them 
the peoples front views the language law as the key to righting 
two historic wrongs imposed by stalin the seizure of the land from 
romania under the secret 1939 pact that led to the annexation of the 
baltic republics and the forced conversion of their alphabet from 
the latin used by their romanian brothers to cyrillic followed by a 
decadeslong effort to convince the world that moldavians and 
romanians are distinct nationalities 
after romania refused in 1968 to take part in the warsaw pact 
invasion of czechoslovakia romanianproduced books disappeared from 
moldavia only now are they beginning to reappear the shelves of a 
downtown kishinev bookstore specializing in books from allies of the 
soviet union had many more books in vietnamese than romanian 
among the 12 selections produced in romania were a coloring book 
with no words a howto sewing book a germanromanian dictionary 
and a translation of a french book 
there is also a territorial aspect to the moldavians program a 
call for the return of northern bukovina and the southern black sea 
coast from the ukraine 
the majority recognize this isnt ukrainian territory 
moldavian historian valery matei asserted

a communications satellite is 
orbiting earth after being propelled by a privately owned rocket in 
a launch that opens a new era in the space age 
the 2700pound marcopolo 1 satellite was drilled into space 
sunday by a threestage delta rocket that performed flawlessly 
during a 27minute climb into orbit 
the launching was the first in which a privately owned rocket 
sent a payload into orbit consort i the nations first licensed 
commercial spacecraft released a payload on a suborbital voyage in 
march 
delta 187 has placed the british satellite broadcasting 
satellite in orbit we wish the spacecraft folks good luck 
reported ray adams of mcdonnell douglas which made the 30 million 
delta 
the satellite was sent into an elliptical orbit ranging from 
about 100 to 22300 miles high 
on tuesday ground controllers are to send a signal to fire an 
onboard motor to place it in a stationary orbit 22300 miles high 
parking it over the middle atlantic ocean within view of the british 
isles 
marcopolo 1 is the first of two satellites designed to transmit 
television programs direct to british homes equipped with 12inch 
dish antennas a settop box and a remote control unit the 
equipment will cost about 450 said anthony simondsgooding chief 
executive officer of british satellite broadcasting ltd operator 
of the satellite system 
the launch was a milestone in the us commercial space program 
that started after the 1986 challenger explosion after the space 
shuttle disaster thenpresident reagan told the national 
aeronautics and space administration to stop launching payloads for 
commercial customers reagan said the job should be done by private 
industry with unmanned rockets 
this is not just another launch its the beginning of a new 
industry a landmark event said stephanie leemiller of the us 
department of transportation which licenses commercial launches 
she said 27 additional launches are scheduled through 1993 
reagans decision revitalized a us unmanned space rocket 
program that was almost dead because of the nations growing 
reliance on the manned space shuttle to launch all payloads 
three major us aerospace companies took on the commercial space 
program in earnest and the mcdonnell douglas delta was the first to 
the launch pad martin marietta has scheduled a commercial launch 
with its titan rocket later this year and general dynamics atlas 
is set to make its debut next year 
all three rockets are upgraded versions of boosters nasa and the 
air force have used for several years the delta launched sunday was 
the 187th in that series 
the three companies will compete with each other and with the 
wellestablished ariane rocket sponsored by the french government 
and with a long march rocket being marketed by the chinese 
several smaller american companies are developing rockets for 
boosting small commercial payloads into orbit or on brief suborbital 
trips 
british satellite broadcasting in 1987 selected hughes aircraft 
co to build the two marcopolo satellites under a 300 million 
contract 
mcdonnell douglas is charging hughes 50 million for each of the 
two launches hughes will verify the satellites are in orbit and 
working before british satellite accepts them the second launch is 
planned next summer 
the air force will receive more than 1 million for the use of 
its launching pad and tracking stations for the initial launch 
according to sheila m carter a spokeswoman for mcdonnell douglas 
simondsgooding said bsb plans to start broadcasting to homes 
through the satellite next spring with customers initially 
receiving five channels four of them free 
the charge will be about 15 monthly for the movie channel which 
shows movies from around the world the free channels will consist 
of now for news and sports galaxy devoted to entertainment such 
as game shows a lifestyle channel and a youthoriented channel 
such as mtv

the discovery of what appears to be 
active ice volcanoes on neptunes moon triton overshadowed some 
other interesting findings by the voyager 2 spacecraft 
a day on neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes give or take 
four minutes a day is the time the bulk of a planet takes to spin 
on its axis 
winds up to more than 700 mph blow in neptunes atmosphere 
tiny dust particles vaporized in 100000degree fahrenheit 
microexplosions as they hit voyager when it passed through the 
plane of neptunes rings an onboard sensor recorded the explosions 
which sound like heavy rain falling on a roof the particles were 
about the size of smoke particles too small to hurt voyager 
neptunes south pole and equator while incredibly cold are 
hotter than the planets middle latitudes 
neptunes magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from the 
poles around which the planet rotates a much greater tilt than the 
minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially estimated that means 
neptunes magnetic north pole is closer to its equator than to its 
rotational north pole earths magnetic poles are tilted 12 degrees 
from its true or rotational poles

its an uphill climb they concede but members of 
the mexican olympic bobsled team say they still expect someday to 
become real competitors in the winter sport 
that goal comes despite the fact the tames brothers finished 36th 
and 37th at the 1988 winter olympics in calgary and it comes 
despite the fact they still have no sled little money and are 
hundreds of miles from the nearest snow 
the brothers are seriously preparing for another run at breaking 
into bobsledding respectability said eduardo tames they are 
raising money for a november training trip to calgary and hope to 
travel to europe in 1990 for muchneeded competition 
and whats more tames said the team is recruiting 
were trying to find mexicans who play college football who 
have the leg strength to get faster starts he said sunday we 
want to have 10 to 12 guys on our team next time 
tames said he and brothers jorge adrian and roberto who are 
from guadalajara and work at a dallas restaurant plan to go to 
several mexican cities for the recruiting they would like to take 
several new recruits to calgary for the november practice runs 
well have to let them try the sleds he said sometimes 
they dont like that 
for the time being tames and his brothers are working out every 
morning in dallas going out early to beat the searing texas heat 
snow is the furthest thing from their minds he said as they push 
and ride a wheeled cart across a large parking lot to get down their 
timing and strengthen their bodies 
we need to be more explosive to push the sled faster at the 
beginning he said 
they would like to buy their own sled but that seems like an 
idle dream because even used sleds go for 10000 to 20000 
for now they are simply doing well to afford 1000 weekly just 
to rent a sled during their canadian training trip and meet the 16 
fee they must pay track operators for each practice run 
mexican officials were pleased with the teams finish at calgary 
and have already given them permission to represent the financially 
struggling country again if the brothers can find their own funding 
for the 1992 games 
wearing red and white donated uniforms the brothers finished 
ahead of portugal a japanese team one from the virgin islands and 
a us entry that abandoned its last run 
we didnt finish last in 1988 so that was pretty good for us 
tames said we definitely want to improve that performance 
improvement will be a costly endeavor and a medal is an 
unthinkable goal but tames says nothing can beat the thrill he and 
his brothers find in bobsledding 
its really different from anything ive ever tried before 
he said adding that no amusement park roller coaster can even come 
close 
the only way you can tell if youre going to like it is to try 
the sled its really scary its really fast until your reflexes 
and eyes adjust to the speed youre running

the skull of a bear has been unearthed on the site 
of the elizabethan rose theater where william shakespeare is 
believed to have acted and near where bearbaiting was first 
recorded in the 1500s 
dr sebastian payne of the historic buildings and monuments 
commission who examined the skull was quoted in the times of 
london today as saying the animal was believed to be a mature adult 
european brown bear 
he said the canine teeth were broken off possibly to make the 
bear less dangerous to humans and dogs and because the teeth were 
subsequently worn smooth the animal must have survived its ordeal 
for some time he said the skull appeared to have come from a ditch 
that contained debris dating from 15871606 when the rose theater 
was flourishing 
bears were brought to britain to undergo the torments of attacks 
by dogs for the entertainment of paying spectators the discovery of 
the skull may indicate the rose was used for entertainment other 
than drama 
the rose site is near the more famous globe theater both stood 
on the south bank of the thames river by southwark bridge 
the foundations of the rose were discovered earlier this year 
during demolition to build an office they are the only relics of an 
elizabethan theater yet found 
the acting profession demonstrated for weeks to try to have the 
site preserved as a permanent exhibit but the campaign was 
unsuccessful

skeptics say solarpowered cars still 
arent feasible but james worden commutes to work every day in a 
solar car he built himself 
the car is a 350pound silver threewheeler covered with solar 
panels that suggests a cross between a golf cart and a honda civic 
it holds two people can reach 35 mph and for four years has taken 
him on his regular 13mile commute 
worden keeps it parked in a sunny spot outside his lab at the 
massachusetts institute of technology when he drives it at night 
or takes it more than about 50 miles he plugs it into an ordinary 
electric outlet to recharge its nickelcadmium battery 
worden easily kept up with traffic during a recent spin through 
crowded cambridge where the most significant trouble the car 
encountered was giant potholes 
one advantage was its silence 
has it stalled a passenger inquired as the car sat 
noiselessly waiting for a green light 
no worden replied its recharging 
in a month or two the 22yearold entrepreneur expects to 
produce a fourwheel prototype that will look more like a more 
traditional automobile 
we hope to be making a car a day in two years said worden 
who was a high school student when he built his first solar car and 
had yet to graduate from mit when he founded his company 
solelectron corp 
worden said his next generation solarelectric commuter car will 
weigh 800 to 1000 pounds accommodate two people plus 300 pounds of 
cargo and reach 45 mph it also will be able to go for 40 miles at 
night and 60 miles in full sunlight before recharging 
its a city car worden said the idea is itll be 
sprightly and clean and easy theres no gas and no fuel charge and 
no oil changes youll never have to get a brake job there 
wont be a muffler either the only service youll need except 
the tires is watering the battery every year or so 
the car should sell for about 10000 worden said extra solar 
panels which could be left on a roof for recharging would cost 
another 500 to 1000 
solelectron also is working on a 20000 racing car model to go 
faster and farther 
his fourwheel commuter car has limitations in full sunlight it 
will go only 20 mph before drawing on its hightech lead battery 
parked a full day in the sun it will soak up only enough light to 
run 40 miles recharging the battery will take up to five hours 
still worden and other entrepreneurs of solar energy say that 
smog ozone depletion and global warming make electric cars more 
attractive even in places where frequently cloudy skies obscure the 
sunlight 
solarelectric cars are on the market in europe for instance a 
swiss compact sells for about 20600 
some proponents such as robert wills an engineer at dartmouth 
college predict solar cars will be commercially available in this 
country before the end of the century 
there just arent any better solutions to air pollution in the 
major cities said wills an organizer of the new england tour de 
sol solar car races 
at the same time solar technology has advanced enormously in 
recent years due in part to lessons learned from longdistance 
solar car races 
in 1987 general motors sunraycer was driven 1950 miles across 
australia in 5 days averaging 415 mph and just this summer 
wordens racing car the 270pound solectria drove 3200 miles from 
los angeles to washington dc in two weeks with few troubles 
other than some flat tires 
but although gm has learned much about engineering lightweight 
solar cars from the sunraycer we feel this probably has more 
application to a lightweight efficient electric commuter car than to 
a solar car said gm spokesman bruce mccristal in detroit 
mccristal would not say whether gm is working on an electric car 
many observers still believe that barring soaring gasoline prices 
or regulatory incentives offered by states trying to reduce air 
pollution widespread use of solar cars is a long way off 
i would agree with worden that he has a vehicle that can easily 
encompass the needs of the average commuter but whether the 
commuter will buy it is another question said edward a campbell 
publisher of alternate energy transportation a monthly newsletter 
based in new york 
will the commuter accept something that can only go 40 miles a 
day and has to be laid up at night

nearly nine of 10 classroom teachers consider the 
computer revolution a boon to education but a majority also feels 
less computerliterate than their students according to a poll 
fiftynine percent believe teachers are inadequately trained in 
computer use according to the poll released sunday the computer 
report card how teachers grade computers in the classroom 
commissioned by international business machines corp 
twothirds of us teachers now use classroom computers but 52 
percent said they felt less computer literate than their students 
fiftyseven percent said they did not own a personal computer at 
home 
the poll conducted by the wirthlin group a new yorkbased 
polling organization was based on telephone interviews of 1100 
teachers in all 50 states randomly selected from a list of 
approximately 250000 precollegiate teachers compiled by the dunhill 
international list co it was conducted between july 69 and had a 
sampling margin of error of plus or minus 3 points 
the ibm survey echoed the sentiments of a report in july by the 2 
millionmember national education association stating that 
schools are not doing enough to help teachers become familiar and 
comfortable with computers 
the teacher unions report found that only onethird of 
kindergartenthrough 12thgrade teachers had even 10 hours of 
computer training 
still the ibm poll found 59 percent of teachers believe 
computers are being used effectively for instruction 85 percent 
think theyve had a positive impact on education and 88 percent 
reject the idea that computers are a passing fad 
and while 43 percent said computers made teaching less difficult 
45 percent said the technology hadnt affected the difficulty of 
their jobs and 9 percent said it had made their jobs harder the 
rest offered no opinion 
teachers are saying that technology has a place in the 
classroom but they have to be given the training to use the 
equipment for personal use or as a teaching isntrument mary 
hatwood futrell outgoing president of the nea said in an interview 
a pleasant surprise was the number of teachers who believe we 
should use technology more extensively than we do now she said 
i hope the survey sends a clear message to colleges and to school 
districts that teachers want to use technology and that they need 
training 
computers a rarity in us schools a decade ago are now in 
virtually every school district 
other poll highlights 
77 percent agreed that computer use could lessen the need for 
academic tracking because they allow for more individualized 
instruction in the same classroom 
91 percent believed computers can help develop basic skills in 
reading and writing and 66 percent said computers arent being used 
enough toward those ends 
82 percent said computers increased students motivation for 
learning 
68 percent considered cost the greatest obstacles to effective 
use of computers 
77 percent agreed that computers will never replace textbooks 
as instructional tools 
70 percent do not like the focus on drill and practice software

a woman charged with murdering her 
lesbian lover is using the battered spouse syndrome as her 
defense authorities said 
defense lawyers for annette green 30 planned to argue that she 
killed her 32yearold livein lover ivonne julio because ms 
julio beat and humiliated her repeatedly during their 11year 
relationship 
the trial was scheduled to begin today in palm beach county 
circuit court 
ms greens defense is considered novel because the battered 
spouse syndrome is usually ascribed to women who suffer repeated 
beatings by male partners 
this is a new issue said new york university law professor 
holly maguigan an expert on domestic violence but it is not 
surprising the dynamics in a samesex relationship are often 
similar to those in a heterosexual relationship 
ms green shot ms julio with a bullet to the brain on oct 30 
1988 following a halloween party and a fight in a trailer park in 
unincorporated palm beach county according to police 
she would have killed me because she is very violent ms 
green told police after the killing 
ms green told police that ms julio had beaten her more than 100 
times since 1977 when they became lovers ms julio two years 
older and 70 pounds heavier used to strike ms green without 
warning ms green said 
police said ms green admitted that she was not in immediate 
danger when she shot ms julio who was kneeling in a closet 
assistant state attorney bob johnson has asked the court to 
exclude testimony on the battered spouse syndrome as it applies to 
lesbians because of a lack of adequate research 
circuit judge tony waddell has not ruled on the issue 
johnson said he will seek the death penalty if ms green is 
convicted 
a doctor hired by the defense found evidence ms green had 
suffered multiple head injuries acquaintances said the couple 
argued frequently and their arguments often dissolved into violence 
defense attorney william lasley said ms green did not leave ms 
julio out of concern for ms julios twin 14yearold daughters 
lasley said ms green adopted the teenagers and acted as 
their mother protecting them from ms julio

settlements have been reached at pacific telesis which serves 
california and nevada and bell atlantic which covers west 
virginia virginia maryland delaware pennsylvania washington

negotiations

reached until there are agreements in the other states

an effect on our employees said mary lou ringle spokeswoman for 
ohio bells cleveland office 
about 35000 cwa members struck the five ameritech companies aug 
13 and there was little progress in bargaining until late last week

between the cwa and ameritech services a subsidiary employing about 
600 warehouse workers in indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin 
wages had been the issue in all five of the ameritech companies 
with the union balking at offers to pay a onetime lumpsum amount 
as a part of any negotiated increase 
we paved the way to a settlement by moving some of the lumpsum 
money into wage increases in ohio rosenthal said hopefully we 
can do the same in the other companies

thousands of armed contra soldiers are 
preparing to defy a regional peace accord and march back into 
nicaragua despite a lack of us support 
we will wait in the mountains for the changes that president 
daniel ortega has promised said contra chief of staff israel 
galeano known as commander franklin 
we arent going to launch offensive operations because we dont 
have enough supplies but we will defend ourselves if attacked he 
said saturday in an interview with the associated press 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government has promised democratic 
reforms and set an election for feb 25 1990 in accordance with an 
agreement signed by central american presidents on aug 7 in tela 
honduras 
the accord also called for disbanding the nicaraguan resistance 
army by dec 8 with a united nations team to observe the process 
by the time the un gets here well be gone said 
commander henry head of the rebel medical corps 
most of the army fighting to oust the sandinista government has 
been camped in honduras along the nicaraguan border since us 
military aid was suspended a yearandhalf ago 
the isolated camps are strung out along the narrow yamales river 
valley 30 miles from the nearest paved road weakened by desertions 
and shortages of supplies and medicine the army has by and large 
retained its integrity and spirit 
we have too few bullets and too much morale said galeano 
he and other field commanders say an intact fighting force will 
pressure the sandinistas into fulfilling their democratic promises 
to a warweary nation 
what can the un do if ortega cheats asked one soldier who 
had taken the battle name danilo look what happened in 
panama where gen manuel antonio noriega retains his grip on 
power despite us and other international opposition 
battlehardened commanders express contempt for politicians 
of the nicaraguan directorate in miami 
weve kicked out the desk soldiers they lost touch with the 
fighters said commander dimas one of a group of young field 
commanders who now make up the general staff 
us officials say they fear that contras who return to nicaragua 
will be wiped out by the vastly larger sandinista army and contra 
commanders said they had been asked to wait at least until dec 8 
before making a move 
the gringos think everything in central america runs on their 
money they think that without their money and their supplies well 
just go away said dimas 
now were thinking about this entirely from the point of view 
of our own interests he said 
nonlethal aid has continued and us officials point 
energetically to literacy and civics courses barber and cooking 
classes and even a course in public speaking as examples of the 
current us effort 
but many contras now see the aid as irrelevant and even damaging 
because it made them seem a creature of the united states rather 
than an indigenous guerrilla force created by sandinista oppression 
withdrawal of the aid is viewed as immoral and some said us 
advisers didnt seem to realize they were in a war 
they were always telling us oh no dont attack that bridge 
dont attack that factory congress will get mad said henry 
the army is made up almost entirely of peasant farmers 
sharecroppers and ranchers who fled the sandinista governments land 
seizures and collectivization efforts many now have families in the 
camps in nearby villages or in refugee camps in eastern honduras 
commanders and soldiers alike said they began their fight without 
expecting us aid 
i started with a 22 rifle after they tried to make me join a 
collective said pavon or big bird a member of the jorge 
salazar no 5 battlion 
but despite defiance the army knows it is alone short of 
ammunition and with little hope of outside help an outbreak of 
meningitis has killed three children and left others ill 
what do you know about canadas rules on asylum asked a 
fighter named freddy when he was alone with a journalist is 
there a lot of work there 
freddy said he had joined the contras to avoid the draft i 
avoided two years of service but now ive been fighting for six 
he said 
mariana amador said she walked 10 miles from a village to collect 
her son who had decided to desert from an contra artillery unit 
he got nervous when they started talking about going back into 
nicaragua she said 
where there were 11000 men in early february there are now 
6000 to 7000 
commanders claim 2500 fighters have already left for nicaragua 
while no one wanted to discuss desertions some companies that 
should have 200 men could muster only 120 
were purifying ourselves said commander nolan the leader 
of a combined battalion the weak and the corrupt are leaving 
ortega and the sandinistas have been making an effort to convince 
the contras that it is safe to return sandinista and contra field 
commanders have held impromptu talks 
but the fighters are skeptical about sandinista promises saying 
that ortega has yet to prove he can keep a promise

bombings other attacks in recent months were conducted by leftist 
guerrillas that sometimes cooperate with drug traffickers 
the spokesman said police patrols in medellin 215 miles north of 
bogota were tightened to prevent new attacks he said extra units 
were stationed throughout medellin to protect private and public 
buildings 
the city is hometown for the medellin cartel the worlds biggest 
drug organization and reportedly responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine sent by air sea and land to the united states 
president virgilio barco meanwhile denied reports related to 
the resignation of the justice minister monica de greiff but he 
failed to clarify whether the minister had actually resigned 
according to a communique late sunday 
the presidential communique followed a weekend of speculation 
over the alleged desertion of mrs de greiff at a time when the 
government is conducting an unprecedented campaign against the drug 
lords 
newspapers radio networks and television stations repeatedly 
reported sunday that mrs de greiff had resigned after less than two 
months in charge 
asked to clarify the communique a spokesman at the presidential 
press office said i cannot add a single word to the document 
mrs de greiff 32 had been the target of death threats against 
her her husband and their 3yearold child since the government 
launched a nationwide crackdown on drug traffickers after a string 
of killings that included presidential candidate sen luis carlos 
galan on aug 18 
since galans death the government has arrested more than 11000 
people and seized hundreds of millions of dollars in property the 
united states last week pledged 65 million in helicopters and other 
military aid for the government effort 
rumors of mrs de greiffs resignation circulated after a tv 
interview last week in which she said i wasnt prepared to work 
in times of war such as now 
rodrigo lara bonilla a predecessor of mrs de greiff was killed 
by drug hitmen in 1984 
last week the traffickers declared war after the government 
began a crackdown in response to the assassinations of a magistrate 
a police colonel and sen galan over a 48hour period 
the presidential communique on mrs de greiff appeared untimely 
as the government was calling on colombians to become fighters for 
the moral and help them defeat the cocaine traffickers 
she traveled to washington on friday where she was scheduled to 
confer with us attorney general dick thornburgh on extradition of 
arrested drug suspects but she failed to show up at the meeting and 
no explanation was given by colombian authorities 
thornburgh said sunday that mrs de greiff would be welcome in 
united states if she applied for refugee status to escape from 
political prosecution 
private radio network caracol said mrs de greiff had told 
president barco she wanted to resign other news reports said she 
would be replaced temporarily by communications minister carlos 
lemos simmonds 
the newspaper el tiempo reported sunday that a court has struck 
down an arrest order for medellin cartel boss pablo escobar that 
accused him of ordering the massacre of peasants at two ranches by 
rightwing death squads 
but el tiempo said a threejudge panel reversed its ruling aug 
15 deciding there was insufficient evidence against escobar who 
formed a trafficking organization in the mid1970s and has 
repeatedly terrorized the judicial system with assassinations and 
threats according to police 
no such reversal was reported at the time and it was not 
immediately possible to confirm the report sunday 
meanwhile in jerusalem police opened an inquiry sunday into 
israelis suspected of training death squads for colombian drug 
barons and a retired army officer named in the scandal said the 
probe could implicate other officers and a legislator 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said on israel television the 
allegations contained a certain amount of exaggeration he said 
the government had no part in the scandal

relatives warned jose enrique 
menendez that criminals prey on the rich but he kept the gates 
unlocked at his 4 million beverly hills house with its tennis 
court and mercedesbenz outside 
and that could have made it easy for mobsters to get him his 
sister said outside a memorial for the slain hollywood executive 
we think he made the mistake of buying a business that had been 
used before by the mafia and we think he was trying to run it 
straight marta menendezcano of west palm beach fla said 
friday 
her brother jose e menendez was found shot to death the night 
of aug 20 along with his 44yearold wife kitty in their 
spanishstyle mansion 
about all police would say was that nothing had been ruled out 
the cubanborn menendez 45 once headed rcaariola records as 
well as the us rental car operations for the hertz corp 
he was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of live 
entertainment inc an affiliate of carolco pictures inc in the 
video and music distribution business and had been praised for 
improving the companys performance 
two of the three companies operated by live entertainment had 
been linked to organized crime before live entertainment bought 
them live entertainment acting president roger r smith has 
vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link 
ms menendezcano and former lt gov mike curb a friend for 
nearly a decade described menendez as absolutely honest although 
an extremely aggressive businessman 
sometimes he had to tell people things they didnt want to 
hear curb said but he was a wonderful guy an absolutely 
outstanding person i just cant believe something like this could 
happen 
curb and ms menendezcano spoke outside the memorial service at 
the directors guild of america in hollywood where 400 people 
listened to eulogies by the menendezes sons eric 18 and lyle 22 
ms menendezcano said her brother had tried to keep the video 
business clean 
the first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business 
she said because of his success he probably was stepping on many 
shoes which some people didnt like 
international video entertainment which live entertainment 
purchased in 1986 had been owned by noel c bloom bloom was 
identified in a california attorney generals report on organized 
crime that year as a major distributor of xrated movies and a 
former associate of the late michael zaffarano of the bonanno 
organizedcrime family 
peter hoffman carolcos president and chief executive said 
international video entertainment itself was never involved in 
pornography 
the other company with a crimelinked past was beckzack corp 
which owns the 81store strawberries audio and homevideo retailing 
chain in the northeast live entertainment completed its acquisition 
of beckzack this june 
beckzacks principal shareholder morris levy was convicted in 
may 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler 
he remains free pending an appeal of his conviction 
an fbi affidavit filed in federal court in new york in connection 
with an investigation of levy quoted an unidentified informant as 
saying that a faction of the genovese crime family owned an interest 
in the strawberries chain the documents called levy a lucrative 
source of cash and property for genovese leaders 
andrew nichols the boston lawyer who represented levy in the 
sale of strawberries to live entertainment for about 405 million 
said he is certain the company had no crime connections at the time 
of the sale 
and live entertainment officials said they even checked with 
federal organized crime investigators who said they were unaware of 
any such links to strawberries 
ms menendezcano said her brother had big plans to expand he 
said he would be controlling the east coast video business through 
his careful planning in the next couple of years 
she said her brother refused to listen when she warned him about 
leaving the house unlocked 
we told him that there were burglars criminals in the 
neighborhood she said 
menendez and his wife had been looking to the future building an 
8000squarefoot dream house above los angeles 
then their sons found their bulletriddled bodies 
menendez would want his business associates and friends to keep 
up the fight his younger son told the mourners 
eric menendez recalled how his father kept a portrait of the 
slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr in the house and 
adopted as his motto kings declaration of hope i have a dream

crack cocaine is becoming more prevalent in the 
chicago suburbs and police fear the city may no longer remain 
relatively untouched by the drug 
its virgin soil says lt harold jenkins of the maywood 
police department dealers figure they can come here and start 
their own thing 
authorities are uncertain why crack popular among drug users 
for years in other cities had been so scarce here one theory is 
that local drug kingpins kept the drug out of the area because they 
feared it would cut into their profitable trafficking in powder 
cocaine and heroin 
now crack is becoming a problem in some of the poorer southern 
suburbs and police fear poor city neighborhoods could be next 
in suburban harvey 539 drug arrests were made last year and 
police say 95 percent of the narcotics trade in that suburb involves 
crack a smokable form of cocaine 
crack dealers police said have invaded other urban centers by 
first establishing footholds first in outlying communities 
one dose of crack provides a much more intense high than cocaine 
in powder form and sells for less money as a result crack is 
popular in poorer communities and among the young 
for years chicago police have focused their drug activities on 
powder cocaine and heroin abuse while other cities reeled under 
soaring homicide rates due to crack chicagos homicide rate in 1988 
dropped to its lowest level in 20 years 
officials say the full extent of crack abuse in chicago has not 
been determined from february to june police raided 20 crack 
houses said sgt jim brady 
chicago gangs are believed to be playing a key role in 
distributing crack in the suburbs and police are checking into 
reports that los angeles street gangs may be involved they have 
introduced crack into kansas city mo minneapolis and other cities 
police in suburban robbins say their town has become known on the 
street as rockville because so much crack cocaine is sold there 
in rock form 
on most nights dozens of dealers sell crack openly in alleys and 
parking lots and on street corners said sgt charles harris

troops forced open shops in the capital 
and its suburbs today the first day of a weeklong strike to protest 
alleged killings of sinhalese militants and to demand the withdrawal 
of indian soldiers 
heavily armed soldiers in combat gear drove around colombo 
warning shop owners to open and troops broke the locks of shops 
whose owners refused most subsequently opened their establishments 
but some said they did because they feared the military 
few buses rolled through the capital and soldiers were posted at 
nearly every corner witnesses said 
troops also prevented cameramen from taking pictures of the 
military actions and at least two photographers had their film rolls 
exposed by the military 
no clashes or other violence were immediately reported but 
military officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said 235 suspected sinhalese radicals had been rounded up since 
sunday in central and southern sri lanka the sinhalese heartland 
inspector general of police ernest perera also ordered all police 
on alert after intelligence reports were received that said 
sinhalese extremists planned to attack police stations during the 
strike military officials said 
the strike was called by national workers action front the trade 
union wing of the peoples liberation front an extremist sinhalese 
group waging a violent 2yearold campaign against the 
sinhalesedominated government 
sinhalese radicals oppose the governments peace plan granting 
limited autonomy to tamils in the north and east indian troops were 
invited to the island in july 1987 to help enforce the initiative 
but the government now wants them out india says a quick withdrawal 
could lead to further violence 
posters put up in colombo by the militants demanded that 
residents stay indoors and not open for business counterposters 
believed to have been put up by progovernment groups said anyone 
who heeded the strike call would be treated as a traitor 
at least 5000 people have been killed in the campaign by 
sinhalese ultranationalists human rights organizations and 
opposition politicans say many of the victims have been suspected 
radicals shot after capture by security forces in past weeks 
military officials have reported scores of unidentified bodies 
turning up in various parts of the island every day 
another 11000 people have died in the tamil insurrection that 
began in 1983 in northeastern sri lanka 
sinhalese who are mainly buddhist and make up 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people dominate the government and military 
tamils who are mainly hindu and comprise about 18 percent of the 
islands population say they are discriminated against by the 
ethnic majority in jobs education and use of the sinhala language 
india the dominant military power in the region moved in troops 
because of the sympathies of its own 60 million tamils to the rebel 
cause but the soldiers soon began fighting the rebels it once 
supported after a major tamil militia rejected the peace plan

lutherans worked on a compromise approach 
to abortion an issue that in the past divided the three 
denominations that merged last year to form the evangelical lutheran 
church in america 
a motion was submitted sunday at the churchs eightday 
legislative assembly which ends wednesday asking individuals to 
act on their christian convictions while the church makes a 
longrange study

a resolutions committee proposal calling simply for a church study 
and for people to use prior church guidance 
the lutheran church in america the american lutheran church and 
the association of evangelical lutheran churches merged into the 
53million member church on jan 1 1988 the three denominations 
had taken varying positions on abortion 
the substitute motion which reportedly satisfied a womens 
caucus that had sought church action to oppose restrictions on 
abortion said church advocacy should involve appealing for free 
access to services for individuals and work for justice 
especially with and for the poor 
meanwhile antiabortion pickets showed up outside the ohare 
exposition center where the new churchs first policymaking 
assembly is being held with signs reading 
elca its your baby now abortion stops a beating heart 
and lutheran general stop killing

has been picketing lutheran general hospital in nearby park ridge 
ill which performs abortions 
bishop herbert w chilstrom the churchs president said in a 
letter that the hospital does not provide abortion on demand he 
also was quoted as saying the hospital aborts only fetuses so 
seriously abnormal they would die before or at birth 
meanwhile the assembly delayed action on whether to set a 
deadline for its pension board to sell off stock in companies doing 
business in south africa 
the board has 16 billion in assets 849 million invested in 
companies operating in south africa it says it is gradually 
reducing the holdings but must do so gradually to be financially 
prudent 
one group pension members for justice is pressing for a 
deadline of sept 1 1991 to get rid of the holdings 
several denominations including the united church of christ 
the episcopal church the church of the brethren and the quakers 
have decided to sell all stock in companies operating in south

retail gasoline prices plunged 2 cents 
nationwide in the past two weeks because of fierce competition among 
service stations according to a business analyst 
the average price for all types of gasoline sold at full and 
selfservice pumps was 11044 cents per gallon for the period ending 
friday said trilby lundberg who directs the lundberg survey of 
12000 stations 
it was uncertain whether the prices would stay down through the 
labor day weekend said ms lundberg 
many station operators have lost money as retail prices fell more 
sharply than wholesale prices creating a tough situation for 
retailers and making price predictions difficult she said 
the average price of 11044 cents is about the same price as 
april 7 after the initial 10 percent jump in gasoline prices in the 
wake of the alaskan oil spill 
since then prices have climbed up another 8 cents per gallon and 
dropped back down again 
during the recent twoweek period the average price of a gallon 
of gasoline at a selfservice pump plunged from 10229 cents to 
9942 cents for regular unleaded from 11832 cents to 11603 cents 
for premium unleaded and from 10263 cents to 9891 cents for 
regular leaded 
at the fullservice pumps the average price of a gallon of 
regular unleaded gasoline fell from 12955 cents to 12819 cents 
premium unleaded dropped from 14174 cents to 14047 and regular 
leaded came down from 12925 cents to 12776 cents

two palestinians died today of gunshot wounds 
suffered in clashes with israeli forces and west bank arabs began a 
general strike to protest the deportations of five activists a day 
earlier 
the deaths raised to 12 the number of palestinians killed in 
clashes the past week in contrast to 10 people who died in 
confrontations in the previous three weeks 
also today 60yearold rajeb al kassas died of injuries suffered 
three days earlier when he was beaten by masked youths who accused 
him of collaborating with israeli authorities arab reports said 
the army said it was checking the report 
the armys chief of staff lt gen dan shomron has blamed the 
rising violence on a decision by yasser arafats mainstream plo 
faction fatah early this month urging armed struggle against israel 
the israeli daily haaretz said however that the upturn in 
violence also resulted from a new army policy of raiding remote 
villages in the west bank to arrest uprising activists 
a total of 98 palestinians have been reported slain by fellow 
arabs as alleged collaborators during the revolt

a mass circulation british newspaper today accused 
polands roman catholic church leader of antisemitism in the 
controversy about a convent at auschwitz death camp 
the daily mirror said cardinal jozef glemps stand must have had 
the backing of pope john paul ii 
the cardinal has tapped into the deep vein of antisemitism 
which has existed in his country for a thousand years he would not 
have done so without the knowledge of the pope himself a pole 
todays editorial said 
the tabloid sells 3 million copies a day and supports the 
socialist opposition labor party 
on saturday glemp urged jews worldwide to stop being antipolish 
in objecting to the existence of a catholic convent at auschwitz 
the german concentration camp established in poland mainly to 
exterminate jews 
if there would be no antipolonism there will be no 
antisemitism in our country glemp said 
the daily mirror commented the butchers were german nazis and 
their renegade allies but when cardinal glemp spoke warmly of the 
improving relations with polands old enemies germany and russia 
he used dangerously inflammatory language against the jews 
he tried to justify his own shameless bad faith in tearing up a 
solemn agreement that a carmelite convent would be removed from 
auschwitz a place which the holocaust made holy to jews 
the polish catholic church had given its word that the nuns 
would be moved by last february cardinal glemp broke it without a 
qualm and now that the jews insist that he keeps the promise he 
accuses them of violating polands sovereignty 
in the name of god what does he hope to gain by fanning the 
embers of hate the editorial asked

the cost of a firstclass postage stamp will 
likely rise to 28 to 32 cents early in 1991 postmaster general 
anthony frank said today 
that means two more christmases at the current 25cent rate for 
firstclass letters frank said on nbctvs today show 
frank had said previously that the postal service would apply for 
a rate increase sometime next year to take effect in 1991 but had 
not specified the amount 
he said today that the increase would be 20 to 25 percent later 
specifying a range of 28 cents to 32 cents for the new rate 
the cost of mailing a letter rose from 22 cents to 25 cents in 
the spring of 1988 and a new increase effective in 1991 would 
continue the recent policy of increases every three years 
any increase must be approved by the independent postal rate 
commission in a complex process that takes as long as 11 months 
thus to become effective in 1991 the new rates would have to be 
applied for next year 
under the law that established the postal service the agency is 
required to break even financially over the course of a few years 
thus it usually reports profits in the year or so after raising 
rates slips into the red as costs rise then seeks another increase 
to get even again 
the postal service is not subsidized by taxpayer funds

years in a vietcong prison camp was slain on his way to work at the 
joint us military assistance group in quezon city 
communist rebels claimed responsibility for the assassination 
maj gen ramon montanao acting military chief of staff said he 
considered the rowe case solved 
it was the first time the military has claimed to have arrested 
one of the assassins last june police arrested a messenger for a 
university newspaper in connection with the slaying but said later 
he was not believed to have been among the actual assailants 
during an interrogation in front of reporters itaas said he was

auto safety advocates say its no longer a 
question of whether minivans and light trucks will have to pass the 
same safety regulations as passenger cars but when 
you look at auto safety in general and the issue of minivans 
stands out like a sore thumb said clarence ditlow director of 
the center for auto safety the nonprofit agency founded by 
consumer advocate ralph nader 
ditlow says there has been enough public outcry and statistical 
information that the government can no longer ignore the regulation 
discrepancy between passenger cars and minivans 
jeffrey miller acting administrator of the national highway 
traffic safety administration agrees that regulations will be 
implemented within the next few years but he says the reason is 
mostly to reassure the public not because minivans are less safe 
its very important for motorists to understand that most 
safety standards already apply said miller we are trying to 
build on what already is a pretty good safety record it helps to 
reassure the public 
statistics from the insurance institute for highway safety show 
that the accident death rate per 10000 vans last year was 14 an 
increase over the year before but only slightly higher than the 13 
rate of large cars and much lower than the 30 rate of small cars 
minivans along with light trucks and offroad vehicles are 
classified as multipurpose passenger vehicles a category that 
doesnt have the same restrictions as passenger cars minivans are 
manufactured by chrysler general motors ford toyota volkswagen 
nissan mitsubishi and mazda 
minivans are fast usurping the market for station wagons among 
large families and those people worry about the lack of government 
regulation for side and roof strength shoulderlap seat belts and 
head restraints 
but albert slechter federal government affairs director for 
chrysler corp which has 56 percent of the us minivan market 
says some of the safety measures required of cars dont make sense 
for vans 
for years the center for auto safety and others have tried 
unsuccessfully to extend government auto safety rules to minivans 
and light trucks 
last session the senate passed a bill requiring such rules but 
the legislation died after 18 months with no action in the house 
committee chaired by rep john dingell dmich whose district 
includes detroit and whose wife works for general motors corp a 
similar bill passed by the senate before the current recess may be 
headed back to the same committee 
ditlow said the bill may face trouble again in the house but 
added there is such a growing consensus that minivans are less 
safe the bottom line is not whether the safety rules will be 
strengthened but when 
in a june 29 letter to members of the senate transportation 
secretary samuel skinner said the department was moving to improve 
safety of light trucks and vans and didnt think congressional 
action was necessary 
miller said some regulations like those concerning frontseat 
head restraints will be finalized this year to apply to the 1991 
model year 
a chief concern is rollover which is related to the higher 
center of gravity on vans and utility vehicles miller said the 
vehicles roof and seat belts protect occupants when a car rolls 
and minivan manufacturers have voluntarily made those features as 
sturdy as on passenger cars 
according to statistics the greatest rollover problem is not 
vans but light trucks and offroad vehicles partly because of the 
type of driver attracted to those vehicles miller said 
there are specific passenger cars regulations to protect against 
crashes into the side but none exist for vans this isnt a 
problem van makers say because the van is higher and the point of 
impact by another vehicle is into the sill which is a sturdy beam 
across the side 
as for the raised rear stop light now required in cars 
manufacturers say they cant figure out where it should go on a van 
and say vans tail lights already are higher than those on cars

solidarity leader lech walesa said today he 
plans to appeal to workers for at least a sixmonth strike 
moratorium to give the new government some time to solve polands 
pressing problems 
the independent gazeta wyborcza newspaper said walesa would issue 
a statement in the next few days to affirm the need for a moratorium 
of at least six months 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a solidarity activist and a 
close adviser to walesa was approved by parliament thursday as the 
east blocs first noncommunist leader 
asked by reporters in gdansk today when the moratorium request 
would be issued walesa replied we should do it together with the 
appointment of the government 
we have the biggest chance ever to make the poland of our 
dreams we can go in this direction but we cannot do it if we are 
going to suffer economic losses he said 
mazowiecki has been holding talks with other political leaders to 
decide how to allot government ministries among solidarity the 
communist party and two smaller parties that joined solidarity to 
form a majority coalition in parliament 
walesa has said in the past that an end to labor unrest and 
western aid are necessary to help reverse polands economic decline 
and provide a favorable climate for the new government 
the gazeta wyborcza article said walesa told workers with pay 
demands that solidarity would help negotiate their demands with 
management 
pay disputes have broken out on an almost daily basis over the 
past six months but most stoppages have been brief 
workers are frustrated by annual inflation of more than 100 
percent price increases and empty shelves they are also upset 
about the lack of visible economic improvement since solidarity was 
legalized in april after a sevenyear ban and polands freest 
elections in more than four decades were held in june 
railway workers in the central city of lodz ended a oneday 
strike on saturday under pressure from walesa they sent an appeal 
to mazowiecki asking him to satisfy their pay demands

a group founded to promote baby crib safety 
said it is asking the consumer product safety commission today to 
recall millions of cribs because protruding corner posts can snag a 
childs clothing and cause strangulation 
the danny foundation named for a california boy who became 
braindamaged after his shirt got caught on a crib post is seeking 
a ban on protruding corner posts or knobs on cribs 
it is time for the government and crib manufacturers to 
acknowledge these dangerous cribs and prevent further deaths and 
injuries said jack walsh executive director of the foundation 
nearly 50 children have died and two have been left permanently 
brain damaged since 1973 as a result of getting caught on crib 
posts the foundations petition said 
the current voluntary safety standard for cribs adopted in 1984 
which allows corner posts to protrude fiveeighths of an inch 
doesnt protect against strangulation because that is still long 
enough to catch an infants clothing necklace or pacifier cord the 
foundation said in a statement it said a recent study of children 
climbing out of cribs found that two became caught on cornerposts 
that complied with the standard 
believe it or not when this standard was adopted consumers in 
the group opted for the fiveeighthsinch standard because it 
allowed for a less expensive crib almost 16 at the retail level 
on a price of 110 for a crib aaron locker general counsel of 
the juvenile products manufacturers association said today on abcs 
good morning america 
but walsh said it is clear that the voluntary standard is 
inadequate cribs that comply with the curent standard are as 
hazardous as the millions of cribs manufactured before the 
standard 
the foundation in addition to urging a recall of unsafe 
cribs and a ban on protruding cornerposts asked the safety 
commission to mount an information campaign to warn consumers of the 
dangers of the cribs 
there are up to 25 million handmedown cribs in this country 
alone which continue to present a danger walsh said 
the danny foundation a nonprofit organization dedicated to 
promoting crib safety was founded by the family of danny 
lineweaver a child who became severely brain damaged in july 1984 
just short of his second birthday when his shirt got caught on a 
post as he was climbing out of his crib the child remains comatose

a retired israeli officer was questioned by 
police today about allegations he trained private militias for 
colombian drug lords and claimed he did no more than other former 
israeli officers working in the region 
retired lt col yair klein told reporters at police headquarters 
in the tel aviv suburb of petah tikva he believed he was innocent of 
any wrongdoing 
if i did break the law a lot of other people did he said 
israeli newspapers have said klein was the officer seen in an nbc 
film showing the training of death squads for the medellin drug 
cartel in colombia he has denied he trained squads for colombian 
drug dealers 
on sunday klein said he would name highranking officers 
including one now sitting in israels parliament who were involved 
in training operations in latin america but today he continued to 
refuse to make any names public 
police launched an inquiry sunday into possible involvement of 
israelis with colombian assassination squads 
yehoshua caspi head of the investigations unit said police 
would examine all aspects of israelis suspected of selling 
military services and knowhow without defense ministry permission 
to unofficial groups in colombia he said the defense ministry 
requested the probe 
the possible involvement of klein and other israelis with the 
medellin drug cartel drew a renewed defense today from prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
i know our officers i cannot believe that they have been 
involved in such crimes shamir said 
he said the government was not responsible for its citizens 
actions overseas but that it would prosecute those who broke laws 
we have to do what we can i am concerned with everything that 
is doing harm to our image he said 
reports from colombia said four israelis were involved in 
training assassins for drug smugglers in colombia along with us 
british and south african mercenaries 
klein returned to israel from miami on friday after israeli 
newspapers and television identified him in the nbc film on drug 
cartel militias 
he said that last year he helped train banana growers and 
ranchers in colombias rural countryside to fight guerrillas 
he said he was paid 40000 for two monthlong weapons training 
courses he conducted with three other retired israeli officers and 
said all of his dealings in colombia were according to the law 
he said his security company spearhead ended its training 
program last year and his last visit to colombia was four months ago 
his company was denied a defense ministry permit to export 
weapons or arms technology but he said the permit was unnecessary 
because you dont need a permit to work with civilian 
organizations 
the yediot ahronot daily said klein was paid 800000 to train 
hit squads for the medellin drug cartel the newspaper alleged that 
klein was recruited last year by cartel leaders to train ranchers 
and paramilitary troops 
yediot said klein was introduced to the drug barons by an israeli 
businessman identified only as shoshani 
klein confirmed that a man named shoshani helped him make 
contacts and received 10 percent of his fees 
yediot said colombias secret service sent a report to israel 
four months ago on israeli mercenaries in colombia but the claims 
were ignored 
a foreign ministry spokesman said israel received no official 
report from colombia but began investigating allegations in the 
colombian press passed along by the israeli embassy in april

south african leader fw de klerk 
today outlined a plan for resolving his countrys racial conflict to 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia who praised some of de klerks 
ideas 
the trip has been viewed as a major step toward improving south 
africas relations with its black neighbors kaunda has been one of 
the harshest critics of south africas whiteled government for the 
past 25 years 
de klerk and kaunda covered a range of regional issues during two 
hours of talks at a hotel in livingstone a tourist town in southern 
zambia near victoria falls 
i had the opportunity to give a positive vision of the future 
in which south africa is going to break out of the cycle of 
conflict de klerk said at a brief news conference after the 
talks we are going through with negotiations and dialogue 
asked about de klerks ideas kaunda said there are certain 
democratic principles which he says he intends to implement about 
those i see no disagreement at all 
both leaders declined to be more specific 
kaunda led a zambian delegation of about 100 in greeting de 
klerk south africas acting president at the airport today 
in their talks de klerk and kaunda also discussed the crumbling 
effort to end angolas 14year civil war and the independence 
process in namibia the territory south africa has ruled for 74 
years 
on namibia de klerk said he and kaunda agreed that the yearlong 
independence plan was on track with elections scheduled for early 
november 
de klerk met sunday in johannesburg with angolan guerrilla leader 
jonas savimbi who softened his stance a week after canceling a 
ceasefire with angolas marxist government 
de klerks predecessor pw botha was forced to resign from the 
presidency aug 14 after the cabinet overrode his objections to the 
talks with kaunda 
botha said zambia should be shunned because it allows the african 
national congress guerrilla movement to maintain its headquarters in 
lusaka the capital the anc wages a bombing and sabotage campaign 
in its bid to undermine the south african government 
de klerk leader of the governing national party is favored to 
win a fiveyear term as president after parliamentary elections 
sept 6 
he has tried to portray himself as a statesman capable of ending 
south africas international isolation while at the same insisting 
the anc renounce violence before being included in negotiations 
kaunda has led zamibia since its independence from britain in 
1964 and currently is chairman of the frontline states a sixnation 
group formed to work collectively against the south african 
government 
after talks sunday with de klerk savimbi said his usbacked 
national union for the total independence of angola unita still is 
committed to peace in angola and promised he will attend an african 
summit in zaire next month to put the fractured peace process back 
on track 
we welcome the prospect of resuming talks with the angolan 
government at the earliest possible opportunity we commit 
ourselves again to the effort to achieve peace and national 
reconciliation savimbi said 
the statement did not say the guerrillas will observe the june 22 
ceasefire agreement 
on thursday savimbi said a 2monthold ceasefire had failed and 
ordered his fighters to resume fighting angolas government and the 
guerrillas repeatedly have accused each other of violating the 
ceasefire and reported heavy fighting recently 
the rebels have been at war for a share in government since 
portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975 
on friday de klerk met in zaire with president mobutu sese seko 
and the two agreed to mediate between the warring angolans 
south africa supported savimbi until a regional peace treaty in 
december with angola which also calls for a phased withdrawal of 
cubas 50000 soldiers from angola 
washington supplies the guerrillas with about 15 million in 
annual aid

us rep barney frank says he would not stand in 
the way of a congressional investigation into his relationship with 
a male prostitute 
if people think an inquest is appropriate i have no objection 
to that at all frank said sunday after attending a parade in fall 
river 
democrats and republicans may request a formal investigation when 
congress reconvenes early next month the house code of conduct 
calls for members to act at all times in a manner which shall 
reflect creditably on the house 
frank says he was victimized in his relationship with a male 
prostitute who may have run a sex ring out of his apartment and 
predicted voters will not hold the incident against him 
despite republican calls for his resignation polls published 
over the weekend showed franks constituents still strongly support 
him 
one poll found franks constituents by a 21 margin said he 
deserved reelection and more than 65 percent in another poll did 
not think frank should resign 
frank received spirited support sunday as he marched in the fall 
river parade three days after admitting to the relationship with a 
male prostitute 
the parade was part of an event named fall river celebrates 
america that drew some 100000 people over the weekend 
while there were a few muffled boos most of the crowd cheered 
frank as the democratic congressman moved through the parade route 
frank 49 acknowledged on friday he had once paid for sex with a 
male prostitute then hired the man steve gobie to do household 
chores and run errands 
frank said he fired gobie when he became suspicious that the man 
was selling sex from franks capitol hill apartment 
i dont think im going to be heavily penalized by the voters 
for being suckered by a guy i was trying to help frank said on 
friday 
in a related development gobie said he helped police in 
alexandria va on friday arrest a former senate aide who allegedly 
tried to arrange a sexual encounter with a 13yearold girl 
alexandria police cpl john avery confirmed gobies claim today 
the washington times and the washington post reported today that 
the man was charged with solicitation to commit indecent liberties 
involving a minor 
gobie told both newspapers no actual child was ever involved 
it was something we made up he told the times 
the times identified the man as john e ashford 39 who has done 
consulting work for several democratic governors and sen richard h 
bryan dnev he is a former aide to sen thomas eagleton dmo 
ashford declined comment his attorney rawles jones said 
ashford would plead innocent 
after publicly acknowledging his homosexuality in may 1987 frank

in the states 4th district which encompasses some boston suburbs 
and parts of southeastern massachusetts

the final session of an international peace 
conference on cambodia opened today in the french capital with no 
agreement as yet on any of the major issues dividing the 
vietnambacked cambodian government from three resistance factions 
foreign ministers attending the opening sessions of the monthlong 
conference established working committees on reaching ceasefire 
achieving a powersharing agreement repatriating refugees and 
monitoring the complete withdrawal of 26000 vietnamese troops by 
sept 27 
but nearly three weeks of committee meetings which has involved 
19 countries and the united nations yielded so little progress that 
us secretary of state james a baker announced friday he would not 
return to paris for the meeting today through wednesday 
the united states accused vietnam and its government in phnom 
penh led by prime minister hun sen of inflexibility toward the 
conditions for peace set out by prince norodom sihanouk leader of 
the resistance who enjoys strong us support 
chinas official xinhua news agency reported over the weekend 
that foreign minister qian qichen would attend the closing 
ministerial session only if the four committees of the conference 
can succeed in producing agreements 
china sponsors the khmer rouge the strongest of the three 
resistance movements fighting the cambodian government the khmer 
rouge whose genocidal rule between 1975 and 1978 cost a million 
lives have been at the center of the deadlock 
sihanouks resistence coalition has insisted that the khmer rouge 
be given a role in a transitional government that would rule between 
the troop pullout and elections which hun sen has said he would 
like to hold within three months of the withdrawal 
but hun sen rejects including the khmer rouge and says they must 
be eliminated politically and militarily 
the khmer rouge remain the principle obstacle they dont 
believe in a political solution said hun sens deputy foreign 
minister sok an 
the khmer rouge are militarily the strongest of the resistence 
factions and are the most feared by the government and cambodian 
population 
surprise lastminute concessions were possible but not likely 
thailand which has thousands of cambodian refugees in camps 
along its border and is the supply route from china to the khmer 
rouge has predicted no global accord will be signed and that 
another international meeting will be necessary 
indian officials have said the problems existing after nearly two 
decades of fighting cannot be settled in one month 
there remained hope among some delegates that the conference 
could result in a partial accord 
it does not appear likely the conference will achieve its 
objectives said a western delegate several days before the 
conference reconvened 
but the delegate added the conference is less a failure than 
a stage through which one has to pass

to resupply from outside the area 
hospital and union officials said most hospitals have put off 
elective surgery 
sixtyfive of the affected hospitals are in central and northern 
new jersey and are supplied by new jersey blood services of new 
brunswick a branch of the new york blood center said spokesman 
michael scahill 
were trying to source as much blood as we can from different 
parts of the country any red cross center that has blood has been 
contacted scahill said 
a picket line was established by the 50 to 75 employees at the 
new brunswick center according to scahill pickets also marched 
outside the new york blood center in manhattan 
everybody is out and we are accusing management of allowing no 
negotiations over the weekend absolutely none said edward kay 
an executive vice president for local 1199 of the drug hospital and 
health care employees union 
no negotiations were planned until workers are back at their 
jobs scahill said 
besides calling around the country to locate blood medically 
qualified management employees were taking blood from donors 
according to scahill those without medical training were doing 
clerical work 
the notforprofit organization usually has a fourtofiveday 
supply of blood but because of the strike and the time of year it 
was down to less than a days worth scahill said 
its the traditional shortage period the prelabor day period 
were used to shortfalls in the system but this adds a real 
crunch to it he said 
the union said the strike was called because of a management 
attempt to cut pension contributions by 50 percent 
the labor union announced last week that it would walk out on the

an underground extremist faction today 
threatened to kill pope john paul ii if he comes to lebanon on a 
peace mission 
the wording of the threat by the organization for the defense of 
the oppressed suggested it was made by shiite moslem zealots 
a newspaper in iran a sponsor of moslem shiite extremism in 
lebanon said sunday the pope should stay out of lebanon but it did 
not make an overt threat 
it was the second time in four days that the previously unknown 
organization for the defense of the oppressed has made a statement 
delivered to a western news agency in beirut the statement said 
to his holiness pope john paul ii we address our words to him 
wishing that he writes his will before he comes to beirut 
the organization emphasizes that his holiness the pope will be 
one of the victims of the criminal war our beloved homeland lebanon 
is living through the statement said 
other moslem groups have said that a lebanese peace mission by 
the roman catholic leader would really be intended to boost the 
christian side in the countrys 14yearold civil war 
however a senior shiite cleric sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah was quoted sunday as saying he would welcome the pope and 
give him full security guarantees to visit moslem west beirut 
the vatican said it is studying the possibility of a visit to 
lebanon but no date has been set 
in its statement the extremist group also said it will arrange 
a reception for the pope of rome similar to our reception of the 
israeli invaders and the forces of former president reagan and the 
loving mother france in 1982 and 1983 
that last paragraph referred to twin suicide truck bombings on 
oct 23 1983 that killed 241 american servicemen and 58 frenchmen 
the attacks prompted withdrawal of an international peacekeeping 
force from lebanon 
france which ruled lebanon from 1918 to 1943 often is referred 
to as the the christians loving mother mainly because it 
helped forge a national covenant that gave the christians key 
government posts 
the french have now sent a sixship flotilla to the eastern 
mediterranean off lebanon saying the forces may be needed to 
evacuate french nationals from lebanon 
last week the organization for the defense of the oppressed 
issued a statement threatening to attack any french vessel that 
approaches the lebanese coast 
todays developments came amid renewed clashes between christian 
army units and syrian troops allied with moslem militias police 
reported no casualties in the sporadic clashes 
by police count 792 have been killed and 2247 wounded in the 
5monthold confrontation the latest round of the civil war 
on the diplomatic front a french envoy was reported in damascus 
syria waiting to begin talks on a french peace plan while a soviet 
envoy discussed peace proposals for lebanon with iraqi officials 
french foreign minister roland dumas said the envoy would be 
pressing for a ceasefire with an embargo on arms deliveries to the 
warring factions political reform and withdrawal of syrian and 
israeli forces from lebanon 
the proposed troop withdrawal is similar to a soviet proposal 
outlined sunday by arab diplomats 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with an estimated 
40000 troops in the country under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate israel has maintained a selfdeclared security zone in 
south lebanon since withdrawing most of its invasion forces in 1985 
moslem radio stations today criticized the french proposal the 
voice of the nation the most popular station in moslem west beirut 
said dumas plan lays all the blame for the crisis on syria 
with whom most of the moslem majority is aligned

a group of women who performed as many as 13000 
illegal abortions in the four years preceding the supreme courts 
legalization of the procedure is considering reviving its 
underground organization 
in the wake of the courts recent decision allowing states to 
restrict access to abortions former members of the group called 
jane say such an organization may again be necessary 
jane believed to have been the only group of its kind in the 
united states involved about 120 women who were trained by illegal 
abortionists and worked clandestinely from 1969 to 1972 under 
constant threat of arrest 
it was like being in vietnam for four years said jody 
howard a former jane member who is now a freelance writer 
ms howard and ruth surgal another leading jane member told a 
group of about 60 women gathered in a north side bookstore last week 
that they had been driven by deep conviction both to help desperate 
women and to free women from dependence on male doctors or 
abortionists 
its not that i feel great that we did 11 12 13000 
abortions ms howard said but i feel good that we can go to 
people and say you can do it we did it before and we can do it 
again 
members said the groups abortions were safe about 3 percent 
resulted in complications usually infection approximately the same 
rate as that of doctors the group says none of the women undergoing 
jane abortions died 
the group operated in secrecy using code names and frequently 
changing apartments where the abortions were performed the women 
said each pregnant woman met with a counselor sometimes several 
times to discuss the procedure and anything else she wanted 
despite the precautions however seven group members were 
arrested in 1972 the charges were dropped when the supreme court 
legalized abortion and for the most part jane members said there 
was a tacit agreement with police officers who sent their wives 
daughters and girlfriends to the group 
jane began as an underground abortion referral service it was 
named after a woman who preferred to leave the pseudonym jane 
instead of her real name when calling women about abortions 
by 1969 jane members realized that some of the abortionists they 
thought were doctors were in fact laymen so the women began 
attending abortions to learn the procedure ms howard said 
we said if they could do it we could too she said

israeli jets roared over a stronghold of 
shiite moslem forces in east lebanon today touching off false radio 
reports of a bombing raid 
the voice of lebanon the most popular christian radio station in 
east beirut and voice of the nation the main broadcaster in the 
moslem sector were among those to report a raid on lebanons bekaa 
valley 
however hezbollah issued a statement saying there was no such 
raid and the israeli army also denied launching an attack 
there hasnt been any air raid today said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
the spokesman said supersonic jets broke the sound barrier in 
reconnaissance runs over the village of janta and the ancient city 
of baalbek drawing heavy antiaircraft fire from hezbollahs 
positions 
the sonic booms apparently prompted the reports that the israelis 
bombed janta 43 miles southeast of beirut 
an israeli army spokeswoman who could not be identified under 
standing military rules described the report as disinformation 
an earlier hezbollah statement today said nine people were killed 
and 27 wounded in the israeli air attack sunday on a party base in 
south lebanons village of ain abusuar 
the statement said the victims included 15 students wounded when 
their school was hit in the attack 
police who had earlier put the toll at three guerrillas killed 
and nine wounded today confirmed hezbollahs toll 
ain abusuar is 40 miles southeast of beirut near the northern 
edge of israels selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
sundays attack was israels ninth on lebanon this year it 
apparently was in retaliation for an aug 9 suicide car bomb attack 
by a hezbollah activist in the security zone 
five israeli soldiers and an militiamen of the israelbacked 
south lebanon army were wounded 
hezbollah said the bombing was to avenge the kidnapping of a 
shiite moslem cleric sheik abdulkarim obeid by israeli commandos 
south lebanon on july 28 
israel justified the kidnapping by saying it wanted to trade 
obeid for two soldiers and an airman captured in lebanon in 1986 and 
believed held by hezbollah 
it has offered to swap obeid and other captive shiites for the 
three israelis and 16 western hostages including eight americans 
most of whom are believed held by groups linked to hezbollah the 
fundamentalists have rejected the offer 
longest held of the hostages in terry a anderson chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press who was taken nearly 4 
years ago 
israel carved out the security zone which is 610 miles deep 
when its withdrew most of its army from lebanon in mid1985

former us rep pat swindall was sentenced to one 
year in prison today for lying to a federal grand jury about a loan 
he negotiated with an undercover agent posing as a drugmoney 
launderer 
us district judge richard c freeman also imposed a 30000 
fine plus a 450 fee against swindall who was convicted on nine 
counts of perjury in june 
the prison term was 12 months on each count to run concurrently 
swindall a twoterm republican from atlantas eastern suburbs 
spoke to the judge for about half an hour in rambling remarks that 
frequently touched on issues in the trial but freeman told him 
several times that this was not the place to retry his case 
i stand before you in all humility he told the judge at one 
point but freeman interrupted him saying you dont know the 
meaning of humility mr swindall i thought you were beginning to 
learn it but im afraid youre not 
after the judge imposed the sentence swindall smiled and shook 
hands with his attorneys the judge said the congressman will remain 
free on his own recognizance pending an appeal of the conviction 
swindall later told reporters he thought the sentence was proper 
for someone guilty of perjury 
i have no complaints whatsoever the problem i have is not the 
length of the sentence but whether it should have been imposed at 
all he said 
when us attorney robert barr was asked if the government was 
satisfied with the relatively light sentence he replied its not 
really up to us to be satisfied we thought a more lengthy sentence 
was called for 
attorneys for both sides argued briefly before freeman announced 
his decision defense attorneys said federal sentencing guidelines 
called for 10 to 16 months in prison and urged the judge to impose 
even less than that 
the prosecution argued that the guidelines called for a sentence 
of 37 to 46 months but in imposing the 12month sentence freeman 
said he disagreed with the governments interpretation of the 
guidelines 
the judge recommended that swindall serve his sentence at a 
minimumsecurity federal prison camp in atlanta 
the courtroom was packed for todays 1hour hearing and an 
overflow of about a dozen people stood outside the closed door as 
prosecutors and defense attorneys presented their arguments on the 
sentence 
evidence in his trial showed that swindall repeatedly talked with 
the undercover agent and a political associate as he was seeking 
850000 to finish his luxurious stone mountain home even after a 
time when he told the grand jury he had walked away from the 
proposed deal 
the congressman who had been introduced to the money man by 
political associate charles lechasney ultimately accepted and 
endorsed a 150000 check before backing out of the deal 
the jury found swindall guilty of deliberately telling 18 lies to 
the grand jury 
swindall was largely unknown politically before he won the 
congressional seat in 1984 upsetting veteran democrat elliott 
levitas he was reelected in 1986 but lost in 1988 to democrat ben 
jones while under the cloud of his perjury indictment 
swindall sought a speedy trial before the 1988 election in hopes 
of getting an acquittal and preserving his career but the trial was 
aborted after swindall campaign mailings maintaining his innocence 
reached members of the jury 
earlier this year swindall had hoped to make a comeback against 
veteran democrat nunn in 1990

irans militia allies held funerals monday 
for the victims of the deadliest israeli raid of 1989 and buried 
them in the shiite moslem country of south lebanon 
hezbollah or party of god said nine people were killed and 27 
wounded in the sixminute air strike sunday on a hezbollah base in 
ain abusuar village it identified the dead as three guerrillas and 
six civilians and claimed 15 children were wounded by a rocket that 
hit a school 
police confirmed the hezbollah figures but said all nine dead 
were guerrillas they said the school building had been abandoned 
long ago and hezbollah used it as an ammunition dump 
in beirut the foreign ministry said it had instructed lebanons 
acting delegate to the united nations shawki shweiri to complain 
about the raid to the security council 
the death toll at ain abusuar was the highest of israels nine 
air raids in lebanon this year by police count eight people were 
killed and 67 wounded in the eight previous raids 
israeli jets broke the sound barrier in reconnaissance flights 
monday over the bekaa valley of east lebanon drawing antiaircraft 
fire from hezbollah positions in janta village and the ancient city 
of baalbek 
beirut radio stations mistook the sonic booms for bomb 
explosions but police hezbollah and the israeli military said the 
planes did not attack 
five bodies from the sunday raid were taken from hospital morgues 
in beirut and sent to south lebanon in a convoy of seven buses 20 
cars and two ambulances for burial in their hometowns 
hezbollah militiamen escorting the flagbedecked motorcade fired 
in the air in a traditional lebanese expression of mourning in 
sidon the convoy divided taking two victims to the southern port 
of tyre and three to nabatiyeh an inland market town 
about 100 mourners buried the other four in the ain abusuar 
cemetery clenching their fists and chanting death to israel 
and death to america armed militiamen prevented photographers 
from taking pictures and reporters were kept at a distance of 200 
yards 
its a security precaution for your own safety a hezbollah 
guerrilla said the israelis might be tempted to strike again if 
there is a big gathering 
ain abusuar is on the northern edge of israels security 
zone in south lebanon a border area 6 to 10 miles deep patrolled 
jointly by israeli soldiers and a predominantly christian surrogate 
militia called the south lebanon army 
sundays raid was an apparent response to a suicide truck bomb 
attack in the zone aug 9 that wounded five israeli soldiers and an 
allied militiaman 
hezbollah said the suicide bombing was vengeance for the israeli 
kidnapping july 28 of sheik abdulkarim obeid a shiite cleric 
associated with the group 
israel has offered to trade him for three captured israel 
soldiers and the 16 western hostages in lebanon who include eight 
americans hezbollah is believed to sponsor shiite groups that hold 
most of the hostages

shortages of funds are hampering city halls in 
dealing with child care teenage pregnancy and other problems of 
children the national league of cities said monday in appealing for 
longterm federal assistance 
releasing the results of a survey of 390 cities the league said 
the need for child care overshadows all other needs for children 
under 9 over that age the top concern of city officials shifts to 
such preventive issues as alcohol and drug abuse and teen pregnancy 
among cities with populations less than 300000 nearly half said 
money was their chief problem in dealing with these problems 
seventy percent of the cities of more than 300000 cited lack of 
funds 
this report is a sobering slap of reality that should awaken 
our national conscience said james p moran jr mayor of 
alexandria va and chairman of the leagues human development 
policy committee 
much has been documented about the condition and need for 
investment in the roads bridges and public facilities that are the 
physical infrastructure of our cities moran said but we dont 
have much solid information about our children and families they 
are the social infrastructure of our cities and towns 
moran said the new study provides a very solid profile to 
fill this gap in information and the needs portrayed in this 
report are both local and national 
we need help and we need it now the virginia mayor said 
we also need real commitments over the long run not the kind of 
federal aid that is here one year and gone the next 
cities are already taking steps to deal with the problems the 
report said 
in pico rivera calif recreation leaders escort children to a 
local park after school for activities until parents who pay 10 a 
week for the service can pick them up 
in jacksonville fla the city in cooperation with barnett bank 
and the state department of health and rehabilitiative services 
developed a program to train mothers who are on welfare to operate 
family day care homes 
in boise idaho the city funds 10 apartments and places 
homeless families with children in them for up to two months 
rentfree 
in west seneca ny the juvenile bureau has substance abuse 
prevention programs in 5th and 7th grades and presented these and 
other programs to 6600 students last year 
also cited in the report were the nations only cityoperated day 
care accreditation program in san antonio texas a teenage 
pregnancy education program in spokane wash and an advisory 
council made up of children and adults that advises the oakland 
calif city council on young peoples issues 
from coast to coast cities are working on these issues in 
innovative ways the report said they predict their involvement 
will increase over time except there is no money to support 
expansion 
the study entitled our future and our only hope covered 
278 cities with populations above 50000 and 112 smaller cities 
moran said the survey of larger cities covering 60 percent of 
all those in the nation was much broader than that for the smaller 
communities but nevertheless most of the findings run parallel 
for the smaller cities and can be regarded as generally good 
indicators 
among the 278 larger cities 63 percent ranked child care as the 
most pressing need for children up to 2 years old 80 percent for 
children ages 2 to 5 and 69 percent for children ages 5 to 9 
thirty percent indentified alchol and drugs as the most pressing 
issue for children ages 9 to 14 and 25 percent for ages 14 to 18 
in the 14 to 18 group teen pregnancy was next at 22 percent 
among cities of from 50000 to 100000 population 44 percent 
said lack of money was the chief barrier to greater city hall 
involvement thise rose to 50 percent in cities of 100000 to 
300000 and 70 percent in larger cities 
what it all comes down to in the end is not just will but also 
money said moran

two decades the media generalassociated press poll found and if 
world war does break out 54 percent feared its escalation into 
allout nuclear war

of world war ii could recur a holocaust on the order of nazi 
germanys murders of more than 6 million jews gassed starved or 
shot in concentration camps 
the poll conducted among 1163 adults asked do you think

german troops invaded poland the war soon consumed europe north 
africa and the far east claiming an estimated 50 million lives 
before it ended in 1945 
the united states joined the war in 1941 after the japanese who 
were allied with the germans attacked the us pacific fleet at 
pearl harbor hawaii poll respondents overwhelmingly expressed the 
view that the nazis would have conquered western europe had the 
united states not intervened 
in the pacific the united states hastened japans surrender in 
1945 by dropping atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki still the 
only time nuclear weapons have been detonated in a war 
six in 10 poll respondents said the hiroshima bombing in which 
death estimates run as high as 200000 was the right thing to do

another world war was greater among women than men 5344 percent 
and women were more inclined to fear nuclear escalation of a world 
war 6048 percent 
of the 49 percent who foresaw another world war 6 percent said

confining killer whales in tanks to perform 
generates jobs good times for the public and money for sea world 
but the practice is being questioned since a fight between two of 
the mammals ended in death 
some biologists say that killer whales in the open ocean dont 
fight and that putting them in tanks makes them neurotic and 
aggressive toward each other 
sea world denies captivity played a role in the deadly aug 21 
fight between two female whales the national marine fisheries 
service which regulates display of marine mammals agreed with sea 
world that the death was an accident 
killer whales also called orcas are a prime attraction at san 
diegos sea world and three sister sea worlds so the acts are 
important to the economic wellbeing of the parks and 4800 
yearround employees 
as part of harcourt brace jovanovich incs parks division the 
four sea worlds with two other amusement parks last year generated 
618 million in income on 338 million in revenue no income 
breakdowns for individual parks are available hbjs parks division 
is on the market for a reported 13 billion 
sea world officials defend the park as more than a moneymaking 
enterprise 
youngsters often come away with knowledge they didnt have 
before and a fascination that doesnt go away sea world 
veterinarian jim mcbain said they become advocates for the marine 
environment 
nonetheless captivity could have been a key factor in kandus 
death said ken balcomb a research biologist at the center for 
whale research in friday harbor wash 
im pretty sure virtually all animals in captivity develop 
neuroses he said you do have a stress factor its pretty much 
a caged mentality they have to live with 
the parks 11monthold baby shamu was orphaned when her mother 
kandu collided with a performing partner corky in a 
5milliongallon pool 
the 3ton kandus upper jaw was fractured and she bled to death 
before thousands of spectators it was the first killer whale to die 
in a fight in the parks 25year history 
corky weighing 8000 pounds is believed to be about 25 years 
old 
about 30 members of the group friends of whales picketed sea 
world on saturday protesting the confinement of killer whales one 
protester held up a sign reading is it fun to see animals die 
in captivity 
sea world officials have said that most of the public reaction 
since kandus death has been sympathetic and favorable 
mcbain said 14yearold kandus actions were normal for killer 
whales which are not known to have ever killed humans but are 
skillful efficient hunters they eat mostly fish or seals but also 
attack other whale species 
mcbain said they butt chase and nip each other while 
establishing and maintaining social hierarchies 
but balcomb who has monitored orcas off san juan island wash 
for 13 years said such whale rivalries are nonexistent at sea 
in the wild they dont solve their problems aggressively 
balcomb said its not normal killer whales travel in kinship 
groups or clans and they dont have those aggressive interactions 
if other whales come along from a different group they just avoid 
each other obviously you cant do that in a tank 
mcbain acknowledged that past pools were too small and probably 
contributed to earlier failed breeding efforts and premature deaths 
of killer whales first captured for display in the mid1960s shamu 
stadium in san diego built in 1987 more than quadrupled the killer 
whales quarters 
also in 1987 trainers were pulled from the water for several 
months after a series of accidents in which whales injured trainers 
trainers were allowed to return to the water last year under 
stricter safety guidelines 
just how long killer whales live at sea and how that compares to 
captive orcas remain an area of debate some biologists believe a 
female whale lives up to 80 years in the wild while the maximum for 
a male is about 50 
in captivity killer whales on average have died within eight 
years primarily because of infection according to balcomb

about 5000 farmers from the 
breadbasket province of vojvodina on monday rallied in front of the 
federal parliament to demand higher selling prices for their produce 
the farmers are angry about the governments attempts to control 
runaway inflation by forcing food prices down 
at mondays rally in a driving rain farmers demanded that 
statecontrolled food prices cover the cost of production 
it is cows which should be milked not peasants said one 
sign after paying taxes the peasant has only his underpants 
read another 
farmers in yugoslavias largest republic of serbia of which 
vojvodina is a part objected to a recent government decision to 
flood the market with cheap flour wheat sugar and other foods from 
federal stockpiles to try to halt constant price rises on those 
items 
agriculture minister stevo mirjanic said aug 9 that past 
governments were to blame for the poor state of yugoslav 
agriculture and he promised higher guaranteed prices for farm 
products the tanjug news agency said the government planned to 
review agricultural problems oct 5 
the protest had been intended to draw farmers from all over 
yugoslavia but the rally fell victim to the divisive disputes among 
the countrys six constituent republics farmers from croatia and 
slovenia pulled out because they saw the protest as a serbian move 
to rattle the federal government of ante markovic a croat under 
fierce attack from serbian politicians

aircraft designer jack northrops dream for more 
than three decades was a jet that would combine the flying wing 
design with stealth technology making it virtually impossible 
for enemy radar to detect the b2 stealth bomber flew its maiden 
voyage this summer and the pending decision on whether to begin 
fullscale production will help determine the face of american air 
power into the next century 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jack northrop the aircraft designer and 
founder of the california company bearing his name was obsessed 
with the flying wing but for more than three decades the air force 
shunned it as a flight of fancy 
then in the end it embraced northrops dream to build the b2 
stealth bomber the worlds most expensive airplane at current 
estimates of 530 million apiece 
now congress must decide whether the united states can afford to 
build a plane the military says it cant afford to do without 
northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of the 
flying wing chiefly its reduced liklihood of being detected by 
radar as a side benefit a nice selling point to the military for 
what he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane a 
flying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventional 
airplane of the same weight it therefore is more efficient meaning 
it requires less power and less fuel and can carry a greater 
payload 
any reasonable assumptions northrop said in 1947 will 
always result in advantage to the allwing configuration of such 
magnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations may 
be involved in its development 
in 1981 as the headlines focused on ronald reagans resurrection 
of the b1 program canceled by jimmy carter jack northrop then 
retired and near death was given a special security clearance so 
pentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34 
years earlier the air force had finally contracted with the company 
bearing his name to build a flying wing as the nations flagship 
strategic bomber 
long before the public got its first glimpse of the b2 air 
force chief of staff larry welch declared that the aerodynamic 
design is markedly more efficient than that of its 
predecessors the b2 he continued requires far fewer tankers 
and carries a very healthy bomb load it would be a superb 
bomber even if it werent stealthy 
aside from military considerations some aviation buffs are 
rooting for full development and production of the b2 because of 
its potential spinoffs for commercial flight according to tim 
wooldridge of the national air and space museum airlines and air 
transport companies have long flirted with the notion of an allwing 
design for spanloaders that could fly tremendous distances 
carrying huge weights oil for example but nobodys willing to 
bet the billions of dollars it would cost for feasibility 
research he notes what airline would bet that kind of money 
to some in congress the billions that will be needed to build a 
fleet of b2s look like a questionable bet as well 
by current estimates each one will cost about 530 million put 
another way a single b2 will cost 100 million more than torontos 
spectacular skydome the worlds newest and fanciest sports stadium 
replete with hotel restaurants and retractable roof the extra 100 
million would buy a major league baseball team 
the department of defense has produced a b2 program that wont 
fly financially said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee members of congress are balking at 
spending 41 billion this year for the strategic defense 
initiative it is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much 
per year on a plane 
this was the worst kind of public policy said rep john r 
kasich rohio to keep something secret all this time and drive 
the cost up to 22 billion to date will never be tolerated again 
the air force rejects such criticism suggesting that some 
members of congress are being coy with their constituents now that 
the cost estimates are public after eight years of topsecret 
development the charge that someone was hiding anything from the 
congress is ludicrous said larry welch the air force chief of 
staff there were dozens and dozens of people in the congress who 
were fully aware of all the details 
but rep myke synar dokla said i attended classified 
briefings by the air force and by northrop which frankly left a lot 
to be desired they were not straightforward they were not candid 
and in many ways they were very confusing 
synar charged that northrop had miserably failed to manage this 
program former pentagon procurement chief robert b costello 
agreed saying he had serious and grave concerns about 
northrops management and that the firms quality controls were 
terrible 
northrops chairman thomas v jones vigorously defended the 
company and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders saying the 
program had produced an extraordinary new aircraft system and 
unprecedented technical successes 
the nations first b2 bomber made its public debut this summer 
18 months later than scheduled it taxied slowly from its hanger at 
northrops plant in palmdale calif and turned onto runway 04 the 
morning of july 17 chief northrop test pilot bruce j hinds who 
hadnt been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for the 
honor ran up the planes four general electric engines and released 
the brakes at 936 am edt twentythree seconds later the b2 was 
airborne 
the aircraft was very stable rock stable hinds reported 
later its going to be a very easy airplane to fly 
but not to sell before the august congressional recess the 
house limited b2 production to two planes next year and two the 
year after that half what the bush administration wants it also 
ordered the pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper production 
program the senate was kinder it trimmed only 300 million from 
the 47 billion sought by the president for the b2 next year a 
compromise bill may be crafted next month 
meanwhile the air force has scrambled to redefine the b2s 
mission and capability originally conceived as a purely strategic 
bomber to seek out and destroy the soviet unions mobile missiles in 
a nuclear war it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfire 
weapon as well 
gen bernard p randolph head of the air force systems command 
argues that the b2 would have been ideal had it been available 
for the 1986 us raid on libya just three to four b2s could 
have done the job directly from stateside bases randolph said 
thats a remarkable switch in air force thinking when the raid 
was planned by a young marine lieutenant colonel named oliver north 
he inquired about having the already operational f117a stealth 
fighterbomber do the job according to bill sweetman a noted 
aviation writer and author of stealth bomber 
the air force turned north down cold saying the plane was too 
valuable to risk on such a venture 
the question arises if that is true of the f117 thought to 
cost about 100 million per plane why wouldnt it be true of the 
b2 at more than half a billion dollars

president hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
appeared monday to have won parliamentary approval for foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati his main ally but members criticized 
three other cabinet nominees 
the official islamic republic news agency said 22 deputies spoke 
at mondays session the second day of debate on the cabinet and at 
least eight more were to address the 270seat majlis before 
individual votes tuesday on the nominees 
rafsanjani 55 is known as a pragmatist and seeks renewed ties 
with the west to ensure a flow of technology and money needed to 
rebuild the economy after eight years of war with iraq he also 
wants to encourage private investment 
velayati foreign minister since 1981 and a staunch ally of 
rafsanjani is expected to steer iran more toward the west 
there had been fears the majlis would reject velayati because 
rafsanjani failed to comply with a petition from 138 members asking 
that he keep his main radical opponent interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi in the cabinet 
left off the cabinet list with mohtashemi were his two allies 
outgoing prime minister hussein musavi and intelligence minister 
mohammad reyshehri the new constitution made the presidency more 
powerful and abolished the post of prime minister 
the news agency said mondays speakers supported velayati 
because of the backing he had received from the late imam 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 a decade after leading 
the islamic revolution to power 
support for velayati was accompanied by criticism of his ministry 
for employing iranian graduates from abroad who lack a combatant 
and revolutionary record irna said 
mohammad ali najafi a 38yearold massachusetts institute of 
technology graduate chosen as education minister appeared to be the 
least popular of rafsanjanis candidates possibly because of his 
western background 
irna said most of those who spoke monday urged the rejection of 
najafi who has been education minister for a year and also held the 
higher education portfolio in previous governments 
public criticism of the education system has increased many 
officials believe standards have dropped because of lack of funds to 
open new schools and the flight of foreigneducated technocrats and 
teachers after the revolution 
rafsanjani had predicted hardliners in the majlis would veto his 
foreigneducated candidates 
in a speech opening the debate sunday the new president said 
studying at american universities was not and is not a negative 
point many iranians who studied abroad have provided valuable 
services to this country 
abdallah nouri the candidate to succeed mohtashemi as interior 
minister was praised monday as a sharp witty planner but 
speakers criticized ali fallahiyan chosen to replace the radical 
reyshehri as intelligence minister irna reported 
it quoted ibrahim asgharzadeh a tehran member as saying 
fallahiyan who was reyshehris deputy lacked the necessary 
planning ability to take over the job 
abdolhussein vahaji nominated to move up from deputy commerce 
minister to the top job was blamed for many of the ministrys 
current problems the agency said 
the department has been without a minister for more than a year 
because the majlis has failed to approve at least two previous 
candidates 
deputies said vahaji displayed weak management abilities as 
deputy commerce minister and expressed doubt whether he could 
change things for the better irna said 
rafsanjani was elected president july 28 and given unprecedented 
executive powers in constitutional reforms approved in a referendum 
the same day

a larger harvest has taken the edge off the 
booming us oats market that has attracted imports from canada 
sweden and other foreign suppliers an agriculture department report 
said monday 
in the 198889 marketing year that ended may 31 us oats 
imports rose to about 68 million bushels or nearly 1 million metric 
tons a 50 percent increase from 198788 
the united states has been the worlds largest importer of oats 
since 198384 including large increases the last two or three years 
as consumers discovered the grains health benefits 
research has linked the fiber content of oats with lower serum 
cholesterol levels and health concerns have buoyed the demand for 
oat food products the report said 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 689 bushels 
of oats a bushel of oats weights 32 pounds little more than half 
that of wheat 
oats imports in 198990 are forecast to settle back to around 50 
million bushels or about 725000 tons but the united states is 
expected to remain as the dominant buyer in the world market the 
report said 
us production this year is expected to rise 74 percent from the 
droughtstricken 1988 harvest to 381 million bushels or about 553 
million tons according to usda forecasts 
the usda says oats prices nationally may average in the range of 
155 to 195 per bushel in 198990 compared with 261 estimated 
for 198889

voyager 2 found neptunes moon triton to 
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward 
and where giant craters once overflowed with oceansize floods of 
frozen lava scientists believe 
if scientists are correct in their interpretation of voyagers 
photographs triton is only the third object in the universe where 
active volcanoes have been identified 
its one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the 
solar system says charles kohlhase voyager spacecraft mission 
design manager at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
the latest data returned by voyagers ultraviolet light sensor 
revealed auroras somewhat like earths northern and southern 
lights in several places in neptunes skies and over much of the 
day side of triton roger yelle of the university of arizona said 
today 
the auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are 
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting 
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light and they occur at odd 
places because of neptunes tilted magnetic field yelle said when 
the particles are pulled toward earths poles along magnetic field 
lines they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble 
auroras 
voyager today snapped and sent back to earth beautiful 
photographs showing the sunlit crescent edges of neptune and triton 
as they were backlighted by the sun nasa expects to release prints 
of the photo no earlier than tuesday 
triton apparently has three types of volcanic activity 
scientists announced two of them friday huge inactive 
cratershaped volcanoes called calderas filled with lava made of 
ice instead of molten rock and long faultline valleys filled with 
oozing ice a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube 
slit with a razor blade 
tritons biggest surprise came sunday when us geological 
survey geologist laurence soderblom announced that a third kind of 
volcanic activity apparently had been identified the latest 
recorded photographs sent by voyager reveal what look like active 
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively spewing nitrogen ice particles 
and gas 12 to 20 miles high 
the stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel 
said university of arizona planetary scientist bradford smith 
leader of voyagers photographic imaging team 
soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be 
a crazy idea but other scientists expressed their support 
it sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis said voyager 
project scientist edward stone 
voyager has discovered six moons orbiting neptune in addition to 
triton and nereid which were discovered from earth it also has 
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet including two that 
are broad bands of dust 
by 9 pm pdt tonight voyager will be 276 billion miles from 
earth and 365 million miles from neptune speeding toward 
interstellar space at 37600 mph 
as the craft sped toward the illdefined boundary of the solar 
system about 1500 mission scientists engineers and their families 
celebrated at a bash that featured rock n roll legend chuck berry 
singing go voyager go a slightly modified version of his 
classic johnny b goode 
a recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the 
cultural and historical items aboard aboard voyager 
the spacecraft made its closest approach to neptune on thursday 
night when it skimmed about 3000 miles over the planets north pole 
cloudtops early friday it zoomed about 24000 miles past triton 
since then it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed 
tritons volcanic activity 
soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to 
sulfurspewing volcanoes on jupiters moon io but he said the 
volcanoes on triton are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground 
pools rises to the surface where reduced pressure means its got 
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas 
i believe they are active soderblom said theres 10 or 20 
or 30 lots 
based on darkcolored plumeshaped deposits that stretch up to 
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes soderblom estimated the 
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour perhaps 
faster 
smith said the deposits apparently contain radiationdarkened 
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the 
blast 
earths volcanoes spew molten rock and ios erupts sulfur venus 
also may have active volcanoes but none has been spotted on the 
cloudshrouded planet 
on sunday nasa also revealed more surprises about tritons 
apparently inactive calderalike volcanoes which measure up to 
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what smith described as flows 
of viscous ice possibly water ice that gushes up from below 
the new photos show tritons icelava lakes can come up and 
overflow smith said you see that happen in hawaii all the 
time when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop kilauea 
volcano 
so eruptions from tritons calderas once produced a sea of 
icelike lava in repeated eruptions resulting in massive 
oceanicscale flooding soderblom said 
a volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100 
years smith said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice 
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located 
on tritons huge south polar ice cap 
a year on neptune and triton lasts about 165 earth years so if 
the ice cap had gone through a summer evidence of volcanic deposits 
would have been erased as the ice cap receded he added

ethnic rivalry has voters charged up to go to the 
polls tuesday in a special election for the late claude peppers 
us house seat 
hispanics appear to be rallying around gop state sen ileana 
roslehtinen who stands to become the first cubanamerican in 
congress many nonlatin whites and blacks seem to favor gerald 
richman a brooklynborn jewish attorney 
if those patterns hold up recent polls indicate a photofinish 
dade county elections supervisor david leahy on monday predicted 
up to a 45 percent turnout unusually high for a special election 
there has been a tremendous amount of media exposure and we 
think both camps are getting a lot more people out to vote he 
said 
ms roslehtinen whose name is pronounced illeeahnah 
rosslayttihnen campaigned monday with us sen connie mack 
among senior citizens on miami beach richman campaigned across 
miami beach and with black ministers in miami 
polls last week indicated the two were neckandneck and that 
most voters would put heritage ahead of partisanship when they 
choose between ms roslehtinen and richman who has come under fire 
for saying hes running for an american seat 
there are more than 100000 registered democrats in the district 
pepper held 27 years for the democrats until his death may 30 at age 
88 while there are 71000 republicans and 14000 independents 
blacks make up 19 percent of the voters and hispanics more than 40 
percent with the rest nonlatin whites 
cubanamericans are expected to turn out in high numbers for ms 
roslehtinen 37 
richman a 48yearold former florida bar association president 
hoped for strong turnout from the traditional coalition of jewish 
retirees and black democrats the coalitions power has been eroded 
by the latin influx into south florida 
after richman in his first try for office trounced cubanborn 
former city commissioner rosario kennedy in the aug 15 democratic 
runoff ms roslehtinen accused him of running a bigoted campaign 
and refused to make appearances with him 
ms kennedy refused to endorse richman and the dade fair 
campaign practices committee charged that his american seat 
statement could be ethnically divisive 
while richman said his statement meant he wants to unify the 
community ms roslehtinen highlighted the committees criticism in 
a tv commercial 
in the campaigns final weekend a spanishlanguage flier went 
out to hispanics it read we too are americans no we werent 
born in brooklyn new york like him no we dont speak english the 
same way he does 
jeff eller spokesman for richman called the flier bald 
hypocrisy and the fair campaign practices committee called ms 
roslehtinen to task sunday saying the brochure serves only to 
further polarize dade county voters 
ms roslehtinen said the state gop put out the flier but she 
didnt see anything wrong with it 
ive said it in english and in spanish im just as american 
as my opponent she said

the korean war may have been fought to contain 
communist aggression but the planners of a memorial for the 
conflicts veterans are more concerned about acts by vandals 
pigeons and mother nature 
it seems the planned location is a little remote and it may be 
vulnerable to flooding 
its going to be way out there by itself and the potential for 
vandalism is pretty high said air force lt col mark coon of the 
american battle monuments commission 
its very tempting to go up and rub the statues and touch and 
maybe break off a finger or two one lady even wrote about pigeons 
sitting on them or dropping on them coon said 
think building a monument is easy 
organizers of the 6 million project won the governments 
blessing in 1986 for a spot on the mall near the tidal basin and 
directly across the reflecting pool from the vietnam veterans 
memorial 
backers of the project include president bush and advice 
columnist abigail van buren 
the design submitted by pennsylvania state university 
architects was supposed to be a secret until bush presided over 
the unveiling as a military band played patriotic songs at a white 
house ceremony on flag day last june 
but in typical washington fashion word leaked out beforehand 
that the architects contemplated statues of 38 soldiers marching 
unevenly down a treelined path toward an american flag 
while the design was praised by veterans groups the planners 
face some vexing problems 
this summer the washington post published a map showing how much 
of the mall would be under water when the region gets the type of 
flooding that is expected to occur every 50 years the korean 
memorial site was in a prime flooding spot 
somebody someday will have to be concerned about that coon 
said 
the four penn state architects are already concerned about it 
although lately their efforts have focused more on getting their 
design approved by a battery of planning and parks commissions 
the designers were picked by a jury of korean war veterans from 
among 1019 entrants and they are not about to let their work be 
ruined by water or vandals 
the flood forecast represents a geotechnic problem that has to 
be addressed were talking to engineers said don leon an 
associate architecture professor who is one of the designers 
as for vandalism you address those problems by understanding 
the type of materials to be used leon said 
the group is considering making the statues out of granite 
the commission has raised 35 million of the 6 million it 
estimates the memorial will cost the money must be on hand by the 
time the projects legislative authority expires in october 1991 or 
the collected funds are supposed to be returned according to coon 
thats a nightmare thinking about returning all the money 
somebody would come through before that im sure coon said 
he said an informational flyer about the memorial was sent 
recently to 12 million recipients of veterans administration 
checks and that several dear abby advice columns about the 
project had also helped generate interest 
the designers dont expect the memorial to stir the controversy 
that surrounded the vietnam memorial which some veterans criticized 
as unheroic 
the vietnam memorial is a vshaped wall bearing the names of 
those killed in the war a statue of three battleweary soldiers 
stands nearby as a concession to the critics 
coon said some people have questioned why the names of korean war 
veterans will not also appear on a wall at the new site 
they were told that simply wasnt the plan

a student received nine years in prison for 
allegedly spreading rumors to the voice of america a newspaper said 
monday in the first reported sentencing of a student participant in 
the spring democracy movement 
also on monday former classmates of fugitive student leader 
wuer kaixi resumed classes at beijing normal university with one 
week of required political study but students said they were just 
going through the motions 
zhang weiping 25 was sentenced saturday by the hangzhou 
intermediate peoples court for spreading counterrevolutionary 
propaganda and instigating criminal acts according to china youth 
news 
zhang a senior at zhejiang fine arts institute in the eastern 
city of hangzhou admitted he called the us governmentfunded 
radio station and that he drew eight cartoons vilifying communist 
party and government leaders but he would not acknowledge his acts 
were counterrevolutionary the daily said 
according to the court on june 6 two days after the bloody 
military crackdown of the student movement in beijing zhang called 
voa and said students in hangzhou had forced authorities to fly the 
chinese flag at half staff to mourn the dead in beijing 
it said zhang sent a tape of the voa broadcast of his report to 
his university to be played on the schools public address system 
and it created a very bad political influence 
voa which has a large audience in china has been criticized in 
the official media since the crackdown for rumormongering in 
its reports and one of its correspondents was expelled chinese say 
they still regard it as more reliable than their governmentrun 
media 
authorities have arrested thousands of workers and students who 
took part in the prodemocracy movement and dozens of workers have 
been sentenced to long prison terms for rioting and causing social 
disturbances at least 12 nonstudents have been executed for 
destroying public property and attacking police 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were killed in the june 
34 crackdown of the prodemocracy movement which called for an end 
to official corruption freedom of the press and a dialogue with 
government leaders 
the government has announced the arrests of eight of the 21 
student leaders on a nationwide wanted list but so far none has 
been brought to public trial two students on the list wuer and 
li lu fled abroad but chinese sources say all of the remaining 19 
have been arrested 
officials have refused to comment on such reports including a 
hong kong tv report over the weekend that the fourth student on the 
list chai ling was arrested in beijing 
college students are returning to their campuses but the 
atmosphere is very different from the spring 
students at beijing normal university where wuer was a freshman 
last year said they spent their first day of class monday watching 
government videotapes of what is officially called a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the tapes which appeared on tv this summer glorify the 
soldiers who are said to have exercised utmost patience and 
restraint when faced with hooligans pitching stones and bottles 
and setting tanks on fire 
we all know what really happened though said a sophomore 
from jiangsu province as he walked to an afternoon political 
discussion session he said he and his classmates would say whatever 
was expected of them but made it clear no one believed any of it 
although none of the students spoke of renewing the protests 
they were keenly interested in the fate of the movements leaders 
many asked what is wuer kaixi doing now and where are 
the other escaped leaders living wuer has been accepted to study 
at harvard university but many others appear not to have settled 
anywhere yet 
many also asked about chai ling one of only two women on the 
mostwanted list of 21 student leaders she was at the forefront of 
the students weeklong hunger strike in may and reportedly was one 
of the last to leave tiananmen square on the night of the army 
attack 
groups of students walking past the student canteen which was 
plastered with posters this spring barely glanced at its brick 
walls 
they also ignored a large red banner hung across the campus main 
road exhorting students to continue the struggle against bourgeois 
liberalism to the very end 
the tv news monday showed more than 10000 students from 15 
schools in shenyang in northeastern china hacking at overgrown 
weeds sunday the voluntary labor was organized by the 
provincial government and is part of the renewed emphasis on molding 
a correct proletarian attitude 
there are almost no students at beijing universitys campus a 
hotbed of student activism this spring the start of classes has 
been delayed until oct 14 partly in an attempt to prevent any 
student protests on the oct 1 anniversary of 40 years of communist 
rule in china

a prosecutor said today that ptl founder 
jim bakker lied to his followers to cheat them out of their money 
but defense lawyers said bakker had a creative religious genius 
and stands unfairly accused 
the motive was dollars prosecutor jerry miller told jurors 
in opening statements at bakkers federal court trial the motive 
was opulence the motive was a lavish lifestyle most of you wont be 
able to identify with 
as the trial opened the leadoff prosecution witness was former 
bakker aide david taggart who testified that bakker was a handson 
administrator who worked on the ministry fundraising programs even 
on vacation 
taggart who was convicted last month of committing tax evasion 
during the time he was bakkers personal assistant said bakker was 
involved in much of the ministrys promotional activities including 
fundraising letters and brochures 
taggart and his brother james who was ptls interior decorator 
and was also convicted of tax evasion each face 25 years in prison 
and 1 million in fines at a sept 8 sentencing david taggart said 
he testified today because i thought it might have some impact on 
my sentencing in the future 
bakker is being tried on 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
prosecutors say he and other executives of the ptl television 
ministry diverted for their own benefit at least 4 million of the 
158 million they raised for lifetime partnerships at the 
ministrys resort hotels 
in his 40minute presentation to the jury miller said bakker 
used untruth and halftruth to get people to send money for the 
partnerships in ptl 
this case is about cheating people out of their money tricking 
people out of their money by the use of the mails telephone and 
television miller said 
defense lawyer george t davis spoke an hour and 15 minutes 
saying there was no evidence that bakker sold anything or had any 
criminal intent to defraud people 
we will prove that there was not a sale of one single 
membership or lifetime partnership davis said what happened 
was gifts or donations this was a church this was an outreach 
program 
whether you believe jim bakker was divinely inspired or not he 
had a divine inspiration and that was the heritage foundation it 
was the product of a creative religious genius that was jim 
bakkers contribution to the christian faith he believed in 
while bakker was in court his wife tammy carried on their 
television broadcast from orlando fla where the bakkers moved 
after their ptl empire collapsed 
if there was any way i could be there i would be there but we 
have a program to keep on the air mrs bakker said adding that 
her son jamie charles started school today i want jim to have 
something to come back to 
if convicted of all 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy bakker 
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined 5 million 
i was a pastor and a businessman i was not said bakker in 
testimony during a lawsuit last summer bakker who says he is 
innocent and his attorney davis have declined to discuss their 
defense strategy 
bakker 49 resigned from ptl in march 1987 after revelations 
about his sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn and a 
265000 payoff to buy her silence three months after bakker 
resigned ptl was put under bankruptcy protection 
outside the courthouse today about 50 journalists and cameramen 
waited hoping to get one of the two rows of seats reserved for news 
media other journalists signed up for one of the 28 spectator seats 
in the small courtroom 
two men from columbia sc carried picket signs denouncing 
bakker and several other television evangelists 
one of the pickets bob eckhardt said he and david hallman 
didnt represent a specific denomination we just want people to 
know god isnt playing games anybody who reads the bible knew that 
ptl wasnt right eckhardt said 
in a sentencing hearing for former ptl vice president richard 
dortch last week prosecutors gave a glimpse at their case against 
bakker 
dortch bakkers top assistant from 1984 to 1987 pleaded guilty 
to four fraud and conspiracy charges in a bargain that requires him 
to testify against bakker he was sentenced to eight years in prison 
and fined 200000 
at dortchs sentencing hearing prosecutors set up large charts 
showing ptl raised 158 million between 1984 and 1987 through 
partnerships that promised supporters who gave 1000 three nights 
lodging per year for life in hotels being constructed at heritage 
usa ptls expansive retreat and park near here 
money was diverted to support the bakkers extravagant lifestyle 
the prosecutors said during those years bakker and his wife 
tammy drew 35 million in bonuses plus other perks and other 
funds were used for daytoday operations at ptl prosecutors said 
the government contended that nearly half of the money raised 
through lifetime partnerships 742 million was for the towers 
hotel project but only 114 million was actually spent on the 
unfinished 20floor hotel 
in another lifetime partnership plan the 1100 club 492000 
people were offered the chance to buy partnerships and take their 
choice of brand new lodgings at farmland usa 
according to the charts 7783 people bought partnerships with 
donations of 1100 each but only one bunkhouse with 16 rooms 
was built only eight of those rooms were designated for lifetime 
partners 
tapes of ptls television program which were reviewed by a grand 
jury and will be shown to bakkers jury show bakker and dortch 
promising that there was a limit of 30000 lifetime partnerships in 
the towers project 
but government auditors said 68755 partnerships were sold 
mr bakker and mr dortch later told viewers of their 
television show that 900 additional partnerships had opened up 
because of people who had not made good on their pledges justice 
department prosecutor deborah smith told us district judge robert 
potter on thursday 
she said that sales pitch was an example of the calculated 
attempts by bakker and dortch to mislead their viewers and the ptl 
board about the ministrys financial condition 
mr dortch presented himself as a religious leader and man of 
god while lying to them to induce them to send in their money she 
said

the respected roman catholic periodical 30 giorni 30 
days said monday it would cease publication indefinitely to protest 
criticism of a group close to the monthly magazine by the vaticans 
official newspaper 
another magazine said it would join the protest by issuing its 
next edition blank 
the vaticans losservatore romano on monday criticized a recent 
convention held by the conservative italian catholic group 
communione e liberazione communion and liberation 
the newspaper said the convention barely dealt with religious 
subjects or new ideas and instead focused on particular political 
issues it attacked the group for criticizing the decision of the 
italian president francesco cossiga to dissolve romes government 
cossiga made the decision after mayor pietro giubilo resigned in 
the wake of allegations of a conflict of interest in the awarding of 
contracts for school lunches giubilo who denied blame in the 
scandal was a supporter of communione e liberazione 
marco bucarelli president of the board of directors of 30 
giorni said the magazine was ceasing publication indefinitely as a 
protest 
such a grave decision is motivated by the attempt mounted by 
ideologicalpolitical factions to limit the freedom of expression 
and action of catholic lay people he said 
the magazines staff also issued a statement in support of the 
publishers decision 
for some time and without any restraint the directors of the 
vatican daily have taken advantage of the moral authority of the 
holy see for ideologicalpolitical maneuvers that apart from 
breaking with the glorious tradition of the paper put serious 
limitations on the freedom of opinion of the faithful the 
statement said 
30 giorni said the halt of publication applied to its italian 
french american spanish and brazilian editions 
il sabato a weekly magazine that also is close to communione e 
liberazione said its edition due out thursday would be blank to 
protest the osservatore romano article

a rash of slayings suicides and escapes 
at the state penitentiary has led to the resignation of the warden 
and once again focused negative attention on the louisiana prison 
system 
earlier this year legislators spoke optimistically of ending 
federal intervention in the prisons begun in 1975 as a result of a 
lawsuit that claimed inmates were living in squalor but the 
possibility of renewed state control seems remote now 
instead us district judge frank polozola has demanded 
stepbystep plans to move convicts out of parish jails in 
addition he has dressed down prison officials who had criticized 
his actions 
believe me i truly dont want to be warden at any 
institution polozola said at the hearing i really didnt want 
to go to law school to be a warden 
the state penitentiary at angola has been racked by allegations 
of drug dealing lax security and low employee morale 
the maximum security prison houses 4800 inmates on its 
18000acre site along the mississippi because of court rulings 
the number of inmates is about the prisons intended capacity 
in the 1950s when inmates were forced to work long hours in the 
fields and housed in substandard cells angola was declared the 
worst prison in america by one study conditions there contributed 
to the 1971 lawsuit that led to the federal takeover 
a 500inmate cellblock at angola was built several years ago but 
hasnt opened because the state lacks funds to pay more guards 
as a result of the manpower shortage at angola and other 
louisiana prisons 4000 of the 16000 inmates the state is 
responsible for are being held by sheriffs in parish jails 
officials in orleans and jefferson parishes have been forced to 
release some accused criminals before trial because of a lack of 
space 
gov buddy roemer recently authorized 5 million to 8 million to 
open the addition at angola and to step up construction of a new 
prison in winn parish polozola unmoved by the states continuing 
budget squeeze has criticized the legislature for not doing enough 
to head off the problem 
if the state cant do it i will thats not a threat thats a 
promise polozola said 
on june 21 polozola declared a state of emergency following four 
fatal stabbings four suicides and 11 escapes over 14 months at 
angola and appointed former warden ross maggio to oversee a special 
investigation 
maggios aug 21 report said angola was understaffed that guards 
were not properly trained to use firearms and that prison officials 
were not searching visitors or guards for drugs he accused the 
administration of lax management saying it had not even filed 
criminal charges against seven recaptured escapees 
two days later roemer asked warden hilton butler to retire 
larry smith was appointed interim warden becoming the 
penitentiarys first black warden 
butler a career corrections employee who ran the prison for 2 
years has said the accusations against him were exaggerated and 
that conditions at the prison were similar under maggio his 
predecessor 
roemer also ordered state police to reopen an investigation that 
stemmed from a scandal involving former pardon board chairman howard 
marsellus jr 
marsellus who served under former gov edwin edwards was 
convicted of accepting money for pardon recommendations

a general strike called by sinhalese 
radicals brought nearly all businesses and transportation to a halt 
in most of sri lanka on monday 
despite government efforts to keep everything open on the first 
day of the weeklong strike witnesses said almost all shops hotels 
offices and businesses had closed by evening in colombo and most of 
southern and central sri lanka witnesses said those areas make up 
the heartland of sri lankas majority sinhalese community 
you cannot even get a cup of tea today said dharmasena 
attygalle a shipping clerk who walked to work in colombo but found 
his office closed 
the radicals are fighting the sinhalesedominated government 
because they believe it has granted too many concessions to ethnic 
tamil rebels and has not done enough to force a pullout of indian 
peacekeeping troops 
heavily armed troops patrolled colombo in trucks with 
loudspeakers urging shop owners to open their businesses soldiers 
broke locks on some shop doors witnesses said 
however owners forced to open simply closed again when troops 
left witnesses said 
armed troops escorted private and staterun buses but the main 
roads were empty by evening 
the strike was the latest in the series of work stoppages called 
by the peoples liberation front in recent weeks as part of its 
violent 2yearold antigovernment campaign that has claimed at 
least 5000 lives 
the ultranationlist radicals are protesting what they view as 
genocide by the military the radicals say the military armed with 
emergency laws has killed hundreds of front members 
opposition parties and human rights groups also accuse the 
military and progovernment vigilante groups of killing civilians 
suspected to be front sympathizers during a recent crackdown ordered 
by president ranasinghe premadasa the government denies the charge 
the front also protests the presence of indian peacekeeping 
troops in the northeast deployed two years ago to help end an 
ethnic tamil rebellion for an independent nation the radicals say 
the indian presence compromises the countrys independence 
radical posters on buildings monday asked soldiers and policemen 
to resign or face death 
other posters believed to have been created by progovernment 
groups warned sinhalese radicals their families would meet the same 
fate 
an official of the government information department who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said all major newspaper groups have 
indicated they will not publish tuesdays editions the official 
said few staff members arrived for work monday 
the latest report of violence in the radicals campaign came 
sunday when sinhalese militants shot to death a soldiers parents 
brother and sister at their home near colombo military officials 
said 
the front launched its antigovernment campaign soon after the 
first indian troops arrived on june 30 1987 to enforce an 
indiabrokered peace plan to end the tamil insurgency 
the peace plan which promised limited tamil autonomy fell apart 
when the largest tamil rebel group began attacking indian soldiers 
at least 11000 people including about 1000 indian soldiers 
have been killed in the 6yearold rebel war 
a spokesman for the indian embassy said monday that indian troops 
killed nine tamil rebels since sunday in the north and east three 
soldiers also died in the battles the spokesman said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people say they suffer discrimination from the sinhalese majority 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population

new prime minister toshiki kaifu hopes to build warm 
ties during his a trip to the united states this week and he will 
stress the need for both to do more to reduce their trade imbalance 
officials said monday 
japanese prime ministers customarily visit washington shortly 
after taking office to establish good working relations but kaifu 
also hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomatic 
credentials and revitalize his governments foreign policy the 
officials said 
kaifu who on aug 9 became japans third prime minister in less 
than three months is a former education minister with little 
experience in foreign affairs his liberal democratic party which 
pursues conservative policies has been rocked by a series of money 
and sex scandals that have put diplomatic initiatives on hold 
the 58yearold prime minister leaves wednesday for washington 
and will later visit mexico and canada he will meet friday with 
president bush and then visit boston where he plans to meet with 
academics and watch a red sox game according to yukio okamoto 
director of the foreign ministrys first north america division 
bush is expected to seek a commitment from kaifu that japan will 
reform areas of its business and distribution system that the united 
states says limit foreign access 
foreign ministry officials said kaifu will tell bush that japan 
is willing to pursue major reform but that the united states also 
must institute changes if substantial improvement in the trade 
imbalance is to be made 
japan is prepared to address her own structural issues and 
indeed we have been addressing ourselves to these problems said 
mitoji yabunaka director of the ministrys second north america 
division but efforts should be made by both sides 
yabunaka said japan would ask the united states to boost its 
savings and business investment rates work harder to promote 
exports improve its vocational training and seek longterm 
investments rather than shortterm profits 
these are very serious issues and there is no quick fix he 
said 
japan has made major reductions in tariffs and other import 
barriers in recent years us and japanese officials have begun to 
say that the trade imbalance now stems mainly from social and 
business structures and practices in both countries 
the united states has said japans complex distribution system 
and ingrown business relationships make it difficult for foreign 
companies to penetrate the market and japans high saving rate 
reduces its purchases of foreign goods 
last year japans trade surplus with the united states was 55 
billion according to us figures 
on other issues okamoto said mr kaifu will be making clear 
to the president that there will be no change whatsoever in our 
basic position in our foreign policy 
in addition to forming a working relationship with us 
officials kaifu plans to reach out to the american public he said 
we expect mr kaifus personal traits young energetic 
accessible a caring personality will be well received by our 
american friends he said 
kaifus will visit mexico sept 46 the newspaper yomiuri 
shimbun reported monday that kaifu will offer mexican officials a 1 
billion loan to help combat air pollution in mexico city 
kaifu is to meet with prime minister brian mulroney of canada in 
ottawa on sept 7 okamoto said

idaho while taking an injured criminal suspect to a hospital 
killing at least two persons authorities said today 
there were indications that the man wounded in a canadian border 
shootout scuffled with the helicopters threeperson crew before 
the craft disappeared sunday evening and authorities said they were 
treating the crash as a crime 
rescuers found two bodies in the wreckage of the helicopter where 
it crashed in a mountainous region and were looking for the other 
two people said kootenai county idaho sheriffs sgt kenneth 
sopher the helicopter had been en route to sacred heart medical 
center in spokane 
the circumstances of the mishap definitely indicate that 
its not an aircraft accident said pete mangum an air safety 
inspector with the national transportation safety board in seattle 
the kootenai county sheriffs office is investigating the incident 
as a criminal activity other than an aircraft accident 
he declined to specify what evidence led authorities to believe a 
crime had caused the crash but a man who was monitoring radio 
messages sunday evening said the crew apparently radioed shortly 
before the crash that they were having trouble with the wounded 
suspect 
the helicopter an aerospatiale astar also carried its pilot a 
nurse and a respiratory therapist according to marilyn thordarson 
a spokeswoman for the hospital 
the wreckage was spotted at about 10 am near spirit mountain 
about two miles south of blanchard lake near the washingtonidaho 
border sopher saod 
the copter was believed to be one of two that were dispatched to 
bonners ferry idaho to pick up two people wounded in the shooting 
which occurred after a man wanted by the royal canadian mounted 
police forced his way into the united states from canada at gunpoint 
one helicopter picked up a wounded 71yearold man and returned 
to spokane safely the second copter left bonners ferry about 930 
pm and disappeared about a halfhour later 
bob zinkgraf a resident of colbert about 15 miles north of

shortly before 10 pm 
they reported they were having problems with the suspect he 
said a couple of minutes minutes later they reported they were 
in a scuffle with the suspect 
zinkgraf said he heard the hospital reporting that it had lost 
contact with the helicopter a short time later at about 10 pm 
ms thordarson said she knew of no reports of difficulty from the 
helicopter crew only that it made a routine patient status report 
shortly before radio contact became garbled and then was lost 
altogether 
identities of those on board were not immediately released but 
authorities said the patient aboard the missing helicopter was 
apparently the man sought by police for questioning about an 
incident at the us customs station at eastport idaho

couple about a mile south of the crossing station and forced his way 
in she said a woman fled the house and called police who later 
found two wounded men ms miles said

hospital identified the injured man in the helicopter that arrived 
safely as bob mcglocklin 71 he was reported in satisfactory 
condition with gunshot wounds in his arm and back

the state department flatly opposed on monday 
any form of membership by the palestine liberation organization in a 
world tourism group as contrary to international law and the cause 
of peace 
it was not clear however that us opposition would derail the 
move under discussion at a meeting of the world tourism organization 
in paris since the united states does not have veto power 
on the other hand the bush administration could discourage the 
move if it chose to withhold financial support the united states 
which covers 4 percent to 5 percent of the organizations budget is 
contributing 330000 this year 
the plo with which the administration is discussing mideast 
peace prospects applied for membership on july 7 for palestine 
all arab countries recognize yasser arafats groups as the sole 
legitimiate representative of palestinian arabs and many other 
countries have permitted the plo to open quasiembassies 
the united states enhanced plo prestige last december by opening 
a dialogue that the bush administration has continued despite an 
evident lack of progress in promoting arabisraeli negotiations on 
the other hand all us administrations as a matter of policy 
have been opposed to establishment of a palestinian state on land 
held by israel 
asked about the plos latest push for acceptance state 
department spokesman richard boucher declared the us is opposed 
to admitting the plo or quote palestine unquote to the world 
tourism organization in our view the selfdeclared state of 
palestine which we do not recognize does not meet the generally 
accepted criteria under international law for statehood and thus 
does not qualify for membership in international organizations 
nor boucher said do we believe that bestowing legitimacy 
upon the selfproclaimed quote state would advance the efforts to

the peace conference on cambodia began its final 
session monday with less than three days to resolve deepseated 
differences that have frustrated nearly a month of negotiations 
foreign minister roland dumas opened the session which foreign 
ministers were asked to attend and urged the 19 national 
delegations to accept compromise in the five major areas of 
disagreement 
i appeal to each of you to make this possible dumas said 
eduard a shevardnadze and qian quichen foreign ministers of the 
soviet union and china were absent because of lack of progress at 
the conference their governments announced washington said 
secretary of state james a baker iii also chose not to return 
because no comprehensive solution was in sight 
the first conference of all parties involved in cambodia had 
raised hopes when it began in late july with all 19 foreign 
ministers attending and the chairmaship shared by france and 
indonesia it was intended to lay the groundwork for lasting peace 
in cambodia after two decades of war 
mondays meeting lasted 3 hours mostly in closed session 
delegates said efforts for a compromise would continue over dinner 
and in informal groups after that 
dumas said national reconciliation was the essential issue of 
disagreement that no doubt will determine all the rest 
the main protagonists the vietnamesesponsored government of 
premier hun sen and the threeparty rebel alliance led by prince 
norodom sihanouk have scarcely changed their positions during three 
weeks of efforts by working committees 
conference sources said the factions reiterated those positions 
monday and hun sen proposed a mission to gather information both on 
vietnamese and chinese settlers in cambodia and conditions at khmer 
rouge refugee camps in thailand 
sihanouk claims up to 1 million vietnamese colonizers have 
settled in cambodia during vietnams decade of occupation and 
demands they be removed with vietnamese soldiers who withdraw next 
month 
the prince cambodias ruler until 1970 said he was prepared 
to agree with that which the majority of the conference wants a 
source close to the conference quoted him as saying 
in what capacity the prince spoke was not completely clear he 
resigned over the weekend as president of his party cited internal 
disputes but kept the leadership of the rebel alliance 
at the center of the conflict is the khmer rouge the strongest 
rebel faction which controlled cambodia for nearly four years until 
the vietnamese invasion of december 1978 and is blamed for hundreds 
of thousands of deaths 
sihanouk has insisted the khmer rouge be included in a 
transitional government before general elections a conference 
source said hun sen in a speech at the beginning of the closed 
session rejected the proposal once again 
dumas the french foreign minister said the other areas of 
disagreement were the un role in monitoring the vietnamese 
withdrawal and a ceasefire organization of a ceasefire use of 
the word genocide in a conference text and the alleged 
vietnamese settlers 
leaders pf the khmer rouge have refused to accept the word 
genocide which vietnam and the hun sen government use to 
describe the khmer rouge reign in conference texts hun sen insists 
it be used 
vietnam says it will withdraw the last of its forces by sept 27 
with or without a settlement 
there has been speculation the conference might continue at some 
later date if it does not achieve a comprehensive solution by the 
wednesday deadline an immediate consequence of no agreement would 
be a lack of arrangements for monitoring the vietnamese withdrawal 
after 20 years of bloodshed and horrors in cambodia youd have 
to be a brave person to be optimistic a member of the canadian 
delegation said canada is cochairman of the committee trying to 
establish an international control mechanism 
the delegate speaking privately said his committees document 
was about 12 pages long after three weeks of work but contained 
about 16 pages of amendments covering points of disagreement 
among delegates

the us trade deficit narrowed to 277 
billion from april through june the best showing in more than four 
years as a record level of exports overcame a big surge in 
americas foreign oil bill the government reported monday 
the commerce department said that the 23 percent drop in the 
trade deficit during the second quarter marked the second 
consecutive quarterly decline the deficit had fallen an even 
sharper 114 percent in the first three months of the year to 2838 
billion 
the apriljune improvement came from a 34 percent increase in 
exports which climbed to an alltime high of 9087 billion this 
more than offset a 2 percent rise in imports which also set a 
record at 11858 billion 
many analysts are concerned that the rapid growth in exports 
which provided much of the momentum for overall economic activity 
last year has already begun to slow under the impact of a rise in 
the value of the dollar 
a stronger dollar makes american goods less competitive on 
overseas markets while making imports cheaper in the united states 
rising demand for imported oil is also expected to make the 
deficit worsen in the second half of the year while nonoil imports 
actually fell in the second quarter oil imports shot up by 238 
percent 
this is the end of the good news on trade said michael 
evans head of a washington forecasting firm he and other analysts 
predicted the deficit would widen slightly in coming months 
with the dollar having risen so much in the last 18 months 
export growth has slowed while import growth remains fairly 
strong said david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill 
for the first six months of the year the trade deficit is 
running at an annual rate of 1122 billion down almost 12 percent 
from the 1988 deficit of 1272 billion 
evans said he expected the deficit would show only a marginal 
improvement for the whole year and he predicted the trade balance 
would actually begin to rise again in 1990 as the dollars increase 
eats further into export growth 
mondays report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance 
of payment basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the 
commerce departments monthly merchandise trade reports 
the totals from the two reports vary slightly because the balance 
of payments report exludes military sales by the us government and 
makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures 
the 277 billion deficit in the apriljune quarter was the 
lowest quarterly imbalance since a 257 billion deficit in the 
first three months of 1985 
the lowerthanexpected trade deficit for the second quarter 
along with stronger consumer spending should prompt an upward 
revision in the estimate of overall economic growth when it is 
released by the commerce department on tuesday many analysts said 
in advance of the report many economists were predicting the 
gross national product would be revised from a lackluster 17 
percent annual rate in the second quarter to a more respectable 27 
percent rate further easing fears that the economy is in danger of 
toppling into a recession this year 
the second quarter trade improvement was propelled by a 39 
percent rise in nonfarm exports which climbed to a record 801 
billion this gain reflected widespread increases in a variety of 
merchandise categories exports of airplanes jumped 12 percent while 
computer sales were up 5 percent and consumer exports rose 73 
percent 
the increase in imports occurred because of the 26 billion rise 
in petroleum imports which climbed to 134 billion reflecting 
both higher prices and an increase in volume nonoil imports edged 
down 03 percent to 1052 billion 
the price per barrel of oil rose to 1846 up 188 percent from 
the first quarter while the volume climbed to 797 million barrels 
a day up 41 percent from the previous quarter 
evans said with domestic production declining and energy demands 
growing americas foreign oil bill is headed even higher he noted 
that oil imports in july which were not reflected in this report 
supplied more than 50 percent of domestic needs the first time that 
has occurred in 12 years 
sales of us farm products slipped a tiny 03 percent to 107 
billion with part of the decline reflected in a 500 million drop in 
wheat sales to the soviet union soybean sales fell by 200 mllion 
primarily because of a cutback in shipments to western europe while 
tobacco exports were down 200 million because of a drop in 
shipments to japan 
the average price of soybeans fell 4 percent while cotton prices 
were down 3 percent and corn prices declined 2 percent wheat prices 
were up 2 percent on average 
as usual the biggest deficit was run up with japan an imbalance 
of 122 billion a full 44 percent of the total deficit

chancellor helmut kohl on monday 
emerged as the sole contender for leadership of his christian 
democratic union as the governing party heads into the 1990 national 
election campaign 
the partys support tendered in a closeddoor meeting is a 
muchneeded boost for the chancellor who has suffered a drop in 
popularity among voters 
but the apparent decision to retain kohl as party leader and 
therefore its candidate for chancellor next year could disappoint 
the majority of west german voters who want a change from the status 
quo 
a public opinion poll released over the weekend by the respected 
emnid research firm indicated 71 percent of west german voters 
questioned want an alternative to kohl as chancellor including 59 
percent of the respondents claiming allegiance to kohls party 
political observers had speculated that more popular members of 
the party might come forward to challenge kohl as the party heads 
into a tough reelection fight 
kohl declined to talk with reporters after the threehour 
meeting but a participant rhinelandpalatinate governor 
carlludwig wagner said kohl emerged as the sole candidate for 
party leadership 
the party will hold its national convention in bremen in less 
than two weeks at which another chancellor candidate could emerge 
but mondays decision appeared to indicate the party will stick with 
kohl 
the christian democratic union has been damaged by controversies 
such as us accusations that west german firms helped libya build a 
chemical weapons plant and bonns refusal to endorse a nato plan to 
extend the range of nuclear missiles based in west germany 
amid those crises the party suffered some serious election 
setbacks this year losing control of important cities like berlin 
and frankfurt 
kohl and his party recovered some voter confidence this summer 
following the may 2930 nato summit at which the missile debate was 
resolved and the highprofile visit by president bush immediately 
after 
but the emnid poll commissioned by the weekly news magazine der 
spiegel indicated further damage has been caused by a dispute over 
kohls firing of longtime party manager heiner geissler 
geissler has had a moderating influence on the party in recent 
years moving it toward the ideological center as the west german 
electorate became more concerned with social security issues and the 
environment 
the poll of 1000 voters showed 38 percent support the christian 
democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social 
union and an equal 38 percent favor the leftleaning social 
democratic party 
with neither of the two main political parties polling a 
majority a coalition with one of the smaller parties would be 
necessary to win control of the federal government in the 1990 
balloting

mourners filled a church today to remember 
huey p newton as he lived not as he died 
all 1200 seats of the allen temple baptist church were taken for 
the funeral of the black panther party cofounder who was shot to 
death in what police allege was a dispute over crack cocaine 
hundreds more people milled about outside the building 
were here to celebrate his life not to discuss his death 
said elaine brown head of the panthers from 1974 to 1977 and now a 
writer living in southern california we dont need 
counterrevolutionary fratricide hell be remembered as a hero 
i just think it is very important for me to be here said the 
rev y stevens of the third baptist church in san francisco he 
has been an inspiration to the young black people somewhere along 
the line he may have fallen but in the early days i admired his 
mission 
church officials said the service would feature a lengthy list of 
speakers including h rap brown leader of the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee and bobby seale who joined with newton to 
establish the panthers in 1966 
on sunday a wake for newton drew 6000 mourners in a rare public 
show of support for the black power politics he espoused in the 
60s 
this here is for those who really meant a lot to huey the 
people who needed him the most the everyday people from the 
streets said hillary jones standing in line sunday as people 
filed through a mortuary two at a time to view his body 
this kind of turnout for what huey once stood for hasnt been 
seen in a long time around here added jones 48 who described 
herself as a sympathizer with politics of the black panther party 
which dissolved in the mid 70s 
also today a selfproclaimed prison gang member and drug dealer 
who police say admitted killing newton faced arraignment on a 
homicide charge in alameda county municipal court 
mourners on sunday lined up for three blocks outside the funeral 
home in a rundown section of east oakland 
this is a terrible tragedy for blacks he stood for black pride 
in the 60s and now he stands for the decimation of blacks by 
crack said leroy johnson 44 as he waited to attend the daylong 
wake 
newton 47 was shot to death tuesday in what police said was a 
dispute over crack cocaine in the drugridden west oakland 
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years ago 
he founded the black panther party with bobby seale in 1966 and 
as its minister of defense became one of the most articulate leaders 
of the black militancy movement the party dissolved in the mid70s 
he made us have black pride said norma corman 38 who knew 
newton casually for the last decade he was a good man destroyed 
by the badness of drugs 
however many in line at the funeral home said they didnt 
believe the police account of newtons death and blamed it on 
authorities 
the police were always after huey said jeffrey deleong 28 
the man got him 
a television cameraman taping interviews with mourners was 
attacked by a group of men who had warned him earlier that they 
didnt want their pictures taken police and ktvuchannel 2 
officials said 
cameraman henry faybusovic suffered cuts and scrapes and was 
being xrayed for internal injuries at highland hospital said 
police sgt c vierra 
police said tyrone robinson a 25yearold member of the black 
guerrilla family admitted shooting newton in selfdefense after 
newton brandished a gun and demanded crack shortly before dawn 
tuesday newton had a history of drug and alcohol abuse 
police have disputed the exconvicts account instead believing 
the killing was an attempt by robinson to make a name for himself in 
the notorious gang police said newton had stolen drugs and money 
from the gang in recent years 
newtons family has declined to comment since the police 
announcement friday of robinsons arrest 14 hours after the slaying 
the black guerrilla family was founded in the prisons in the 
1960s by inmate george jackson a black panther who died in a 
notorious escape attempt at san quentin prison in 1971

administration officials denied reports that mrs de greiff had 
resigned in the face of death threats from the leaders of the 
medellin cocaine cartel 
white house spokesman roman papadiuk said the president of 
colombia virgilio barco has denied reports that mrs de greiff had 
resigned in the face of death threats from drug lords and his 
words are good enough for me

to have an afternoon meeting with senior state department officials 
including undersecretary of state robert kimmitt

former us rep pat swindall was sentenced to a 
year in prison and fined 30000 monday for lying to a federal grand 
jury about an 850000 moneylaundering scheme and again declared he 
is an innocent man 
the 38yearold republican who served two terms before his 
defeat last november was convicted june 20 of nine counts of 
perjury for his testimony in 1988 about negotiations with a federal 
agent posing as a drugmoney launderer 
federal guidelines called for up to 11 years in prison the fine 
imposed by us district judge richard c freeman was the maximum 
under the guidelines 
swindall who won election from atlantas eastern suburbs in 1984 
but lost while under indictment four years later remains free on 
appeal prosecutors said that under the guidelines he will serve 
the entire sentence 
the problem i have is not the length of the sentence but 
whether it should have been imposed at all he said after the 
sentencing 
in a 30minute statement to the judge swindall cited why he 
believes he was unfairly convicted but an irritated judge told the 
former congressman he would not rehash the evidence or turn 
this thing into a circus 
swindall told him i stand before you in all humility but 
freeman retorted you dont know the meaning of humility mr 
swindall 
us attorney robert barr said afterward we thought a more 
lengthy sentence was called for 
the prosecution had requested sentencing under guidelines calling 
for up to about four years on each count for lying about a crime 
but the judge refused because the government never accused swindall 
of actually laundering any money 
freeman agreed to recommend that swindall be sent to the 
minimumsecurity prison in atlanta 
evidence at swindalls trial included tapes of conversations with 
an irs undercover agent and a political supporter charles 
lechasney who has since pleaded guilty to money laundering 
conspiracy a witness also testified the congressmanlawyer boasted 
he could beat a perjury rap because he had given properly vague 
answers 
swindall had sought 850000 to finish his luxurious home he 
accepted a 150000 check before backing out of the deal 
the jury found swindall guilty of telling 18 deliberate lies in 
his grand jury testimony about the deal he claimed he was tired and 
his memory faulty 
swindall is appealing his conviction contending that the judge 
improperly struck the testimony of a congressional colleague and 
that the prosecution improperly questioned a witness about why some 
defendants dont testify as swindall declined to do 
on monday swindalls brother kevin told the judge the 
excongressman had not testified at his trial because he didnt 
want the jury poisoned by the revelation of unsavory details of a 
feud with his father over family business 
swindall was largely a political unknown before he was elected to 
congress in 1984 upsetting democrat elliott levitas he was 
reelected in 1986 but lost in 1988 to democrat ben jones while 
under the cloud of his perjury indictment 
lechasney who testified against swindall awaits sentencing on 
his own conviction

south african leader fw de klerk 
outlined his plans for racial reconciliation at a historic summit 
monday with one of his governments most outspoken and influential 
opponents president kenneth kaunda of zambia 
the meeting at a resort hotel near victoria falls was the first 
state visit by a south african leader to zambia which accommodates 
the headquarters of the african national congress guerrilla movement 
de klerks predecessor president pw botha initiated a 
campaign last year to improve whiterun south africas relations 
with its black neighbors but botha resigned aug 14 after the 
cabinet overruled his argument that de klerk not visit zambia 
because of its support for the anc 
de klerk stressed that his government opposed any outside 
interference in domestic politics but briefed kaunda on his 
proposals to end south africas blackwhite conflict 
i had the opportunity to give a positive vision of the future 
in which south africa is going to break out of the cycle of 
conflict de klerk told reporters we are going through 
negotiations and dialogue 
kaunda said he would have to confer with other african heads of 
state before responding to several points raised in the talks 
asked about de klerks proposals kaunda replied there are 
certain basic principles which he says he intends to implement 
about those i see no disagreement at all 
de klerk said of kaunda i got the impression he listened very 
carefully his reaction was a positive one but also a waitandsee 
one 
neither leader disclosed specifics of what de klerk said in 
recent speeches he has proposed a fiveyear plan aimed at bringing 
the black majority into the political system while preventing white 
interests from being overruled 
kaunda has led zamibia since its independence from britain in 
1964 and is chairman of the frontline states a sixnation group 
formed to work collectively against the south african government 
he recently warned of a major violent explosion if the anc 
and south africas white leaders failed to open talks 
the anc has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign in south africa 
since 1961 as part of a campaign to end whiteminority control 
south africas farright conservative party claimed kaunda would 
in effect meet de klerk as a mediator for the anc presenting its 
latest proposal for talks aimed at bringing about majority rule 
de klerk said the proposal was not discussed and kaunda said 
i wasnt speaking for the anc 
kaunda led a delegation of about 100 in a lowkey welcome for de 
klerk at livingstones airport there was a red carpet but no guard 
of honor no band and no south african flag 
both leaders described the talks as useful and welcomed the 
opportunity to get acquainted de klerk on the flight back to south 
africa said he found kaunda a pleasant man an earnest christian 
hes concerned that we move toward cooperation 
de klerk leader of the governing national party is favored to 
win a fiveyear term as president after parliamentary elections 
sept 6 
he has tried to portray himself as a statesman capable of ending 
south africas international isolation while at the same insisting 
the anc renounce violence before being included in negotiations 
in their talks de klerk and kaunda discussed the breakdown of a 
ceasefire intended to end angolas 14year civil war and the 
independence process in namibia the territory south africa has 
ruled for 74 years 
de klerk said they agreed the yearlong independence plan was on 
track with elections scheduled for early november 
on sunday de klerk met with angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi afterward savimbi said his usbacked national union for 
the total independence of angola unita remains committed to 
peace in angola he promised to attend a summit in zaire next month 
to try to salvage the ceasefire 
in washington the state department said we welcome statements 
from unita that it is prepared to observe the ceasefire as weve 
stated before we urge both sides to conclude negotiations on a 
comprehensive and effective ceasefire agreement such an agreement 
would open the way to negotiations on political issues and national 
reconciliation 
the unita leader was angered by a claim by kaunda last week that 
savimbi had agreed to retire from politics and that the rebels would 
accept angolas current oneparty constitution these points were 
raised by the south african delegation with kaunda 
south africa ended its aid to savimbi under terms of a regional 
peace treaty signed in december with angola the pact calls for a 
phased withdrawal of cubas 50000 soldiers from angola

a federal judge today refused to stop the 
national football league from suspending players who test positive 
for steroids 
us district court judge thomas hogan said all nfl players had 
been given ample notice earlier this year that they would face 
discipline for using the strengthenhancing substances 
hogan refused to issue a temporary restraining order and said the 
players labor union had not shown that its members would face 
irreparable harm under the leagues suspension plan 
the players association filed a motion for a temporary 
restraining order earlier today calling the testing procedures 
highly questionable in terms of accuracy the labor unions 
lawyers said they were considering whether to take further legal 
action and asked the nfl to voluntarily suspend its plan to disclose 
the names of players testing positive and suspend them for 30 days 
identifying and suspending players under the program will result 
in their being permanently stigmatized the association said in 
court papers their professional reputations will be irreparably 
harmed and injured 
the union said publicly announced playersuspensions are 
imminent for those who test positive for steroids or chemicals 
designed to mask the presence of the substances 
the nfls plans called for announcing today a list of those who 
tested positive 
this automatic sanction is to be imposed in the absence of 
essential baseline data which provides the only sound basis for 
determining whether measured levels of steroids actually reflect 
steroid use as opposed to naturally occurring levels of the 
hormones detected said the players organizations court papers 
the players have filed a grievance challenging the steroid 
program and the matter is in arbitration 
despite the pending arbitration the league has apparently 
refused to refrain from proceeding with its plans to announce the 
suspension of numerous players for a minimum of 30 days onefourth 
of the nfl season said the players court filings 
before the 1987 season 1600 players were tested for steroids 
and 6 percent were found to be users the same number of players was 
tested before the 1988 season and although final results are not 
due until next month the nfl said the 6 percent usage figure was so 
far what the league had found

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki met with 
coalition leaders monday about forming the east blocs first 
noncommunist government but a solidarity deputy said a new cabinet 
could not be presented until september 
also monday solidarity leader lech walesa said he plans to 
appeal to workers for a moratorium on strikes to give the new 
government time to solve polands pressing problems 
there are no major obstacles or difficulties in forming the 
government only there is a certain inevitable slow process said 
bronislaw geremek the solidarity parliamentary floor leader 
mazowiecki elected the first noncommunist government leader in 
the east bloc in more than 40 years on thursday had said he would 
like to present the government to the sejm by the end of august 
the prime minister did not realize this inevitable slowness 
when he gave the date of aug 31 and he cannot keep that promise 
we think the government could be presented to the sejm before sept 
10 geremek said 
geremek and other members of the solidarity parliamentary group 
met with mazowiecki for two hours monday the prime minister also 
received separately the parliamentary and party leaders of the 
democratic and peasant parties 
the independent gazeta wyborcza newspaper said monday that walesa 
would issue a statement in the coming days about the need for strike 
moratorium of at least a six months 
walesa has said that labor peace and western aid are necessary to 
help reverse polands economic decline and provide a favorable 
climate for the new government 
asked in gdansk on monday when the moratorium request would be 
issued walesa replied we should do it together with the 
appointment of the whole government 
we have the biggest chance ever to make the poland of our 
dreams we can go in this direction but we cannot do it if we are 
going to suffer economic losses he said 
walesa will appeal to workers not to strike and said solidarity 
would help them in the meantime to negotiate with management gazeta 
wyborcza said 
pay disputes have broken out on an almost daily basis in the 
country in the past six months but most of the work stoppages have 
been brief 
workers are frustrated by soaring inflation empty shelves and 
stores with poor quality goods as well as by the lack of visible 
economic improvements since solidarity was legalized in april after 
a sevenyear ban and polands freest elections in more than four 
decades were held in june 
geremek said the parliamentary group discussed its relationship 
with the prime minister the governments economic program and the 
distribution of ministries 
drafting an economic plan is the most difficult problem the 
government faces he said 
a sketch of the economic program emerged during the electoral 
campaign now is not the time to define the direction of the 
program but to define the strategy in particular a choice between 
a stepbystep approach and a big bang he said 
we have the impression now that a policy of radical economic 
change is necessary from the start this government must see the 
need to give some signs of improvement in the short term he said 
geremek said the improvement must concern supplying goods to 
major cities and that the government must also find a way to stop 
inflation which has reached three digits 
the communist party has been promised the key ministries of 
defense and the interior which control the army and the police and 
geremek indicated that the communists may be asked to take an 
economic ministry as well 
to give them the ministries of the interior and the army and no 
economic ministry would be a big mistake they would have all the 
power and no responsibility he said 
the solidarity group also told mazowiecki it was important to 
diminish the communist partys monopoly over mass media 
particularly radio and television 
until now state radio and television were administered by a 
staterun committee whose chairman held the rank of minister 
geremek suggested the new head of radio and television could be 
someone who is not a member of the government 
there is no place in the government for a minister of 
information he said 
as part of the agreements that led to solidaritys legalization 
and the election the indpendent movement was granted permission to 
publish a daily and weekly newspaper it also has limited access to 
state tv and radio

japanese authorities said monday they detained two 
chinese refugees posing as vietnamese boat people and launched a new 
policy of refusing vietnamese who flee their homeland for economic 
reasons 
refugees from political persecution still will be accepted under 
the policy that began monday said yoichiro mizukami of the justice 
ministrys immigration bureau 
he said the decision to start the screening was made after the

other asian countries have adopted similar screening policies for 
vietnamese boat people but japan so far had taken in all boat 
people 
the justice ministry said in a statement that immigration 
authorities discovered the two chinese among 107 vietnamese boat 
people who arrived in southwestern japan in a wooden boat may 29 
it said the two chinese both from fujian province in 
southeastern china had pretended to be boat people in hopes of 
becoming permament residents of japan or at least finding work 
landing permission for the pair was retracted and they were taken 
into custody it added a ministry official speaking on condition 
of anonymity said japan would deport them to their homeland but 
declined to discuss details 
the ministry also said remarks by the two chinese led authorities 
to believe many chinese or chinesevietnamese were included among 
arriving boat people 
earlier a justice ministry official said merchants in southern 
china were helping many vietnamese refugees travel by boat to japan 
also monday another wooden vessel with 203 vietnamese refugees 
was found heading for japan an official of japans coast guard 
said the justice ministry said they would face screening under the 
new policy 
so far this year 1909 vietnamese have arrived in japan 
compared with 219 boat people in all of 1988 according to justice 
ministry figures 
many refugees have said they came to japan for a better economic 
life ministry officials reported

threats from drug traffickers

greiff was not resigning white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
as he teed off for golf the vacationing bush was asked about a 
newsweek report that he was considering sending covert military 
teams into colombia to assist barcos crackdown 
if i discussed covert action it wouldnt be covert i dont 
discuss that kind of thing at all he replied 
bush cautioned that his reply should not be interpreted as a 
yes or a no or a confirm or a deny 
popadiuk told reporters in response to a question about covert 
operations obviously we are very concenrned about he colombian 
drug situation but in terms of specific actions we may or may 
not be undertaking we just dont comment on any covert activities 
that may or may not be undertaken

us military teams and special forces to help barco but the 
presidents hands are tied by barcos own statements that he does 
not want such assistance said the source who spoke on condition of

of the drug lords violence

us rep barney frank said monday that reaction 
among friends and constituents to his relationship with a male 
prostitute has been more generous than i really had any right to 
expect 
opponents kept up their criticism however and a law professor 
asked prosecutors monday to file felony sodomy charges against the 
fiveterm democrat from massachusetts 
on friday frank confirmed details of a newspaper account of his 
paying the man for sex once and then hiring him as a personal 
assistant believing he could help reform him he said he fired the 
man when he suspected he was selling sex from franks apartment 
frank said he did not believe he or anyone else in such a 
situation should be prosecuted 
i felt that they were poor judgments and that if they 
victimized anybody they victimized me he said that is i 
never felt i was hurting anybody except myself 
two polls published over the weekend showed that voters in the 
states 4th district still strongly supported frank 
frank 49 made two public appearances in fall river over the 
weekend where a few muffled boos were overwhelmed by applause 
and cheers 
i guess it means people think ive done a good job in the past 
its nice to have that i work hard at my job he said im 
touched because right now obviously im chagrined and angry at 
myself as i rethink all this 
people are being nicer to me than im ready to be to myself 
right now 
alexander tennant executive director of the state republican 
party called on frank to resign for apparently violating the law 
and predicted that voter opinion will change once the gop makes it 
clear frank not only hired a male prostitute but also wrote letters 
on the mans behalf to his probation officer 
the democrats are arguing this is a personal matter we are 
arguing that there is a very serious public matter tennant said 
he and other republicans are asking for an house ethics 
investigation to which frank said he had no objection 
george washington law professor john banzhaf said many people 
dont think frank confessed to a crime he has 
banzhaf said he asked us attorney jay stephens of the district 
of columbia to also investigate other charges related to 
prostitution including running a bawdy house and soliciting for 
prostitution 
what banzhaf is saying is that every gay person in washington 
dc who is not totally abstinent is a criminal said frank 
in a lot of districts if two people who are not married have 
any kind of sex theyre breaking the law and in some states if 
married people have a certain kind of sex theyre breaking the law 
and i have always thought that was a mistake 
felony sodomy in the district of columbia carries up to 10 years 
in prison the other charges carry lesser penalties said banzhaf 
who teaches public interest law and has filed suits in a number of 
corruption cases involving federal officials 
frank said he hired the male prostitute steve gobie to run 
errands and do chores hoping to help gobie give up prostitution and 
drugs frank said that two years ago he fired gobie who turns 33 on 
monday because he suspected gobie was selling sex out of the 
congressmans apartment when he wasnt home

a court ruling against the energy departments 
award of a 1 billion management contract for the nations first 
highlevel nuclear waste dump wont necessarily delay the project a 
senior department official said monday 
us claims court judge reginald gibson ruled last thursday that 
the department could award the contract to no one but trw 
environmental safety systems inc an unsuccessful bidder which sued 
on grounds that the departments means of selecting bechtel systems 
management inc as manager was improper and unfair 
over the short run i cant see that thats a dramatic impact 
on the program said samuel rousso acting director of the 
departments office of civilian radioactive waste management which 
is administering the problemridden project 
he said the department had not yet decided how to respond to 
gibsons ruling including whether to appeal 
the full decision paper has to be analyzed to see what the 
thrust of the judges position is and how we feel about that and 
what we are at liberty to do about that he said in an interview 
in his office at department headquarters 
rousso said preparatory work for studies to determine the 
geologic suitability of the proposed repository site at yucca 
mountain about 100 miles northwest of las vegas nev is not 
affected by gibsons ruling the studies are being held up however 
by nevadas refusal to grant the necessary environmental permits 
nuclear utilities are anxious to see the repository built because 
some are being forced to spend millions of dollars to expand 
temporary waste storage facilities utilities customers pay 400 
million a year into a fund for the permanent dump 
rousso said significant delays in opening the dump by the target 
date of 2003 could result if gibsons ruling which is temporarily 
sealed under court order forces the department to abandon its 
plans to put a single company in charge of much of the project 
he said justice department lawyers were still reviewing the 
ruling and that neither he nor energy secretary james d watkins had 
studied details of the decision 
gibson last week announced only the gist of his ruling saying he 
would give the companies involved until wednesday to review the 
formal document for any proprietary information or trade secrets 
that should be removed before it is made public 
rousso also reiterated his denial of one of trws main charges 
that his involvement in the contract award process was a conflict of 
interest trw asserted that the award was tainted by the fact that 
rousso worked for science applications international corp a 
bechtel subcontractor before joining the energy department 
rousso said he worked for science applications for seven months 
before coming to the department in 1986 the yucca mountain contract 
proposal did not exist then he said adding that he has no 
continuing ties with science applications 
i hold no pension rights no favoritism no job promises no 
thoughts to that regard and i dont see where any conflict of 
interest has been shown he said 
under federal law energy department supervisory employees cannot 
knowingly participating in department projects that involve any 
energy company for which they worked within the past year

people who think oprah winfrey looks 
impossibly slim on the cover of this weeks tv guide are right the 
talk show queens face was superimposed on actress annmargrets 
hourglass figure 
appearing under the headline oprah the richest woman on tv 
the illustration of miss winfrey in a gauzy dress atop a pile of 
money is not identified as a composite 
and tv guide acknowledged monday that unsuspecting readers might 
think its a real photograph 
the lean body upon which oprahs head rests is from a publicity 
shot of annmargret according to the actress publicist george 
kirvay the photo comes from a rockette special annmargret did 
about 10 years ago kirvay said 
i think she was shocked kirvay said of annmargrets 
reaction to tv guides cover for the aug 26sept 1 issue if you 
look at the two pictures theyre identical its even her ring on 
oprahs hand 
the formerly overweight miss winfrey who lost 67 pounds on a 
diet in 1988 had no part whatsoever in the covers making said 
christine tardio a spokeswoman for miss winfreys harpo production 
company 
oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that nor would she 
pose in that revealing a dress its not something she would ever 
do ms tardio said 
david sendler tv guides national section editor acknowledged 
the illustration could be mistaken for a photograph he said an 
artist had used the annmargret shot for creative inspiration 
annmargret should be thrilled because shes got another tv 
guide cover sendler said and oprah should be thrilled because 
she looks terrific 
but sendler said tv guide had instructed the artist not to use 
photographs so literally in the future

the evangelical lutheran church in america 
voted overwhelmingly monday to sell all stock in companies operating 
in south africa by sept 1 1991 despite objections the 
denomination could lose money 
prudence is a christian virtue and im not going to listen to 
pagan lawyers tell me how to be a prudent christian said bishop 
william lazareth of new york city who supported the deadline 
an estimated 85 percent of the 1041 delegates voted for the 
deadline in a showofcards vote at stake was the churchs 16 
billion pension fund of which 849 million is invested in 
companies doing business in south africa 
the meeting is the first since the 1988 merger of the lutheran 
church in america the american lutheran church and the association 
of evangelical lutheran churches 
the divestment move is aimed at pushing south africa to end 
apartheid which establishes a racially segregated society in which 
the countrys 28 million blacks are dominated by 5 million whites 
its a matter of outrage said bishop harold jensen of 
washington dc we cant deal with it simply on a rational 
basis 
several protestant denominations particularly the episcopal 
church the united church of christ the church of the brethren and 
the quakers have had strong divestment policies but none has sold 
all its holdings 
the assembly in the sixth day of an eightday meeting also 
approved a major missions program for the 1990s 
the vote on divestment followed nearly three hours of debate 
among delegates in the 53 millionmember denomination the 
thirdlargest among us protestants 
before the vote investment specialist john kapanke president of 
the denominations board of pensions said a deadline threatened 
financial responsibility 
kapanke said at a news conference later that constraints on 
investments could jeopardize them and increase risks 
he and others said the denomination could be opening itself to a 
lawsuit accusing it of violating its fiduciary responsibility 
we should not fight our social battles with other peoples 
money said the rev elvin bjork of salem ore we could do a 
great deal of damage to the pension fund 
deadline supporters argued that fiduciary meant faithfulness 
to justice as well as to money 
bishop sherman hicks of chicago said all things belong to god 
including money and that the church has do whats right 
regardless of what he called lesser considerations 
a resolutions committee had proposed a measure asking the 
pensions board to work more aggressively to sell off the stock but 
set no deadline however the delegates chose the stiffer 
substitute offered by bishop david olson of minneapolis 
in addition to setting the 1991 deadline the resolution defined 
companies to be divested as those with direct and indirect 
operations in south africa

president mikhail s gorbachev has told officials 
of the lithuanian communist party that the baltic republic has gone 
too far in its drive for independence an activist said monday 
also on monday the communist party daily newspaper pravda 
accused the peoples front of moldavia comprised of ethnic 
activists in the southern republic of moldavia of trying to take 
power on the crest of a muddy wave of chauvinism and separatism 
in vilnius lithuania romaldus olozus a member of the governing 
council or sejm of the sajudis grassroots movement said he and 
four colleagues met with lithuanian communist party chief algirdas 
brazauskas on monday after gorbachev called the lithuanian party 
leader on friday and sunday to express his concern 
brazauskas told the sajudis members gorbachev is concerned 
about whats happening in lithuania that what had happened so far 
was worth supporting but that now wed gone too far olozus said 
by telephone 
on saturday the soviet communist party central committee in 
moscow issued a stinging statement saying separatists were leading 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia into an abyss 
the statement came days after more than 1 million baltic people 
joined hands in a human chain to protest the 1939 agreement between 
josef stalin and adolf hitler that assigned the thenindependent 
baltics to a soviet sphere of influence 
the government of lithuania and the communist party of a second 
baltic republic latvia came into line monday behind the party 
statement 
the tass news agency said the latvian party issued a statement 
calling the partys stance the basis for concrete action for 
normalizing the socialpolitical situation in the country 
in lithuania the presidium of the republics supreme soviet 
legislature rejected a commissions findings that the inorporation 
of lithuania into the soviet union by stalin in 1940 was an 
international crime 
izvestia the soviet government newspaper said the findings did 
not take into account lithuanias political situation in 193940 
and would lead the republic into a political dead end and serve 
poorly in the transfer to economic independence 
it turned the supreme soviet commissions work back to it until a 
national panel finishes its review izvestia said 
olozus said gorbachev apparently was upset with the findings of 
the lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legal 
argument for full independence 
a meeting of communist party activists was called monday in 
vilnius but nothing was known of its results 
the confrontation with the kremlin was inescapable but the 
resistance might slow down the sajudisled drive for greater 
autonomy if not outright independence from moscow olozus said 
the grassroots movement will continue on the same path but the 
steps can be slower or faster depending on the concrete 
situation he said 
sajudis chairman vytautus landsbergis also indicated sunday the 
kremlin statement will make some problems for us but he added 
he didnt expect the kremlin to crush the movement i dont think 
theyre madmen he said 
olozus said no special meeting of sajudis was planned to discuss 
the kremlin reaction but that landsbergis would speak on lithuanian 
tv tuesday night 
he said he had an impression from talking to brazauskas that 
gorbachev did not entirely support the strident tone of the central 
committee statement but that his reaction was one of 
disappointment 
in moldavia representatives of the moldavian peoples front met 
leaders of a council representing nonmoldavian workers who have 
been on strike since last week to protest a draft law making 
moldavian the republics official language tass reported it did 
not report any progress in their dispute over the language law 
the republics supreme soviet is to take up the issue at a 
meeting tuesday in the capital of kishinev on sunday thousands 
rallied there to protest or support the law 
russians ukrainians and other minorities who together make up 36 
percent of moldavias 42 million people are concerned the law will 
be the first step toward a policy of discriminating against 
nonmoldavians 
pravda on monday said that the crowd drawn to kishinevs lenin 
square on sunday by the peoples front had submitted to longterm 
brainwashing by nationalistminded ideologists 
those who have led the moldavian population to ethnic strife 
exploiting perestroika slogans as a coverup are pursuing their 
personal aims and seek to take power on the crest of a muddy wave of 
chauvinism and separatism it said 
it said the strikers who have walked off the job at more than 
100 factories and offices were particularly upset with a provision 
of the law that would make moldavian not only the government 
language but the language of interethnic communications 
the strikers say that will force even predominantly nonmoldavian 
cities to use moldavian as the language of communications between 
different ethnic groups

a decent pair of shoes is as hard to find 
as a patch of flat land in this coal mining community now that the 
last clothing store has shut its doors 
the strike against the pittston coal group is slowly suffocating 
dickenson county where nearly a third of the striking united mine 
workers live 
the county had been in an economic downturn for more than four 
years when the strike began april 5 since then the county has lost 
coal tax revenue the school budget has been cut deeply and 
businesses have been hurt by the lack of buying power 
the countys unemployment rate for july announced monday was 
92 percent secondhighest in the state 
its really put a strain on the community as a whole said 
henry vanover the county administrator 
but the loyalty of its people to the union remains as deep as the 
black veins that provide the countys lifeblood 
you can go into any town and find widespread community support 
for the union and the unions position commonwealths attorney 
gerald gray said 
carrol deckard for example said she donates 10 percent of the 
sales at her craft and novelty store in clintwood the odd shop to 
the union 
this is a coal mining town its all weve got she said 
the union brought decent wages here where people used to work for 
1 an hour if the union doesnt get a contract were gone weve 
already lost three stores 
the geography that makes dickenson county rich in coal and lured 
miners from scotland and ireland a century ago also makes it 
dependent on the mineral 
the rugged county is surrounded by large mountain ranges the 
county needs to upgrade its roads and its water and sewer systems to 
compete for industry gray said 
but the government can barely make ends meet now and may have to 
borrow before the end of the fiscal year to provide essential 
services vanover said 
to show both the isolation of the area and the closeness of its 
people gray noted that 95 percent of the people living in the 
county are descendants of the original settlers 
pittston owns about 70 percent of the surface land and 95 percent 
of the underground reserves gray said in essence they are the 
landlords and we are the tenants he said 
although pittston denies it is trying to do away with collective 
bargaining the residents and business owners believe for the most 
part that the company is trying to break the union that is making 
the stakes of the strike higher than any previous labor dispute and 
drawing the community together 
most of the replacement workers are from out of state when local 
residents cross over gray said it splits families 
denny boggs pointed to a trailer next to his service station and 
said the woman who lives there disowned her father when he went to 
work for pittston 
people who have been friends all their lives are being 
separated kids who grew up together harold willis added as he 
paid boggs for his gas 
pittstons replacement workers are digging 40 percent less coal 
than normal which means a 40 percent reduction in coal severance 
taxes vanover estimated that the county has lost 200000 in 
anticipated severance tax revenue and will continue to lose about 
60000 each month the strike goes on 
the schools open next week with their budget for the year cut 
400000 
it doesnt look very good for us even to maintain present 
standards assistant superintendent gerald triplett said the 
county has cut four teaching positions and more reductions are 
possible he said 
there is no indication the strike involving pittstons 1695 
union employees in virginia west virginia and kentucky will end 
soon 
real estate and personal property taxes counted on in the county 
budget are due dec 5 and many striking miners may not be able to 
pay them gray said 
several stores have gone bankrupt the striking miners are making 
200 a week in strike pay compared with 500 a week before they 
walked out which means they have only enough to cover groceries and 
monthly bills 
the loss of revenue is a strain but the worst part is the 
effect on people their spirits the longer it goes vanover said

a minor crackdown against mall rats at a few 
massachusetts shopping centers runs counter to the thinking at most 
retail arcades where freespending kids are given a lot of space 
teens have a large retail impact at the malls so to lose them 
would be to lose a lot said peter zollo president of teenage 
research unlimited a chicagobased firm that compiles spending 
statistics 
even though their video displays and junk food havens act as 
magnets for bored youngsters on hot summer afternoons some mall 
managers said monday that loiterers arent welcome 
and in several cases kids have been arrested for trespassing 
last month a 14yearold was picked up while waiting for his 
mother at shoppers world in framingham police said at least four 
other such arrests have been made at the same mall this summer and 
similar incidents have been reported elsewhere 
jamie leblanc 15 said he and his pals frequent the watertown 
mall and regularly spend money on the latest tapes and newest 
fashions lately he said theyve repeatedly run into trouble 
i was sitting in dunkin donuts with my friends and a cop 
tapped his billy club on my shoulder and told me to get out said 
leblanc who had bought a cup of coffee i was just sitting there 
smoking a cigarette not bothering anyone 
zollo said taking a hard line on teenage conduct could be 
instant death for shopkeepers and cinema owners who rent space in 
malls expressly because of the ready audience 
every year youngsters between the ages of 12 and 19 spend 313 
billion of their own money at shops nationwide and account for 79 
billion in retail business when the money their parents gives them 
is factored in zollos research found 
last week alone 13 million teenagers bought movie tickets and 
during the summer nearly 65 percent of the nations 27 million 
teenagers saw at least one feature he said 
obviously malls hold two functions for teens zollo said 
one is of a social nature and the other is shopping they do both 
there and the more time they spend the more money they spend 
mall owners agreed they dont want to discourage teens from 
coming but said they have to draw the line somewhere 
its a delicate balance said henry hudson general manager 
at the south shore plaza in braintree the mall managers have to 
maintain control in the centers for the benefit of the patrons 
boston police spokesman scott gillis said anywhere from five to 
15plus officers patrol busy city shopping areas for troublemakers 
especially during vacation time 
we tell people loiterers to move on and if it gets to be a 
problem we lock them up for disorderly conduct he said 
nuisancetype loitering is definitely not acceptable and will not 
be tolerated 
randy boon a researcher at stillerman jones and co an 
indianapolisbased marketing research firm said mall managers dont 
want to see a few overactive or offensive kids discourage business 
overall 
its a big thing a lot of customers that go in tend to be 
scared away if there are a lot of kids hanging out who dont seem to 
be doing anything he said 
no one wants to see kids wreaking havoc at their local malls but 
a little goofing off is to be expected said carolyn kennedy 
general manager at assembly square mall in nearby somerville 
shopping centers are a gathering place kids dont have malt 
shops anymore she said they need a place to go

the international trade commission cleared the 
way for a duty on imports of subsidized canadian pork ruling monday 
that the shipments have hurt american meatpackers 
however canada is contesting the duty before a twonation panel 
set up by the uscanada free trade agreement and could appeal the 
commissions 32 ruling 
the commerce department imposed the 3centperpound duty in 
july but the commission was required to find that american 
producers were being injured by the canadian subsidy 
canadian pork imports present a real and imminent threat to the 
domestic industry said commissioner david b rohr 
todays decision is a victory for us pork producers and fair 
trade said don gingerich president of the national pork 
producers council the countervailing duty should send a clear 
signal to the canadian pork industry to curb its excess production 
imports of canadian pork products have increased by more than 52 
percent since 1984 according to the producers group 
the duty applies to shipments of subsidized fresh chilled and 
frozen pork from canada the commerce department imposed the duty 
after determining that canadian payment programs amount to a subsidy 
on pork the revenue was put into escrow until the commission ruled 
canadian pork representatives petitioned last week for the 
appeals panel to review the commerce departments decision and the 
canadian government expressed disappointment with the commissions 
decision monday 
we do not agree with this ruling said canadian agriculture 
minister don mazankowski in our view the canadian industry had 
made a compelling case before the commission for a noinjury finding 
in this investigation 
commission chairman anne brunsdale who voted against the 
commissions finding said she did not think the canadian subsidy 
was a significant threat to us meatpackers 
she said canadian pork imports amounted to just 04 percent of 
us production 
rep tim johnson dsd wrote president bush monday urging him 
to raise the issue of pork imports when he meets wednesday with 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
truckloads of subsidized canadian pork products are being 
dumped over the border where they unfairly undercut producers from 
south dakota and other states johnson said

president bush on monday praised 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev for being extraordinarily 
understanding of the changes taking place in eastern europe and 
expressed hope that change can continue peacefully both outside the 
soviet union and within it 
the president also said it wil take a lot more money than his 
119 million aid package to help poland rebuild its economy but 
said that political and economic reforms must come first 
bush said that once reforms take hold in poland more aid will be 
forthcoming from the international financial institutions that help 
developing countries 
the president spoke with reporters on the lawn outside his 
oceanfront home after getting a firsthand report from labor 
secretary elizabeth dole and senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan on their justcompleted visit to poland and their talks with 
the countrys new leaders 
asked whether the soviet communist partys criticism of the 
baltic nationalism movement might be a prelude to a crackdown the 
president said i hope not 
gorbachev has told officials of the lithuanian communist party 
that the baltic republic has gone too far in its drive for 
independence an activist said monday 
in vilnius lithuania romaldus ozolus a member of the governing 
council or sejm of the sajudis grassroots movement said he and 
four colleagues met with lithuanian communist party chief algirdas 
brazauskas after gorbachev called the lithuanian party leader on 
friday and sunday to express his concern 
bush said i think that mr gorbachevs reaction to the changes 
in poland were extraordinarily understanding and certainly not 
militant in any way and i hope that would be the tone as the rapid 
change thats taking place in eastern europe goes forward not just 
in poland but in other countries as well 
i must say the way mr gorbachev has handled this and reacted 
to it has been very positive the president said 
lets hope that change continues to take place peacefully and 
not only outside the soviet union but in it we want to see 
perestroika succeed he said 
bush said that if solidarity leader lech walesa visits the united 
states later this year i certainly will meet with him 
on another topic bush declined to say what advice he would give 
colombian minister of justice monica de greiff if she seeks asylum 
in the united states its too hypothetical for me to answer that 
question he said 
the doles made a detour here on their way home from europe after 
visiting morocco armenia poland and the netherlands they brought 
bush a letter from walesa as well as their own letter outlining the 
urgency of the appeals they heard for help from polish leaders 
including new prime minister tadeusz mazowecki and president wojiech 
jaruzelski the former communist party chief 
the doles also brought bush greetings from moroccos king hassan 
who has been in the midst of efforts to end the strife in lebanon 
mrs dole said of poland it was incredible and it was really 
awesome to be there at this particular time in the history of 
poland 
she said the poles appreciate the help bush has already 
proferred theyre seeking more foreign investment and hoping that 
our banks will establish branches in poland and theyre 
concerned about food they feel that some change there within the 
short term is important because the shelves are empty and they need 
more food mrs dole said 
her husband the kansas senator said polish leaders all 
indicated some urgency and one used the word emergency 
we came away with the feeling that maybe the time is not great 
maybe its 60 days maybe its three months walesa said yesterday 
maybe its six months to a year the people need to see a change 
the senator said 
he added they dont want to be a welfare client they want 
investments they want banks they want opportunities and its 
going to take a while to change that system after 45 years to a 
market economy 
asked if he felt 119 million was enough bush said i think to 
satisfy all the requirements of poland it could take a lot more 
money than that but its also got to take political reform its 
got to take economic reform so that when they talk about investment 
and privatization something really happens 
and once those reforms are in place and on forward then you 
will find that your multilateral financial institutions will be in a 
much better place to help said bush who added that he hopes that 
support will build in congress for those lending institutions 
mrs dole said her department will dispatch a team to help poland 
on such matters as job training and unemployment insurance once the 
new government selects a labor minister 
the doles made the sidetrip here via a marine helicopter after 
landing at pease air force base in neighboring new hampshire on 
their way home to washington they were joined by rep bob mcewen 
rohio and his wife liz who visited poland separately and picked 
up with the doles in the netherlands 
walt riker the senators aide said the doles called bush on 
sunday to request the meeting because of their own sense of urgency 
theres a limited window of opportunity now in poland riker 
said 
dole said the devastation in armenia from last decembers 
earthquake was heartrending and he said 700000 people are 
still homeless from the disaster that killed 35000 to 50000 
armenians 
bush meantime went fishing but failed to catch anything 
keeping intact a bad streak that began aug 16 the first day of his 
vacation

a decision by local authorities to 
prosecute mothers whose babies test positive for drugs has civil 
libertarians afraid the threat of criminal charges will deter 
addicts from seeking prenatal care 
four infants born with cocaine or heroin in their systems have 
been taken from their mothers in the last month and placed in foster 
homes or protective custody 
the solicitors office responsible for greenville and pickens 
counties has charged three of the mothers and the parents of the 
fourth mother a 15yearold girl with child neglect no trial 
dates have been set 
authorities said it is necessary to prosecute these women to 
force them to get treatment for their addictions 
the policy drew criticism from the american civil liberties 
union which fears women will shy away from seeking prenatal care or 
treatment for addiction for fear their newborns will be taken away 
and they will be prosecuted 
the greenvillepickens policy makes it a crime to be 
pregnant said lynn paltrow staff attorney for the aclu in new 
york 
assuming these women really took drugs addiction is a 
physiological health problem ms paltrow said its an illness 
that needs treatment 
solicitor joseph j watsons district in greenville and pickens 
counties has a population of 367000 the district in northwestern 
south carolina is a mix of rural and industrial areas with industry 
concentrated near greenville 
the south carolina county is one of the first in the nation to 
expand a criminal child neglect charge to cover drugabusing mothers 
conviction carries up to 10 years in prison but only probation 
and treatment will be recommended assistant solicitor catherine 
chrisotophillis said 
elsewhere illinois gov james r thompson signed a law thursday 
expanding childneglect law to protect newborns who test positive 
for illegal drugs 
in florida a woman whose two children tested positive for 
cocaine was placed on 15 years probation friday for drug delivery 
a charge routinely used against drug dealers a judge ruled she 
delivered drugs via the umbilical cord 
similar cases in at least three other states california texas 
and ohio have been dismissed 
prosecuting women for using drugs while pregnant is necessary to 
identify such women who might not otherwise come forward for 
treatment watson and ms christophillis said they said it should 
not deter women from seeking prenatal care 
i feel if we can rehabilitate the mothers now we can save 
another baby being born ms christophillis said 
watson acknowledged however that to emphasize the punishment 
side of things could potentially drive mothers away from the 
hospital 
watson said women whose infants showed signs of fetal alcohol 
syndrome would also be prosecuted

president bush on monday recommended 
to congress a 36 percent pay raise for federal employees 
formalizing an agareement worked out last spring 
the raise agreed upon by congressional leaders and the 
administration would be effective in january 1990 
a letter containing the formal recommendation from bush to house 
speaker thomas foley was released by the travelling white house 
accompanying bush on his vacation in kennebunkport 
bush wrote that the governments pay advisory commission had 
concluded a pay raise of 286 percent would be consistent with 
current provisions requiring federal government pay to be comparable 
with privatesector pay 
however bush noted he has the power to alter the comparability 
rules in the case of national emergency or economic conditions 
affecting the general welfare 
he said that 286 percent raise would be unacceptable because of 
adverse budgetary and economic effects 
initially bush had proposed a 2 percent federal pay increase in 
his 1990 budget request 
in addition bush has previously recommended pay increases of up 
to 25 percent for some top level federal executives although 
legislation pending in the house would freeze that pay and that of 
judges 
we feel there is a better alternative to the house proposal 
white house spokesman steve hart said monday in reference to the 
presidents pay increase propoals for senior executives and judges

violence against people and property as well as statements urging 
the communities to confront each other 
a joint statement said the two agreed the town will have a new

soviet activist andrei sakharov visited 
labor camps in search of raoul wallenberg this year but found no 
trace of the swedish diplomat missing since 1945 svenska dagbladet 
newspaper said monday 
a swedish foreign ministry official confirmed the soviet human 
rights activist recently elected a legislator was pursuing 
wallenbergs fate he also said the ministry has released previously 
classified documents to the newspaper 
svenska dagbladet quoted documents as relating that sakharov 
heard of another longterm prisoner in the soviet union who the 
paper concluded may have been confused with wallenberg 
the swedish diplomat is credited with rescuing tens of thousands 
of hungarian jews from nazi extermination before he was arrested in 
1945 by soviet troops entering budapest 
soviet officials say files discovered in 1957 show wallenberg 
died of natural causes in prison 10 years earlier but other 
prisoners reported seeing wallenberg long after he allegedly died 
he would be 77 years old now 
vollrath tham the foreign ministry official in charge of 
wallenbergs case confirmed sakharov had visited labor camps to 
seek word of the missing man sakharovs last communication was in 
march he said 
tham declined to disclose further information he said 
substantial parts of the wallenberg file remain classified and 
were withheld from svenska dagbladet 
the paper said it examined more than 6000 pages of documents 
it reported a december conversation between sakharov and andrs 
wijkman head of the swedish red cross 
sakharov told wijkman that acting on information from a swedish 
source he and his wife yelena bonner searched for wallenberg at two 
labor camps near torzhok 125 miles northwest of moscow but found 
no trace of him 
the nobel peace prize winner also reported learning about a 
recently released prisoner called einar marcus who helped save jews 
in czechoslovakia from nazi deportation 
marcus who apparently is of swedish descent had told a friend 
of sakharov about his wartime service and that like wallenberg he 
was arrested at the end of the war 
the paper concluded that if the story is correct several people 
who reported seeing a swedish diplomat in prison may have met 
marcus not wallenberg 
sakharov suggested sweden send an envoy to talk to marcus who 
now lives in syktyvkar 600 miles northeast of moscow 
on sunday soviet television broadcast a report on wallenberg for 
the first time and appealed to anyone who had any information on him 
to step forward 
the broadcast was the latest sign of glasnost or openness on 
the case which soviet authorities had tried to bury for years 
no reason was ever given for wallenbergs arrest but it is 
assumed he was mistaken for a spy

neptunes icy volcanic moon triton is the 
coldest body ever measured in the solar system nasa said monday 
and the planet itself has something in common with los angeles smog 
the voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like 
earths northern lights on neptune and triton scientists said 
looking backward 32 million miles voyager 2 on monday snapped a 
series of family portraits of neptune and triton appearing as 
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun 
earlier voyager 2s ultraviolet detector determined that 
tritons surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
making the moon the coldest body we have seen in the solar 
system said roger yelle of the university of arizona 
scientists believe pluto and its moon charon are the 
secondcoldest bodies in the solar system 
in another finding the best closeup photo yet of another moon 
1989 n1 showed that neptunes secondlargest moon has a huge crater 
about half as wide as the lumpylooking 240milewide satellite 
that indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 n1 
one of six moons discovered since june by voyager according to 
bradford smith the leader of voyagers photographic imaging team 
voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find 
liquid lakes or oceans on triton but the moon almost certainly is 
too cold to have them said torrence johnson a scientist at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory here 
johnson defended the theory advanced by other scientists sunday 
that triton has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles 
20 miles skyward it isnt a crazy idea he said 
voyagers close encounter with neptune occurred thursday night 
and it passed triton on friday capping its epic tour of the four 
outer planets including jupiter saturn and uranus 
the probe has also found five rings including three thin ones 
and two broad bands of dust 
1989 n1 took nereids place as neptunes secondlargest moon 
after triton n1 and the other five moons discovered by voyager in 
addition to triton and nereid which were discovered from earth 
have not yet been permanently named 
the latest data returned by voyagers ultraviolet light sensor 
revealed auroras somewhat like earths northern and southern lights 
over wide sections of neptunes skies and over much of tritons day 
side said yelle 
but unlike earths auroras which glow in visible light as 
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases the 
auroras on neptune and triton are invisible to the human eye thats 
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles 
excite hydrogen gas 
sunlight hitting natural gas or methane high in neptunes 
atmosphere converts it into photochemical smog that forms a 
90milethick icy layer at the bottom of neptunes stratosphere 
said jim pollock an imaging team member from nasas ames research 
center in mountain view calif 
smith said smog on neptune and in los angeles have definite 
similarities although los angeles smog has components absent on 
neptune 
finding smog on neptune is no surprise smith said 
photochemical smog exists any place planet or moon weve been 
that has an atmosphere in los angeles the problem is its 
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts 
exceeding anything weve seen except on titan saturns smoggy 
moon 
auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles 
from the solar wind spiral toward a planets magnetic poles along 
magnetic field lines on earth the magnetic poles are tilted only 
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates so 
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions 
neptunes major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from 
its rotational poles and scientists have said the planet may have 
multiple magnetic poles that could explain why neptunes auroras 
appear over wide areas of the planet 
tritons aurora is created differently electrically charged 
particles in neptunes orbiting radiation belt discovered recently 
by voyager excite gases in tritons atmosphere to create its 
auroras said andy chen of johns hopkins university 
by 9 am pdt tuesday voyager will be 2759 billion miles from 
earth and 4097 million miles beyond neptune slowly decelerating as 
it speeds toward the stars at 37582 mph 
nasa engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming 
voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in 
the coming months said lanny miller manager of the flight 
engineering office

police on monday questioned two former israeli 
military officers about reports they trained gunmen for colombian 
cocaine bosses one said the civilians he trained may have later 
been hired by drug lords 
foreign minister moshe arens said monday on army radio that 
israel will make every effort to prevent israelis from working as 
mercenaries in latin america declaring we will do everything in 
our power to enforce the law and prevent all aid by israelis to the 
drug cartel 
lt col yair klein said in an interview shortly before being 
questioned by police that the force we trained was so strong that 
the drug dealers wanted them for their own and with the money they 
have they probably succeeded 
klein a former paratrooper who once headed an elite antiterror 
squad said he regretted getting involved in colombia even though at 
the time he believed he was only training farmers to defend their 
cattle against marauding guerrillas 
if i had known who these people were and where they ended up i 
wouldnt have done it said klein 
also questioned was reserve lt col amatzia shueli a former 
commando who worked with klein as a shooting instructor in colombia 
police went to kleins farmhouse after questioning him for nine 
hours and confiscated documents israel radio said 
klein and shueli were asked to leave their passports with police 
it added 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said israel will fully investigate 
the affair but added i know our officers and i cannot believe 
that they have been involved in such crimes 
in tel aviv klein said he was no more guilty than other israelis 
who trained paramilitary groups in latin america 
if i did break the law a lot of other people did klein said 
on army radio as he walked into the criminal affairs division of the 
petah tikva police station near tel aviv 
israeli sources speaking on condition of anonymity estimated 
dozens of former officers were involved in training nongovernment 
groups 
klein said on sunday he would name highranking officers and a 
member of parliament who were involved in training paramilitary 
forces in latin america he declined to identify them monday 
yehoshua saguy a former chief of military intelligence and now a 
parliament member of the rightwing likud bloc said on israel radio 
he visited colombia in 1986 as a representative of an electronics 
firm he said he met with the defense minister but concluded no 
deals 
the newspaper yediot ahronot quoted former maj gen rahamim 
zeevi as saying he visited colombia several times on business but 
always had government authorization zeevi who now represents the 
moledet party in parliament once was kleins commander 
klein said he and three other retired israeli officers held two 
threeweek weapons courses for civilians starting in april 1988 he 
said his hod hahanit spearhead company trained groups of 30 
farmers and ranchers to defend themselves from guerrillas 
hod hahanit said israeli defense ministry authorization was not 
required because he was training civilians 
klein said the colombian army initially encouraged his work but 
that he shut down and fled the country shortly after trying to set 
up a third course 
for the third course we saw something was going wrong he 
said we were no longer getting ammunition from the army and 
officers stopped visiting our training camp 
he said he was paid 20000 a course and each instructor received 
2000 
klein retired from the army in 1978 and founded hod hahanit in 
1985 after operating a restaurant and then a gas station 
there are officers like me who at the height of their abilities 
leave the army and settle on a lowpaying pension klein said 
out of frustration with the civilian market they go back to doing 
what they do best 
yediot ahronot said two israelis were arrested in miami in june 
for trying to ship weapons to colombia intended to kill the leader 
of the medellin drug cartel 
us customs authorities identified one as david candiotti 27 
they said he reputedly worked for the rival cali drug cartel and was 
involved in a conspiracy to detonate an explosivespacked drone over 
the hideout of medellin cartel leader pablo escobar gavaria 
in bogota colombian defense minister gen oscar botero restrepo 
said in a statement monday that training there by israeli 
mercenaries was illegal 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo quoted klein as saying in an 
interview that he ignored an israeli embassy warning that he may 
have been training drug traffickers last year believing he was 
dealing with legitimate ranchers 
the ranchers also hired mercenaries from south africa zimbabwe 
ireland and the united states klein was quoted as saying 
kleins training was reportedly done near puerto boyaca 
puerto boyaca 100 miles north of bogota is an area where drug 
traffickers have steadily bought up land and where anyone resisting 
their efforts has been murdered

gerard mortier director of the brussels 
opera was named artistic director of the salzburg festival on 
monday with a mandate to revamp a cultural showcase some critics say 
is elitist and conservative 
his appointment follows the july 16 death of herbert von karajan 
the longtime guiding spirit and conductor of the festival who died 
of a heart attack at age 81 
the board of the festival announced that mortier 46 will take 
over at salzburg on oct 1 1991 but starting next month he will 
help plan festival events to be held after 1991 the austria press 
agency reported 
in another appointment the board named hans landesmann a music 
manager in vienna as the festivals economic director 
the festival has become an old museum unaware of whats going 
on in the world we should give modern music and drama the place 
they deserve landesmann said in an interview 
for years critics said tickets to the salzburg festival cost too 
much and that proceedings were too much under the sway of karajan 
austrian cultural politicians now are trying to open the 
69yearold festival to new forms of art and invite a greater 
variety of musicians 
under a plan outlined in june the unpaid honorary fiveman 
board of the festival will be replaced by a permanent salaried 
threemember board 
we need new forwardthinking people in the management much 
more aware of the contemporary scene said landesmann who is to 
draw up a reform program 
landesmann said he would like to include artists on a new board 
to advise on projects 
he said he would also like to see film and video galas and 
exhibits during the festival 
while not playing down the merits of italian traditional operas 
here every year landesmann proposes to include other composers 
such as richard strauss and alban berg 
there is also talk among festival organizers of devoting the 
2600seat great festival hall to foreign classical opera and the 
little festival hall to mozart productions 
we want a repertoire consistent with the line of mozarts 
heritage something specific typical of salzburg landesmann said 
in an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering figure 
such as karajan he said no permanent conductor will be named 
invitations will go out to wellknown figures such as sir georg 
solti riccardo muti and claudio abbado all of whom are present 
this summer 
karajan was opposed to reforms he was an old man and he didnt 
like changes he was opposed to seeing new people landesmann said 
five years ago government auditors had urged festival organizers 
to spend less 
press chief hans widrich said the festival runs an annual budget 
of 27 million state subsidies total 77 million and the rest 
comes from ticket sales radio and television rights 
salzburg pays some of the highest performer fees in europe and 
charges nearly twice the top ticket prices of other european 
festivals up to 250 for the best seat at the opera

mourners many of whom wiped away tears i really believed he 
would live to fight another day and as i look out and see you

neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years 
ago police said newton died in a dispute over crack cocaine 
tyrone robinson 25 a reputed prison gang member who police say 
has admitted killing newton was being held without bail awaiting 
his arraignment scheduled later monday on a homicide charge

their illegal gains be confiscated it quoted a report monday in 
granma the official newspaper of the cuban communist party 
the trial is the latest chapter in a scandal that has resulted in 
the executions of four officers including a highly decorated 
general who had been with castro since guerrilla days more than 30 
years ago 
castro fired abrantes as interior minister in june when 12 
military officers from the ministry and two from the army were 
charged with drug smuggling and other crimes all were convicted and 
the 10 not executed are serving prison terms of up to 30 years 
prosecutors said abrantes fumbled the drugsmuggling 
investigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate but 
that the evidence did not support a charge of treason prensa latina 
reported 
abrantes knew as early as february that officials of his ministry 
were involved in drug trafficking but did nothing about it the 
prosecution said 
according to prensa latina castro personally ordered abrantes to 
investigate after persistent reports that tons of colombian cocaine 
and jamaican marijuana were moving through cuba to the united states 
abrantes was charged with abusing power neglecting his duties 
and stealing from the government the agency said 
it said prosecutors asked the tribunal to send the former vice 
interior minister gen pascual martinez gil to prison for 15 years 
and requested a 13year term for lt col oscar carreno gomez the 
former customs chief 
abrantes carreno gomez and four others are accused of taking 
money from some of the officers arrested in june prensa latina said 
abrantes allegedly accumulated millions of dollars in an illegal 
fund 
the prosecution said abrantes had a long close relationship with 
col antonio de la guardia one of the officers executed in 
addition to drug charges those arrested in june were accused of 
crimes ranging from diamond smuggling to black marketeering 
prensa latina said abrantes was accused of various illegal 
financial dealings and diverting ministry funds and resources to 
personal use 
felipe aleman cruz the chief prosecutor said abrantes was so 
consumed with dollar fever that he traded in cuban pesos on the 
black market for his own profit 
cuban media have given the corruption scandal an unusual amount 
of coverage and prensa latina has sent dispatches around the world

state officials monday agreed to fight 
deportation of a 9yearold bangladeshi girl who was molested by the 
man who brought her to america then taken from a foster home 
because it wasnt culturally relevant 
earlier the girls foster parents and more than 200 supporters 
fighting her removal and possible deportation marched on the state 
capitol chanting and waving banners demanding help for the 
youngster they call kushi bear 
the girl is one of several members of a bangladeshi family that 
stefan christopher 52 brought to this country a un consultant 
he had married one of the girls older sisters separated from her 
and married another sister age 12 over the years he brought family 
members to work on his oakville farm 
christopher is in jail awaiting sentencing sept 5 after pleading 
guilty to taking indecent liberties with the girl and two other 
children sheriffs department officials said he subjected them to 
physical and psychological torture 
after mondays rally the state child protective services said it 
would review the case and fight deportation spokeswoman irene 
hopman said an education visa would be sought for kushi allowing 
her to remain in the united states indefinitely 
but ms hopman insisted that the child could not remain with her 
foster parents chemical engineer bob martin and his wife betsy 
seidel an english teacher 
she is not adoptable she had been raised a moslem that is her 
familys religion ms hopman said the girls birth parents 
want her educated and raised in the united states but their sect 
does not believe in adoption and they have not relinquished their 
rights 
martin and seidel wept when they were surrounded by supporters 
after hearing the news they had feared the state would allow kushi 
to be sent back to bangladesh where she would be outcast because of 
the sexual abuse 
kushi has a magic that touches everyone martin told the 
rally betsy and i did everything we could within the system but 
it wasnt enough removing kushi was wrong just wrong 
cps workers took khurshida kushi begum from the martinseidel 
home at hoquiam near the pacific ocean last friday declaring it 
wasnt culturally relevant 
the girl has been placed temporarily with her 19yearold sister 
morshida here whose marriage gave kushi entry to the united states 
the girl faces deportation when her visa expires sept 5 
if the placement with her sister doesnt work out three moslem 
families have volunteered their homes ms hopman said 
morshida mother of two children has filed for divorce from 
christopher 52 whom she married when she was 12 
supporters say if the child were returned to her remote village 
she would face life as a social outcast because of her sexual abuse 
shah asadullah a bangladeshi psychiatrist with group health 
medical center in seattle wrote in a letter to cps that if she is 
deported she is likely to become completely outcast and walk the 
streets to survive 
i am shocked by the sudden removal of the child said lawyer 
janet watson who represents martin and seidel in their effort to 
adopt the girl ive never heard of a child being removed by the 
state from an excellent home against the wishes of the child 
the girl said i want to live with them because they love me 
and theyre nice 
a 16yearold cousin of kushis committed suicide last year after 
being abused leading to the sheriffs investigation and removal of 
the children the sheriffs office said 
state officials said they have been unable to directly contact 
the illiterate parents in bangladesh three letters have not been 
answered said ms hopman 
she said efforts to reach them will be stepped up and that the 
immigration and naturalization service will be asked to provide an 
education visa which would allow her to remain in the united states 
until her education is completed 
but kushis brother sultan 21 who lives in seattle said in an 
interview that kushis parents dont mind if their daughter stays 
with martin and seidel 
i write them and they say its ok they dont know about this 
adoption this country is very hard my parents cant understand 
he said 
they said its ok if she happy if she goes to school they 
poor they dont have nothing thats why its ok

avanti automotive corp won a twoyear reprieve 
monday from having to install air bags or motorized seat belts in 
its convertibles 
the national highway traffic safety administration said it 
granted an exemption from passive restraint requirements because 
complying would cause substantial economic hardship for the 
struggling car company 
avantis passive restraint exemption is the only one granted for 
1990 modelyear cars nhtsa spokesman tim hurd said 
the companys hardtop models still must comply with the passive 
restraint requirement 
in seeking the exemption avanti noted its importance to 
youngstown ohio a oncethriving steel center now racked with high 
unemployment 
avanti affords job opportunities to an economically depressed 
area its payroll approximately 250000 a month other jobs have 
been created by suppliers to avanti said the notice published in 
the federal register 
the company which employs about 190 workers was given 8 
million worth of incentives to bring its plant to youngstown 
avanti said it lost 2 million between june 1 1988 and nov 30 
1988 the most recent financial statements made available to nhtsa 
the company which intends to produce about 200 convertibles a 
year had asked for a threeyear exemption 
nhtsa said it would consider extending the exemption if 
necessary but wanted to take into account whether the company 
follows through with interim plans to make a combination roll 
barautomatic seat belt to be sold as optional equipment for the 
convertibles which sell for a base price of 47982 
its just one of those decisions that is so dumb it speaks for 
itself said clarence ditlow director of the center for auto 
safety we feel that air bags are such an important lifesaving 
technology that there shouldnt be any exemptions from the 
standard 
ditlow of the nonprofit organization founded by consumer 
advocate ralph nader said the company should have been required to 
buy air bag technology from another manufacturer 
avanti has known for five years now six years actually that 
they have to meet the standard he said consumers shouldnt buy 
the car there are other convertibles out there with air bags

a federal judge has eliminated one of 
occidental chemical corps main defenses in a lawsuit over 
liability for cleaning up the infamous love canal toxic dump 
according to a decision made public monday 
us district judge john curtin ruling in a lawsuit filed by the 
state rejected occidentals claim that the company had relinquished 
liability when it sold the love canal land to the niagara falls 
school board 
occidental owner of the former hooker chemical and plastic co 
that used love canal as a waste dump contended it wasnt 
responsible for the site after 1953 when it sold the land on which 
a school was subsequently built 
state attorney general robert abrams said the ruling was a 
great victory for the state 
it lays to rest occidentals principal defense that selling the 
landfill to a school district relieved the company of its 
responsibility for the harmful health effects caused by occidentals 
dumping on the land he said 
occidental actually palmed off what it knew to be an enormous 
toxic waste site for 1 the attorney general said 
curtin in a judgment dated friday also extended occidentals 
liability for the cost of cleaning up love canal to include 
liability under the states nuisance law last year curtin said the 
company was liable under the federal superfund law 
some estimates on the cost of cleaning up love canal where 
occidental acknowledges that 20000 tons of chemical wastes were 
dumped in the 1940s and 1950s exceed 250 million 
new york state is one of several parties including the federal 
government and former area residents suing occidental over love 
canal 
we just received the courts decision late this afternoon and 
have not yet had the chance to review it said occidental 
spokesman john stuart however given the courts previous summary 
judgment ruling against occidental in february 1988 on the question 
of liability under superfund this decision is not completely 
unexpected 
in 1978 love canal became synonymous with environmental disaster 
when state officials ordered an evaculation of children and pregnant 
women from the area because of leaking chemicals 
president carter designated the 10block site as a federal 
emergency area in 1978 and the federal environmental protection 
agency began a lawsuit against the company the following year 
other issues involving occidentals liability and damages will 
probably be the subject of future trials curtin has deliberated the 
case for 10 years

a runaway train that careened off 
its tracks into a row of houses killing four people was going 
faster and had less braking capacity and more weight than indicated 
in preliminary reports federal officials said monday 
the derailment and a deadly explosion of an underground pipeline 
that occurred 13 days later in the crash area are the subject of a 
fiveday national transportation safety board inquiry the hearing 
began monday 
in addition to focusing on the trains mechanics the hearing is 
addressing the crews response to the emergency local efforts to 
determine the pipelines safety after the derailment also were 
examined 
the southern pacific freight train with 69 cars and six 
locomotives was traveling between 105 mph and 110 mph when it 
derailed may 12 william pugh the ntsb investigator in charge told 
the hearing 
initial estimates of a train speed of 90 mph as it swooped down 
from a mountain pass were discarded after a computer analysis of the 
accident said board chairman lee dickenson 
the train crested the summit of cajon pass at 30 mph with 
engineer frank holland believing the loaded train weighed 6151 tons 
and had full braking capability on at least four locomotives 
according to testimony by holland and pugh 
but the accident investigation has found the weight of the train 
was about 8900 tons and that possibly only two of the locomotive 
had dynamic braking capability which dickenson described as 
akin to downshifting on a car to help slow it 
the train could have been halted if it was at the weight holland 
used in his calculations dickenson said during a hearing break 
pugh said the weight for the cars which were loaded with a 
mineral called trona had not been provided by the shipper lakes 
minerals corp in order to satisfy a computer requirement for 
preparation of the weigh bills the weight was estimated he said 
a routine test had indicated braking problems with one locomotive 
and intermittent problems with another holland said two helper 
locomotives were added to the train at oban before the cajon pass 
at hollands request 
but the engineer said he was not informed that one of the helper 
units also lacked dynamic braking capability 
the board also heard from witnesses to the may 25 gas explosion 
that killed two people and injured 30 in a san bernardino 
neighborhood a total of 17 homes were destroyed in the derailment 
and explosion 
james knight deputy chief of the san bernardino fire department 
told the ntsb panel that he spoke with a representative of the 
calnev pipe line co after the train wreck and recommended that the 
entire line be unearthed and examined for possible damage he also 
recommended that the gas inside be removed if possible and 
replaced with water 
the line supplies 90 percent of las vegas gas and nearly all the 
jet fuel to george and edwards air force bases 
they said they planned to uncover the pipeline knight said 
did they he was asked 
no 
knight who said that calnev had uncovered and examined only 
three areas of the pipeline added that he did not have the 
jurisdiction to influence the companys actions

american jewish leaders and a mass circulation british newspaper 
assailed cardinal jozef glemp of poland on monday for his weekend 
remarks on the furor over a convent at auschwitz death camp calling 
his comments antisemitic 
the daily mirror paper said in an editorial that the roman 
catholic prelates stand must have had the backing of pope john paul 
ii 
the cardinal has tapped into the deep vein of antisemitism 
which has existed in his country for a thousand years he would not 
have done so without the knowledge of the pope himself a pole it 
said 
kalman sultanik vice president of the world jewish congress 
said in new york on monday cardinal glemps grotesque and 
hatefilled remarks have been strongly condemned by solidarity and 
revealed that an ugly vein of antisemitism runs through the polish 
church 
glemp suggested in an address on saturday to pilgrims at jasna 
gora monastery in czestochowa poland that jews were being 
antipolish in objecting to the existence of a carmelite convent at 
auschwitz site of a nazi german death camp set up in poland mainly 
to exterminate jews 
he asked jews worldwide to halt their objections saying if 
there would be no antipolonism there will be no antisemitism in 
our country 
glemp was responding to international criticism of the abrogation 
by the church on aug 10 of a 1987 pledge to move the convent from 
the camp perimeter many jewish groups consider the convent an 
intrusion at the site 
a james rudin chairman of interreligious affairs of the 
american jewish committee said in new york on monday were in a 
spiritual gridlock and the kind of rhetoric of cardinal glemp 
doesnt help he seems to be reviving some of the antijewish 
canards of the past 
rudin said glemps comment raises the anger of many people and 
feeds into the antijewish stereotypes of some polish people that we 
thought we had overcome i hope that wont be the final word from 
cardinal glemp 
rabbi avi weiss of the riverdale section of new york city one of 
seven jews who demonstrated on july 14 at the convent at auschwitz 
said glemp was quoted as saying a squad of seven new york jews 
launched an attack against the convent but did not kill the nuns or 
destroy the convent only because they were stopped 
weiss said monday in new york glemps statement is as close to 
a blood libel as one can come were calling upon the vatican to 
discipline cardinal glemp 
the seven demonstrators were roughly dragged away by workmen at 
the camp 
weiss said that jacek kuron a leader of the solidarity union in 
poland told him i feel very much ashamed as a pole for what 
happened to you 
the daily mirror said in its editorial the butchers were 
german nazis and their renegade allies but when cardinal glemp 
spoke warmly of the improving relations with polands old enemies 
germany and russia he used dangerously inflammatory language 
against the jews 
he tried to justify his own shameless bad faith in tearing up a 
solemn agreement that a carmelite convent would be removed from 
auschwitz a place which the holocaust made holy to jews 
the polish catholic church had given its word that the nuns 
would be moved by last february cardinal glemp broke it without a 
qualm and now that the jews insist that he keeps the promise he 
accuses them of violating polands sovereignty 
in the name of god what does he hope to gain by fanning the 
embers of hate

a prosecutor said in court monday that former 
officials of the mexican government may be implicated in connection 
with the torture murder of us drug agent enrique camarena 
the comments by assistant us attorney jimmy gurule came during 
a federal hearing at which he won the continued imprisonment of a 
material witness who is the brotherinlaw of former mexican 
president luis echeverria 
the prosecutor told us district judge edward rafeedie that the 
political clout of ruben zuno arce makes him a key witness in 
the ongoing probe of camarenas 1985 murder 
gurule said the government now believes that corrupt political 
officials and law enforcement officers at higher levels were 
present at a guadalajara home during a brutal interrogation of 
camarena in the hours before he was murdered 
gurules courtroom comments were made to support continued 
imprisonment of zuno who has been held since aug 9 as a material 
witness without any charges filed against him 
zuno testified before a grand jury last thursday but gurule said 
he did not conclude the questioning and wants him to return next 
thursday 
rafeedie asked for a general indication of the testimony in order 
to decide whether to keep the witness in prison 
there were denials regarding his association with narcotics 
traffickers said gurule but there were admissions of his 
association with political officials at the highest level 
including president lopez portillo he could place calls 
and the president of mexico would answer immediately he had that 
type of political clout 
gurule said he believes that zuno acted as a gobetween for 
politicians and drug traffickers including rafael caro quintero 
caro has been accused of ordering camarenas execution and is 
awaiting trial in mexico 
camarena allegedly was tortured and murdered at a home that caro 
bought indirectly from zuno gurule said the government wants 
information about transfer of the property 
the kidnapping and torture murder of camarena and his pilot 
alfredo zavalaavelar became an international incident the drug 
enforcement administration has vowed to bring in every person 
involved in the murders several members of the mexican federal 
police force were linked to the killings and one raul lopez 
alvarez was convicted last year along with two drug traffickers 
camarena and zavala were killed after the narcotics agent led a 
series of damaging raids on marijuana plantations allegedly operated 
by caro authorities have said 
camarenas body was found march 5 1985 on a ranch 65 miles 
southeast of guadalajara 
seven more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the 
case including caro this month a grand jury indicted yet another 
defendant former mexican police officer juan jose bernabe ramirez 
his trial is set for oct 3 and the government wants zuno to testify 
against him 
zunos lawyers argued futilely for his immediate release saying 
he has been roughed up while in custody and is being denied 
visits with his wife who is echeverrias sister 
i dont think they could do this with an american citizen 
said attorney edward medvene just because hes mexican its not 
fair 
rafeedie who ordered prison officials to allow visits by zunos 
wife ordered zunos continued imprisonment while he concludes his 
testimony before the grand jury after that the judge said he 
wants lawyers to file briefs on why the witness cannot be released 
the judge scheduled a hearing for sept 5 to consider zunos 
future status 
outside court gurule declined to comment on when further 
indictments might be expected in the camarena case saying only 
we are hopeful there will be more to come

colombias justice minister and attorney 
general dick thornburgh on monday discussed extradition of colombian 
drug traffickers wanted here and tighter security for judges in that 
embattled nation 
monica de greiff accompanied by top colombian law enforcement 
and military officials discussed the implementation of us aid to 
stem the wave of assassinations of colombian judges by the drug 
lords the justice department said in a statement issued after an 
hourlong meeting 
besides the extradition of some 80 colombian drug traffickers 
wanted by us authorities ms de greiff and thornburgh also 
discussed training and equipping colombian police and armed forces 
for the war against the medellin cocaine cartel the department said 
the discussions which for a time included john c lawn head of 
the us drug enforcement administration also touched on getting 
help for the colombian judiciary from other nations the department 
said 
the meeting came just hours after colombian president virgilio 
barco in bogota put to rest rumors that his 32yearold justice 
minister had decided to resign in the face of death threats from 
drug cartel leaders worried about possible extradition to the united 
states 
in bogota the us ambassador thomas mcnamara met with foreign 
minister julio londono paredes no details of their 20minute 
meeting were available 
ms de greiff arrived at the justice department and later left 
under heavy security provided by the drug enforcement administration 
and the fbi 
as reports circulated about a death threat against ms de 
greiffs 3year old son state department spokesman richard boucher 
acknowledged that continued violence against enemies of cartel 
chieftains was a serious danger 
ms de greiff was being housed in a location that was being kept 
secret for security reasons 
thornburgh has said he expects that colombian authorities will 
deliver to us officials this week eduardo martinez romero who was 
arrested recently as part of a government crackdown against the 
cartel martinez has been under us indictment since march 
ms de greiffs apparent decision to remain on the job rather 
than resign in the face of death threats spared barco an additional 
setback in his efforts to gain the upper hand in the struggle 
against the cocaine traffickers de greiff who was appointed only 
six weeks ago is the eighth colombian justice minister in three 
years 
as i understand it our contacts through the us embassy 
indicate that president barco has denied that she has resigned 
said white house spokesman roman popadiuk speaking to reporters at 
president bushs vacation retreat in kennebunkport maine 
the drug traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every 
trafficker sent to the united states to face trial 
as part of the us effort to assist colombia in its crackdown 
the white house announced last friday a 65 million military aid 
program in addition the justice department is providing 2 million 
to help protect colombian judges 
in another development bush declined to discuss reports hes 
considering the use of covert military actions to help colombia 
teeing off for a golf game bush was asked about a newsweek 
report which said that he was weighing such support for barcos 
crackdown 
if i discussed covert action it wouldnt be covert i dont 
discuss that kind of thing at all he replied bush cautioned 
however that his reply should not be interpreted as a yes or a no 
or a confirm or a deny 
bush was briefed on the colombia situation by national security 
adviser brent scowcroft 
an administration official speaking on grounds of anonymity 
said bush would like to use us military teams and special forces 
to help barco but the presidents hands are tied by barcos own 
statements that he does not want such assistance the source said 
justice department spokesman david runkel meanwhile said 
federal prosecutors were concerned that some of their cases against 
80 colombian drug dealers charged with violating us laws have 
gone stale while the suspects remained at large in latin america 
witnesses could disappear or other evidentiary problems 
could have arisen with the passage of time since the suspects were 
charged by us authorities runkel said 
its not as easy a matter as saying we brought the indictment 
the person is here runkel said there is some concern that 
some of these cases may have gone stale 
justice department prosecutors are reviewing the cases against 
the 80 defendants to determine which ones can still be proven in 
court if the suspects are caught and brought to the united states 
for trial when we have a strong case and we can get our hands on 
that person we will bring a case runkel said 
on tuesday bush is to huddle with thornburgh drug policy 
director william j bennett and other top administration officials 
at the presidents compound in maine to discuss the drug strategy he 
will unveil sept 5 
the justice department said that thornburgh will report to bush 
about his meeting with ms de greiff 
also in attendance at the justice department meeting were 
colombian ambassador victor mosquera gen camilo zuniga chief of 
the armed forces intelligence gen armondo casadiego subdirector 
of the colombian national police and alberto romero chief of 
intelligence for the colombian equivalent of the fbi

israel spoke on monday of a growing wave of 
antisemitic attacks abroad and urged foreign governments to fight 
the trend as a shameful and disgusting phenomenon 
cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein told foreign reporters at a 
news conference the government was closely monitoring the attacks 
and deeply concerned about them 
israel was founded as a jewish homeland after the nazi holocaust 
killed 6 million jews 
an official from the world zionist organizations information 
department yochanan manor gave figues showing assaults motivated 
by antisemitism on jews rose worldwide from fewer than 200 annually 
in the 1960s to more than 2000 a year at the close of the 1980s 
more than half the current attacks occur in the united states 
manor said 
in the last two years arson attacks against jewish targets and 
attacks on synagogues in the united states and europe doubled he 
said 
manor said most incidents involved antijewish slogans or 
swastikas painted on walls and arson attacks on synagogues 
rubinstein said he believed antisemitic attacks were increasing 
because people were less aware of the repercussions of antisemitism 
more than 40 years after the holocaust 
antisemitism must be treated as a shameful and disgusting 
phenomenon that has no place among civilized people and enlightened 
countries rubinstein said 
he noted the possible influence of the 20monthold palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule in the occupied territories which has 
marred israels image 
the intefadeh rubinstein said using the arabic word for 
uprising may have been used as an excuse for serving as a basis 
of antiisraeli phenomena

a mob of angry antigamblers burned down 
a casino scheduled to open on the st regis mohawk reservation 
indian residents said monday 
the lucky knight casino was heavily damaged in the sunday night 
fire which followed a confrontation between a group of mohawks 
opposed to the gambling parlors and a selfappointed reservation 
security force 
the confrontation also triggered a brief standoff between state 
police and the security force called the warriors society on the 
reservation straddling the uscanadian border in northern new york 
reservation residents said a group of gambling opponents came 
together as a vigilante mob that burned the casino which was 
scheduled to open tuesday and featured slot machines craps tables 
and other games 
it was torched right there said alex jacobs a reporter and 
program director for ckonradio a public radio station 
franklin county fire investigators said monday that arson is 
suspected but the blaze remains under investigation 
casino owner victoria adams said she had just left the building 
when the mob stormed it and set the fire with molotov cocktails she 
said the mob tried to burn other casinos on the reservation but were 
fended off by armed guards 
state police said the conflict involved upwards of 500 
people the incident lasted about six hours

intervene set up their own armed checkpoints just inside the 
reservation

respective strongholds along the perimeter of the reservation which 
was the site of a 10day standoff between troopers and the warriors 
after a gambling raid july 20 by state and federal authorities 
gambling is illegal in new york and state officials have 
contested the tribes right to operate casinos the mohawks contend 
they are not bound by state or federal gambling laws since they 
consider their reservation a sovereign nation

reservation but antigambling indians claim the vote was invalid 
state police and tribal leaders reached an agreement this month 
to resume patrols on the reservation but the warriors society has

jim bakkers fraud and conspiracy trial 
opened monday with a federal prosecutor accusing the tv evangelist 
of fleecing followers he considered tacky so that he could live 
in high style 
a former aide testified that the founder of the ptl television 
ministry said he wanted to be paid like johnny carson and told 
him how top ministry executives took a cut from the money they 
raised 
but bakkers lawyer said in his opening argument that the founder 
of the ptl television ministry was a creative religious genius 
who is unfairly accused 
prosecutors say bakker and other executives at the evangelical 
empire diverted for their own benefit at least 4 million of the 
158 million they raised by selling lifetime partnerships at the 
ministrys resort hotels 
if convicted of all 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy bakker 
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined 5 million 
have a nice day was all the 49yearold evangelist said as he 
entered the courthouse 
meanwhile bakkers wife tammy carried on with their new 
broadcast from orlando fla asking viewers to pray for bakker she 
said she wanted to have the jim and tammy show on the air so 
jim will have something to come home to 
bakker quit ptl amid revelations about his 1980 sexual encounter 
with church secretary jessica hahn and a 265000 payoff to her 
outside the courthouse monday the opening of the trial was 
marked by reporters and spectators vying for seats in the small 
court and two men carrying signs denouncing bakker and several 
other broadcast evangelists 
we just want people to know god isnt playing games anybody 
who reads the bible knew that ptl wasnt right said bob 
eckhardt of columbia sc 
a young woman and a man sold hiphugging bible belts belts 
adorned with small bibles 
a jury was chosen last week the first witness david taggart a 
former personal assistant to bakker testified that bakker was 
involved daily in details of the ministrys fundraising whether 
he was on vacation or not 
taggart and his brother james ptls interior decorator were 
convicted last month of tax evasion each faces 25 years in prison 
and 1 million in fines at sentencing sept 8 
taggart the only witness monday said he testified because it 
might have some impact on my sentencing 
taggart said bakker also told him top ptl executives diverted 
funds for their own use he said some fundraisers got up to 10 
percent of what they took in taggart said 
under bakkers orders taggart spent more than 500000 in ptl 
money to purchase and decorate a condominium for the bakker family 
in highland beach fla in 1982 taggart testified that ptl 
directors did not approve the expenditure until several months later 
bakker complained about salary taggart testified i remember 
mr bakker saying he wanted to be paid like johnny carson he said 
taggart said that during bakkers last 15 months at ptl january 
1986 to march 1987 the minister received nearly 1 million in 
bonuses from the ptl board including a 500000 christmas bonus in 
november 1986 and a 100000 christmas gift that december 
he told the jury about goldplated faucets in bakkers 
fourbedroom sixbath suite at a hotel at heritage usa ptls 
christian theme park in fort mill sc and about gold faucets in 
bakkers office suite bathrooms and his home 
taggart also testified that bakker personally approved using ptl 
money to pay hahn to keep quiet about their sexual encounter 
deborah smith a justice department special prosecutor asked 
taggart if bakker ever discussed the holders of ptl partnerships 
i recall mr bakker looking out the window over the water park 
and heritage grand hotel and complaining that the partners were 
dumb he said he said they would block the buses that were 
coming into the lobby and they would wear their wet bathing suits in 
the lobby of the hotel 
taggart was to take the stand again tuesday 
the prosecution says ptl raised 158 million from 1984 to 1987 by 
promising 1000 donors three nights lodging per year for life in 
hotels at heritage usa during those years bakker and his wife drew 
35 million in bonuses plus other perks prosecutors said 
assistant us attorney jerry miller said the case is about 
cheating people out of their money tricking people out of their 
money by the use of the mails telephone and television 
miller told jurors the money paid for a lavish lifestyle most 
of you wont be able to identify with including 100000 for a 
private jet to take the bakkers clothing to california miller said 
the bakkers had two rolls royces and four mercedes cars including 
one used only to drive bakkers 12yearold son from place to place 
miller said that on one occasion the bakkers delighted by the 
smell of cinnamon buns from a bakery during a trip sent a security 
guard to the store to buy 100 worth of the rolls so they could 
smell them in their hotel suite 
three days later with not a bite taken out of any of them the 
security guard tossed them out miller said 
you will hear evidence of mr bakkers disdain for the people 
he was asking to send money miller said you will hear how he 
described them as tacky because of the way they dressed 
defense attorney george t davis said bakker didnt sell 
anything what happened was gifts or donations this was a 
church davis told the jury 
davis blamed problems at ptl on trusted lieutenants and noted 
that former ptl vice president richard dortch and the taggart 
brothers are convicted felons 
dortch pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in exchange 
for testimony against bakker he was sentenced last week to eight 
years in prison and fined 200000

opposition parties said monday the new 
government that takes over sept 1 will continue the military 
dictatorship but promised they will not take to the streets to 
fight the new regime 
in an official communique the opposition coalition led by the 
christian democratic party called on people to remain alert and 
watchful and determined to impose through peaceful means its 
vocation of democracy justice and freedom 
it did not call on panamanians to protest in the streets as it 
has in the past 
also monday progovernment parties met to discuss the formula 
for a government that takes over sept 1 when the current 
governments term expires without an elected replacement 
two possibilities were being discussed forming a 
civilianmilitary junta or appointing an acting president with 
authority to call elections in the near future 
the government annulled may 7 presidential elections arguing 
us intervention in favor of the opposition distorted the results 
international observers backed opposition claims they won a 
landslide victory 
washington accuses gen manuel antonio noriega commander of the 
panamanian defense forces of canceling the elections in another 
move to fight us attempts to have him removed from power 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on 
drugtrafficking charges he denies the charges as another us 
government plot to discredit him 
oppositon parties refused a government offer to participate in a 
civilianmilitary junta on sept 1 
on sept 2 the government will find that it has not solved the 
economic crisis and its international isolation is worse than it 
was christian democratic leader and former vice presidential 
candidate ricardo arias calderon told the associated press 
he said the new government will be another version of the 
military dictatorship 
the government and opposition failed to agree on a new government 
because the opposition insists that noriega retire the government 
will not consider dimissing the general who wields the real power in 
panama

mediate the dispute

the kremlin cannot trust the polish army in 
case of an eastwest european confrontation but neither can 
western war planners bank on polish troops breaking ranks with their 
soviet allies during a conflict experts say 
it is an unreliable force i think that has been the soviet 
general staff calculation for years and i think it has got to be 
even more the conclusion now that the communists have lost control 
of the polish government said a ross johnson a former rand corp 
expert on warsaw pact military forces who now heads radio free 
europe 
unless the soviets have firm control of polish rail lines they 
would face grave difficulties waging a ground war in europe 
according to analysts who have studied the issue for the pentagon 
ian cutherbertson a british expert on eastern europe said 
the soviets long have realized the unreliability of the polish 
armed forces most of them are earmarked to protect soviet 
communications lines in poland for the group of western forces

robert englund recalls some advice mel brooks 
dispensed when mark hammill fretted about being typed forever as 
luke skywalker as a result of the star wars movies the gospel 
according to brooks never get off the merrygoround while its 
still turning 
says englund i remember mark drinking a beer and watching an 
old mary tyler moore show with me up in laurel canyon he was so 
worried until mel brooks gave him that advice at 20th century fox 
it really made sense to me watching mark and seeing his angst i 
said to mark whats your problem youre starring in star wars 
ive used that advice all through the freddy craze and its 
really kept me focused the merrygorounds going to stop pretty 
soon ill get off nice and gently and go on to other things 
the freddy craze is having another goround this summer with 
nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child its yet another 
encounter with freddy kreuger that charmer with the prune face and 
the steelbladed fingers however the film has opened quite poorly 
falling a staggering 57 percent in its second week of release for a 
take of only 35 million it looks like this could be freddys last 
stand 
for an actor who has performed shakespeare and ibsen englund 
retains a healthy attitude about the character who has dominated his 
career for the past five years 
i do freddy once a year explained englund people accuse 
me of doing it for the money now but ive had a decent career and 
im still doing a lot of other things im even turning down jobs 
because of conflicts in schedule 
i enjoy doing freddy i dont enjoy putting the makeup on 
anymore its a real 2 hour drag once its on its wonderfully 
designed porous so it can breathe i love being able to kid around 
with the crew as freddy on the set i love that its the one time in 
my life on film that i can really be larger than life i can 
exaggerate its the kind of acting thats generally reserved for 
the theater 
the nightmare series is the kind of bonanza of which small 
film companies such as new line cinema dream the original film was 
the creature of the poor mans alfred hitchcock wes craven who 
created such throatgrabbing terror that the 12 million investment 
returned 26 million in tickets sold the cost has risen with each 
sequel but so has the gross 30 million for no 2 45 million for 
no 3 50 million for no 4 
who attends the slice and dice teenoriented movies 
i think the original audience were punk rockers and heavy metal 
kids said englund they discovered the movie on their own 
there was no hype at the beginning because new line didnt have any 
money to advertise 
there was a certain subversiveness a certain anarchy to 
freddy a slight attack on middleclass complacency after all 
elm street what does that stand for picket fences and mowed 
lawns 
with the budgets increasing we changed to more of a fantasy 
and a special effects film the audience has grown with it weve 
gotten the poltergeist audience weve gotten the kid brother and 
sister of the heavy metal and punk kids and their parents too 
without the freddy makeup englund is a pleasant even bland 
looking 40yearold with a short beard and curly blond hair he was 
a california boy who attended northridge state university and the 
university of california at los angeles before studying at the royal 
academy of dramatic art in london 
after playing the classics in the east englund decided to give 
hollywood a try and he appeared in such films as buster and 
billie janmichael vincent stay hungry jeff bridges sally 
field and last of the cowboys henry fonda television brought 
him recognition especially the miniseries v he was also 
obliged to do the subsequent v series 
i was playing the most beatific nerdy little guy the good 
alien the actor said i did the first elm street to meet wes 
craven whom id heard a lot about and also for the challenge of 
doing a character in makeup i figured i was going to be locked into 
the television for five years i wanted to show the town that i 
could do something very very different 
as a slight change of pace englund will appear this autumn in 
the title role of a production of phantom of the opera 
not the musical i have the worst monotone in the world he 
added hastily this is from the original novel

the progressive wing of brazils 
roman catholic church has promised to keep fighting for political 
change on behalf of the nations impoverished multitudes despite 
pope john paul iis warnings that politics is not the business of 
priests 
in latin america religion has too often been utilized to 
justify submission and domination said bishop pedro casaldaliga 
a leader of the progressive wing which is the dominant faction in 
the national conference of brazilian bishops its necessary now 
to stimulate the connection between faith and politics and work for 
greater social justice 
casaldaliga who is spanishborn has received death threats for 
defending indians and landless peasants in his diocese in the 
western state of mato grosso he also has praised nicaraguas 
sandinista government and leftist groups in el salvador and 
guatemala 
last year he received a letter from the vatican criticizing his 
pastoral work and placing restrictions on his visits to central 
america 
but he said he would not be silenced 
i cant accept the separation of life and politics 
casaldaliga said in an interview to renounce my political 
commitments would be equivalent to renouncing my faith 
political involvement was the key message at a meeting of 2000 
delegates representing 100000 ecclesiastical base communities 
churchsponsored social groups set up mainly in poor urban and rural 
areas of brazil 
among the delegates gathering in this poor crimeridden rio de 
janeiro suburb were 95 of brazils 374 bishops 135 priests 100 
nuns and 900 church workers the others were community 
representatives 
the fiveday meeting in july offered workshops on topics such as 
the formation of christians for political participation and 
political militance and the deepening of faith 
casaldaliga described the meeting as especially important 
because it was held despite vatican pressure on the brazilian church 
while the progressives remain dominant in the national conference 
of brazilian bishops the churchs main operational organization 
here it has become more centrist over the past few years largely 
as a result of the appointment of a number of conservative bishops 
by the vatican 
brazilians use the term progressives to describe what in 
other parts of the world are called liberals 
brazilian church leaders were the most prominent critics of the 
military government that ruled from 1964 to 1985 and have frequently 
clashed with the civilian government that followed the bishops 
conference has accused the current administration of president jose 
sarney of corruption and failure to implement a promised agrarian 
reform program 
the brazilian church also has had several well publicized 
disputes with the vatican in recent years 
the rev leonardo boff brazils most prominent progressive 
theologian was ordered to maintain obedient silence for a year 
in 1985 early this year cardinal paulo evaristo arns another 
progressive leader had his sao paulo archdiocese divided into five 
smaller dioceses seriously undermining his influence 
but carlos alberto libanio christo a dominican friar who was 
imprisoned for four years by brazils military government said it 
was essential for church leaders to continue to take stands on 
social questions 
brazil finds itself in very difficult circumstances he added 
in an interview after the conference for example we have a 
foreign debt of 112 billion the highest in the developing world 
and will pay out 12 billion this year alone in interest on it 
solutions to problems such as the debt are eminently political 
the vatican cannot be against politics after all the pope is 
also a head of state 
tomas balduino bishop of goias about 150 miles west of 
brasilia the capital in central brazil stressed the same theme 
politics is key because it concretizes the road to 
liberation he said told a reporter we want liberation not only 
in the realm of theology but in practice as well 
but balduino though admitting to past tensions between the 
brazilian church and the vatican said he saw no danger of a major 
confrontation with rome 
the pope has benefited from our interchanges and so have we 
he said 
bishop adriano hypolito of nova iguacu near rio who was briefly 
kidnapped and tortured in 1976 by rightwing vigilantes because of 
his criticism of the military government said all the churchs 
social work is political we have the right to form people and that 
formation has to be for the common good 
hypolito was one of five brazilian bishops to receive critical 
letters from the vatican last october he did not want to discuss 
the contents in an interview but brazilian press accounts have said 
he had been sharply rebuked for opening paths for ideological 
groups in his diocese 
the letter was not really serious he said it was like a 
note from a father to a son reminding him to take care crossing the 
street i have no fears about the future 
another sign the progressives intend to continue their political 
activism came a week after the conference 
bishop mauro morelli whose diocese was host to the conference 
endorsed the presidential campaign of luis inacio lula da silva of 
the socialist workers party in the nov 15 presidential elections 
although the pope has frequently insisted that church leaders stay 
out of party politics 
the workers party was born out of the peoples struggle and 
has serious proposals morelli said in his endorsement i dont 
vote for friends but for ideologies

this is one of a series of occasional reports by 
associated press correspondents on farming and farm life in other 
countries 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the realities of modern farming are 
intruding upon the cosy world of the channel islands where men and 
women lovingly raise real jersey and guernsey cows 
todays dairy farmers on the britishcrown islands off france 
have become much more competitive and as they have modernized they 
have concentrated their cows into a smaller number but larger more 
efficient herds 
that the farmers say ultimately is not good for the two famous 
breeds 
still the cows are delicately looked after 
every evening at about 7 oclock philip romeril goes out to the 
field behind his 18thcentury farmhouse to check on his 60 jerseys 
their golden brown hides glow in the soft receding summer light 
their tails swish and their round brown eyes blink they have names 
like carol and marie and they ooze contentment 
romeril scratches the tops of a few heads tugs at a floppy ear 
here and there runs his hand over a pregnant cows bulge 
and then he has a chat with them 
people think im crazy because i talk to my cows romeril 
said but its important a cow that runs away from you is not a 
happy cow 
explained anne perchard another jersey dairy farmer who serves 
as chairman of the world jersey cattle bureau there has to be a 
tremendous feeling towards the cow itself otherwise there are 
easier ways of making a living 
in addition to modernization on dairy farms young people are 
being lured from the land by the islands booming financial services 
and tourist industries and that also could endanger the future of 
guernseys and jerseys 
other factors also are conspiring against the islands cow 
farmers guernsey has lost some 50 cows and jersey a handful to 
bovine spongiform encepholopathy or a softening of the brain 
tissues apparently linked to a cow feed 
it is believed that the disease which has struck in england as 
well is not contagious and isnt passed on to offspring but 
farmers arent entirely sure 
also the approach of 1992 when the 12nation european economic 
community dismantles all trade barriers has raised fears of milk 
imports 
the islands which are not members of the community and are 
dependencies of the british crown currently are protected from such 
imports on each the farmers sell their milk to one milk marketing 
board 
in an effort to improve their herds jersey farmers are 
considering following guernseys lead and mating their cows with 
outside bulls for the first time in nearly 200 years 
the small dairy farmer is struggling to make a living 
romeril said 
said farmer william luff secretary of world guernsey cattle 
federation the number of farms is being reduced all the time 
jersey the bigger of the two islands has about 7000 cows they 
are smallish and brown some have white markings islanders describe 
their faces as dishy 
guernsey has about 4000 which have similar coloring but they 
tend to be heftier and have roman noses 
there were about twice as many island cows in the 19th century 
when thousands were exported mostly to england the united states 
canada new zealand australia and denmark 
in the old days the average jersey herd was made up of a dozen 
or so cows now it has 40 
there are 100 dairy farmers on jersey compared with 1005 in 
1952 on guernsey there are 85 farmers vs 353 in 1952 
some people say that in 20 years there will 25 large herds 
supplying the island mrs perchard said that would be very sad 
because the whole idea of the island cow in her setting would 
evaporate 
romeril said genetically i think we would suffer because you 
would have a lot more concentration on certain blood lines each 
bull would sire more cows 
apart from young people leaving agriculture there are also 
worries that high property prices will tempt farmers to sell their 
land 
perhaps there wont be enough people to maintain the island 
herd in 15 years time guernseys luff said 
jerseys parliament twice has voted down a proposal to import 
semen to improve the herd and proponents have agreed to wait for 
the completion of a fiveyear genetic study before raising the issue 
again 
this is the veritable cradle of the breed mrs perchard 
said the fact that we are a closed herd this is something that 
is looked at with envy but one wonders whether semen imports 
would improve our product 
guernsey imported semen in 1976 from an englishbred guernsey 
bull and luff said the guernsey breed has improved as a result 
of course each island thinks its own breed is superior a 
rivalry as traditional as the supper time check on cows 
we all go around last thing said peter lee a jersey farmer 
theyre all members of the family

the solomon islands have the 
worlds highest incidence of malaria and some experts fear the 
mosquitoborne disease might spread at a greater rate here and 
elsewhere if the earth is made warmer and wetter by the greenhouse 
effect 
i dont see eradication of mosquitos that carry the disease 
will come for 50 or 60 years said dr ezekiel nukuro 
undersecretary of health improvement in the solomon islands 
government 
a vaccine could be generations away 
the solomons is one of three heavily malarial pacific island 
countries papau new guinea and vanuatu are the others 
health authorities estimate 337 out of every 1000 people in the 
solomon islands have malaria the disease is responsible for 51 
percent of the islands deaths 
malaria is not a new to the solomons 
in 1568 the portuguese explorer mendana who thought the islands 
hid the fabled king solomons mines reported a disease that fits the 
symptoms of malaria high fever chills pains profuse sweating 
and often death 
when us troops came ashore on guadalcanal to fight the japanese 
in 1942 more fell to malaria than enemy action the solomon 
islands ministry of health records show that 772 of every 1000 
american soldiers were affected 
it took three years of spraying with ddt and dosing soldiers with 
antimalarial tablets to reduce the incidence to 20 per 1000 by the 
time the war ended in 1945 
the malaria parasite enters the body through the mosquitos 
saliva and travels in the blood to the liver 
for countries like the solomon islands with an annual per capita 
income of about 500 the cost of controlling the disease or 
providing antimalarial drugs to the population of 317000 is beyond 
the means of the government according to a report delivered at a 
conference on malaria in the pacific 
the solomons tried eradicating it by aerial spraying in the 
1970s but the disease returned when spraying stopped efforts are 
now being concentrated on chemicals to kill the mosquito larvae 
other methods such as mosquito nets window and door screens and 
long sleeve shirts are being encouraged but most of the population 
live in grass huts wear tshirts and shorts and remain easy prey 
for mosqutios 
some researchers including dr ross coppel of the walter and 
eliza hall institute in melbourne australia one of the worlds 
leading malaria research establishments fear drug resistance will 
spread and so will malaria 
coppel who is part of a team working on the development of a 
malaria vaccine predicted warming of the atmosphere by the 
greenhouse effect will make the planet wetter more habitable for 
mosquitos and thus spread the parasite 
it is absolutely clear that it will speed up the spread of 
malaria if the planet gets hotter and wetter it will make perfect 
breeding conditions for the mosquitos he said 
the parasite cant breed below 22 degrees centigrade 716 
degrees fahrenheit what will happen if the earth warms as 
predicted is that the rainfall pattern will change 
areas will become hotter and warmer and the parasite eggs which 
are laid and hatched in water will flourish he said 
coppel said the disease could be reintroduced to the poorer areas 
of the mediterranean and the north of australia from which it had 
been eradicted many years ago 
we need to work on a vaccine but use bed netting repellants 
and sprays in a multiprong effort he added the outlook is not 
very optimistic 
many hotels in the solomon islands provide guests with mosquito 
spray and a warning that malaria is a deadly disease visitors are 
urged to spray themselves generously 
you can still go to a malarial area and be reasonably safe if 
you take drugs use netting and insect repellent coppel said

nobody really begrudges presidents their 
vacations after all the man who holds the job never is really off 
duty anyhow nor is he ever off stage even on holiday 
but presidential days away are watched and counted as though an 
office bookkeeper were making sure an employee hadnt overstayed his 
quota of paid vacation weeks there isnt any limit for presidents 
of course they set their own schedules for their breaks from the 
office routine and the office travels with them 
president bush is ending the second week of a threeweek vacation 
at kennebunkport maine his family retreat since boyhood for 
barbara and me this has been a delightful vacation a place that we 
love very much said bush who has been more talkative and more 
accessible than most of his modern predecessors were when 
vacationing 
as president ronald reagan spent vacations in the isolated 
privacy of his 688acre ranch near santa barbara calif during 
eight years in office he spent 335 days at the ranch 
jimmy carter vacationed at st simons island and later at sapelo 
island off the georgia coast renting retreats there he also spent 
some of his breaks at home in plains ga which enjoyed something 
of a tourist boom during his single term 
gerald r ford visited vail colo richard m nixon bought 
himself a place in key biscayne fla and later switched coasts to 
san clemente calif lyndon b johnson had his lbj ranch in texas 
and john f kennedys vacation white house was the family compound 
of oceanfront homes in hyannisport mass on cape cod 
presidential vacations are as luxurious and as private as the 
president wants them to be 
bush has been golfing boating fishing often commenting on what 
he called a total vacation but he also held a news conference 
at his walkers point home invited two prime ministers as house 
guests and said hed be working with some cabinet members this week 
on the drugfighting program that will be announced sept 5 
while a vacationing president has some white house work to do 
each day and aides at hand because theres more where that came 
from recent ones seem to have broken the old pattern in which a 
sheaf of announcements was trundled along on the holiday to be 
rationed out one at a time to give the impression that decisions 
were flowing daily 
security can be a costly problem especially when the 
presidential retreat is close by tourist territory as bushs is and 
as kennedys was 
when the vacation white house came to hyannisport the neighbors 
met in a village church and considered asking that the streets be 
blocked off to bring back their peace and quiet that didnt happen 
except at the kennedy compound 
bush said last week he hopes his kennebunkport neighbors havent 
been inconvenienced he also said he hopes congress will vote funds 
to help pay local security expenses theres no question that 
theres a security burden placed on this small community here and 
indeed some of the surrounding communities by the presence of the 
president he said 
the president said he feels safe and comfortable in his maine 
surroundings although i cant stroll as you know quite as 
freely as i used to before i was in government work 
what bothers me a little bit is that you just cant jump in the 
car over there and drive downtown but that goes with the 
territory 
the territory also seems to include questions about luxury and 
isolation from average people when bush was asked one last 
wednesday he said hes doing his best to keep in touch 
ive got a lot of friends from all walks of life and you know 
there is a little tendency in this job to get isolated he 
said but i dont think people feel anything other than isnt it 
nice to have a good vacation and i try to have as much contact as i 
can 
bush has spent vacations at kennebunkport all his life missing 
only the years of his world war ii service his first presidential 
vacation had to be one of his better ones certainly more relaxed 
than the break he took while trying to get to the white house 
he looked back after getting what should rank as the perfect 
question for a vacation news conference why do the polls show that 
americans think hes doing a great job 
thank you for asking that question he smiled but 
these things change in the summer of 88 he was the republican 
presidential nominee lagging in the polls and in need of a comeback 
look youre looking at a guy who was standing on this lawn 
about a year ago at this time and the numbers were quite 
different in a different setting a different situation what goes 
up can come down

if you think theyre rushing christmas with those 
catalogs before labor day you should see the financial mail its 
about taxes 
thats right federal income taxes april 15 in august 
but as much as that sounds like madness there is some method in 
it many taxpayers and the people who advise them have learned from 
experience that it is never too soon to start arranging your affairs 
to minimize the burden when it comes time to settle up with uncle 
sam 
the ideal would be to start in january said william brennan 
a specialist in the subject with the accounting firm of ernst amp 
young 
tax planning some might call it finagling is often portrayed 
as a shadowy activity practiced only by the rich at the expense of 
the ordinary wageearner 
note for example the court case this summer in which leona 
helmsley the new york hotelier accused of tax evasion was quoted 
by a witness as saying that only the little people pay taxes 
or consider the fuss over whether malcolm forbes the magazine 
publisher and bon vivant might have been entitled to deduct some of 
the expenses of his morocco birthday extravaganza as a business 
expense he said he wouldnt anyway 
the morals of the matter may depend on your personal viewpoint 
the law on this point however is pretty clear 
it was settled long ago by the noted appeals court judge learned 
hand who decreed that everybody has a perfect right to take all 
measures available within the law to minimize the taxes they owe 
for most of the 1980s the big tax planning problem has been 
adjusting to some justpassed sweeping overhaul of the tax system 
this year for a change there isnt much that is drastically new 
but there is a lot of uncertainty over changes that might be made 
in the future 
the betting among the experts is that sooner or later the low 
basic income tax rates set by the 1986 tax reform law will be raised 
again in some way 
before new tax laws became an annual event sound tax strategy 
generally called for deferring part of income and accelerating 
certain expense items to shift some of the tax burden to the next 
year said analysts at standard amp poors corp in the firms 
weekly publication the outlook 
now the decision is less clearcut but despite prospects for 
higher taxes to come shifting income forward and expenses back is 
still the best tax strategy in most cases 
this kind of maneuver can be as simple as stepping up charitable 
contributions so that they are made before new years 
its easier to accelerate deductions than to defer income 
observed the accounting firm laventhol amp horwath in a recent yearend 
planning report 
the reason is obvious you control the money you pay out but 
not the money you take in 
selfemployed people have more flexibility in this regard if 
their checkbooks can stand the wait they can simply delay sending 
out bills to customers or clients so that the money wont be paid 
until after 1990 has begun 
one longcherished deduction for many people continues to fade 
on its way to extinction by 1991 consumer interest is 20 percent 
deductible this year and only 10 percent next 
says standard amp poors many tax advisors now recommend either 
paying off such loans early or consolidating them under a home 
equity loan of up to 100000 on which the interest is fully 
deductible regardless of how loan proceeds are used

the governments leading wildlife official 
says kenyas game parks remain safe despite four fatal attacks since 
july including the slaying of conservationist george adamson 
richard leakey the director of wildlife blamed the attacks on 
elephant poachers who have turned to banditry after being driven out 
of the animal reserves by kenyas campaign to save its elephant 
population 
he noted that the three fatal attacks before adamson was slain 
aug 20 took place in particularly remote areas and far from the 
usual tourist or safari trails 
his death and the killings of a connecticut woman and a french 
couple in july raised fears for the health of kenyas tourist 
industry the countrys no 1 income earner 
but leakey said he saw no reason for visitors to fear for their 
safety so long as they stay in regular tourist areas and on main 
roads 
i have traveled widely in the last few weeks to assess the 
situation for myself he said after adamsons death most of our 
wildlife areas where the majority of tourists go are in my judgment 
reasonably safe and there should be no need for tourists to fear 
going there 
the 83yearold adamson was shot to death near his camp at the 
remote kora national reserve in eastern kenya while trying to help 
an assistant and a guest who were being robbed by three gunmen 
adamson a retired game warden had lived in kenya since 1924 
and with his wife joy helped to popularize conservation through 
their practice of releasing captive lions into the wild joy who 
was killed by a servant in 1980 detailed the unique practice in the 
books born free living free and forever free which 
subsequently were made into movies 
in july a french husband and wife were killed in the meru game 
park east of mount kenya when they stumbled onto a group of 
poachers while driving down a seldomused track 
little more than two weeks later on july 27 nine men attacked a 
19member tour group organized by the connecticut audubon society on 
a 40mile stretch of dirt road between the southern national parks 
of tsavo and amboseli killing marie esther ferraro of bethany conn 
seven tourists have been wounded in separate attacks since 
september a year ago tour operators say several hundred tourists 
mostly americans have been frightened off by the violence 
although the cancellations were quickly replaced by new bookings 
the tour operators expressed fears adamsons death would prompt 
other tourists to cancel or defer plans to visit kenya 
they call and want to know if its safe to come to kenya 
said the manager of one large safari company who spoke on condition 
he not be identified by name we try to reassure them 
another safari group said it received 50 cancellations in the 
four days after adamson died 
tourism is of prime concern to the government 
last year a record 660000 tourists visited kenyas game parks 
and indian ocean beach resorts and brought in an estimated 350 
million outstripping income from the main export coffee 
the tour operators expressed their anxieties recently at a 
meeting with leakey who sought to allay their fears 
he said roads allowed to fall into disrepair in recent years 
were being regraded and resurfaced to provide quicker and therefore 
safer journeys plainclothes security officers have been posted in 
most of the major tourist lodges in kenyas game parks he said 
in an interview later leakey claimed that because of the 
intensified antipoaching operation kenyas tourist attractions 
actually are safer now than six months ago most of the attacks he 
said had occurred outside the national parks 
using more than 300 new weapons and 45 new vehicles along with 
increased air surveillance and renewed foot patrols kenya has 
brought poaching virtually to a halt since leakeys appointment in 
march 
the number of elephants killed has dropped from an average three 
a day to three since june he said in the last decade the 
slaughter by poachers reduced kenyas elephant population from 
65000 to 17000 
about three dozen poachers have been killed in the combined 
effort by the department of wildlife police and paramilitary units 
said leakey in the last few months no game rangers have died at 
poachers hands 
the revitalized effort has brought poachers under new pressures 
leakey said 
previously people werent being hurt because they didnt 
feature high on poachers lists because elephants were so easy to 
get he said 
now he added they dont know where to go they have nothing 
theyre short of cash and theyve turned to robbery 
leakey said the government believed it was dealing with fewer 
than 100 of the armed bandits whom he identified as indigent 
somalis called shifta who have fled their wartorn impoverished 
country to exploit kenyas elephants for their ivory tusks ivory 
fetches 110 to 155 a pound on the world market a record price 
until very recently there was very easy money to be made in 
the national parks by killing elephants leakey said nobody was 
after them there was no danger its very risky now to go into 
tsavo if youre a poacher 
although shifta have robbed and harrassed citizens in eastern 
kenya since the early 1960s david stiles an anthropologist who has 
studied shiftas for nearly two decades said many of those 
perpetrating the violence were deserters from somalias army which 
is fighting a rebellion in northern somalia 
leakey said the shifta were spread along a swath of arid remote 
territory from tsavos periphery up to meru and posed little threat 
to those who stayed on main roads and tourist byways

in a quiet though dramatic 
reversal of policy brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help 
to save the amazon wilderness the worlds largest from destruction 
the government which early this year rebuffed a united nations 
proposal to swap some of its 112billion foreign debt for 
investments in amazon protection programs recently told britain and 
west germany it would work with them to curb damage mostly by 
burning to the huge rain forest 
in august brazil accepted italian and canadian planes for local 
authorities to police the jungle then it said yes to a project 
backed by the united nations and by private american companies to 
establish a 11 millionacre protected forest area to produce rubber 
and nuts 
the moves represent a sharp reversal in president jose sarneys 
amazon policy which in the past considered offers by foreigners as 
attempts to take control of the rain forest from brazil 
we cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to 
create here sarney told reporters in march after france the 
netherlands and two us congressional delegations suggested trading 
some brazilian foreign debt the third worlds largest for amazon 
preservation 
but analysts say subtle shifts in political social and economic 
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind 
a bit of the persecution complex that took over the government 
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior is being overcome 
opening the road to new initiatives wrote the brazilian physicist 
jose goldemberg in the o estado de sao paulo newspaper recently 
there is belief here that sarney widely discredited for his 
inability to check 1004 percent annual inflation talked tough in 
the past to placate rightwing supporters 
but with his centerright brazilian democratic movement party in 
splinters and the countrys first popular presidential election 
since 1960 set for nov 15 sarney might now be resigned to accept 
foreign aid the analysts say 
what you have is a lameduck government that lacks the 
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through 
congress rene dreifuss a political scientist at the fluminense 
university in rio told the associated press it has no choice but 
to accept help from abroad 
equally important the hostility marking the issue has undermined 
brazils trade links abroad 
it started to become taboo to do business in the amazon sen 
leopoldo peres a member of the democratic movement and president of 
a senate committee on amazon deforestation said in an interview 
american and european banks and lending organizations started 
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle 
environmentalists pressured the european economic community to 
ban imports of iron ore produced at the greater carajas project a 
huge metallurgy project in para a state in the amazon region 
recently trade officials from belgium west germany and britain 
visited the 200 millionacre 70 billion project where thousands 
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the amazon river 
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore 
a rio de janeiro city councilman alfredo sirkis of brazils 
green party contends sarney first stiffened on the amazon issue 
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death 
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist francisco chico 
mendes 
mendes who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the 
forest for pasture was killed last december outside his modest home 
in a backwoods amazon town 
all of a sudden chico was all over the front pages and us 
senators were showing up to talk about saving the amazon sirkis 
said it irritated the military and sarney reacted by turning it 
into a sovereignty issue 
but the british rock star sting met with sarney in january and 
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for 
an indian reservation 
in february indian tribes of the eastern amazon basin organized 
the first national tribal conference with a goal of blocking world 
bank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the amazon 
region 
these efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that 
uncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million squaremile amazon forest 
for farming ranching highway building and mining was changing 
global weather patterns 
environmentalists contend deforestation of the amazon also is 
destroying unique plant and animal life much of it unstudied and 
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the earths atmosphere 
satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of brazils rain 
forest has been cut and burned some scientists say this adds carbon 
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as 
the greenhouse effect 
by april the first visible sign of change came when sarney 
announced a multimilliondollar plan to preserve the rain forest 
his our nature project extended the suspension of tax 
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight 
the burning it also established new forest and indian reservations 
and an environmental fund banned timber exports and controlled the 
sale of mercury which is indiscriminately dumped into amazonarea 
rivers by freelance gold prospectors 
when the hysteria in the press and the government faded the 
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue flavio feldmann 
of the brazilian social democratic party a vocal ecology defender 
told a reporter 
on july 5 foreign minister roberto abreu de sodre signed a 
memorandum of understanding with britain to tackle urban and 
industrial environmental problems control of marine pollution and 
forestry management 
this cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states 
to administer their natural heritage said abreu de sodre 
in august brazil accepted 655 million in grants and loans from 
west germany for conservation projects in the amazon over three 
years 
after this the interamerican development bank said it would 
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in latin 
america and the caribbean 
many brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more 
to foreign technological and financial help although some seemingly 
remain wary of the socalled sovereignty issue 
but christopher patten britains minister of overseas 
development a recent visitor to brazil said environmental 
problems are the worlds problem which has to be solved by 
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other

rajiv gandhi the prime minister flew to 
southern india and became rajiv gandhi the candidate hopscotching 
by helicopter across friendly and hostile political turf as part of 
his upcoming reelection bid 
with forceful voice and blistering rhetoric at odds with his 
congenial pinkcheeked appearance candidate gandhi denounced those 
who oppose him as relics of a feudal past consorters with traitors 
and assassins potential instigators of religious wars 
under indian law he must call elections no later than jan 4 
in less than five years gandhi has grown from political novice 
to confident campaigner as he seeks to perpetuate the dynasty that 
began in 1947 when his grandfather jawaharlal nehru became indias 
first prime minister as the vast asian subcontinent was freed from 
british colonial rule 
the nehrugandhi familys domination of the prime ministership 
has been interrupted only twice for a total of three years it was 
personified and perpetuated by nehrus daughter the ironwilled 
indira gandhi whose assassination in 1984 propelled rajiv gandhi an 
exairline pilot into the leadership of the worlds largest albeit 
flawed and unruly democracy 
the young man who rode to victory on a wave of sympathy for his 
mothers slaying is now at the age of 45 being put to the test of 
harsher political realities 
at last count the elections commission was considering 
applications of 216 parties or wouldbe parties for places on the 
ballot for the elections the problem for the opposition and the 
advantage for gandhi is that the closest thing to a wellorganized 
national political party in india is the congress party he inherited 
from his grandfather and mother 
the next best at the moment is the janata dal or national front 
an evershifting alliance of about half a dozen parties or movements 
constantly at war within itself 
it was the janata dal that gandhi assailed in 13 speeches during 
a 31hour swing in august across the southern states of karnataka 
and andhra pradesh 
to be sure gandhi has been trading barbs with janata dals 
president viswanath pratap singh his former defense and finance 
minister for about three years 
but he has now launched a frontal attack on nt rama rao janata 
dals chairman 
rama rao the chief minister or top elected official of andhra 
pradesh is highly popular across india as a movie star who has 
portrayed just about every major deity in the hindu pantheon he is 
timing the release of his next film for the election campaign 
rama rao who routinely dresses in facial paint and bright orange 
robes invocatory of the gods he portrays is also the leader of 
telegu desam a political party operating only in andhra pradesh 
nevertheless it won the second highest bloc of national parliament 
seats in the 1984 election 30 to the gandhi partys 415 in the 
544seat chamber 
in speeches to congress party rallies officially scheduled as 
public meetings in four economically depressed andhra pradesh 
towns gandhi accused rama raos state government of corruption 
exploitation of the poor and failure to provide protection from a 
murky maoist band known as naxalites 
by the time he got to hyderabad andhra pradeshs state capital 
candidate gandhi had nominally reverted to prime minister gandhi 
seated beside rama rao at a news conference gandhi repeated some of 
the same charges when a reporter tried to ask rama rao a question 
the head of the prime ministers information office gopalaswami 
parthasarathy stepped forward to say this is not a joint press 
conference 
the next day according to the antigandhi national newspaper 
indian express the 70ish movie star sniped at the prime minister as 
an inexperienced young brat 
still a national opinion poll conducted for the news magazine 
india today in august projected gandhis congress party would win 
315 or 58 percent of the seats in the election 
even if the opposition parties as a whole captured a majority 58 
percent of the 10399 registered voters surveyed in the poll said 
they doubted the opposition would be able to form a government and 
if they did 69 percent thought any such government would fall apart 
before its fiveyear term was up

us assembly plants back in operation 
after winning a threeweek labor dispute have blazed the trail for 
other companies to fight the extraordinary power labor unions hold 
in mexico industry spokesmen say 
a union power struggle that shut down 15 american plants known as 
maquiladoras in the border city of reynosa ended with labor and 
government officials agreeing aug 18 to let the workers form a 
union independent of the nationally powerful mexican workers 
federation whose local representative forced the workers to strike 
it definitely means that companies can take a stand against 
illegal activities and corruption and be successsul said don 
king manager for reynosas west bend plant 
we blazed a new trail 
the strike was settled after intervention of president carlos 
salinas de gortaris government in mexico city 
salinas has made clear he will not let unions stand in the way of 
his goal of modernizing the mexican economy and attracting more 
foreign investors 
the salinas government has acted in a certain direction to 
remove as much of the corruption as it possibly can said arnold 
kezsbom president of the new yorkbased service manufacturing corp 
whose reynosa plant was closed in the strike 
he doesnt want to have the negative publicity that occurred 
out of this permeate throughout the world the issue was the 
expansion of the maquiladora industry in mexico 
maquiladoras in which foreignowned companies take advantage of 
cheap mexican labor to produce goods for sale in their own countries 
or elsewhere have become a top foreign income earner for mexico 
the industry which generated 23 billion in foreign currency 
last year has grown by more than 70 percent since 1985 and employs 
about 392000 people mainly along the usmexican border 
the strike cost an estimated 500000 a day in lost production 
but plant managers said it was worth it because the outcome was 
favorable to them 
although the plant workers indicated no great sympathy for a 
walkout they went on strike july 25 on the orders of rafael 
morales a local leader of the powerful mexican workers federation 
strike flags were hoisted traditionally in mexico workers who 
violate strike flags face severe consequences including possible 
physical harm immediately or later 
the plants nevertheless continued to pay the workers their 
wages and benefits averaging about 120 a hour during the strike 
kezsbom said the american managers resisted morales who controls 
most of the labor contracts at reynosas 27 other maquiladoras 
because they considered him corrupt 
morales forced companies to give him control of trucking 
contracts waste disposal and scrap resale and to issue food 
coupons good only at stores he controls the coupons are part of the 
employee benefit packages 
the nearly 2000 workers at the plants morales shut down waited 
for two weeks while plant managers and business leaders pleaded with 
the federal government in mexico city to step in 
then frustrated by government inaction about 900 workers ripped 
down the strike flags stormed back into their plants and went to 
work 
that same day interior secretary fernando gutierrez barrios met 
with industry leaders in mexico city and promised the government 
would intervene 
gov americo villarreal of tamaulipas summoned the managers to a 
meeting in the state capital ciudad victoria the next day to work 
out an accord giving the plant workers the right to form an 
independent union 
the agreement surprised those familiar with the strength of the 
mexican workers federation the nations largest labor organization 
and a powerful sector of the governing institutional revolutionary 
party 
although the agreement stipulates that only workers from the 
affected 15 plants can join the independent union industry 
spokesmen say it may open a new era of labor relations in tamaulipas 
and other mexican states with maquiladora plants

the ancient oriental medical treatment 
acupuncture is still something of a rarity among orthodox american 
doctors but the practice is spreading in at least one specialty 
veterinary medicine the vets dont talk about it much but their 
appearance at racetracks around the country has become commonplace 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dr allen schoen sticks some rather ordinary 
looking needles into the neck of a big 3yearold chestnut filly 
the thoroughbred stabled at belmont racetrack had been laid up 
with what had been diagnosed as hock problems 
the hock is sort of a backward ankle on a horses hind leg a 
long way from the neck the treatment was acupuncture a practice 
that has been proliferating in recent years among veterinarians 
the hockhurt filly had been through a run of conventional 
veterinarians says schoen president of the international veterinary 
acupuncture society everything helped temporarily but the 
problem kept coming back 
now the filly is running at belmont and the hocks are holding 
fine 
most owners want it kept secret if their horses are treated by 
acupuncture but its use has become widespread on racetracks across 
the country as well as in smallanimal practices and on livestock 
eight years ago you hardly ever saw a vet out here practicing 
acupuncture says billy turner an experienced trainer who guided 
secretariat to the 1973 triple crown now theyre all over the 
place turner uses acupuncture on horses he trains not only as a 
cure but as a diagnostic tool as well 
they cant solve everything but they solve a lot turner 
says they made a believer out of me 
but why wont they talk about it 
you know how to spell trainer asks another trainer phil 
johnson note that it has an i in it its never the horse 
the jockey the breeding its the i in the trainer that got 
that horse into the winners circle why would they tell you 
something like acupuncture helped 
a cynical view but certainly one with a horseshoes worth of 
truth the other reluctance is that the administration of 
acupuncture may indicate a certain unsoundness 
dr marvin cain of cincinnati is to equine acupuncture what the 
mayo clinic is to generalized medicine 
cain has been a vet for 35 years mostly operating a smallanimal 
practice in cincinnati until he decided to go fulltime into 
performance horses which have included the italian equestrian 
team as well as show horses and racehorses before selling his 
practice however he inserted needles into dogs cats parakeets 
and parrots chinchillas and hamsters and even a pheasant whose 
eventual fate was to be served under glass 
cain was a skeptic of the ancient oriental remedy and admits he 
took his first lessons reluctantly 
i felt there was no such thing as a problem without a solution 
and i was finding too many problems without predictable solutions 
when a chiropractor friend suggested i explore the possibilities of 
acupuncture he says 
he couldnt argue with the results he immediately saw 
in some animals it was as though someone had said take up your 
bed and walk reports cain i was seeing miracles every day 
he subsequently studied under master acupuncturists in seoul tokyo 
hong kong and taipei his studies were on humans and he was issued a 
license by the chinese academy of acupuncture he then translated 
this knowledge to animals 
johnson the trainer has seen cain work 
the horses see me every day but when they see him approaching 
they seem to know its dr do good johnson says cain never 
wants to know what the problem is he wants to find it himself 
cain explains that with acupuncture he addresses the cause not 
the symptom its a lot more lucrative to treat a symptom than to 
treat a cause he says 
if a symptom is treated then a symptom must be continually 
treated if you remove the cause then the effect is no longer there 
in acupuncture we do not practice symptomatic medicine we do not 
deliver a drug to relieve pain the cause of the pain becomes worse 
the greatest goal of my professional life is to put myself out of 
business cain says 
my dollar signs have decreased since i began fulltime on 
acupuncture but the true wealth i live with and die with has 
increased beyond everything a dollar sign could suggest he says 
this has given me a sense of worth a contribution to the 
advancement of life

arabamericans have been part of the fabric of 
american society for more than 100 years but the current wave of 
immigrants fleeing the destruction and death in their homelands 
has reawakened their ethnic sense and brought problems in 
microcosm here is a look this slice of america today 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an arabamerican community center is burned 
twice a couple returns home from their mosque to find go back 
scrawled in shoe polish on their walls and carpet 
they put sludge in my pita bread took my lunchmeat out they 
wrote sand nigger on my timecard said lebaneseamerican fred 
abbas a wayne county sewer plant worker who won 500000 in a 
discrimination suit the county is seeking a new trial 
but nationally antiarab sentiments are dwindling as people 
stop stereotyping arabamericans so says faris bouhafa of the 
americanarab antidiscrimination committee in washington dc 
which represents 25 million people 
in the early years of their immigration arabamericans of their 
many nationalities tended to cluster together as other ethnic groups 
did but as they fanned out over the country the second and third 
generations acquiring education tended to assimilate although 
keeping their ethnic devotion to regional culinary tastes from lamb 
dishes to pita bread 
now some arabamerican experts say the lebanese and palestinian 
havoc and the violence throughout the middle east has reawakened a 
sense of identity 
in greater detroit home by most counts to some 250000 
arabamericans the largest concentration in north america the 
immigrants keep coming and tensions remain so says terry ahwal a 
board member on the adcs detroit chapter and a catholic who 
emigrated from palestine to the united states in 1972 when she was 
15 
of the 22 arab nations most immigrants here are from lebanon 
syria palestinejordan yemen and the chaldea the ancient area 
between the tigris and euphrates that constituted babylon some 
arabs are christians others practice islam the chaldeans are roman 
catholics from iraq 
detroit is the ellis island of the arab community at first it 
was economics the car industry gave jobs to lots of unskilled 
people and people bring families says ahwal whose chapter 
received threatening letters after a bomb brought down pan am flight 
103 in december in scotland 
we always get threats its normal its a comedy here we pass 
them around and laugh says ismael ahmed director of the arab 
community center for economic and social services better known as 
access 
access founded in 1971 moved into its third home in dearborn 
last summer the first two burned says ahmed who blames arsonists 
i think people are frightened whole blocks become arab very 
quickly says the brooklynborn ahmed who is lebaneseegyptian 
each year 3000 to 10000 arabs land in detroit many from 
lebanon 
more problems 
the number one issue is unemployment because of the language 
most come from villages that have lived the same way for hundreds 
of years ahmed says their skills arent very transferable 
but that was so when the first immigrants arrived their basic 
talents were agricultural and mercantile so they took jobs at 
anything from grocery stores to peddling pots and pans in rural 
areas 
arab immigration to the united states began with a trickle more 
than 100 years ago when peddlers found business good they stayed 
a wave came from the lebanon region after 1900 some to escape the 
crumbling ottoman empires oppression in 1919 emigres built the 
nations first mosque in the detroit enclave of highland park 
i think the thing that attracted people to this area was it was 
a nice place to live says henry saad a bloomfield hills lawyer 
and a thirdgeneration lebanese 
the thousands who followed them to greater detroit were lured by 
auto industry wages 
detroit was booming the real question is why they continue to 
come here says nabeel abraham an anthropologist at henry ford 
community college these people wouldnt be here except for the 
war thats my suspicion 
one of the factors making detroit different is we have this 
constant influx of immigrants and they pull you back from 
assimilation abraham says theyre always trying to recreate 
home

dick gregory the product of a welfare home a 
black comedian with a penchant for causes onetime candidate for 
mayor in chicago onetime writein candidate for president a 
multimillionaire who backed civil rights has now turned his 
attention to the war against drugs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dick gregory doesnt leave an audience 
laughing anymore 
the onetime standup comic still delivers jokes to warm up a 
crowd but the fulltime social activist soon takes over with cold 
harsh exhortations 
today its drugs says gregory we want our neighborhoods back 
i think there will be violence you have to be willing to die we 
want people whod be willing to die but not willing to kill 
gregory became a diet guru after dealing with fasting as a weapon 
of political protest in the cause of civil rights he joined ranks 
with martin luther king jr and malcolm x and took to the latters 
message of being willing to die for freedom 
in personal terms he has brought his once300 pounds down to 
150 commercially he has parlayed his liquid diet plan into a 
multimilliondollar business 
here in shreveport he has converted a small neighborhood park 
once overrun by dope dealers and shabby with neglect into a joyful 
childfilled bunker against the narcotics siege 
he is waging war against among other things the head shops that 
provide the paraphernalia of the drug culture 
his motives are not genuine says jim willis the owner of 
pipes unique hes looking for publicity to sell his health food 
you cant buy a front page ad but he stays on the front page 
i think its real unfair 
gregory denies ulterior motives 
im here to protect my america and my children he says 
im here for the same reason people go to war 
hes recruiting some famous soldiers 
coretta scott king wife of the slain civil rights leader her 
son martin luther king iii dancer ben vereen and the rev joseph 
lowery president of the southern christian leadership conference 
all have been drawn to ab palmer park 
from a popup tent gregory coordinates antidrug protests 
basketball games and gospel singalongs all the while the 
potential for violent confrontation might be just across the street 
or around the corner for anyone who takes up his banner 
theres a new hero in shreveport and its not the drug 
pushers says gregory 57 its the movement 
but it is gregory who is the new hero of cedar grove the black 
community terrified by an allnight riot in september 1988 behind 
the riot was drugs 
here the selfdescribed statesman dispenses power and 
selfreliance by showing people what they can do cooperatively 
almost nightly he marshals his forces to march by crack houses 
and buyers corners singing hymns no more yard and garage 
sales their sandwich boards proclaim 
its heady stuff for people who only weeks ago were afraid to 
venture into ab palmer park because the unsavory element had 
conquered the playground 
when we got to the park we found thousands of needles 
gregory says now we find bubblegum wrappers 
in late summer the park is vibrant women escape the pressing 
heat on folding chairs under the bright blue awnings supplied by 
good samaritan funeral home one women reads from her bible and her 
listeners chime in with religious tunes 
two basketball games are going at once while parents keep a 
watchful eye from the bleachers around the baseball diamond the 
cinderblock clubhouse is packed with folks playing board games 
pool and pingpong or sitting in front of the giant fans the city 
agreed to open the swimming pool 
the level of fear among residents has gone down quite a bit 
says the rev joe gant a local baptist dick gregory has served 
as catalyst dick gregory has made us more aware of the problems 
even when dick leaves we will be organized

conservative shreveport isnt accustomed to the national 
attention located on the red river along the old texas trail the 
city is regionally known for north americas largest rose garden and 
a doublea texas league baseball team 
gregory concedes shreveport was an odd place to land but he 
says we didnt pick this town the town picked us 
gregorys choice of this city of 200000 in northwestern 
louisiana raised suspicions it was an attempt to register black 
voters before the 1990 mayors race or a scheme to promote his 
health products 
i think its human nature says assistant police chief doug 
c perdue hes a celebrity a multimillionaire its difficult 
for us to understand why a millionaire that could be anywhere would 
come down and help us 
gregory arrived in shreveport on june 6 to set up a corporate 
account at security national bank a minorityowned bank run by his 
friend wesley godfrey at the bank gant told him about a 
neighborhood plan to recapture ab palmer park 
so the selfdescribed agitator decided to stay he enlisted some 
help from the rev george clements a catholic priest from chicago 
and both went on a 40day solid food fast to draw attention 
gregory staged demonstrations at two shreveport head shops 
refusing to leave until he was arrested and the stores agreed to 
withdraw their glass pipes popular for smoking crack or cocaine 
from public display 
he was arrested and fined seven times in four days in june 
helping him in shreveport are three of his 10 children 
christian gregory 19 is often the overnight man keeping the 
vigil at ab palmer park he lies in the cluttered screened tent 
talking on the phone or watching tv in the muggy summer night 
all night long there are knocks on the door from drug 
addicts gregory says one night it was a drug dealer its 
almost like they come here to confess 
perdue says gregory is focusing attention on the drug problem 
the way its affecting the american family what mr gregory has 
done is what we have been unable to do im glad hes here 
perdue has no statistics to determine whether gregory has sent 
cedar grove dope dealers packing or just underground 
we still have drug problems in the community he says but 
there are fewer drug transactions and dealers in cedar grove some 
known drug dealers have moved to other areas of the city we have 
less visible drug activity throughout the area 
i wouldnt think that mr gregory could singlehandedly stop 
the drug dealing if he could he ought to be president 
gregorys speeches are punctuated with sexual and racial 
references he gets laughs from youngsters when he blames drugs and 
teenage pregnancy on food additives he tells parents 
youve got a gun and a bible and you dont realize the gun 
cancels the bible out because youre telling god that you dont 
trust him to protect you 
the whole drug craze was brought on by you not your children 
the irony of cocaine use he says is that it got white americas 
best and black americas worst he calls the fight against drugs 
bigger than the civil rights movement 
it affects everyone this brings us together he says i am 
shocked to find out the level of fear that exists in this country i 
think we will be able to turn it around 
gregorys plans for departure from shreveport are as vague as the 
reasons he decided to stay we wont leave until we drive the drug 
dealers out or they drive us out he says 
ive made so much money i have one company that makes 6 
million a day the only way i can say thanks is to try to correct 
the wrongs 
i know america is a better place because of me

when he turned 65 in july his offstage modesty matched his 
flamboyance on stage 
he chooses to praise other musicians

when musicians ask you to sit in with them and bellson is much in

both for spectacular effect and musical validity 
but characteristically hed rather talk about other drummers 
its an honor to be put in a class with gene krupa and buddy 
rich he says but im not the only one left my teachers are 
living today i learned to play listening to max roach and art 
blakey 
i listen to max today i smile ill pick out something i never 
heard before hes the first drummer to teach all of us to play 
melodically before him drummers played rhythmically 
jo jones taught me how to play wonderful brush things he was 
the king with the high hat cymbal buddy rich and i we remained 
friends until he died used to say if we had to pick just one 
drummer it would be jo when he came out with the basie band he was 
the first to play with that fluid drive 
how can you not talk about chick webb big sid catlett jimmie 
crawford with the lunceford band people said you finally swung 
the ellington band id say listen to those records sonny greer 
did there was so much magic there 
louis bellson pronounced louie was born in rock falls ill 
one of four boys and four girls whose italian father had a music 
store frank played clarinet tony and henry still play drums ede 
teaches music in las vegas 
we had to learn the rudiments of almost every instrument in the 
music store so we could give lessons he says by the time we 
were 13 we knew every aria from every opera it gave us a wonderful 
basic structure of music we were lucky to have our father 
i can go to an opera and enjoy that as well as go to a good 
jazz concert it is wonderful to be able to do that music is such a 
big thing in our lives 
as he sold dorsey miller ellington and basie records in the 
store bellson says i was always thinking how id like to go on 
the road and play with those bands he went to ballrooms to hear 
traveling bands sometimes he sat in 
ted fio rito hired bellson when he graduated from high school and 
asked if he knew a girl singer bellson recommended a fellow 
cheerleader june haver 
i stayed with him three months at the florentine gardens in 
los angeles the mills brothers were the main attraction i learned 
so much from that great quartet one night freddy goodman came in 
he was managing his brother he sent me a note to come to his table 
and said how would you like to audition for benny goodman 
benny was doing a picture at paramount studios i went down the 
next day i heard benny say wheres the kid i started to sweat 
benny said put makeup and a gray jacket on him my audition was 
being in the movie benny said you got the job we leave 
thursday 
after goodman and army service bellson was with tommy dorsey 
from 1947 to 49 had a sextet then played with harry james until 
spending 1951 to 53 with duke ellington 
he left ellington shortly after he married pearl bailey to form 
his own bands and combos often backing his wife and his former 
employers often hired him for special gigs 
one career highlight was playing in las vegas for a bill 
combining pearl bailey and louis armstrong 
another highlight was playing for ellington 
with ellington bellson says you never knew exactly what 
you were in for when you joined ellington there was no drum book 
he wanted to get the ultimate from you 
bellsons latest album is east side suite a 53minute piece 
composed with tommy newsom plus six other tracks earlier this 
year musicmasters records also released hot 
ive got a big band in los angeles and in new york bellson 
says both are superb pearl requires a quartet when she performs 
im part of that and i still work with a quintet and do clinics at 
high schools and colleges 
miss bailey and bellson havent let their traveling her broadway 
stint in hello dolly or her georgetown university attendance 
she was graduated in 1985 keep them apart for more than a month at 
a time 
most musicians say bellson never shows anger but he once got 
furious with benny goodman 
goodman had asked if bellsons band would play the first half of 
programs in san francisco and phoenix i was delighted 
but gradually during rehearsals goodman started to stare down 
some of bellsons musicians and tell them what to do 
on a break bellson found goodman sunning himself on the hood of 
bellsons brand new car his heels scratching the paint 
we went back and he started picking on me and the rhythm 
section i put the sticks down and said i dont know what you 
want get yourself another drummer i was so mad at benny i wanted 
to kill him 
goodman apologized later by phone 
bellson tried movie music in the 1960s for the likes of henry 
mancini but found it unfulfilling i had to go out on the road 
and play 
if it were all to end tomorrow id still smile ellington 
basie goodman dorsey james what more can you ask for

john goodman only shrugs when asked about his 
character on roseanne and the huge success of the sitcom 
i never analyze it he says if it aint broke dont fix 
it 
he also keeps himself aloof from the controversy that surrounds 
his costar roseanne barr both professionally and personally 
its none of my business he says i dont get involved 
barr has been involved in various creative disputes on the show 
that caused the departures of matt williams the executive producer 
creator and head writer and ellen falcon the director 
barr who has split from her husband bill pentland also 
recently was accused of offering 50 to a man to beat up a 
photographer she said was annoying her 
in its first year roseanne was second in the ratings behind 
nbcs the cosby show in the summer reruns its been in a tight 
race with nbcs cheers for the top spot 
barr plays a bluecollar mom who works in a plastics factory by 
day and comes home at night to three rambunctious kids and a husband 
whos usually out of work it was the first acting experience for 
barr a standup comic 
goodman plays dan connor the husband a contractor who declares 
himself the king of dry wall but whose most endearing quality 
is that hes a romantic and a dreamer 
goodman says going back for the second season of roseanne was 
like going back to the second year of high school 
it wasnt as dreadful as all the images id conjured up during 
the summer he says i did two movies during the summer so 
going back to roseanne was like going back to something you do 
every day like going back to your real job 
goodman says the show got off to a rocky start when they began a 
year ago 
id never done a sitcom before he says i was extremely 
insecure and nervous but as we went along we found our sea legs 
roseanne was more nervous than she should have been about her 
acting i always thought she worried too much about it 
we have good chemistry together shes so much fun to work 
with were like naughty school kids were always messing around 
it keeps the day short and it helps connect us 
goodman who prefers living in new york and hanging out in new 
orleans is buying a house in los angeles now that roseanne is a 
solid hit 
he had been living in a small apartment but now he needs more 
room 
im getting married in the fall and now will be a good time to 
buy a house he says im marrying a girl from bogalusa la 
named anna hartzog i met her in new orleans when i was doing 
everybodys allamerican then i went down for mardi gras and we 
started dating pretty seriously 
im nuts about new orleans hopefully in the next three to 
five years ill get a place down there hopefully ill have little 
islands of refuge all around the country 
goodman has lived here off and on while working in such movies as 
punchline raising arizona and burglar he still keeps 
an apartment in new york where he got his start as a stage actor 
goodman was working in a los angeles stage production of antony 
and cleopatra when he was asked if he was interested in doing a 
television series 
i said itd be nice to settle down for a while he says i 
didnt hear from them for a while id never seen roseannes comedy 
act but i had seen her on commercials and stuff i knew who she 
was 
he grew up in st louis and began acting at southwest missouri 
state university when failure to take an sat test made him 
ineligible for football among his classmates were kathleen turner 
and tess harper his acting idol was marlon brando the beall 
endall he kids that hes brandos longlost son 
after graduation he settled in new york with a 1000 loan from 
his brother and soon began to land stage roles 
i was working mostly on the road he says it wasnt until 
i started doing commercials that i could afford to stay in new york 
i lived there for 13 years i sure miss it but it makes me crazy 
sometimes when im there i only left because the works out here 
he had been doing television but hed never been a regular in a 
series his first film work was a movie for home box office 
mystery of moro castle he was a guest on such shows as the 
equalizer moonlighting and the paper chase and had roles 
in the miniseries chiefs and murder ordained along with 
several tv movies 
this past summer he costarred with bette midler in stella 
and richard dreyfuss in always he also did one days work on 
sea of love starring al pacino

is lord elgin on the verge of losing his marbles after all 
nearly two centuries ago thomas bruce the seventh earl of 
elgin sacrificed his reputation his marriage his family fortune 
his seat in the house of lords and the nether end of his nose to 
bring back from the acropolis the magnificent marble statues 
columns and friezes on display in the british museum almost ever 
since successive greek governments have demanded return of the 
marbles 
now a soulsearching breeze or at least a strong gust of 
conscience is parting the curtains of the clandestine world of 
museum curators and antiquities collectors wide enough for some 
cherished artifacts and revered bones to emerge like the risen 
dead from showcases and storage vaults and return to their lands of 
origin 
the plot may seem like a latenight rerun of an old boris karloff 
tombandmummy chiller but the script actually echoes ethics codes 
and operating standards adopted in recent years by associations of 
museum directors and curators to discourage the booming 
billiondollar traffic in stolen art 
more and more countries especially in the third world are 
adopting laws to protect their cultural patrimony and are going to 
court to retrieve millenniaold heirlooms scattered far and wide 
among museums art dealers and private collectors 
a few weeks ago stanford university agreed to give back for 
reburial the skeletal remains of 550 ohlone indians some of them 
3000 years old 
in january bostons museum of fine arts returned to egypt 
fragments of nine mud plaster paintings dating to the reign of 
thutmose iii in l500 bc the museum bought them from an amsterdam 
dealer in 1978 but recently discovered they were stolen from a 
necropolis in thebes by tymborychoi tomb robbers whose 
activities date back to the time of the pharaohs 
turkey which in the last two decades has been plundered of more 
of its ancient treasures than at any time since the fall of 
constantinople in 1204 is pursuing a court case against new yorks 
metropolitan museum of art to get back sixthcentury bc gold and 
silver pieces illicitly excavated the new york branch of 
christies the art auctioneers voluntarily handed back a drawing 
identified by one of its experts as a rembrandt stolen l0 years ago 
from an amsterdam museum 
in february an fbi sting in miami nabbed a former buenos aires 
police commissioner trying to peddle a goya portrait missing from 
the museum in rosario argentina 
several years ago in a suit brought by us customs under the 
national stolen properties act new york art dealer david bernstein 
was ordered to return to peru 745 precolumbian pieces valued at 
more than 1 million he avoided a prison sentence by doing public 
service cataloging museum artifacts 
us dealers import as many as 40000 items a year from peru 
alone estimated national geographic many of them literally 
stripmined from archaeological sites with bulldozers and 
backhoes plundered peruvian art is advertised in slick mailorder 
catalogs 
hopi indians are demanding the return of kachina dolls from 
museums as far away as west germany where indian art is in vogue 
in tribal belief the dolls are trapped friends unable to come 
home 
the return by the smithsonian institution of 16 blackfeet indian 
remains and new york states decision to give back 12 onondaga 
wampum belts reflect the growing sensitivity among museums to the 
origin or provenance of their acquisitions and the deep emotions 
stirred by their removal 
an even faster growing public empathy for peoples whose past has 
been plundered is evidenced in the popularity of tony hellermans 
novel talking god more than two months on the bestseller list 
the plot involves a navajo activist who digs up an episcopal 
churchyard and ships family skeletons to a smithsonian curator to 
protest the 18000 native american remains still stored in the 
museums vaults for study by anthropologists 
but perhaps the most chilling moral deterrent to fencing stolen 
goods in the name of fine art was last months landmark decision by 
a federal judge ordering an indianapolis art dealer to return to the 
greek orthodox church of cyprus exquisite sixthcentury mosaics 
ripped from the ceiling of a tiny stone church after the 1974 
turkish invasion the church and the cypriot government of the 
greekruled side of the island jointly sued for recovery after 
learning that dealer peg goldberg was offering the four byzantine 
treasures one of them a rare portrait of christ as a boy to 
californias getty museum for 20 million 
in the usual tangled web of international art traffic dealer 
goldberg bought the mosaics near the geneva switzerland airport 
from aydin dikmen an allegedly terminally ill turk living in 
munich through an amsterdam middleman named michael van rijn van 
rijn claimed to be related to rembrandt on his fathers side and 
rubens on his mothers but indeed had been convicted in france of 
forging marc chagalls signature on lithographs 
alan shestack director of bostons museum of fine arts said in 
an interview that more and more museum directors are worrying 
about issues we used to wink at were a lot more concerned about 
where works of art come from and how they got here

two decades ago under a previous administration scandal marred 
the museums centennial when customs agents impounded a raphael 
portrait smuggled out of italy 
the museum which has one of the finest egyptology collections 
outside cairo can well afford to return the theban mud paintings 
but shestack wonders out loud what he and other museum directors 
might do if faced with the loss of a piece worth maybe millions 
perhaps id try to work out some sort of quid pro quo arrangement 
swapping something of equivalent value or negotiating a longterm 
loan 
despite new laws and treaties to protect central americas 
cultural riches mayan curator ian graham at harvards peabody 
museum of archaeology and ethnology knows from experience that the 
soaring world market in precolumbian art has made looters more 
daring and better equipped with allterrain vehicles xray devices 
and stratigraphic drills they are also becoming more violent 
for 30 years graham has ventured into the rain forests of 
guatemala each february when the rainy season ends to study a 
civilization whose art and architecture rivaled that of ancient 
egypt but now the race is on against armed gangs of esteleros 
tomb robbers to record the few hundred surviving mayan stelae 
those magnificent 7foot limestone tablets inscribed with 
hieroglyphics found at the bases of temples and pyramids 
looters are busier and more brazen than ever lamented graham 
in an interview at the peabody sometimes the political unrest in 
the area comes as a blessing army patrols with machine guns 
searching for guerrillas in the rain forests scare off the more 
vicious gangs 
several years ago grahams small research team was ambushed by 
robbers at an archaelogical site in guatemalas peten region one of 
his assistants was fatally shot in the back 
his work has since been interrupted by sporadic gunfire but 
graham thinks a worse crime is cutting up these stupendous slabs 
into slices a mule can carry across the border into belize for 
illicit export to eager buyers 
just removing them from where they stood for 1000 years robs 
them of much of the story they have to tell says graham in his 
own writing he indicts a different breed of gogo museum 
directors more entrepreneurs than scholars and collectors mostly 
ignorant of history but motivated by profit for encouraging a 
soaring art theft trade that employs a work force of several hundred 
thousand around the world some law enforcement officers rank it 
second only to the drug traffic in cash flow 
graham also charges that us income tax laws allowing inflated 
writeoffs for museum donations reward pillage and piracy mayan 
stelae have found their way into museums in washington dc 
dallas houston new orleans st louis chicago zurich berlin 
cologne and many others 
university of pennsylvania archaeologist george bass an early 
advocate of museum codes once pinpointed the ethical dilemma in a 
scholarly report the clandestine excavator and antiquities 
smuggler are criminals to be abhorred museums and private 
collectors who encourage their illegal work are held in high 
esteem 
thomas hoving former director of the metropolitan told a 
conference of museum directors that the explosion in smuggled art 
was the most serious issue facing the profession this did not 
deter him two years later from acquiring the sixth century bc 
euphronios krater the finest greek vase there is for a 
reported 1 million cash and 300000 in ancient gold coins 
hoving dubbed the grand acquisitor for the 300 million he 
spent adding to the metropolitans vast collections denied the vase 
was a hot pot and insisted it had been in the hands of a 
private european collector since world war i whose name could not 
be divulged 
dietrich von bothmer the museums curator of greek and roman 
art was met with open derision when he added vague details of its 
purchase in zurich from an armenian living in beirut who was moving 
to australia for tax purposes 
why not an eskimo moving to florida scoffed a new england 
curator 
museum curators have long argued that such acquisitions preserve 
precious art for the enrichment of the public and keep it from 
disappearing into private collections or swiss bank vaults 
dealers and collectors similarly insist they are saving 
antiquities not appreciated in their land of origin from rotting in 
the jungle or as in the case of mayan temples in the yucatan and 
even the great wall of china being used as building blocks by 
developers 
peasants digging into ancient ruins need food for their families 
so why not pay them for finding a cretan amphora or an indian bowl 
that might otherwise wind up under a plow or a shopping mall 
besides in a business where forged documents have long been a 
way of life too scrupulous a stand on acquisitions will only drive 
the best archaeological loot into the booming markets of japan 
where precolumbian art is rapidly replacing french impressionists 
as a status symbol and a giltedged investment

until excavation can be replaced by other exploratory

they were in the thick of the early revolutionary 
movements in china and the soviet union a russian woman and her 
chinese husband but then they fell victim to the various political 
purges in an interview in beijing before the writer was expelled 
from china elizaveta kishkina told of her life with li lisan and 
wondered aloud if china will turn on her and her family again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1933 elizaveta kishkina fell in love with 
the dashing chinese revolutionary li lisan from their romance 
sprang a tale of suffering and love that spans the gulag of josef 
stalin and the labor camps of chinas cultural revolution 
purged twice in china and jailed in the soviet union li died in 
the custody of chinas red guards in 1967 mrs kishkina and their 
two daughters lived on 
for her marriage with li mrs kishkina spent nine years in 
chinese prisons and lost her voice because communist authorities 
who accused her of being a soviet spy prohibited her from speaking 
for nine years her daughters prosecuted also for espionage were 
imprisoned for two years each 
after deng xiaoping came to power in 1978 mrs kishkina 
thinking political purges had ended planned to live out her years 
in peace in beijing but now her adopted country is caught in 
another bloody campaign this time to crush a movement for freedom 
mrs kishkina wonders whether china will turn on her and her family 
again 
of course we are afraid for the future she said in the 
living room of her beijing apartment when you have seen what i 
have seen you can never rest peacefully 
the story of this sovietchinese clan covers more than seven 
decades for mrs kishkina it is a tale of dashed hopes in a 
glorious socialist future and of the instincts of a mother 
protecting her family 
in the end she said as she smiled at her 15yearold 
grandson peter we only have each other the politicians come and 
go but we have survived 
for li it is a sad story of a revolutionary manipulated by his 
superiors and of love for ones country overcoming political beliefs 
and fierce pride 
he was a broken man he had been used up by the revolution and 
by the leaders mrs kishkina said all he wanted was to live in 
peace but they wouldnt even allow him that 
mrs kishkina a 75yearold woman who goes by her chinese name 
lisha lives in a threebedroom apartment in the western section of 
beijing comfortably furnished with a fluffy couch and a small but 
ornate russian samovar it is highclass by chinese standards 
lisha is a woman of sparkling gray eyes who greets guests with 
cookies and cakes she speaks excellent mandarin with a thick 
accent giving her joviality an air of russian mystery 
lisha was born in 1914 into a ukranian aristocratic family that 
had fallen on hard times when she was 6 her father died and her 
mother packed up the family and moved to moscow where three years 
earlier the bolsheviks had seized power 
as a young girl and a teenager lisha believed strongly in the 
revolution in the late 1920s when soviet leaders issued the call 
to develop siberia lisha was one of the first to sign up 
the bands of soviet youth lived a hard life fighting swarms of 
insects in summer and fierce snows and frosts in winter 
in france they say lovers can live on kisses and cool water 
lisha said as revolutionaries we lived on ideology and strong 
tea 
in 1933 she returned to moscow and enrolled at a parttime 
school that year she met li lisan 
li was a shell of a man a gifted labor organizer he had risen 
quickly through the ranks of the fledgling chinese communist party 
and in 1928 with the help of soviet agents was appointed its head 
li was picked because his belief that chinas revolution would 
begin in its cities matched those of stalin when it became apparent 
that li was wrong and that the revolution was occurring in the 
countryside under the leadership of mao tsetung li was sacked and 
given refuge in moscow 
lisha had been hoping to continue her studies and li gave her the 
encouragement she needed the two began seeing each other and soon 
had a simple marriage in line with their political beliefs 
in 1936 lisha was accepted by the moscow pedagological institute 
for foreign languages majoring in french but her husbands 
political problems had just begun 
in the late 1930s a stalinist purge targeted li and he was 
accused of being a japanese spy and a trotskyist he was jailed 
from 193839 
it never crossed my mind to leave the man she said in 
that way i was very traditional revolutionary love to me was not 
free love it was love with a higher purpose

blind mans zoo elektra 10000 maniacs 
 
the beguiling folkrock band from upstate new york 10000 
maniacs are an unlikely success story dont expect them to sound 
happy about it 
teenage pregnancy environmental poisoning rural poverty 
vietnam and central america are all addressed on the dour blind 
mans zoo the strong followup to the maniacs breakthrough lp 
in my tribe 
singer and lyric writer natalie merchant takes somewhat overdone 
political topics and gives them a fresh twist her songs are almost 
like short stories printed on lyric sheets in paragraph form and 
often having only vague connections to the accompanying music 
on the big parade the teenage son of a vietnam war widow 
makes a pilgrimage to the war memorial in washington questioning 
the sense of the conflict that killed his father merchant ends on a 
questioning note abraham had his war too but an honest war or 
so its taught in school 
merchant takes the voice of a soontobe teenage parent on the 
jaunty melody eat for two dream child in my head is a 
nightmare born in a borrowed bed she sings neatly capturing the 
nightmarish aftereffects of one nights mistake 
the delicate trouble me about wanting to take some of the 
burden off the shoulders of a sick friend is particularly 
entrancing 
the four men behind merchant all take turns writing music mostly 
folkrock with occasional harder touches despite the continued 
succession of downbeat topics the record meets the challenge set by 
in my tribe 
that said warning signs abound the record hews so closely to 
the sound of its predecessor that it can almost be called in my 
tribe part 2 10000 maniacs songs tend to be harmonically 
similar so the lesser compositions veer quickly into boredom that 
doesnt bode well for longevity 
rem had a similar problem of how to build on the success of a 
signature sound they succeeded after a few stumbles a similar 
challenge awaits 10000 maniacs

blaze of glory aampm joe jackson 
 
joe jacksons music has changed in the 10 years since his first 
record 
as part of englands new wave jacksons early songs were 
guitarbased concise and almost hurried they packed a punch but 
the approach had limitations 
jackson soon decided there was no need to rush to make his case 
he became more deliberate and began to vary the instrumentation and 
style of his music 
blaze of glory for example offers the sounds of music halls 
down to london broadway torch ballads sentimental thing 
and eastern europe the instrumental acropolis now and thats 
just on side 1 theres also funk pop ballads and rock n roll 
jackson produced the record and coaxed fine performances from the 
many musicians involved he shares the vocals with three others 
even giving away his prettiest melody sentimental thing to 
singer drew barfield 
tying the package together is jacksons anger the one constant 
since his new wave days several titles here in fact would have 
fit on his 1979 debut album you and me against the world 
rant and rave nineteen forever and evil empire 
in the same vein is the dramatic title cut about an entertainer 
named johnny who dies young 
he went out in a blaze of glory and you and i just fade 
away jackson sings with envy and bitterness the convincing 
performance is also an ironic one it offers evidence that jackson 
rather than fading is a talent still on the rise

eddie and the cruisers was one of those 
rare movies that refused to die 
when the rockoriented scotti brothers pictures released the film 
in 1983 bookings were scarce and business was modest eddie and 
the cruisers quickly vanished but not for long the soundtrack 
album began selling big by the time the movie appeared on cable and 
in videocassette it had a ready and eager audience 
now comes eddie and the cruisers ii eddie lives at the tag 
end of hollywoods sequel summer returning as the enigmatic rock 
star eddie wilson is michael pare pronounced pawray 
in the first movie wilsons car plunged off the raritan bridge 
in new jersey and his body was never found that was in 1964 at the 
height of his fame considered one of the lost heroes of early rock 
he actually survived and 18 years later is rebuilding a music career 
incognito in canada 
pare admits that the first eddie seemed unpromising 
it didnt get such a great theatrical release its a rock n 
roll summer movie and we didnt come out until october the 
following summer we went on cable and in the first week the record 
went platinum in another two months it went triple platinum 
he came into the film with zero experience as a rock performer 
he had always been a fan had listened to the golden oldies station 
on radio from the age of 9 and revered such stars as elvis presley 
jerry lee lewis and chuck berry but pare never performed rock until 
he reported to the new jersey locations and started hanging out with 
the musicians 
the actor seems totally convincing as a performer in both 
eddie pictures rock n roll is mostly heart and soul and 
technique he said 
the appeal of eddie and the cruisers he believes is a 
combination of the story and the music it was about the rock n 
rollers who have died on us elvis and eddie cochran and jim 
morrison all those guys that we miss now that really never will 
die 
michael pare is a tall laconic ruggedly handsome man whose 
speech patterns reflect his brooklyn birthright he was one of 10 
children whose father died when michael was 5 his first 
professional training came with the cia no not the snoop agency 
but the culinary institute of america the hyde park ny school 
for future chefs 
all through my high school i worked in restaurants he said 
so when i was admitted to the cia i figured that was my career 
for life i was going to be in the industry and maybe have my own 
restaurant by the time i was 50 
its a great gig man if the kitchen is big its like working 
in a big family theres 10 20 30 chefs in there you do four 
hours of preparation then everybody sits down and has lunch then 
you have three hours of service its a different world you always 
work on holidays youre working when everybody else is 
celebrating its a little like show business 
a friend suggested that pare try acting and he studied for two 
years with uta hagen and marvin nelson pare talked himself into an 
interview with the late casting agent joyce selznick who placed him 
in an abc series the greatest american hero 
he also appeared in such features as undercover streets of 
fire the philadelphia experiment and in the cbs series 
houston knights it was eddie and the cruisers that provided 
the big leap forward 
if you get a hit more than one person will submit scripts and 
you dont have to audition for every role he said yeah it 
changed my career a great deal from a supporting character on a tv 
show to a somewhat leading man 
pares greatest challenge in eddie ii came when he faced a 
screaming las vegas audience for wilsons comeback concert 
that was the first time id been before more than 900 people 
said the actor there was 12000 people out there hungry angry 
young rock n rollers who want their music if they did not love 
us boy we would have had a lot of trouble with this movie 
as it happened they were chanting eddie eddie eddie and 
taking their clothes off and throwing flowers on the stage it was 
really bizarre i thought that was just something you read in rock 
n roll magazines it was all there

once he started writing poems out by the 
juniper trees and bitter brush of the high desert john daniel 
didnt feel he had to scale the sheer granite walls of yosemite 
valley anymore 
the great attraction of creative writing is that it is 
exhilarating said daniel its as exciting as rock climbing or 
mountaineering both are an ascent when you climb a mountain you 
often start in the dark and reach a peak where the whole landscape 
is revealed to you 
tall and rangy at 41 with a beard and short hair flecked with 
gray daniel was sitting in the dark mess hall of camp cottonwood in 
the mountains west of lakeview where he spent two weeks this summer 
directing an arts camp for kids 
his path to writing was far from direct 
i didnt get into it through the academic chute he said 
he bailed out of reed college in portland before graduating 
though he was valedictorian at his high school in bethesda md 
i majored in drugs selfdoubt and confusion and i didnt last 
long daniel said 
it wasnt until he had refused to be drafted in the vietnam war 
studied classical guitar set chokers on a weyerhaeuser logging 
crew trusted his life to a rope on the rock walls of yosemite 
valley and peered into boxcars as a railroad detective in san 
francisco that he started thinking of himself as a writer 
i really owe it to the railroad he said 
in 1970 he landed a job as a railroad dick with the 
transcontinental freight bureau in san francisco his job was to see 
that shippers were shipping the freight they said they were he 
spent weekends rock climbing at yosemite 
after two years he wanted out of the city so he transferred to 
klamath falls located on the eastern slope of the cascades and the 
edge of eastern oregons high desert 
i would walk around the yards a little bit and crack a few 
cars he said i worked three hours a day for about five years 
the job gave him the time to begin writing seriously 
concentrating on short fiction 
i also had these impulses that werent stories he said i 
thought maybe they were poems 
to concentrate on writing daniel quit the railroad in 1978 and 
moved into a cabin on a ranch owned by his friend roger hamilton 
now a klamath county commissioner he stayed there four years 
teaching writing parttime in the lakeview schools 
what i found myself writing about was the landscape the sage 
and junipers stoves and the weather daniel said it was in 
that landscape that i came to myself as a writer 
i had led a shiftless life roger hamiltons ranch was the 
first time i stayed in one place through the turning of the seasons 
so i could come to know it 
his work december in the oregon desert looks humbly at that 
landscape 
this space could wear out eyes and ears and leave you wandering 
wild as sage your pale skin cured red reading signs in antelope 
bones following a prophet tumbleweed over snow and snow to some 
barefisted peak where you shiver in the spell of a scatter of stars 
one bright as the next 
in 1982 daniel left the desert after winning the wallace stegner 
fellowship to stanford university there he lived in a cottage on 
stegners place studied and then taught writing last year daniels 
poems were published as the book common ground and he returned 
to the northwest moving to portland with his wife marilyn who is 
an environmental engineer with the oregon department of 
environmental quality 
stegner wrote of daniel reading through his poems is like a 
long unhurried walk out of doors they heal like fresh air and 
balsam 
poet denise levertov added daniels work makes us realize that 
our unique task is not as we have mistakenly assumed to master our 
world but to respond to it 
daniel uses his writing to clarify his ideas and his life 
in the first phase you have to stand in humility before what 
stands inside of you he said when it comes to the point where 
it is out there the second phase comes in its like a sculpture 
it needs you to consciously model it 
i think its presumptuous of you to know how it turns out your 
little poem can be smarter than you are 
through many of daniels poems runs a continuing amazement that 
out of the universe there would have happened this planet earth 
with a stinging natural beauty that has become his religion 
what disturbs me about christianity is their certainty of 
things daniel said what i find fascinating is the great 
uncertainty of evolution what an adventure what a poem evolution 
is the greatest poem 
emily dickinson said in her terse way that beauty is natures 
fact that makes sense to me she was a scientist in her way 
i think poets need to be scientists most good poetry requires 
clear sensory observation poetry isnt all thought and feelings 
its about things ezra pound said that the best art is the most 
precise art the art that makes true reports thats a good recipe 
for science

tomi jenkins likes a ballad jazzy and light the 
way his hero stevie wonder might write it but the singers earliest 
musical inspiration was heavy and loud the kinks you really ot 
me 
that was the song for me said jenkins a member of the funk 
trio cameo he recently issued his debut solo album tomi 
i couldnt stop singing that it was so different before that 
i was listening to rampb and motown but then i had friends who 
listened to nothing but traffic yes and artists like that man 
this was a whole other world that started my appreciation for whole 
different types of music 
he brought that same approach to cameo which prided itself on 
its appeal to diverse audiences and combines rock pop jazz and 
funk on his own record 
theres a lot of songs on my album that can be played on aor 
albumoriented rock as well as the rampb charts he said its 
not like i consciously set out to write a song for across the board 
i just write that kind of music 
while solo albums are often signs of trouble for rock bands 
jenkins insists that he just wants a change of pace a chance to 
have listeners get to know him better 
proving there are no hard feelings jenkins has fellow cameo 
member larry blackmon producing tomi and is recording again with 
the group for their new record 
i had written a lot of songs he said a couple of them we 
tried to work into cameo but it just didnt come off 
my voice was really never prominently heard in cameo even 
though i knew i could sing i didnt beef about it cameo is a 
concept and i can only do so much within that format sooner or 
later i had to break out and get my own musical ideas 
jenkins grew up in rahway nj remembering it as a nice small 
town but his entertainment days began at cape cod in massachusetts 
my parents would take us there and wed stay in cabins they 
had entertainment in the house where everybody ate so i would sing 
with no accompaniment i would sing the same song a hundred times a 
day 
the reaction was sheer panic they ran 
he had some stage fright but speech and drama classes calmed 
jenkins after graduating from high school he worked fulltime at a 
local chemical company until meeting blackmon in the mid70s 
he had just broken up his band and i was looking for a band 
jenkins said i got together with larry and we started new york 
city players almost a year later we had a record deal with 
casablanca and were calling ourselves cameo 
cameo which also includes nathan leftenant had a rough 
beginning waiting out the disco boom and enduring casablancas 
legal and financial battles 
every year they had another president jenkins said it 
affected us greatly trying to get the music played when you have 
changing regimes things are just scattered and we suffered greatly 
because of it 
but they never considered giving up and finally had their 
commercial break in 1979 with secret omen their first of six 
gold albums pop success came eight years later with word up a 
top 10 single and the title track of their platinum album 
word up was slang for whats happening we heard it first 
in london there were some guys going in to do a show at the bbc and 
one of them standing outside the gate is saying hey man word 
up we came back to the states and wrote the hit record 
shes strange another hit single was also made possible by 
a little eavesdropping 
i remember larry and i were on an elevator a woman says 
thats really strange and we just go strange that happens a 
lot a oneword catch word something that stands out 
jenkins is still always on the lookout for a good song doing his 
best to remember any catchy phrase he happens to hear 
i got scraps of paper all over the house i try to write in a 
book but it never works out i sit down and work out the music 
usually its the melody that inspires the lyrics 
jenkins expects most of his audience to initially consist of 
cameo fans but hes confident hell have success on his own merits 
as they get into it theyll definitely recognize the 
difference between my music and cameos music theyll see that 
heres a guy who can sing and has good songs different songs from 
cameo youd never hear three ballads on a cameo album

author tracy kidder has cut through the 
perpetual handwringing and debate over american education with a 
poignant account of one year in a fifthgrade classroom 
among schoolchildren is kidders chronicle of 180 days in the 
life of teacher chris zajac and her kids a racially and 
economically mixed group whose parents and guardians run the gamut 
from doctors to drug addicts 
kidders previous books were house about the practical and 
emotional complexities of building a house and the soul of a new 
machine the pulitzer prizewinning story of the creation of a new 
minicomputer 
for me this book has much more heart than any other one i 
wrote and its certainly the most important subject kidder said 
of his latest work it was the least mundane subject its all 
about the awakening of minds 
kidder interviewed a number of teachers in holyoke mass before 
settling on zajac a 34yearold native of the small ethnically 
diverse mill town i wasnt looking for one of those mythical 
superstars he said i dont even know if those people exist 
the miracle workers but i did want a good teacher 
among schoolchildren houghton mifflin 1895 culled from 
10000 pages of notes is broadened somewhat by digressions into the 
history of holyoke corporal punishment education reform and 
teaching kidder also follows zajac to puerto rico homeland of many 
of her students but most of the action is focused tightly in the 
classroom 
zajac is depicted as a teacher of enormous energy and compassion 
someone deeply affected by the ups and downs of a very volatile job 
who all too often wakes at midnight haunted by a childs desperate 
situation or her own failure to make a difference 
we meet her on the first day of class at kelly school laying 
down the law mrs zajac gives homework the only meanie gives 
homework she tells them if you put your name on a paper you 
should be proud of it if it isnt your best whats mrs zajac 
going to do make you do it over 
of his first impressions kidder recalls she seemed so strict 
to me i thought gosh this isnt the way a teacher ought to be 
he soon revised his opinion she was not mean not cruel she was 
trying to very quickly get control of her room i dont think 
the kids were as daunted by her as i was she really grew on me 
though it wasnt very long before i realized how good she was 
zajacs students ranged from alice and judith very bright girls 
at opposite ends of the economic spectrum to clarence and robert 
emotionally disturbed children from deprived and possibly abusive 
backgrounds 
the days are sprinkled with some rewards judiths compelling 
essay on her familys move from a pleasant house to a perilous 
housing project an inspired lesson on the american revolution a 
chronic underachievers good test performance 
but to many readers if not to zajac those moments may be 
overshadowed by the childrens problems and the strain of teaching 
them 
there was the learning disabled boy whose grandmother sent back a 
suicide note instead of an agreement to meet with his teacher the 
impossibly obnoxious boy who once wrote in class dear dad were do 
you live i want to come and see you i love you but the only thing is 
do you love me the science fair projects that revealed such 
tragic disparities in the home lives of her students that zajac got 
all future fairs canceled 
zajac also had to deal with youngsters who repeatedly came to 
school with less than six hours sleep those who never did 
homework those who constantly misbehaved and disrupted the class 
those who may have been abused 
at years end nevertheless she is satisfied that some of her 
children have made progress and reinvigorated by her decision to 
teach sixth grade rather than fifth the following year 
would anyone go into teaching after reading this book kidder 
whose mother taught english for more than 20 years said he himself 
wondered that he does not disguise his impatience with the low pay 
lack of respect and poor working conditions teachers must endure or 
the highminded reform efforts that he says seem to leave teachers 
right out of the equation 
but kidder believes his book as it weaves through the sunshine 
and shadow of zajacs year illuminates more than the hardships of 
teaching 
you feel useful in the world youre clearly needed by your 
little clients there are tremendous possibilities for joyful 
work he said it is an incredibly difficult job but it has a 
lovely side to it that i think will continue to attract people

actress sissy spacek after recording the 
soundtrack to the 1980 movie coal miners daughter handed 
guitar player harold bradley a note 
pick them strings guitar man loved working with you it 
said 
bradley did pick and pick and pick 
in the city known worldwide for its guitar players bradley has 
been the most productive chet atkins is more famous and roy clark 
helped popularize the term picker but bradley has been more 
prolific 
in a career spanning 43 years the 63yearold bradley has played 
in literally thousands of recording sessions no one in nashville 
perhaps no one else anywhere comes close to matching his output 
my career sounds like a lie but its really happened 
bradley says calmly in a manner that belies the fervor with which he 
plays 
twelve of the records on which he played with elvis presley 
became millionsellers just a few of the other singers hes 
accompanied include willie nelson marie osmond roger miller 
loretta lynn john davidson patsy cline tom jones buddy holly 
the everly brothers hank williams conway twitty charley pride and 
joan baez 
hes played on movie soundtracks such as pink cadillac and 
smokey and the bandit ii in addition to coal miners 
daughter 
a few of the songs on which hes played include jingle bell 
rock only the lonely stand by your man im sorry 
king of the road its such a pretty world today and make 
the world go away 
for good measure he played at the white house in 1978 
accompanying country music stars tom t hall lynn and twitty who 
were invited by president carter to provide some downhome 
entertainment 
this illustrious production came from a musician who taught 
himself how to play at age 15 and still practices an average of a 
couple hours a day even at age 45 he briefly took lessons in 
classical music 
i love it he says as he approaches a halfcentury of 
plucking the strings i love to practice you have to practice 
there is no end to being a good guitar player 
its like youve got this big jigsaw puzzle in front of you 
you put a few pieces in and you get an idea of the picture then you 
realize theres more pieces on the outside so you keep trying to put 
them in and you realize you can never fill in the whole thing 
bradley who does not sing has been enterprising as well as 
busy for sound effects he once went to his car and got a pair of 
tire chains returned to the studio and dropped them to the floor 
during the recording session for the song chain gang 
he has no preference among the various electric or acoustical 
guitars saying simply i prefer what im playing at the time i 
like to play all of em 
an engaging man with volumes of scrapbooks and memorabilia about 
his career bradley believes versatility has been his helpmate as 
much as ability 
i dont know that i am good but i can offer experience ive 
been very lucky to play a wide variety of music country big band 
rock n roll gospel 
if i played one kind i wouldnt have been around this long if 
i was a rock n roll specialist they would not have needed me on 
other recordings that required different abilities 
he also plays other instruments joking that i play two in 
selfdefense the banjo and mandolin 
he says his biggest thrills are those indescribable moments when 
musicians combine for special sounds in the studio 
when something magic happens you get a tremendous high you 
cant turn creativity off and on like water ive enjoyed that 
several times with several artists where it was such a marvelous 
music experience that you felt something great happened 
bradley feels that he is still getting better except for his rock 
n roll playing 
to do that you have to go out and play it he said and i 
play a certain style rockabilly style pretty good but to go out 
and play like van halen and those guys no ill never do that but 
hell never come here and play the guitar the bass guitar the 
banjo the mandolin the ukulele so its kind of a tradeoff 
what youre buying if you buy me is experience and intonation 
and ability but even that cant guarantee a hit record the public 
decides that

japan will have plenty of room for american 
beef if us producers remain competitive in the international 
market the japanese ambassador to the united states said during a 
tour of montana 
by the end of 1991 american beef can come into japan on a 
free competitive basis nobuo matsunaga said as he began a 
threeday tour of montana including several ranches your rivals 
are argentina and australia so you must remain competitive there 
is much room for beef in japan 
opening up japan to us beef exports has helped our ranchers a 
great deal said us sen max baucus dmont chairman of the 
senate international trade subcommittee nationwide ranchers 
incomes increased about 800 million in 1988 largely a result of an 
agreement reached that year with japan to open a market that is 
expected to reach 2 billion annually 
recent cattle price increases also stem from opening the japanese 
market to us exports baucus said us beef exports most going 
to japan increased the value of the average feed steer by 75 in 
1988 he said 
matsunaga was asked friday about the purchase of the selkirk 
ranch near dillon in southwestern montana by the zenchiku meat 
importing company of japan and the purchase of a beef slaughtering 
plant in yakima wash by another japanese exportimport firm 
these are commercial talks between interested parties said 
matsunaga our policy is not to intervene in business talks if 
these investments are successful im sure it will be followed by 
others 
baucus said the japanese beef market was almost completely closed 
to us exports until last year 
although japanese consumers clearly wanted to purchase high 
quality us beef beef was for years the most popular foreign 
purchase for japanese tourists returning to japan us beef 
exports were kept out of japan by a tight quota and other 
barriers said baucus the japanese did agree to ease these 
restrictions somewhat in 1984 but most remained in place until 
1988 
baucus said that in 1988 after seven years of almost continuous 
negotiations the united states and japan signed an agreement that 
obligates japan to phase out its beef quota and most other 
government barriers to beef imports by 1991 
the quota will be replaced by a 75 percent tariff that would be 
reduced over three years although the tariff is high all 
government surcharges and tariffs in 1988 comprised an effective 
tariff rate of about 100 percent

the us forest service is objecting to a 
bill in congress that would determine how much governmentowned 
timber can be sold in the northwest 
forest service officials say the bill would cause further 
destruction of the old growth forest habitat of the northern spotted 
owl the bird has been the center of disputes between the timber 
industry and preservationists who want to stop logging in the owls 
areas 
bills passed by both houses of congress call for sales of 8 
billion board feet of timber by oct 1 1990 that much logging 
could undo most of the legal and environmental safeguards put into 
place this year to help ensure the survival of the owl the 
officials told the sunday oregonian 
conservation groups hoping to reduce the timber sales plan a 
lastditch effort when the bills are considered by a joint 
conference committee 
under the bills forest service officials said the government 
would have to sell nearly all the oldgrowth timber currently locked 
up by a federal court order violate us fish and wildlife service 
guidelines on the owls protection and exceed its own longterm 
timber production capacity 
loggers say that if more timber isnt cut they will run out of 
logs before the end of the year and have to shut down their mills 
the sales target measures pushed by sen mark o hatfield 
rore and sen brock adams dwash call for lifting injunctions 
that have halted most old growth sales on national forests in 
western oregon and washington this year 
to make the 8 billion board feet were definitely going to 
have to sell a very high percentage of that volume that is 
enjoined deputy regional forester john lowe said 
the sunday oregonian said the agencys concerns have prompted a 
reevaluation of the target sales level by congressional staff 
members who were briefed thursday by forest service officials in 
portland 
we have been receiving a lot of conflicting information from 
the forest service about whether they can do this an unidentified 
hatfield aide told the newspaper

the us trade deficit narrowed to 2772 
billion from april through june the smallest quarterly imbalance in 
four years the government reported today 
the commerce department said the gap between imports and us 
exports showed a 23 percent improvement from the first three months 
of the year when the trade deficit totaled 2838 billion 
the improvement stemmed from a 34 percent increase in exports 
which climbed to a record 9087 billion this more than offset a 2 
percent rise in imports which also hit a record of 11858 billion 
the apriljune trade deficit the difference between imports and 
exports was at the lowest since a 257 billion deficit in the 
first quarter of 1985 
for the first six months of the year the deficit was running at 
an annual rate of 1122 billion down 117 percent from the 1272 
billion deficit registered in all of 1988 
however many economists are predicting the deficit will begin 
rising in the last half of this year they are worried that the 
rising value of the dollar will make us goods less competitive on 
overseas markets at the same time that americans appetite for 
imports remains undiminished 
todays report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance of 
payment basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the commerce 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports 
the totals are slightly different becuase the new report excludes 
military sales by the us government to foreign governments and 
makes other minor adjustments in the monthly figures 
in the apriljune quarter nonfarm exports increased 2 billion 
to a record 801 billion the largest increases were in industrial 
supplies and materials capital goods and consumer goods us 
agricultural exports were virtually unchanged at 107 billion in 
the apriljune quarter wheat shipments dropped 500 million 
reflecting a drop in exports to the soviet union 
the increase in imports reflected a jump in petroleum imports 
which rose 24 percent to 134 billion with most of the increase 
coming from higher prices rather than volume nonoil imports 
declined by 300 million to 1052 billion with the largest 
decrease coming from a 17 billion drop in foreign car shipments

scandinavian airline systems and an unidentified 
partner reportedly are involved in advanced talks with texas air 
corp about buying all or part of the houston companys continental 
airlines subsidiary 
the parties have been discussing the form of a possible sale and 
terms for some time and now they have reached the point of trying 
to draft a letter of intent the wall street journal reported today 
late last week texas air chairman frank lorenzo said the company 
may consider selling a minority or controlling interest in 
continental he said texas air officials had talked to interested 
parties but he gave no details 
art kent a spokesman for texas air said this morning he could 
not confirm or deny the report 
its inappropriate to comment on anything like this kent 
said 
he said if discussions with an interested party reach a serious 
point and a letter of intent is appropriate there will be an 
appropriate disclosure 
texas air the nations largest airline holding company also 
owns strikebound eastern airlines the miamibased carrier which is 
in the midst of bankruptcy reorganization wouldnt be involved in 
any transaction involving sas 
sas which currently has a 99 percent stake in texas air as part 
of a marketing agreement wouldnt be able to buy continental 
outright because of us transportation department rules that 
prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25 percent share 
in a us carrier 
talks between the parties are an outgrowth of meetings that began 
between sas and continental officials in june 1988 when the two 
began work on the joint marketing agreement those talks turned to 
sas possibly buying a stake in continental and that aspect has been 
pursued with new seriousness in the past 30 days an unidentified 
source told the journal 
the talks apparently heated up because of signs that 
houstonbased continental could remain profitable after massive 
losses in 1987 and 1988 and the soaring value of airline stocks 
sas is 50 percent owned by the governments of sweden denmark and 
norway in europe its hub is copenhagen

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
country improved slightly last week climbing by six to total 909 
baker hughes inc reported 
the increase was marginal compared with the 45 rigs added to the 
count the previous week that increase was due partly to areas 
drying out from the heavy rains brought on by hurricane chantal 
several weeks ago baker hughes officials said 
a year ago the count stood at 935 the company said monday 
ike kerridge vice president of stockholder relations and 
economist for baker hughes said more drilling has been predicted 
for the second half of the year 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
texas which accounted for more than half of the 45rig increase 
was the big loser this time with its count dropping by 14 
among other major oil producing states oklahomas count 
increased by six and wyomings was up by three california new 
mexico north dakota and michigan each gained two more rigs 
kansas lost three rigs louisiana lost two and ohios count was

lower monday on the chicago board of trade pressured by rainfall in 
the midwest where corn and soybeans are approaching maturity

critical said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago 
three weeks ago if we had had the kind of rain we had over the 
weekend and today we would have been limit down he said 
referring to the exchanges permitted limits on daily price 
fluctuation 
the days action also demonstrated strong support in the soybean 
market at prices around 570 a bushel for september delivery the 
september contracts price fell as low as 570 during the session 
but enough buying interest surfaced there to lift it back above 
575

higher with the contract for delivery in september at 388 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with september at 232 a

the cattle markets typically slow late in august after retailers

whittle communications has named a 
committee of 12 educators and public figures to advise the company 
on its proposed classroom television network 
american federation of teachers president albert shanker and 
former education secretary th bell were among the members of the 
panel whittle chairman christopher whittle said sunday 
whittle communications has undertaken a 200 million project to 
supply television equipment and classroom programming to 6 million 
students around the country by the end of 1990 
education groups including the national parentteacher 
association and state officials in new york and california have 
opposed whittles proposed 12minute daily news programs called 
channel one because the broadcasts will contain two minutes of 
commercials 
whittle said the group would help his companys classroom 
programming to fit in with the needs of teachers and students 
shanker who heads the nations secondlargest teachers union 
told whittle in an aug 24 letter he had strong reservations both 
about the propriety of advertising in schools and the educational 
effectiveness of the shows 
but he said he would join the panel on a twoyear trial basis 
because i believe its important for my organization that i be 
involved in shaping the program 
if this were a perfect world all of americas classrooms would 
be equipped with the latest technologies funded by school boards and 
other government agencies he wrote unfortunately such is not 
the case and its unlikely we will get the needed technologies 
without the participation of companies like whittle in such 
initiatives 
bell served under presidents reagan ford and nixon 
whittle spokesman david jarrard said bell will be the only member 
paid for his work on the panel he did not disclose how much bell 
would be paid 
other members of the panel included industrialist ross perot 
timewarner chairman j richard munro author alex haley and former 
tennessee governor and current university of tennessee president 
lamar alexander 
the panel also included james harvey a staff writer for the 
education report a nation at risk matina horner retiring 
president of radcliff college janelle leonard director of 
technology training in the washington dc public schools

midway airlines a growing carrier facing a 
possible takeover threat said monday it is strengthening its 
defenses against hostile suitors 
chicagobased midway said it had loosened the trigger on its 
shareholder rights plan commonly called a poison pill by 
lowering to 15 percent from 20 percent the portion of its 
outstanding common stock that an outsider would have to acquire to 
kick the plan into action 
at that point all shareholders except the outsider would be 
entitled to buy additional midway stock at belowmarket prices 
potentially raising the amount the outsider would have to pay to buy 
enough shares to control the company 
midway is strengthening its takeover defenses just three weeks 
after ampcopittsburgh corp a pittsburghbased manufacturing 
company disclosed that it had acquired a 66 percent stake in 
midway and said it might seek control of the airline 
midway said monday in a statement its action was not taken in 
response to any known effort to acquire control of the company but 
was designed to ensure that midway shareholders would receive fair 
and equal treatment in the event of any future proposed takeover 
midway also said the amended shareholder rights plan guards 
against partial tender offers open market accumulations and other 
abusive tactics to gain control of midway airlines without 
negotiations with the board of directors 
ampcopittsburgh spokesman marshall berkman declined to comment 
on the development 
a poison pill alone is not considered a complete takeover shield 
but such plans often become the subjects of legal battles in 
takeover wars which slows down an unwanted suitor 
midway the nations 16thlargest carrier operates from midway 
airport on chicagos southwest side 
in 10 years midways markets have grown from three destination 
cities to 51 the airline recently began firstclass service and has 
ordered 74 new jets from mcdonnelldouglas corp worth about 2

texas air corp which is considering a sale of 
part or all of its continental airlines subsidiary reportedly is 
involved in advanced talks about such a transaction with 
scandinavian airlines system and an unidentified partner 
talks about the form of a possible sale and the terms have been 
going on for some time and the parties have reached the point of 
trying to draft a letter of intent the wall street journal reported 
in mondays editions 
a texas air spokesman however would not confirm that any such 
talks have taken place 
i cant confirm or deny anything spokesman art kent told the 
associated press its inappropriate to comment on anything like 
this 
kent said if discussions with an interested party reach a 
serious point and a letter of intent is appropriate there will be 
an appropriate disclosure 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo announced last thursday that the 
houstonbased airline company the largest in the nation may 
consider selling a minority or controlling interest in continental 
strikebound eastern airlines is texas airs other airline 
subsidiary but it would not be involved in any continental 
transaction 
lorenzo said texas air officials have spoken to parties 
interested in continental but he has not provided any details about 
the talks 
sas already has a 99 percent stake in texas air as part of a 
marketing agreement 
if sas is interested in buying part of houstonbased continental 
the transaction would have to be structured in such a way that sas 
would get a minority holding department of transportation rules 
prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25 percent stake 
in a us carrier 
talks that began in june 1988 concerning the texas air marketing 
agreement apparently turned to sas possibly buying part of 
continental that aspect has been pursued with new seriousness in 
the past 30 days an unidentified source told the journal 
signs that continental could remain profitable after massive 
losses in 1987 and 1988 as well as the soaring value of airline 
stocks apparently heated up the discussions 
lorenzos surprise announcement came a week after a boston 
investment firm disclosed that it holds 12 percent of texas air 
loomis sayles amp co a boston portfolio management company has 
said its 12 percent stake was held for investment because it 
believed texas air would show a profit in 1990 
the possible sale of continental could doom eastern according to 
securities analysts and labor leaders 
miamibased eastern is in the sixth month of a strike by 
machinists union members pilots and flight attendants and is 
flying about a third of its prestrike 1100 daily flights 
weve always believed that the plan was to shrink eastern and 
roll it into continental said louis a marchesano an analyst 
with the philadelphia brokerage janney montgomery scott inc 
the sale of continental would mean eastern would have to make 
it on its own marchesano said monday and the risk of a 
shrunken eastern not making it is substantial 
eastern which filed for chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy 
shortly after the walkout began in march is losing more than 15 
million a day 
the sale of continental according to marchesano would mean 
lorenzo might be leaving the airline business 
the miami spokesman for the air line pilots association ron

japanese businessman ginji yasuda filed monday 
to put his ailing aladdin hotel under federal bankruptcy protection 
citing debt that outstripped the resorts assets by more than 38 
million 
yasuda the first foreigner to be licensed to operate a nevada 
casino reported in the chapter 11 filing that his ginji corp owed 
1212 million to various creditors while having total assets of 
829 million 
the filing which had been expected comes on the heels of the 
nevada gaming commissions decision last week to pull yasudas 
license and give the aladdin until next tuesday to comply with a 
list of conditions to allow its casino to remain open 
this was the first step was to get some breathing room for the 
hotel said james shea an attorney who worked on the petitition 
gaming commission chairman john oreilly said the bankruptcy 
filing did not changed the commissions insistence that the aladdin 
hire several new officers inject 3 million in cash into the casino 
and disclose the source of recent loans to the resort 
shea said the hotel has begun to comply with the commissions 
conditions including the hiring monday of longtime gaming figure 
robert brooker to be general manager 
he said hotel officials will hold talks with gaming regulators 
this week in an effort to have the 3 million requirement set aside 
shea said the bankruptcy filing should mean business as 
normal at the hotel with employees contuing to get paid and all 
casino operations intact 
the bankruptcy filing staves off a scheduled auction of the 
aladdin by the holder of a 325 million mortgage on the resort 
yasuda himself took the longtroubled resort out of bankruptcy in 
1986 when he bought the club for 54 million and spent another 20 
million in improvements 
yasuda was given a twoyear limited gaming license in 1987 but 
casino regulators became increasingly concerned over his failure to 
comply with regulatory requirements and the casinos increasing 
losses 
at last weeks gaming commission meeting commissioners voted to 
strip yasuda of his license but allow gaming to continue at the 
resort while attempts continued to sell it 
the commission ordered that the 55yearold yasuda who is 
reported to be seriously ill at his los angeles home stay out of 
the club and remove his name from any accounts
