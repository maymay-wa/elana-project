conservation techniques that were urged during 
the energy shortages of the 70s should be adopted to combat global 
warming caused by pollution the epa says 
the environmental protection agency in a report friday outlined 
actions such as development of fuelefficient cars energysaving 
homes and solar technology needed by the end of the century to 
curtail global warming they say such warming will occur unless air 
pollution is reduced 
in its report to the senate subcommittee on environmental 
protection the epa said most scientists agree that without action 
to reduce pollution the earth can be expected to warm by 4 to 11 
degrees fahrenheit over the next 100 years 
theres no doubt there is a consensus that the greenhouse 
phenomenon is very real said sen max baucus dmont the 
subcommittee chairman after hearing epa administrator william k 
reilly summarize the epa report 
scientists believe that a variety of pollutants are causing a 
greenhouse effect that traps the suns infrared radiation 
instead of allowing it to go back into space resulting in increased 
warming the gases most responsible for the warming are carbon 
dioxide chlorofluorocarbons methane and nitrous oxides 
the epa report said no single technology or policy can have 
significant impact in mitigating the accumulation of greenhouse 
gases because of their wide use instead it said that only by 
dealing with the problem broadly can there be significant reductions 
the recommendations outlined in the epa report will be used by 
both the administration and congress to assess what kinds of 
regulatory action or legislation might be needed on global warming 
one focus the agency said must be aimed at reducing the use of 
fossil fuels which produce carbon dioxide by far the largest 
single contributor to global warming last decade the high cost of 
such fuels and the easy shutoff of foreign sources prompted 
conservation moves 
to curtail energy use the report proposed 
increasing average automobile fuel economy levels to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2000 this is in sharp contrast to the reagan 
administration which in recent years has urged elimination of 
federal fuel economy standards and accommodated auto industry 
requests not to set fleetwide standards above 265 mpg 
taking measures to make new single family homes more energy 
efficient so that on average they will use 50 percent less fuel heat 
in the year 2000 than the average in 1980 
setting fees of 7 percent to 20 percent on carbon emissions from 
natural gas oil and coal to encourage less use of those fossil 
fuels 
the epa also suggested increasing research into solar technology 
so it competes with oil and gas and pushing to get all industrial 
countries to require catalytic converters similar to those required 
in us automobiles 
but the report emphasized that increased energy efficiency will 
not in itself provide the total answer it said efforts must be made 
to 
stop the loss of forests around the world by beginning in 1990 a 
program aimed at planting at least as many trees as are cut down or 
destroyed trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow keeping the gas 
from getting into the atmosphere 
end the use of chlorofluorocarbons by all industrialized 
countries over the next 14 years and take action to sharply curtail 
the chemicals use by developing countries 
the bush administration and the western european countries 
recently agreed to phase out use of such gases which contribute to 
depletion of the worlds ozone layer and are believed to be a major 
contributor to global warming

the national rifle association is denying an 
accusation that it indirectly sent messages to national drug 
director william j bennett threatening his political future 
the allegations are absolutely ridiculous said wayne 
lapierre executive director of nras institute for legislative 
action 
an administration source said friday that the warnings to bennett 
through third parties threaten that if he has thoughts of a 
political future he can forget them if he doesnt respect the power 
of the nra 
bennett has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for elected 
office 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said bennett is 
very angry at the nra and that while hes not looking for a 
fight with the nra he wont walk away from it and may battle them 
in public if need be 
bennett said friday through spokesman don hamilton there have 
been a lot of phone calls a lot of pressure lets cool off 
the issue arose tuesday when at bennetts urging treasury 
secretary nicholas brady immediately suspended import permits for 
more than 110000 assaultstyle rifles such as the semiautomatic 
versions of ak47s and uzi carbines colt industries inc 
subsequently decided on its own to suspend sales of its ar15 the 
most popular usmade semiautomatic assault rifle 
president bush had told bennett a week earlier to develop a 
policy on the rifles calls for a ban have been prompted by scores 
of drugrelated shootings and the recent killing of five california 
schoolchildren by a man wielding such a weapon 
publicly the nra has reacted calmly to the decision saying it 
would relieve the media hysteria over the guns and should 
provide an atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this 
issue 
but privately the source alleged the nra has been relaying 
warnings via private people who are not in government 
during an interview earlier in the day bennett said he believed 
most members of the nra do not support an anything goes attitude 
toward gun ownership and said he had spoken with friends of his who 
are hunters these people have no use or interest in assault 
rifles he said 
the anything goes idea lets just get our hands on any kind 
of weapon i think thats a view of the world thats not shared by 
most americans by most members of the national rifle association 
and i think an awful lot of people out there are concerned about the 
kind of firepower that were seeing used in our streets he said 
bennett said he was not surprised that sales of semiautomatic 
assault rifles have taken off since the import suspension and colts 
action this week but he said if people are doing this because 
they think that this could mean the end of guns that no more guns 
would be available then theyre mistaken 
the tradition in this country of a lawabiding citizen having 
guns using them for lawful purposes teaching their kids how to 
hunt target shooting is as old as this republic itself and its 
not something anybody wants to disturb 
echoing the nras words bennett said everybody knows 
ultimately the problem isnt the gun the problem is the gun in the 
wrong hands 
but it seems to me reasonable measures can be found and taken 
in this effort which dont deprive or interfere with that good and 
decent practice of people enjoying their firearms in lawful ways and 
yet respond and speak appropriately to this escalation this arms 
race in the cities that police have spoken about so eloquently 
clearly theres a large middle ground there

former wyoming congressman dick cheney was 
sworn in as the nations 17th secretary of defense after a unanimous 
senate endorsement that one republican complained may have been too 
swift 
cheney won senate confirmation friday on a 920 vote just one 
day after the senate armed services committee gave him its unanimous 
blessing 
shortly after fridays vote cheney resigned as wyomings sole 
congressmen and then was sworn in as defense chief during a private 
ceremony in his capitol hill office a large formal oathtaking 
ceremony was scheduled for next tuesday 
later in the afternoon friday cheney traveled to his new 
pentagon office where he met with donald atwood the gm executive 
who has been nominated to become deputy defense secretary and with 
several reagan administration holdovers for briefings 
officials said cheney would probably work at least part of the 
weekend trying to get settled in 
cheneys elevation to the defense post finally completed 
formation of president bushs cabinet a process slowed by the 
bruising fight over the presidents first choice for defense 
secretary former texas sen john tower 
tower was rejected by the senate 5347 on march 9 after weeks 
of controversy over his personal life drinking habits and 
consulting work for large defense contractors 
cheney was sworn into office by david cooke director of 
administration and management in the office of defense secretary 
present were his wife lynne their two daughters elizabeth and 
mary and his parents richard and marge 
i am proud to have the opportunity to serve the president of 
the united states and the nation as secretary of defense cheney 
said but at the same time i will miss the house and more than 
anything i regret that i must step down after representing the 
state of wyoming for 10 years 
the rancor surrounding the tower nomination was largely absent 
when the senate moved quickly this week on cheney although some 
bitterness remained sen arlen specter rpa complained the 
senate had rushed to judgment on cheney after the dispute over 
tower and with a twoweek recess looming 
theres hardly been a chance for people to find out about 
congressman cheneys nomination in the press media to sit down and 
write a letter and have it delivered specter said i think 
were correct and im prepared to vote for congressman cheney but i 
do think this timetable ought not set a precedent 
sen john warner of virginia top republican on the senate armed 
services committee denied cheney was put on a fast track noting 
that because he was a congressman his financial records were 
already on file in addition warner said the fbi expedited its 
background check 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman later responded 
more pointedly saying i gather what he specter wanted us to do 
was to wait for the rumor and innuendo to come in 
nunn led the fight to kill the tower nomination and came under 
harsh criticism for his handling of the proceedings the georgia 
democrat used his time on the senate floor to defend the committees 
process 
wyoming sen alan simpson said he and sen malcom wallop both 
republicans felt a mixture of pride and sadness because their 
states congressional delegation was losing a man of distinction 
and honor and rare political savvy 
a special election will be held in wyoming to fill the house seat 
vacated by cheney 
senators not present for the vote on cheney were william 
armstrong rcolo rudy boschwitz rminn jake garn rutah phil 
gramm rtexas john heinz rpa james jeffords rvt terry 
sanford dnc and james mcclure ridaho

twentyone senators have lined up against their 
steelstate colleagues and called on president bush to end steel 
import quotas covering 19 nations and the european community 
the senators said in a letter friday to bush that the restraints 
have driven up steel prices and caused product shortages they said 
the united states needed a sensible steel policy that considered 
not just steelmakers but other producers too 
the senators 18 of them republican face stiff opposition 
fiftyfive other senators many of them from steelproducing states 
have signed onto a bill empowering the bush administration to extend 
the import curbs beyond their sept 30 expiration 
the reagan administration negotiated fiveyear 
productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements in 1984 with 
japan south korea brazil south africa the european community and 
other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the united 
states 
three days before last novembers election bush pledged to 
continue the restraints in some form but with the steel industry 
newly profitable opponents of the curbs led by a coalition of 
us manufacturers believe they can make a case for ending the 
program or at least narrowing its scope 
manufacturers of home appliances construction and farm 
machinery industrial equipment auto parts and other products all 
rely on steel as a raw material said the letter to bush 
in the experience of many of these manufacturers steel 
voluntary restraint agreements have caused higher prices and 
shortages of some steel products and are undermining their ability 
to compete in international markets the letter said 
it is important that steel trade be considered from the 
perspective of all us manufacturers not just the steel industry 
alone it said the senators invited bush to work with congress to 
end the burden of the quotas 
but sen john heinz rpa a leading advocate of continued 
restraints said through a spokesman friday that the conditions that 
compelled steel firms to seek government aid in 1984 remain 
there are still some senators who keep their heads in the sand 
when it comes to the fact that countries have not discontinued their 
unfair trading practices of dumping and subsidies said richard

leaders of eastern airlines striking unions 
are shrugging off their inability to prompt congress to quickly 
produce legislation aimed at helping the thousands of picketers 
the two bills that the carriers workers are pinning their hopes 
on both bogged down on friday at least temporarily as the senate 
began its twoweek easter recess 
union leaders said the delay would not be overly harmful to 
strikers who began their third week of picketing today labor 
leaders said they are relying more heavily on two other strategies 
working in the bankruptcy courts and seeking a buyer for the 
grounded airline 
we never indicated to any of our members that these bills were 
a panacea they would be passed quickly or anything like that 
william winpisinger president of the international association of 
machinists said in an interview 
we told our pilots up front that things in the house would go 
quickly but the senate would be an uphill fight said henry a 
duffy president of the air line pilots association 
the eastern strike began when the airlines 8500 machinists 
walked off their jobs in a wage and benefit dispute and were 
followed by the carriers pilots and flight attendants 
senate democrats scheduled a vote for april 5 the chambers 
second posteaster day of business on whether to allow 
consideration of a bill that would hand the government a role in 
ending the walkout republicans have so far blocked action on the 
measure which would compel president bush to name a special board 
to recommend a way to end the strike 
at the senate judiciary committee officials of easterns parent 
company texas air corp voiced opposition to a measure that would 
up the ante for management the bill introduced by sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio would allow easterns creditors access to the 
assets of texas air which also owns continental airlines eastern 
filed for protection from its creditors under the federal bankruptcy 
code on march 9 
texas airs associate general counsel elliott m seiden told 
the panel that the bill would be unfair oppressive and 
unconstitutional and would have dangerous repercussions throughout 
the airline industry 
in the future no corporation could or would consider acquiring 
a troubled airline or starting a new airline because the risk 
of failing could not be confined to the new venture itself seiden 
told the senators 
both bills are considered long shots for enactment into law 
administration officials have threatened a veto of the emergency 
board bill 
the bankruptcy revision measure has been questioned by several 
lawmakers including sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the 
judiciary panel who said friday that he wants to study how the 
proposal would effect other airlines 
union leaders and their democratic supporters have sought action 
on the bills anyway arguing that their efforts would at the very 
least be good for strikers morale

the us energy system could handling a sudden 
and sustained loss of oil imports without suffering shortages of 
gasoline and other refined oil products although prices might jump 
a governmentsponsored study has concluded 
the study by the national petroleum council an advisory group to 
the energy department said the key to managing an import cutoff is 
quick action by the government to tap into the strategic petroleum 
reserves underground oil stocks 
in the event of a loss of oil imports equal to 3 million barrels 
a day representing about 40 percent of last years average import 
rate the strategic reserves in louisiana and texas could be used 
to meet most of the shortfall according to a draft of the study 
provided friday to the associated press the study assumed the 
imported oil would be cut off for three months 
the strategic reserves currently hold about 555 million barrels 
of crude oil the system was created by congress in 1975 in response 
to the arab oil embargo that year 
the study made no firm predictions about price increases 
resulting from a supply emergency but john lichtblau a private 
energy expert who helped compile the draft report said in an 
interview that prices would be expected to rise sharply even if the 
oil transport system succeeded in averting shortages 
the possibility of a price explosion as an instant reaction in 
such a volatile situation is highly likely said lichtblau 
president of petroleum industry research foundation he said it was 
impossible to predict how high prices would go 
energy industry officials and many on capitol hill have voiced 
increasing alarm in recent weeks at a trend toward rapidly growing 
us dependence on foreign oil imports last year equaled 42 percent 
of supply up from 31 percent in 1985 this trend is linked to a 
drop in us oil output and rising consumption 
the concern has fueled an oil industry drive to win congressional 
approval to drill for oil in the arctic national wildlife refugee in 
northern alaska and off the shores of california and florida where 
prospects for discoveries are considered good 
some energy executives also have cited the import trend as a 
reason for congress to approve an import fee on oil and for 
providing new tax breaks for oil drillers 
the study on how the nations oil transportation system would 
respond to supply emergencies was requested by john herrington in 
february 1987 while he was energy secretary final conclusions are 
to be presented to energy secretary james d watkins in midapril 
said carla byrd a petroleum council spokeswoman 
the draft report cites three main reasons why even a severe 
disruption of oil supplies would not cause a shortage of petroleum 
products the large amounts of oil in transit on ocean tankers 
barges and in pipelines a more flexible and efficient oil refining 
and transport system and the availability of strategic reserves 
the study also said the energy system could cope with a shutdown 
of the transalaska pipeline system for 30 days without causing 
shortages of gasoline or other products the pipeline carries oil 
from the north slope of alaska to the port of valdez for shipment to 
the lower 48 states hawaii and the virgin islands

two democratic senators say theyll keep 8000 
in campaign contributions from an importedcar dealers group even 
though both complained the organization is a foreign agent forbidden 
to make such payments 
although the auto dealers and drivers free trade pac gave 5000 
to sen bob graham of florida and 3000 to sen harry reid of 
nevada last year it also spent nearly 1 million to defeat them and 
sen richard bryan dnev 
those three senators along with sen david boren dokla 
signed a letter to the justice department asking it to investigate 
whether the pac ought to be registered as a foreign agent 
if the organization were found to be a foreign agent operating 
with foreign funds spending that money to influence an american 
election would be illegal 
nevertheless neither graham nor reid plan to give the money back 
unless the justice department tells them to do so their spokesmen 
said 
i mean these guys are hypocrites tom nemet chairman of the 
pac said friday they asked us for money to support them 
nemet and frank glacken the importedauto dealer pacs executive 
director deny theyre working for foreigners 
the pac spent nearly 26 million last year on house and senate 
elections of that total about 83 percent was spent to help 
republican candidates according to figures compiled by the federal 
election commission 
nemet and glacken said in a telephone interview from their office 
in new york city that reid bryan and graham are trying to get even 
because the group spent large amounts of money against them 
nemet and glacken said the organizations funding comes entirely 
from american citizens 
jean neal a spokeswoman for bryan acknowledged that bryan was 
not thrilled that the pac spent more than half a million dollars 
against him ken klein a spokesman for graham said the senator 
would wait to see what the justice department decides craig varoga 
spokesman for reid said only that the senator does not plan to give 
back any money 
boren who has neither been opposed by nor accepted money from 
the group signed the letter because his colleagues asked him to and 
because he is opposed to the role political action committees in 
general are playing in american politics said spokesman john deeken 
under federal law individuals or firms representing foreign 
governments people or companies have to register with the justice 
department as foreign agents and report what activities they have 
carried out for their clients 
while foreign agents could still give money to political 
campaigns as individual american citizens the law does not permit 
them to make such contributions in their role as foreign agents 
the pac also paid out big money to help trent lott in 
mississippi connie mack in florida and malcolm wallop in wyoming 
all three of those republicans won their senate elections 
lott had 319126 spent on his behalf by the pac mack received a 
10000 contribution and had another 326050 spent for him and 
wallop got a 4000 contribution with 88862 spent on his behalf 
according to the fec 
the pac also spent money independently on two house races and 
the beneficiaries there were democrats 
rep david skaggs of colorado had 80000 spent independently for 
him and rep richard stallings of idaho got 45000 spent 
independently on his behalf

the pavia tower toppled the tower of pisa is leaning 
further than ever and dozens of other artworks have been shrouded in 
scaffolding or turned over to restorers 
modern day damage from traffic and pollution and simple old age 
are exacting a heavy toll on some of italys most famous monuments 
the collapse on friday of the 255foot medieval tower in the 
northern city of pavia was one of the most dramatic blows to italys 
historic patrimony since a bell tower in venice toppled 87 years ago 
but experts say is it symptomatic of the problems afflicting art 
works in italy 
there has been inadequate regular maintenance and we have 
reached the absurd where if an art superintendent wants to send a 
letter hes forced to pay for the stamps franco piacenti head of 
the art section of the governments national research committee 
told a convention on protecting artworks in florence friday he 
commented after word of the pavia collapse reached the experts 
two people were killed and 15 injured when the tower collapsed in 
pavia a city founded in 568 by the longobards a germanic tribe 
and later home of the lombard rulers 
the tower was 900 years old and possibly suffered damage from 
heavy rains last august the architect in charge of monument 
preservation however said the cause was probably the natural decay 
of the mortar cementing the bricks 
its something due to age which cannot be predicted its 
typical of ancient towers said maria antonietta abrate it also 
happened to the bell tower of venice 
in 1902 the 1000yearold st marks bell tower in venice 
toppled without warning a worldwide subscription raised money to 
build an exact reproduction which was completed in 1912 
italys most famous tower the leaning tower of pisa has been 
judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate future 
the 800yearold tower continued to increase its lean last year 
according to the annual report recently issued by the group charged 
with preservation of the marble monument but giuseppe toniolo head 
of the group said he expected it to stand for as long as another 
two centuries at its current rate of lean 
the tower is closely watched very closely watched said 
toniolo in a telephone interview just because one tower falls 
doesnt mean another will 
the 180foot marble monument begun in 1173 began to lean when 
it was only 34 feet high when the soil underneath it began to give 
way experts have been studying projects to support the tower while 
keeping its famous tilt but no work has begun yet 
rome is the depository of some of the worlds greatest artworks 
but has also had to battle some of the biggest problems caused by 
the exhaust fumes and the rumbles from the 18 million cars in the 
italian capital 
experts recently reunited marcus aurelius with his horse after an 
8yearlong restoration project but havent decided yet whether to 
risk new damage by returning it to its place on the campidoglio 
square 
the trevi fountain sits behind plexiglass with its waters turned 
off as it undergoes cleaning and restoration but over the past 
year other monuments and columns have been reappearing from behind 
scaffolding as restoration work is completed

chilean fruit could be back in us stores next 
week under an intensified inspection plan designed to assure the 
safety of the produce after traces of cyanide were found in two 
grapes last week 
the bush administration cleared the way friday for new shipments 
of chilean fruit with announcement of an inspection plan that 
officials said will provide maximum feasible safety of the fruit 
and end a weeklong health scare 
under the plan fruit held by importers wholesalers and 
retailers in the united states that cannot be practically 
inspected will be destroyed while fruit at the docks on ships or 
awaiting export in chile will be subjected to heightened 
inspections officials said 
this is a plan that deals with safety and what is maximumly 
feasible said frank young commissioner of the food and drug 
administration 
responsibility to see that fruit already in the united states is 
destroyed lies with state health departments young said 
neither fda nor representatives of chilean exporters could give 
figures on the value of the fruit to be destroyed 
young said questions about who would bear the cost of the lost 
fruit are also not his to consider 
ive got to look at safety ive got to look at the scientific 
data and i cant allow economics or politics to move into those 
decisions the fda commissioner said 
a third poisoning threat was telephoned to the us embassy in 
santiago on friday sometime before the plan was announced in the 
early afternoon friday young said 
young said officials believe the caller may have been the same 
spanishspeaking man who made the two earlier threats that prompted 
the inspections that found the tainted grapes but he said the 
latest threat raises no more or less concern than the first two 
we designed this thing with the probability of more threats 
in mind he said 
about 5 percent of chilean fruit at us docks or in transit to 
the united states will be visually inspected and all 
suspiciouslooking fruit will be subjected to laboratory tests 
before it is released for sale 
in chile fruit to be exported will be subject to increased 
security inspections and lab tests the chilean government and 
exporters will be responsible for the program there but an fda team 
will be sent to chile soon to assist and observe their procedures 
young said 
he said the plan is based on the assumptions of the type of 
sampling that would be required to have a high confidence of 
detecting anything if something is there 
it is impossible to assure 100 percent safety without 
checking every piece of fruit he said 
chilean grapes which make up the bulk of grapes on sale this 
time of year and other fruit could be back on the shelves of us 
stores in five to nine days he said 
young said grapes which constitute about 70 percent of chiles 
sales in the united states raspberries blueberries blackberries 
and strawberries will be the first fruit released because cyanide 
contamination of them is the easiest to spot since the fruit 
discolors quickly and becomes mushy 
but he cautioned that consumers should inspect all products 
regardless of country of origin 
he said buyers should look for needle marks any unusual 
appearance or discoloration or a chemical or burned almond smell 
young said he could not estimate the time for return of the other 
chilean fruit exports including melons cantaloupes pears apples 
nectarines plums and peaches these larger fruits if injected with 
cyanide could carry higher levels of the poison than the smaller 
fruits can 
young said the inspections of 13000 crates of fruit since small 
amounts of cyanide were found in two seedless red grapes last 
weekend turned up no additional evidence of contamination 
after the fda plan was unveiled the military government in 
santiago announced a package of economic measures to counter the 
extensive damage to the chilean fruit industry 
chilean foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz who met in 
washington friday with vice president quayle called the plan a 
workable solution

transportation secretary samuel skinner says he 
is sending top aides to europe this weekend to look into the safety 
of us airlines and new allegations about warnings of terrorist 
attack before the bombing of flight 103 
skinner said friday his action was prompted by a meeting with 
relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the dec 21 disaster 
over scotland and by the controversy erupting in england over 
specific threats before the bombing 
in addition to dispatching members of his personal staff skinner 
said he planned to visit england france and west germany himself 
next month in an effort to get a united approach to the threat of 
sky terrorism and find out more about the bombing and the warnings 
the secretary said in a speech that his meeting with relatives of 
some of the people killed in the pan am explosion convinced him he 
must get directly involved in issues surrounding the bombing 
skinner said the relatives introduced themselves one by one 
using the names of loved ones killed in the crash 
it was one of the most moving meetings i think i have ever had 
you were literally speechless he said 
bert ammerman a victims relative who attended the meeting 
praised skinner for meeting with about 20 families but said he is 
angry that the government has done so little to prevent further 
terrorist attacks or warn passengers 
he said neither former president reagan nor president bush has 
sent even a note of condolence to any of the families while at 
least two us victims families received sympathy notes from 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
if wed won the super bowl wed have been in the rose garden 
but if you get people blown out of the air thats not important 
enough said ammerman whose brother was killed in the bombing 
a group of flight 103 victims relatives proposes that the 
government set up a telephone number passengers can call to see if 
there are threats against a flight they are planning to take 
officials in england disclosed that a bomb warning including a 
photograph of a radiocassette bomb of the type investigators 
believe was used was dated two days before the pan am 747 was 
destroyed but did not reach the airlines until several days later 
both british authorities and the us federal aviation 
administration had described such a bomb in security warnings a 
month earlier airline and government officials said the west 
german intelligence agency said it sent a memo about the possibility 
of such a bomb to us airlines even earlier on nov 10 
skinner said he was trying to get more details on the warning and 
how they were handled 
let me tell you i dont know everything he said yesterday 
i learned some things for the first time and i think the faa did 
about some disclosures in west germany as well as some possible 
disclosures to united kingdom airlines 
meanwhile sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of a senate 
transportation subcommittee introduced a resolution urging bush to 
appoint a commission to investigate the bombing 
the faa specifically warned that the explosive device might 
evade detection by xray machines lautenberg said in a senate 
speech we need to know what pan am and other airlines did if 
anything in response to these warnings 
lautenberg attempted to get floor passage of his resolution but 
sen alan simpson of wyoming the deputy republican leader said it 
should go through the committee hearing process first

a lawsuit by the american civil liberties union 
challenging an emergency curfew for teenagers in the nations 
capital shows the organization has lost touch with the reality of 
drugs and violence mayor marion s barry jr says 
barry commented friday after the local aclu chapter asked a 
federal court to declare the district of columbias 90day law 
unconstitutional and issue an injunction blocking enforcement 
backers say the law is intended to help fight drugs in the 
nations capital by keeping people under 18 off city streets late at 
night and early in the morning and thus away from the often violent 
openair drug markets 
the classaction suit filed in us district court on behalf of 
the parents of five teenagers a 12yearold boy and three other 
people says the curfew violates constitutional protection of 
freedom of speech and association the law also is flawed because it 
forces young adults to carry adequate identification and display it 
to police on request and discriminates irrationally between 
people under and over age 18 
but barry countered the aclu lawyers dont live in these 
neighborhoods where you cant sleep at night because gunshots 
killings are going on they dont live in communities where drugs 
are being used or sold theyre out of touch with reality 
the emergency law went into effect thursday enforcement will 
start on monday the mayor said the measure generally requires 
people under age 18 to be off the streets by 11 pm during the week 
and by midnight on weekends the curfew ends daily at 6 am 
the suit said one of the plaintiffs is a 17yearold girl simbi 
waters an actress attending art school who would need to be out 
after midnight if she gets the part in a play for which she is now 
auditioning 
another plaintiff 17yearold david dranitzke is a student 
council president who attends senior class dinners at night about 
twice a month and who says the senior prom this spring will last 
well past midnight

commission rebuked allen during a closed meeting friday and ordered 
him to write letters of apology to all involved 
one member of the commission who attended the meeting said allen 
acknowledged he had exercised bad judgment the times reported 
allen has said he went to the reservation because he wanted 
firsthand knowledge of whether the girl lalita altaha had had a 
chance to express her own wishes in the custody dispute 
the girl was adopted as an infant by a white couple nadine and 
normand desrochers but last year a court ordered that she be 
returned to her natural mother thurza altaha who lives on the 
white mountain reservation

psychologist barry goodfield who is a consultant to the commission 
and who also had advised the desrochers family allen told the 
commission he went to the reservation with goodfield two us 
marshals and a camera crew which was making a documentary on indian 
adoption cases 
allen told the commissioners that they approached a school bus on 
which lalita was riding and asked for her and that she agreed to 
speak with them they spoke with the girl for about 30 minutes then 
drove her in goodfields car to her home where they had a tense 
exchange with mrs altaha allen said 
as allen goodfield and the others were driving away from the 
reservation they were stopped by gila county sheriffs deputies at 
the request of tribal police and deteined for questioning they were 
released four or five hours later said sheriff joe rodriguez 
tribal chairman reno johnson later called the incident an 
incursion that clearly violates the sovereignity of the tribe 
at the commissions meeting friday allen defended his actions as 
an attempt to determine how tribal courts handle custody cases the 
commission then went into private session and demanded he write 
letters of apology indicating that his activities were not approved 
by the commission or condoned by its members the times reported

patrick j kennedy who followed family 
tradition by entering politics did it again with a st patricks 
day speech to rhode islands friendly sons of st patrick dinner 
kennedy massachusetts sen edward kennedys 21yearold son who 
won a seat in the rhode island house last year invoked his ancestry 
in both joking and serious ways friday 
he reminded the crowd that his greatgrandfather the legendary 
boston mayor john f honey fitz fitzgerald had addressed them 
in 1910 and that his uncle john f kennedy then a massachusetts 
senator had done so in 1959 
so some of you have probably heard this speech before perhaps 
even twice before kennedy said 
kennedy said that by starting his own career in politics he hoped 
to rededicate his generation to the ideals of his uncle and 
greatgrandfather 
he said he is tired of hearing that my generation is the me 
generation i do not accept that serving others is out of fashion 
or that the problems confronting the government are too great

the enola gay the steelgray bomber that 
effectively ended world war ii today sits in a warehouse without 
wings or engines belying its fame as the b29 that carried the 
first atomic weapon 
restoration experts are taking the plane apart bolt by bolt in a 
nineyear project to turn the grimy aircraft into a shiny relic for 
the smithsonian institutions national air and space museum 
when the plane is displayed in 1994 the exhibit likely will 
renew debate about americas use of the atomic bomb 
it was early in the morning on aug 6 1945 when the first 
atomic bomb was released over hiroshima japan killing and injuring 
160000 people a second bomb was later dropped over nagasaki 
any time you even bring up the name enola gay it rekindles 
debate said theodore van kirk a navigator on the historic 
mission i guess the discussion is always going to be around its 
been 40 some years and there still isnt any conclusion 
van kirk now 68 saw the plane in 1985 when rehabilitation work 
began at the smithsonians paul e garber preservation restoration 
and storage facility in silver hill just outside washington he 
retired three years ago from dupont and lives in novato calif 
the enola gays 98footlong body sits severed in half at the 
warehouse the two pieces sit side by side with various other 
historical planes and spacecraft 
we have some visitors who tell us that this plane saved their 
life or their uncles life because it ended the war shop foreman 
richard horigan said recently 
it took nearly three years for horigan and dave peterson to 
restore the front section earlier this year technicians began work 
on the rear section and wings of the plane which cmdr paul w 
tibbets named after his mother 
each part is dipped sprayed or painted with preservatives and 
waxes horigan said 
using photographs old technical manuals and history books as 
their guides the restoration experts plan to remove all markings 
and decals that were not on the plane the day after the mission the 
names and dates of scores of unknown people will be buffed from the 
planes aluminum exterior 
theres lots of graffiti horigan said most of it was joe 
blow 1950 that kind of thing 
tibbets name will be repainted in stenciled military lettering 
instead of the scriptstyle print added sometime after the flight 
enola gay was painted in black block letters under a cockpit 
window just hours before the mission the name will remain but 
extra brush strokes on the e and g from a touchup paint 
job done later will be removed horigan said 
during the restoration work horigan and peterson found a chisel 
that had been lost inside the plane when it was being manufactured 
they also found an atomic bomb arming pin behind the radio 
operators table the pin apparently was an extra not used on the 
weapon a replica of the hiroshima bomb sits in front of the plane 
theres no evidence of the blast whatsoever on the plane 
horigan said i think they were 10 to 15 miles away when the blast 
went off 
after the war in november 1945 the plane was modified it 
returned to the united states in 1946 and went into storage for 
three years in arizona then was ferried by tibbets to park ridge 
ill a storage site for the smithsonian 
it made its last flight dec 2 1953 when it was flown to 
andrews air force base in maryland

thats when the police department called david brimm a wildlife 
officer with the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
brimm and pomeroy took off their shoes and splashed around in the 
fountain until they caught the otter 
theyre actually very playful animals brimm said but they 
have goodsized teeth 
the officers put the otter in the police departments pet carrier 
and brimm took it to the intracoastal waterway and set it free

the parents of five people killed when 
a bomb exploded aboard a pan am flight over scotland are demanding 
that the us government investigate the bombing 
there is an enormous amount of anger and outrage at the way 
weve been treated by this countrys government said barbara 
primeau of greenwich ny mother of 20yearold twins jason and 
eric coker who were among the 270 people killed in the dec 21 
crash of flight 103 in lockerbie scotland 
ms primeau joined two families of victims from upstate new york 
and another family from north adams at a news conference on friday 
the petition drive was launched in this northwest massachusetts 
city because residents have shown concern at the slow progress of 
the crash investigation the families said 
terrorism and tragedy such as this have never touched this 
community before said mayor john barrett iii the first to sign 
the petition 
the drive was organized by joyce wrend who was among the 1000 
mourners at the church service for wendy lincoln a syracuse 
university student on her way home from london for christmas when 
the plane blew up 
id like to see an outcry from the people so loud that the 
government cant forget this said charles lincoln in his first 
statement since the death of his 23yearold daughter 
the petitions will be distributed throughout the northeast 
organizers said they hope to get 20000 signatures by the time they 
stage a vigil outside the white house on april 3 
ms primeau and other family members said they suspect the state 
department knew about the bomb threats but that it remained on the 
sidelines before and after the crash 
were not an investigatory agency francis jones spokeswoman 
for the state departments office of consular affairs in washington 
said friday british authorities are investigating the crash and 
the fbi is assisting them 
the investigation is a very lengthy complicated process and 
its frustrating which is very difficult for the families its 
understandable she added i wish there was something we could 
do to make things come together more quickly 
ms primeau said the anger of the families was heightened friday 
by a british newspaper report that authorities knew who had bombed 
the flight the report from the times of london dismissed by 
investigators has increased their suspicion that the us 
government is withholding information about the bombing she said 
pan am confirmed it had been warned by the west german government 
nov 10 about the kind of radiocassette player bomb involved 
politicians of the opposition labor party in london accused 
transport secretary paul channon with bungling a warning dated two 
days before the disaster but not mailed until several days later

salvador here is his report

none of the votingage residents 
in this village of 2500 plans to cast a ballot in sundays 
presidential election 
no one here believes in this election said rodrigo lainez a 
local leader of this town which was repopulated in 1987 after being 
abandoned for seven years 
this election is to prolong the war said a man who 
identified himself only as victor his comment echoed a refrain 
broadcast daily on two clandestine guerrilla radio stations of the 
leftist farabundo marti national liberation front 
no love is lost between santa marta and the usbacked 
government of president jose napoleon duarte his administration and 
its army consider the town like others revived by people who 
returned from refugee camps in honduras as hostile territory 
santa martas sympathies clearly lie with the fmln the rebel 
army waging a nineyear war against the government the rebels have 
called for an election boycott to prove that a political solution is 
impossible without their participation 
every day from 6 am to 8 am batterypowered radios in santa 
marta are tuned to radio farabundo marti and radio venceremos like 
many rural communities in el salvador this one lacks electricity 
women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee before 
heading to the fields on one morning this week all listened to a 
radio account of overnight attacks on the puppet army and 
admonishments that every salvadoran do his part to prepare for 
insurrection 
guerrillas wander through this town in north central el salvador 
they are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice 
government soldiers on their rare appearances are shunned 
the soldiers three times set fire to the cornfield around 
here said lainez the last time they came through a few went 
up to people and told them just wait until arena is in power 
well be back with a bomb for every house 
alfredo cristiani of the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance or arena is expected to win sundays election in its 
campaign arena has taken a hard line on the war threatening a 
military solution 
col jose herrarte the provincial military commander said in an 
interview that he hopes to improve relations with santa marta 
through more personal contact but he acknowledges the difficulties 
the subversives count on them for supplies recruitment and 
rest he said they portray us only as murderers violators of 
human rights ogres 
an estimated 20000 salvadorans mostly from chalatenango 
cabanas and morazan provinces were driven from their homes by the 
war aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s since 
october 1987 about 6500 have returned to rebuild their lives 
when we came back this was just woods and brush said 
lainez every house had been burned and the fields were 
overgrown 
he said most residents never lost hope of going home our 
umbilical cords are buried here he said using a salvadoran 
expression conveying the importance of ones roots 
for their part the guerrillas refer to the local residents as 
the heroic resettlers of santa marta 
they came back to confront the army without weapons said a 
local guerrilla commander who identified himself only as antolin 
during its first year of reconstruction the town depended on 
charity from the international red cross the united nations and 
church groups but last year yielded a good harvest and the village 
is nearly selfsufficient in corn and beans the daily staples 
a walk through the settlement showed residents building latrines 
making adobe blocks working on a chicken coop and pounding dried 
stalks of millet to separate the kernels from the chaff many are 
enlarging their homes of adobe mudandwattle and corrugated metal 
roofs 
the social arrangement is largely cooperative with familes 
permitted small private plots to augment their communal ration 
because of the war there are lots of widows and orphans 
here said lainez if we werent a cooperative those people 
would die 
he said soldiers in the provincial capital of sensuntepeque often 
stop trucks headed for santa marta loaded with donated food 
clothing or construction materials 
they think everything we bring up here is for the guerrillas 
but we barely have enough for ourselves and arent in a position to 
give things away lainez said

passengers aboard a continental airlines 
jetliner sat in stunned silence when a fire on the planes tail 
created severe vibrations so severe the pilot made an emergency 
landing no one was injured 
the boeing 737 en route from oakland calif to denver with 69 
people aboard landed safely friday at san francisco international 
airport officials said 
the vibrations which began over the sierra nevada about 200 
miles east of san francisco lasted several minutes and were 
followed by several minutes of silence on the airliner 
there was no panic as far as people screaming its just that 
people were quite concerned said re griff greffenius a 
business traveler from walnut creek calif 
officials discovered a charred area about 10 feet in diameter at 
the rear of the tail there also appeared to be damage to the 
stabilizer the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control 
the planes altitude 
an investigator from the national transportation safety boards 
los angeles office examined the plane friday night and two more 
investigators were to arrive today said ron schleede chief of the 
aviation accident division of the safety board 
continental officials in houston said they believed the planes 
auxiliary power unit or apu overheated an aviation source who had 
a chance to inspect the plane said a fire had damaged the stabilizer 
on the tail section near the apu but he said the power unit itself 
was not charred 
it the stabilizer is burned on the outside the paint is 
burned off but they dont know how it occurred said the source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he said a possibile cause could 
have had something to do with one of the planes strobe lights 
david messing a spokesman for continental in houston said there 
was no indication of sabotage on the twinengine jet which carried 
64 passengers and a crew of five

a plan to clean up the worst air in the 
country by restricting everything from industry smokestacks to 
household aerosols has set the stage for a political battle royal in 
southern california 
the plan approved friday by two regional authorities is 
intended to bring air quality in the fourcounty los angeles basin 
up to federal clean air standards by 2007 
the debate over the plan is being followed by smoggy cities 
across the country as well as congress which is preparing to renew 
the clean air act 
by 1994 southern california officials plan to have phased in 120 
rules in a detailed attack against pollutants arising from nearly 
every type of combustion from patio barbecues to coalfired power 
plants 
eventually the plan will require southern californians to drive 
cars powered by methanol compressed gas or electricity mow their 
lawns with electric lawnmowers and use reformulated paints solvents 
and aerosols 
the magnitude of the planning effort is without parallel 
anywhere in the country for a region of this size said mark 
pisano executive director of the southern california association of 
governments 
the air quality plan was adopted by the association on a 161 
vote and by the south coast air quality management district board 
of directors by a 102 vote 
the votes capped a contentious eighthour session that drew 
hundreds of people from environmental and citizens groups industry 
and government 
los angeles county supervisor michael antonovich who sits as a 
member of both boards vowed to seek a referendum which he 
contended would stifle economic growth 
union leaders also opposed tight restrictions on industrial 
pollutants which they said could close factories and cost of 
thousands of jobs 
theyre talking about doing without gasoline said an 
indignant jack foley west coast director of the oil chemical amp 
atomic workers international union 
an industry study by national economic research associates inc 
concluded the plan would cost 128 billion a year a figure that 
contrasts sharply with the districts estimate of 39 billion 
annually 
altogether the plan proposes 160 rules to be enforced over the 
next 18 years reaching into unexpected corners of everyday life to 
attack smog sources both large and small 
the suburban backyard scene would change forever with bans on 
charcoal lighter fluid for barbecues and requirements that lawn 
mowers and other tools run on either electricity or fuel that burns 
more cleanly than gasoline 
the number of drivethrough burger stands might be limited to 
cut down on smoggenerating engine idling while motorists wait for 
their orders 
staterequired checks of auto pollutioncontrol equipment would 
be more stringent and new emission limits would be imposed on 
diesel trucks and buses 
the plan would cover a district of 13350 square miles covering 
los angeles orange riverside and part of san bernardino counties

the government and the countrys most 
feared guerrilla group have signed an accord to begin talks toward 
ending nearly two decades of bloody insurgency 
president virgilio barco in a nationwide television address 
friday night asked the other colombian rebel groups to follow suit 
i urge all guerrillas to integrate themselves in civilian life 
the road is always open barco said 
an estimated 10000 leftist guerrillas operate in colombia they 
are blamed for more than 2000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings in 
1988 alone 
the accord was signed friday in the mountain town of santo 
domingo 180 miles south of bogota by the minister of interior 
raul orejuela bueno and carlos pizarro commander of the m19 or 
the april 19 movement 
the april 19 movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential 
election that the guerrillas say was fraudulent 
once the nations most notorious group m19s bloodiest 
operation was seizing the supreme court building in bogota in 1985 
the army retook the building but 11 supreme court justices and 85 
other people were killed 
a joint declaration said four meetings that led to the accord 
were held in colombia and mexico after the leftist guerrillas 
declared a unilateral ceasefire eight months ago 
the declaration said both sides agreed on talks beginning april 1 
that would lead to full democracy and reintegrate the insurgents 
into society 
the talks are to finish before legislative elections set for 
march 1990 in which m19 probably will participate as a legal 
political party officials said 
the agreement did not say when the guerrillas would have to give 
up their arms 
barco said the accord opens a time of hope for the fate of the 
country but he said there large obstacles to overcome before 
attaining peace 
he signaled that the government is ready to begin talks with the 
revolutionary armed forces of colombia a communist rebel group that 
declared a unilateral ceasefire feb 28 in an effort to join the 
peace process 
however barco said the ceasefire must hold for a certain period 
of time to determine if the farc has a genuine spirit of 
reconciliation 
the joint declaration also said the guerrillas will no longer 
operate underground and will base themselves in santo domingo where 
they receive state protection and will not be subject to harassment 
by the army 
during the signing ceremony orejuela said all sides must stay 
vigilant because there are people interested in seeing that a 
process like this one fails 
the declaration said 13 guerrilla delegates who had no criminal 
record participated in the talks and had government protection

the mayor of beijing has halted plans to build a 
cable car up the side of the great wall yielding to 
preservationists who said it would desecrate chinas most famous 
landmark official newspapers said today 
the battle over the cable car had been fought for two years with 
the main support coming from the chinese builder and an army unit 
stationed near the great wall that was to supply engineers for the 
project 
the china daily newspaper said beijing mayor chen xitong listened 
to both sides at a meeting this month before deciding he convened 
the meeting after opponents publicly accused his office of pushing 
the project through in violation of a 1988 law protecting cultural 
relics 
the cable car was to have been built at badaling about 43 miles 
north of beijing where for a few dollars tourists can walk along a 
small restored section of the great wall 
under the cultural relics law no construction is allowed within 
600 feet of the wall at badaling 
the great wall a dramatic symbol of chinas historic fear of 
foreign contact actually began as a series of short walls built by 
independent kingdoms and principalities to keep out invaders 
efforts to build one unified wall began about 200 bc under chinas 
first emperor qin shi huangdi 
the completed wall finally stretched 3700 miles from the desert 
plains of northcentral china to the sea large portions are now in 
ruins 
the badaling tourism service co and golden glory international 
co of hong kong signed a contract to build the cable car a year 
before the cultural relics law was passed golden glory agreed to 
invest 5 million in the project with a 15 million guarantee if 
it was canceled the china daily said 
china youth news said more than 20 architects and officials from 
the beijing and national cultural relics bureaus led the battle 
against the cable car they even took the rare step of writing a 
letter to premier li peng 
several engineers concluded after a study that the project would 
lose money 
officials who backed the cable car said it would ease crowding on 
the wall and thereby prevent damage thousands of people visit the 
wall each day during the tourism season from about april to october 
tourists currently reach the top via one central set of stairs 
then can walk along the wall in both directions for several hundred 
feet the wall is about 30 feet high at badaling

japan today lifted a fourday suspension on 
importing chilean grapes after chile pledged to step up safety 
precautions as a result of a cyanide scare japanese officials said 
the japanese government ordered the suspension tuesday after 
traces of cyanide were discovered monday in two chilean grapes 
shipped to philadelphia the discovery followed anonymous threats to 
the japanese and us embassies in santiago that chilean fruit would 
be poisoned 
the chile government has reassured tokyo it will step up safety 
precautions to guarantee that grape shipments are safe leading 
japan to lift its ban on imports said health and welfare ministry 
official katsumi itoi 
the decision comes on the heels of an announcement friday by 
washington that chilean fruit exports were once again welcome in the 
united states 
it also comes after the detention thursday in southern chile by 
naval authorities of five japanese fishing boats for safety 
inspection 
chilean navy commander adm jose merino initially said the ships 
were being held until japan lifted its ban 
but friday in a telephone interview chilean navy lt jose araya 
said the boats are retained and being subject to a mandatory 
thorough inspection 
this is necessary for the safety of all people on board those 
vessels once inspectors are satisfied with the safety standards of 
the boats they will let them sail off 
itoi asked if the decision to lift japans ban on chilean grapes 
was diplomatically motivated said the health of the japanese 
people is our primary concern 
there was no immediate word today from chile on japans lifting 
of the ban 
japan has imported 1775 tons of grapes from chile so far this 
year representing about 20 percent of japans total imported grapes 
for the period according to government figures

britains ambassador in lebanon said today the 
prospect of freedom for western hostages in beirut may not have been 
hurt by the controversy over salman rushdies book the satanic 
verses 
the general assumption is i think that the rushdie affair has 
put back prospects of release i am not sure that is correct the 
ambassador allan ramsay said in a radio interview from beirut on 
the british broadcasting corp 
i was encouraged i must say by the statements made by some 
leading moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms 
that there is no reason to continue holding hostages this is very 
much a crime against islam he said 
but ramsay warned i do not want to raise release hopes and i 
do not want to sound overoptimistic 
the iranian spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on 
feb 14 called for rushdies execution for writing the satanic 
verses which moslems say blasphemes islam the indianborn 
author now a british citizen has been in hiding under police guard 
since then 
the 46member organization of islamic conference this week called 
rushdie an apostate which under islamic law is punishable by death 
and demanded that the book be banned 
asked about the release hopes for british hostages ramsay said 
we have been at great pains to stress that one need not affect the 
other that the hostage issue is essentially a humanitarian issue 
fifteen foreigners including nine americans are being held in 
lebanon by proiranian islamic fundamentialists including anglican 
church envoy terry waite british journalist john mccarthy and 
teacher brian keenan who has dual british and irish citizenship 
american terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longest held of the 15 hostages he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
ramsay also played down suggestions that a car bomb blast friday 
about 50 yards from the british embassy in east beirut was intended 
for the embassy we had some windows blown out and one or two 
other bits knocked off nothing very serious he said 
the explosion which killed 15 people was the worst in the area 
of the embassy for some time he said he said he was unaware of any 
increased hostility to britons in beirut since the rushdie affair

attorneys for a 15yearold allegedly impregnated 
in a gang rape plan to appeal a court ruling upholding a law that 
bans medicaid funding for abortions 
circuit judge john h hausner said in a 26page opinion issued 
friday that there are no constitutional provisions entitling the 
teenager to state money for an abortion 
an appeal will be filed monday with the state court of appeals 
said elizabeth gleicher an attorney for the american civil 
liberties union which brought the lawsuit on the girls behalf 
the aclu contends the medicaid ban is unconstitutional because it 
discriminates against poor women 
the lawsuit is the first challenge of the states medicaidfunded 
abortion ban which took effect dec 12 after voters approved it in 
the nov 8 general election 
the aclu also will file a motion monday asking the state supreme 
court to hear the case immediately bypassing the appellate court 
gleicher said the appeals process will continue even if the 
teenager has an abortion she added 
obviously were unhappy and displeased with the judges 
decision gleicher said but we always knew from the very start 
that this case would have to be decided in the state supreme court 
lawyers for the state and groups opposed to abortion were pleased 
with the ruling 
the will of the people has been vindicated the aclus attempt 
to impose its will on the will of the people has been rejected 
said john curcio an attorney for right to life of michigan 
according to the aclu the teen identified only as jane doe 
became pregnant during a jan 15 rape and cant afford abortion 
costs of between 250 and 1000 
if jane doe wants an abortion it cannot be funded by the state 
medicaid program but that does not mean that an abortion is not 
available hausner said 
hausner cited the testimony of doctors who said they sometimes 
perform abortions for free 
two of the teenagers alleged attackers aaron wallace 20 and 
edward costnar 17 both of detroit face trial on firstdegree 
criminal sexual assault charges on april 7

apparently in retaliation for portugals expulsion of a mozambican 
diplomat suspected of involvement in an assassination 
mozambiques foreign ministry said jose da silva pereira 
commercial consul at the portuguese embassy in maputo has been 
declared persona non grata and must leave by midnight tuesday 
the ministry accused the consul of engaging in unspecified 
activities incompatible with his diplomatic status the ministry 
statement did not mention portugals expulsion friday of rafael 
custodio marques third secretary at the mozambican embassy in 
lisbon 
portugal accused marques of involvement in the killing of former 
mozambican rebel leader evo fernandes the expulsion order was 
issued after mozambique refused to waive marques diplomatic 
immunity so he could be questioned about the case 
the dispute has strained relations between portugal and its 
former colony at a time when links between them were growing 
portuguese newspapers have said a man held in connection with the 
murder of fernandes former generalsecretary of the mozambican 
national resistance rebels accused marques of helping plan the 
killing 
according to the reports alexandre chagas confessed to the 
murder and said he was acting for the mozambican government 
mozambique denies all involvement in fernandes death claiming 
he was killed as a result of infighting among the rebels 
portuguese police found fernandes body last april on a hillside 
near lisbon he had been shot in the head and chest 
chagas and joaquim messias were arrested in morocco and 
extradited to portugal to face charges in connection with the 
killing 
fernandes a portuguese citizen was a founder member of the 
rebel movement and was its general secretary from 19831986 
he was demoted to head of the rebels research department but 
observers said he remained an influential figure within the 
organization 
the rebels have waged a hitandrun insurgency against 
mozambiques marxistoriented government since 1977 two years after 
independence portugal does not support the the rebels but allows 
them to maintain an office in lisbon

about 42000 american soldiers are normally stationed in south 
korea under a mutual defense pact 
north korean delegates to the military armistice commission 
meeting at the border site of panmunjom demanded us and south 
korean forces immediately halt the annual exercises the north once 
again said the exercises are a grave threat to peace on the divided 
peninsula and a barrier to peace talks 
you should desist from attempting to justify your aggressive 
acts and discontinue at once the criminal war exercise blocking 
the way to detente and dialogue by leading the situation to the 
brink of war said north korean maj gen choe ui ung 
the armistice commission polices the armistice that ended the 
korean war in 1953 
us navy rear admiral larry vogt head of the un command and 
other us officials said no nuclear attacks were being practiced 
vogt dismissed the north korean charges as meaningless propaganda 
the un command represents the 16 nations that sent troops to 
aid capitalist south korea against the 1950 north korean invasion 
vogt charged north korea was building up its military as part of 
possible plans to attack south korea a north korean attack launched 
the korean war in 1950 
your sides continued military buildup forward deployment of 
forces and secret military maneuvers all directed against the 
republic of south korea cause serious concern that your side may 
be preparing for another act of aggression vogt said 
vogt repeated the us position that the team spirit 
exercises are purely defensive 
north korea in the past has denounced the maneuvers and charged 
they are part of preparations for a us attack but the exercises 
this year stalled northsouth talks on easing tensions north korea 
said last month that progress in government talks was impossible if 
the south went ahead with the exercises

authorities have issued new security orders to all 
major british airports as a result of the december bombing of pan am 
flight 103 a manchester airport spokesman said today 
the reported orders came amid criticism by opposition parliament 
members who say the government mishandled a warning of a terrorist 
attack before the disaster which killed 259 people on board and 11 
on the ground in scotland 
the department of transport refused to confirm any new orders 
saying it would not discuss security arrangements 
the manchester airport spokesman who in keeping with british 
practice refused to be identified said the orders were received 
friday night he gave no details because they dealt with security 
matters 
british new reports said the directive is believed to require 
that all passengers be ordered to remove electrical and electronic 
equipment from suitcases when they check in 
they would then carry the items as hand luggage to be examined at 
boarding gates the british broadcasting corp and other news 
organizations said 
investigators have said the bomb that blew up flight 103 on dec 
21 over lockerbie scotland was concealed in a radiocassette 
player the new yorkbound flight originated in frankfurt west 
germany and passengers and luggage changed to a boeing 747 in 
londons heathrow airport 
on feb 18 the department of transport advised all airlines 
using british airports to begin asking travelers if their baggage 
contained radios computers or other electronic equipment and then 
to examine the items for explosives 
transport secretary paul channon was criticized after admitting 
this week in the wake of newspaper disclosures that authorities were 
warned terrorists might bomb an aircraft with explosives hidden in a 
radiocassette player 
in new york pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon confirmed friday 
that the airline had received a warning from the west german 
government on nov 10 about the kind of radiocassette bomb that 
caused the disaster pan am has also acknowledged receiving a 
warning from the us federal aviation administration 
but it said it received the british warning by mail weeks after 
the air disaster channon said this week the british warning 
contained unimportant information that supplemented what was in 
the earlier warnings 
a legislator in the governing conservative party on friday 
accused hysterical americans of a witch hunt while party 
members rallied to fend off opposition charges over the airport 
security controversy 
if every government and every airline broadcast every warning 
from every source crank or terrorist international air travel 
would grind to a halt the legislator robert adley said friday 
the culprit is the person who planted the bomb it is not the 
british secretary of state for transport 
adley in his statement said malicious opposition labor party 
politicians hysterical americans and newshungry media had united 
in a witch hunt aimed at the conservative government and channon 
adley a senior member in the party of prime minister margaret 
thatcher is an officer of the conservative legislators committee 
on transport 
another tory legislator david wilshire said friday that some 
relatives of victims have been blaming the british government 
blaming heathrow airport blaming anybody except the people i 
think they ought to be complaining about namely the american 
government and pan am 
in massachusetts however the parents of five american people 
who died aboard the flight opened a petition drive friday demanding 
a us inquiry and accusing washington of treating them in a shoddy 
manner 
there is an enormous amount of anger and outrage at the way 
weve been treated by this countrys government said barbara 
primeau of greenwich ny she spoke at a news conference in north 
adams mass 
her 20yearold twins jason and eric coker who were among the 
victims

chinas official xinhua news agency today 
condemned recent petitions for the release of political prisoners 
and sought to discredit the requests as invitations for foreign 
pressure on china 
the xinhua commentary was the latest in a series of official 
statements seeking to quell a growing clamor by chinese 
intellectuals for an amnesty for prisoners of conscience and greater 
freedom of expression 
chinas leading dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi first 
suggested an amnesty in an open letter to senior leader deng 
xiaoping in january 
since then 118 other intellectuals have signed three similar 
letters and hundreds of chinese studying in the united states 
chineseamericans hong kong chinese and taiwanese have signed 
petitions of support 
several delegates are expected to push the idea at the national 
peoples congress chinas legislature which begins its annual 
session monday 
the strongly worded xinhua commentary with its warning of 
foreign interference appeared to be an effort to head off any 
public statement at the congress that could embarrass the government 
xinhua accused the letter writers of using foreign public 
opinion to exercise pressure on the chinese government although 
no foreign government has officially commented on the amnesty drive 
it noted that several of the letters appealed for the release of 
wei jingsheng a former beijing electrician who was sentenced in 
1979 to 15 years in jail for counterrevolutionary crimes 
xinhua said weis case was raised not because he is important 
but because his case aroused much discussion in the foreign press 
when it became public in 1979 the londonbased human rights group 
amnesty international has championed wei 
the chinese people suffered enough from foreign invasions 
before the liberation of the country the commentary said many 
problems and difficulties do exist but these are chinas own 
affairs which the chinese people will overcome by themselves

president bush says the national debate over 
rapidfire assault weapons has gotten pretty hot and any 
decision about new restrictions will be made in a cool way based 
on facts 
bush hinted friday he may be willing to take some steps beyond 
the newly announced federal ban on imports of five popular types of 
semiautomatic weapons law enforcement officials are pressing for a 
prohibition covering weapons made in america as well 
the police have been very concerned about this and weve got to 
find an accommodation between the police and the sporting 
interest the president said 
in my view there can be an accommodation there must be an 
accommodation said bush a lifetime member of the national rifle 
association and outspoken foe of gun control 
asked if the new ban on imports represented a change in position 
on gun control bush said it represents certainly a heightened 
concern on my part about ak47s its a pulse change he added 
grabbing his wrist 
the debate over assault weapons has gotten pretty hot he 
said but well make our decisions from the administration in a 
cool you know a cool way based on facts and not swayed one way 
or another by the temper of the debate 
but i can understand when kids are shot down by an automated 
weapon semiautomated weapon or automated whichever it was why 
i can certainly understand the public outcry five children were 
killed and more than two dozen others were wounded earlier this year 
in stockton calif by a deranged gunman with a semiautomatic ak47 
the president discussed guns and other issues in a 30minute chat 
with reporters on air force one as he returned to washington from an 
overnight speechmaking trip to houston and colorado springs colo 
instead of their customary weekend at camp david bush and his 
wife barbara were remaining at the white house because their 
springer spaniel millie was giving birth to puppies 
its changed my life seriously bush said in mock horror 
you think im kidding about that its awful 
the dog gave birth to six puppies over a fivehour period ending 
at about 2 am this morning said white house spokeswoman anna 
perez 
bush explained that the first lady had banished him from their 
room to the lincoln bedroom because of millie who sleeps on their 
bed 
bush said his wife explained that millie had a very bad night 
last night thrashing around and you would be irritable he added 
so im being sent down the hall which just suits the heck out of 
me 
on other subjects bush said 
no decision has been made on a proposed joint venture with the 
japanese for production in japan of a new version of the f16 jet 
fighter he sought to play down earlier suggestions that a basic 
commitment had been made to the project with only details remaining 
to be worked out 
he was saddened that hostage terry anderson middle east 
correspondent for the associated press was beginning his fifth year 
of captivity in lebanon but said that wouldnt lead to any change 
or reformulation in us policy on hostages the fact that anderson 
and other remain held against their will is with me every single 
waking hour 
he was concerned about the 1 percent increase in wholesale 
prices in february reported friday claiming you always have to be 
vigilant against inflation he said the best way to fight 
inflation was to reach agreement with congress on reducing the 
budget deficit 
gave a thumbsup sign on word that rep richard cheney had won 
920 senate confirmation as defense secretary a tuesday swearingin 
is planned but bush said hell go to work right away at the 
pentagon 
signed a proclamation designating may 4 as a national day of 
prayer it has been an annual event since 1952

a cargo plane carrying explosives 
crashed after takeoff from carswell air force base early today 
killing the two people on board and igniting numerous grass fires 
authorities said 
air force lt brad schudt said the two people killed likely were 
civilians because the dc9 was a private aircraft under contract to 
the air force the victims identities were not immediately 
available 
all of the pastures were on fire said glen youngblood a 
rancher who lives near the ranch where the plane crashed i could 
see the planes tires and they were on fire i told my wife it was a 
plane crash then i went to look to see if i could help 
he drove through burning pastures in his truck but found no 
survivors 
pentagon spokesman lt cmdr edward lundquist said the plane was 
operated by evergreen air a private contractor based in oregon the 
plane that crashed was based in marana ariz 
the plane was en route to tinker air force base in oklahoma when 
the crash occurred about 230 am said air force senior airman 
mark webb a military board will investigate the crash officials 
said 
he said the cargo included 32 explosive fuses which weigh a 
total of about 11 pounds 
the plane crashed into a field about seven miles north of the 
base which is about seven miles west of downtown fort worth 
robert parkey an investigator for the tarrant county medical 
examiners office said he had been unable to go to the scene 
because the area was cordoned off until daylight 
youngblood said the wreckage was scattered over five acres 
if it had been in a populated area there would have been more 
lives lost than two he said it would have destroyed a lot of 
people and homes 
the wreckage was almost unrecognizable in predawn light as an 
airplane except for its large landing wheels and its instrument 
panels youngblood said

leftist guerrillas trying to 
sabotage sundays elections with a boycott and transportation ban 
have assured voters they wont be attacked if they go to the polls 
however some election workers in the capital and eastern areas 
resigned friday saying they had been threatened two mayors also 
quit after similar warnings 
despite the resignations soldiers were ready to distribute 
presidential ballots today to 236 of the nations 260 
municipalities the exceptions are 24 municipalities under the 
control of the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front 
attorney general roberto garcia on friday asked radio stations to 
censor rebel dispatches and not broadcast appeals from the 
guerrillas for an election boycott some statements were broadcast 
anyway 
the christian democrat party of president jose napoleon duarte is 
trying to retain power with candidate fidel chavez mena a former 
foreign minister who says he represents new leadership and dismisses 
charges of corruption and incompetence duarte has liver cancer and 
by law cannot run for reelection 
the frontrunner according to the polls is businessman alfredo 
cristiani leader of the rightist and free market republican 
nationalist alliance or arena that party which in the past has 
been linked to rightist death squads already holds a slim edge in 
the salvadoran congress 
running third in the polls after chavez mena is guillermo ungo a 
leftwing social democrat who returned from exile in 1987 four 
other candidates are not given much chance in the polls of affecting 
the outcome 
accurate polling is difficult in el salvador where nine years of 
civil war and 70000 deaths have made many people reluctant to 
express their real preferences 
the winner will replace duarte whose has been supported by the 
united states in its efforts to reinforce a democratic middle ground 
against rightist and leftist extremes 
the leading parties squabbled over placement of polling booths in 
the capital san salvador the christian democrats and democratic 
convergence said arena is trying to make the booths hard to reach 
election officials have put the booths in central locations but 
arena wants them moved to the suburbs and other residential areas 
arena wants to locate the booths in areas that are hard to get 
to because thats where the salvadoran bourgeoisie lives said 
ungo 
francisco merino arena vicepresidential candidate countered 
that the booths must be put in secure areas to prevent rebel 
disruptions 
the mayors of chalatenango the northern provincial capital and 
metapan a northwestern city resigned friday under rebel warnings 
more than half the countrys municipalities are without mayors and 
nine mayors have been assassinated 
a number of poll workers in san salvador and others in three 
precincts near the city of san miguel resigned friday they said 
they had been threatened by guerrillas 
however voting is still expected to take place in those areas 
with substitute officials 
the guerrillas however said the death threats issued in their 
name were forgeries 
moreover ana guadalupe martinez a rebel political leader said 
friday in an interview in mexico city we will not act against 
those who are voting voters have that guarantee 
she said the rebels called for a boycott to show that no 
political solution is possible without them she said after the 
election the rebels may renew their proposal to join the political 
process under conditions that guarantee a fair vote 
the rebels had asked for a postponement of the elections to let 
them take part but the government rejected their proposal 
a rebel commander told the associated press on friday that any 
attacks on voters would be the work of rightist death squads trying 
to discredit the guerrillas 
there were no attacks on military garrisons during the day and 
only scattered reports of attacks on private vans transporting 
passengers in defiance of the rebels traffic ban 
hector oqueli a leader of the democratic convergence lauded the 
rebels decision not to harass voters 
this reassures our people can now go to vote without worrying

leftist guerrillas trying to 
sabotage sundays elections by disrupting electrical power in the 
capital and traffic on the nations highways assured voters today 
they wont attack people who vote 
a broadcast by the rebels clandestine radio venceremos said 
guerrilla military actions might be intense sunday but that voters 
will not be targeted 
todays warning about military activity followed two days of 
relative calm in el salvador there were no new reports of rebel 
attacks overnight 
earlier in the week attacks by rebels knocked out much of the 
electrical power in the capital and their threat to kill people who 
drove on the nations highways drastically reduced traffic 
nationwide 
on friday two mayors and some election workers in the capital 
and eastern areas resigned saying they had been threatened by the 
rebels 
soldiers prepared to distribute presidential ballots today to 236 
of the nations 260 municipalities the exceptions are 24 
municipalities under the control of the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front 
attorney general roberto garcia on friday asked radio stations to 
censor rebel dispatches and not broadcast appeals from the 
guerrillas for an election boycott some statements were broadcast 
anyway 
the christian democrat party of president jose napoleon duarte is 
trying to retain power with candidate fidel chavez mena a former 
foreign minister who says he represents new leadership and dismisses 
charges of corruption and incompetence duarte has liver cancer and 
by law cannot run for reelection 
the frontrunner according to the polls is businessman alfredo 
cristiani leader of the rightist and free market republican 
nationalist alliance or arena that party which in the past has 
been linked to rightist death squads already holds a slim edge in 
the salvadoran congress 
running third in the polls after chavez mena is guillermo ungo a 
leftwing social democrat who returned from exile in 1987 four 
other candidates are not given much chance in the polls of affecting 
the outcome 
accurate polling is difficult in el salvador where nine years of 
civil war and 70000 deaths have made many people reluctant to 
express their real preferences 
the winner will replace duarte whose has been supported by the 
united states in its efforts to reinforce a democratic middle ground 
against rightist and leftist extremes 
the leading parties squabbled over placement of polling booths in 
the capital san salvador the christian democrats and democratic 
convergence said arena is trying to make the booths hard to reach 
election officials have put the booths in central locations but 
arena wants them moved to the suburbs and other residential areas 
arena wants to locate the booths in areas that are hard to get 
to because thats where the salvadoran bourgeoisie lives said 
ungo 
francisco merino arena vicepresidential candidate countered 
that the booths must be put in secure areas to prevent rebel 
disruptions 
the mayors of chalatenango the northern provincial capital and 
metapan a northwestern city resigned friday under rebel warnings 
more than half the countrys municipalities are without mayors 
and nine mayors have been assassinated 
a number of poll workers in san salvador and others in three 
precincts near the city of san miguel resigned friday under threats 
from guerrillas the rebels said the death threats issued in their 
names were forgeries and voting was still expected to take place in 
those areas with substitute officials 
ana guadalupe martinez a rebel political leader said friday in 
an interview in mexico city we will not act against those who are 
voting voters have that guarantee 
she said the rebels called for a boycott to show that no 
political solution is possible without them she said after the 
election the rebels may renew their proposal to join the political 
process under conditions that guarantee a fair vote the rebels had 
asked for a postponement of the elections to let them take part but 
the government rejected their proposal 
a rebel commander said in an interview friday that any attacks on 
voters would be the work of rightist death squads trying to 
discredit the guerrillas 
there were no attacks on military garrisons during the day and 
only scattered reports of attacks on private vans transporting 
passengers in defiance of the rebels traffic ban 
hector oqueli a leader of the democratic convergence lauded the 
rebels decision not to harass voters 
this reassures our people can now go to vote without worrying

a guerrilla squad sneaked into israel from 
jordan and opened fire on troops killing an israeli soldier and 
wounding another before escaping back across the border the army 
said today 
no group claimed responsibility for the attack late friday night 
the fourth guerrilla raid against israel in a week 
jordan today said it arrested men who infiltrated jordan from 
israel apparently referring to the guerrillas who ambushed the 
israeli army patrol 
the official jordanian news agency petra did not say how many 
men were arrested but it said they were captured at 7 am in wadi 
araba the same region where the attack on the israeli soldiers took 
place 
petra said the incident was under investigation but it gave no 
other details and did not explicitly link the arrests to the israeli 
attack 
the guerrillas ambushed the israeli army patrol in the southern 
hatzeva area 70 miles south of jerusalem an israeli army spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity he said the troops responded with 
gunfire 
reserve sgt oren lior 22 the commander of the unit was killed 
in the gunbattle and another soldier was wounded in the arm the 
spokesman said 
the spokesman said a military unit discovered the tracks of two 
men showing they had crossed into israel from jordan and then 
returned 
according to israel radio the ambush occurred when the army 
patrol followed tracks in the dirt and heard a man shout in english 
stop from behind a bush the guerrillas then opened fire from 
two directions 
defense minister yitzhak rabin blamed palestinian guerrillas for 
the attack the egyptian border the lebanese border and the 
jordanian one are different if there is something in common its 
the wish of the palestinian terror groups to attack us from all the 
directions he said on israel radio 
we hold jordan responsible for preventing any infiltrations 
from its territory moreover we demand the jordanian government do 
everything to find who committed this vile murder and to make 
certain this will not happen in the future rabin said 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai chief of the armys southern 
command described the incident as serious and said on israel 
radio the attack makes it necessary to take efficient steps on the 
other side of the border to prevent any infiltrations into our 
territory and attacks on our soldiers 
in jordan information minister hani khasawneh said it is not 
necessary that we comment on every story israel broadcasts 
two other raids this week were in southern lebanon and the third 
across the border with egypt

a 48hour strike for higher pay by state 
railroad workers forced tens of thousands of vacationers and 
commuters to change travel plans and aggravated easter holiday 
traffic problems officials said saturday 
railway unions arranged the strike to pressure management before 
negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement it was timed 
to coincide with the start of easter holidays and end midnight 
sunday 
company officials said the strike forced them to cut half the 
scheduled trains leaving 300000 fewer seats on routes 
the cutbacks contributed to traffic jams as commuters competed on 
highways with holiday travelers flocking to the coasts and native 
regions 
the general traffic division said 19 people died on spanish 
highways over 19 hours friday and saturday

el salvador has been receiving a huge slice of 
the us foreign aid program for years but now as salvadorans 
prepare to elect a new president many in congress feel us 
taxpayers have not been getting their moneys worth 
the salvadoran war still rages having claimed an estimated 
70000 lives the economy is stagnant and politicallymotivated 
killings are up prompting some lawmakers to argue for a major 
policy shift regardless of who the next salvadoran president is 
the pressure for a new approach is expected to accelerate if as 
expected the candidate of the rightist arena party alfredo 
cristiani wins the election outright on sunday or the subsequent 
runoff 
his principal opponent is christian democrat fidel chavez mena 
despite cristianis denials the perception among many who count 
in congress is that arena is tied to the death squads shadowy 
groups who target both real and suspected leftists sometimes in 
cooperation with the military 
perception plays a key role in forming opinions on administration 
policy democrats tend to be outraged by figures that show an 
average of 20 political killings a month recently while republicans 
note that such incidents once averaged 800 a month 
still the situation was serious enough to warrant a forceful 
appeal last month by vice president dan quayle to the salvadoran 
military to work toward the elimination of human rights 
violations 
the administration also is worried that el salvador might become 
a strategic headache for the united states if the fmln rebels 
triumph the state department said friday that cuba has been the 
source of large quantities of arms shipments to the guerrillas in 
recent months 
the united states has lavished 355 billion on el salvador since 
1980 the largest program in latin america in a bid to help the 
salvadoran army defeat the insurrection and to help the country 
establish stable democratic rule 
the strong support for el salvador reflects in large measure 
congressional affection for outgoing president jose napoleon duarte 
whose commitment to democracy is unquestioned but whose legacy 
after almost five years in office is regarded as mixed at best ill 
with cancer since last year duarte will step down on june 1 
a congressional report completed recently suggests us policy 
has actually made the situation worse in el salvador 
critics such as sen tom harkin diowa a member of the senate 
appropriations committee contend the benefits have been meager 
considering the size of the investment 
for the past five years el salvador has enjoyed a free ride 
with the american taxpayers footing the bill he said friday by 
most standards us policy has failed the test 
harkin has introduced legislation requiring that half of 
salvadors military aid for 1990 be withheld pending a presidential 
report on progress toward prosecution of human rights offenders and 
toward ending the war and death squad activity 
the program for the current year calls for 2925 in economic aid 
and 965 in military aid 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations told secretary of state james a 
baker iii on wednesday he believes the administration should 
emphasize political and diplomatic measures to end salvadors civil 
war 
i think up till now weve tried to implement primarily a 
military track and its failed he said i cant support more 
aid with no strings attached without significant changes in our 
whole approach to that country 
baker strongly defended the salvadoran governments approach to 
the conflict pointing out that the army has unilaterally declared a 
ceasefire to last through june 1 in addition five relatively free 
elections have been held since 1982 and duarte has made a number of 
efforts to negotiate an end to the war baker said 
meanwhile the rebels are doing whatever they can to disrupt 
the election despite their stated desire for peace baker said 
on friday state department spokesman charles redman predicted 
the rebel tactics will fail 
we condemn fmln violence and applaud the efforts of ordinary 
salvadorans to establish firmly democratic rule in their troubled 
country the elections on sunday will be the next step to achieving 
that goal he said

two months into his presidency george bush is 
struggling with perceptions that he hit the ground walking and chose 
a style of governance constrained by worry about policy stumbles 
bush has gone out of his way in recent speeches and exchanges 
with reporters to drive home the message that the only treadmill 
hes on is the exercising machine he uses in the white house 
residence 
he chafed at suggestions by critics that his goslow strategy on 
eastwest relations gives soviet president mikhail gorbachev the 
upper hand in world public opinion saying i am not going to be 
pushed into speedy action because mr gorbachev gives a compelling 
speech at the united nations 
he undertook an almost painstaking explanation of why he ordered 
timeconsuming reviews of both foreign and defense strategy saying 
weve got to map a strategy but administration officials 
acknowledge that bushs preinaugural decision to conduct such 
reassessments contributed to an image problem once he settled into 
office 
bush said thursday that he moved quickly to defuse such ticking 
time bombs as americas endangered savings and loan industry but 
he also said getting the nation ready for the 1990s and beyond is 
what my longterm agenda is all about 
speaking in this same context earlier in the week he told 
insurance executives that i want to be a president who is 
remembered for preparing our country for the next century 
the administration has been beset in recent weeks with a spate of 
news reports often quoting both democratic and republican political 
experts saying bush has adopted a toocautious leadership style 
because of this the notion went he missed the opportunity history 
has afford new presidents get to establish an agenda in their first 
100 days in the white house 
bush confronted such talk headon during a questionandanswer 
session with reporters on march 14 in which he denied the 
administration was adrift the president also argued that he had 
moved as quickly as ronald reagan in 1981 to choose people for 
toplevel jobs 
what followed was an unmistakable white house campaign to blunt 
any continuing talk of an aimless presidency 
im particularly amused by the notion that the bush 
administration must do all kinds of things in our first hundred 
days vice president dan quayle told the national press club 
were succeeding an administration of our own party at a time when 
the country is in good shape 
the notion of the 100 days came in with franklin roosevelt 
who took over a country in the depths of a depression he said 
james david barber a presidential scholar at duke university 
disagreed 
when bush talks about vision he asked does that mean 
anything when he says something hang loose until he does it drug 
war where is it education president when 
thomas edmonds a republican political consultant said bush 
has got to satisfy the publics need to see accomplishments taking 
place 
its not enough to be just a statesman you have to be a 
politician as well he said edmonds noted that reagan 
successfully used television frequently to visually demonstrate 
forward motion even if little was being done 
stephen studdert a special assistant to bush who helps plan the 
presidents activities and concerns himself with the presidents 
image said i think the 60day report card is probably going to 
be pretty tough but i think the 365day report card is going to be 
a better barometer 
white house officials say bush has moved forthrightly with his 
domestic policy agenda noting that in addition to proposing a 
rescue plan for the troubled sampls he has continued to seek a budget 
compromise with congress and sent lawmakers his legislative 
proposals on such issues as child care and the minimum wage 
one official discussing bushs strategy on grounds of anonymity 
acknowledged however that presidential aides recently scrapped the 
themeaweek strategy used early on ethics one week budget 
the next drugs the next and so forth 
the official said the unpredictable flow of news events and the 
extent to which a presidents visibility is often dictated by these 
occurrences made it impractical to try to sustain a single theme 
through a weeks time 
frank greer a democratic consultant said bush had a good 
inaugural and had set a constructive tone in his statements about 
seeking bipartisan consensus on major issues 
but he said the bush white house wasted tremendous political 
capital on the enervating battle to win confirmation of former 
sen john tower as secretary of defense 
history has shown that the first 100 days will prove the tone 
and the effectiveness of a new administration and hes wasted 
twothirds of it greer said and i think what youre headed for 
is a weak presidency

discoverys astronauts 
swooped out of orbit to a desert landing and the cheers of 450000 
spectators today after a nearly flawless journey that completed a 
vital space communications network and mapped a fragile earth 
commander michael coats guided the 97ton winged spaceship to a 
touchdown on a concrete runway at this flight test base at 636 
am concluding a flight that covered 19 million miles in 4 days 
23 hours 39 minutes 
the shuttle landed on the runways center line 
well done discovery thats one to be proud of capsule 
communicator frank culbertson said as the craft rolled to a stop 
fortyfive minutes after touchdown the five astronauts all 
looking fit and smiling left the spacecraft and were met by several 
nasa officials 
they took the traditional walkaround inspection of discovery and 
closeup television pictures showed the fuselage in very good 
condition there was no evidence of the severe tile damage that 
atlantis suffered in december when it was hit by insulation falling 
off a booster rocket and fuel tank during the launch 
the crew was driven to a medical facility for brief examiniations 
and later were to meet with their families before flying back to 
their training base in houston 
there is no significant damage to the tiles shuttle chief 
richard truly told a news conference this is the cleanest orbiter 
of any orbiter ive ever seen 
truly said the astronauts were very healthy and said the flight 
shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is 
two loud sonic booms cracked over the california desert as 
discovery glided powerless through clear skies with the huge crowd 
some waving american flags shouting its approval from viewing sites 
on parched rogers dry lake 
the air force estimated the crowd which streamed in overnight in 
more than 138000 vehicles at 450000 
an hour before landing coats fired braking rockets 196 miles 
above the indian ocean to drop discovery out of orbit and start it 
on a fiery dive through the atmosphere on a course over the 
midpacific across the california coast south of santa barbara and 
into this mojave desert base 
discoverys coming home coats radioed after the firing 
the spaceship was traveling more than 200 mph when it touched the 
runway but slowed quickly as coats operated new brake systems 
designed to improve performance 
as the flight neared an end the crew tidied up the cabin 
checked all reentry systems closed the payload bay doors and donned 
bulky spacesuits for use in case of an emergency bailout 
the astronauts were awakened today by a recording of their 
children saying such things as get up dad get out of bed get 
to work and hi daddy this is your darling daughter telling 
you to wake up 
that was followed by a recording of louis armstrongs what a 
wonderful world the crew responded with a recording of simon and 
garfunkles homeward bound 
it was the 28th shuttle mission and the third since the 
challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years 
ago nasa hopes to complete seven flights this year and 12 a year by 
1992 
its about the cleanest flight weve had from a failure 
standpoint flight director charles shaw said friday night ive 
been involved in every shuttle flight and ive never seen so few 
failures 
the only problem came early in the mission from an erratic 
pressure reading on a hydrogen tank that helps provide electricity 
to the orbiter the astronauts conserved energy by turning off 
unnecessary lights and computers for a day until ground controllers 
corrected the difficulty 
the shuttle is commanded by coats the pilot is john blaha and 
the mission specialists are james buchli james bagian and bob 
springer 
the five completed their primary mission just six hours after 
liftoff from cape canaveral on monday the deployment of a 100 
million tracking and data relay satellite that completes a 
constellation of three such spacecraft the new satellite which 
will be operational in a few weeks will enable nasa to have nearly 
constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites 
at that point the space agency will begin closing six ground 
stations at a savings of 13 million a month 
with the satellite deployed the astronauts turned their 
attention to photographing the earth and conducting several 
experiments

young soviet women will soon be able to discard 
their unstylish clothes and for the first time buy the same trendy 
fashions as their european and american counterparts 
three european companies are finalizing jointventures they 
believe will revolutionize soviet fashion by offering soviet women 
the western styles they can now get only from friends traveling 
abroad foreign currency stores or the black market 
the deals will put branches of britains coppernob chain and 
italys stefanel and benetton chains which all cater to the youth 
market in cities across the soviet union 
soviet women will get their first chance to buy western clothes 
by the end of march when stefanel expects to open two stores in 
leningrad federico steiner an account executive for stefanels 
public relations firm said friday in rome 
under a joint venture contract with the city of leningrad signed 
in september he said one store will accept the soviet ruble and 
the other dollars which tourists and limited numbers of soviets 
have access to 
americanborn designer gifi fields whose coppernob clothes are 
sold in more than 50 british stores said friday he expects to open 
four or five stores in leningrad this fall all accepting rubles 
he also expects to open a leningrad factory by the end of the 
year to assemble partly made clothes imported from britain 
a benetton spokesman marino verengo said the company has been 
negotiating an agreement with the soviet government that would allow 
them to open about 50 stores in soviet cities and build two or three 
factories to produce benetton clothes for the soviet market he said 
the agreement was likely to be signed this year 
fields credited soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs desire to 
reform the soviet economy and meet the growing demand for consumer 
goods for the decision to allow western clothing firms into the 
country for the first time 
the joint ventures he said offer a historic opportunity to 
bring the soviet people closer to their european neighbors with whom 
they share a similar culture and taste in clothes 
obviously theres a great potential in a market which is 
basically dealing in total functional clothing with no flair said 
fields 37 in an interview 
he said londonbased coppernob has reached agreement in principle 
with two leningrad cooperatives nevski zori and lilia to open the 
factory and branches throughout the soviet union details of the 
accord reached during a trip to leningrad in february were being 
finalized 
under the deal he said coppernob will invest any profits in the 
soviet union he did not say how much coppernob would invest in the 
project 
initially were starting the operation off as small he said 
i can see us in 10 years time producing megaamounts of fashion 
clothing in the soviet union not only for the marketplace in the 
soviet union but to service the rest of western europe and possibly 
even the united states 
the clothes going on sale in leningrad this fall will be 
virtually the same as the clothes hell be selling in london or 
washington lots of wool tweed jackets with short skirts or jeans 
rich corduroys and stylish but simple velvet dresses 
good young fashion is like music it transcends all 
boundaries fields said

oliver norths lawyers are defending their 
client by trying to show president reagan personally directed a 
strategy of secretly assisting the contras without informing 
congress 
the approach by norths lawyers has featured two significant 
disclosures so far at his trial 
reagan signed off on a deal to slip 110 million in extra aid to 
honduras in exchange for that countrys government help to the 
guerrillas 
the president apparently gave the goahead for airdropping 
intelligence and recoilless rifles for the sinking of armsbearing 
ships this at a time when congress had banned military aid to the 
contras 
norths lawyers have been able to focus much attention on 
reagans role in secretly supporting the contras with more 
disclosures to come 
part of norths defense is built around previously unpublicized 
quid pro quo arrangements the reagan administration had with 
honduras and other countries 
north lawyer brendan sullivan is hoping through the discussion 
of reagans role to convince the jury that norths actions in 
secretly helping the contras were taken at the behest of the 
president 
we dont comment on pending legal matters mark weinberg a 
spokesman for the former president said when asked about the 
testimony concerning reagans actions 
the apparent weak point in sullivans approach is that it relies 
on blurring the line between lying to congress and avoiding congress 
before reagan initialed the secret quid pro quo arrangement with 
honduras in 1985 north recommended that a special emissary unlikely 
to be questioned by congress be entrusted with details of the 
proposed deal 
the normal course would have been to communicate the arrangement 
through the us ambassador to honduras who could expect to be 
called to capitol hill for questioning 
formernational security adviser robert mcfarlane testified at 
norths trial that reagan agreed congress shouldnt be told about 
thirdcountry support for the contras 
the presidents inner circle of advisers kept information on 
contra aid secret even from each other what they didnt know they 
wouldnt be able to communicate if asked by congress 
members of the national security planning group including the 
president and vice president and several cabinet officers discussed 
the possibility of pressing third countries for contra aid at a 1984 
meeting in the white house situation room 
unbeknownst to some of them saudi arabia had already agreed to 
give 1 million a month mcfarlane who moderated the meeting 
remained silent about the saudi arrangements which he had helped 
set up 
when a state department official was questioned by congress he 
responded that he had heard there was thirdcountry support for the 
contras but that he knew nothing about it 
mcfarlane who did know wasnt asked 
but a strategy of silence was no longer possible in september 
1985 by that time the news media were linking north to 
fundraising efforts and tactical advice being offered the contras 
letters came in from congress answers were demanded mcfarlane 
was on the spot 
in testimony last thursday the former national security adviser 
said he discussed the congressional queries with reagan 
there was no indication from mcfarlanes testimony that reagan 
recognized the complexion of the problem had changed completely 
that in order to retain secrecy answers would have to be hedged or 
falsified 
mcfarlane said he simply told the president that we were bound 
to be criticized in any event no matter what the responses to 
letters from congress 
reagan accepted it saying ok mcfarlane recalled 
prosecutor john keker in his questioning of mcfarlane 
repeatedly elicited testimony that reagan never suggested lying to 
congress part of the prosecutions effort to show it was norths 
idea 
four of the 12 criminal charges against north are that he 
obstructed congress or made false statements by preparing written 
denials in 1985 that national security council staffers were 
involved in assisting the contras 
mcfarlane who signed the letters pleaded guilty to three 
misdemeanors and was fined 20000 mcfarlane also pleaded guilty to 
a fourth misdemeanor in connection with congressional testimony he 
gave denying knowledge of saudi government support for the contras

house speaker jim wright appears to be bracing 
for bad news from the 12 members of an ethics committee who convene 
this week to deliberate a series of charges against him in a process 
not unlike that of a grand jury 
wright has suggested in recent days he would be willing to admit 
to bad judgment in handling his finances if the panel draws such 
conclusions he also has enlisted lieutenants to defend him on the 
house floor and sought advice on how to handle his situation from 
close house colleagues 
at the same time nervousness is rising among house democrats and 
there are murmurs of severe political trouble for the speaker even 
if the panel recommends mild sanctions for any rules violations 
the committee after a lengthy investigation heard three weeks 
of arguments from its investigator chicago attorney richard phelan 
and wrights lawyer william oldaker 
wright is accused of misusing his office for financial gain 
including using staff to prepare a book on which he earned 55000 
in royalties accepting free use of a fort worth condominium and 
improperly lobbying federal savings and loan regulators 
the ethics panel was to resume deliberations on monday and 
planned to meet most of the week members said it increasingly 
appeared that no result would be reached until after congress 
returns from its easter break in early april 
the committee could recommend sanctions ranging from censure to 
expulsion if it finds the texas democrat violated house rules such 
a recommendation is akin to a grand jury indictment and would be 
subject to a disciplinary hearing and ultimately a vote of the 
house if it finds no merit to the charges it could simply drop the 
case 
as the committee met behind closed doors last week wright was 
sending intriguing public signals at an impromptu lunch with 
reporters on tuesday he grew contemplative and said he might not 
run for a third term as speaker if the ethics report eroded his 
backing among democrats 
i wouldnt want to be speaker unless my colleagues want me to 
be speaker he said 
at the same session he seemed to be preparing for a harsh report 
if the committee should say we think this is bad 
judgment well ill accept that i have confidence in them im 
not going to quarrel with that i probably have done things which in 
hindsight were poor judgment 
but he continued to deny any violation of house rules and 
suggested that any lapses were the result of inattention to his 
personal finances rather than intentional wrongdoing and he said 
his support remains strong 
after this is resolved ill be stronger than ever wright 
said my colleagues have confidence in me or they tell me they 
do 
wrights comments came after his attorney had heard phelan 
present his findings to the ethics panel the tone was markedly 
different from last june when wright defiantly asserted it 
should be abundantly clear that the charges against me hold no water 
whatsoever 
both the chairman of the ethics committee rep julian dixon 
dcalif and the senior republican rep john t myers of indiana 
say they believe a polarized partisan outcome to the probe is 
unlikely 
i have no reason now not to believe it will be bipartisan 
dixon told the wall street journal 
that raised the possibility that some counts against wright have 
enough weight that democrats will feel compelled to vote for a 
statement of alleged violation the panels equivalent of an 
indictment 
according to many house members interviewed last week such a 
move would put the speakers job in serious jeopardy 
i think concern is rising said one senior democrat who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity its a very serious matter 
the guy has problems said another democratic lawmaker 
saying wrights alleged misdeeds would become a difficult election 
issue for the party members dont want to be defending their 
leaders they want leaders they can be proud of and who help them 
added another we are weary of having this color our whole 
existence people back home keep reading and hearing about it im 
trying to do important work here but they dont see that im 
concerned about the perception 
while democrats generally would not speak on the record 
republicans werent so reticent rep mickey edwards rokla 
chairman of the republican policy committee said his party was 
being careful not to make the speakers problems appear the result 
of a partisan vendetta 
i hear its going to be very tough a lot of different counts 
sufficient to indicate a pattern of misjudgment or ethical lapses 
edwards said he said that in some ways the republicans would be 
better off with a wounded wright as speaker than with a 
squeakyclean replacement 
id much rather have jim wright as speaker with half the united 
states wondering whats going on with this guy edwards said

nearly 400 years ago a young man about london 
apparently tried to start what would now be called a punk fashion 
he took to wearing his blonde hair long over his left shoulder but 
short on the other side 
the fashion failed to catch on but the young man henry 
wriothesly third earl of southampton is remembered anyhow many 
authorities believe william shakespeare was writing his sonnets at 
the time 1594 in support of a family effort to make the 
20yearold earl get married and produce an heir 
shakespeare wrote two longer poems for him one with a dedication 
evidencing as much friendship as was socially acceptable at that 
period between a mere playwright and a nobleman 
a tiny oval portrait of southampton showing the unsuccessful 
lovelock is a feature of a show of treasures from the 
fitzwilliam the museum of cambridge university in england 
opening sunday at the national gallery of art 
the fitzwilliam is perhaps britains preeminent small 
museum said j carter brown director of the national gallery 
the painting is by nicholas hilliard the most famous miniaturist 
of the period only about an inch and a half in height it was done 
on the back of a calfskin playing card three hearts can still be 
seen on the other side 
southampton did get marrieda few years later after a scandalous 
affair with a lady in waiting to queen elizabeth he had been a 
favorite of the queen and later she commuted a death sentence 
against him for taking part in a conspiracy against her he died on 
a military expedition to the netherlands in 1624 
the exhibition includes more than 160 objects from the 
fitzwilliam they range from a bit of softcore pornography by the 
18th century british satirist william hogarth to a portrait by sir 
anthony van dyck of arhcbishop william laud a strict and highly 
dignified churchman who helped get king charles i into a lot of 
political trouble 100 years before both laud and the king were 
beheaded 
there are also a little water spaniel in painted porcelain and 
assorted coins drawings furniture manuscripts and bronzes 
the most famous painting is one by titian that by coincidence 
deals with the same subject as shakespeares poem to southampton 
with the friendly dedication the rape of lucrece the picture 
was painted in italy about 25 years before shakespeare wrote the 
poem 
the exhibition will be at the gallerys east building through 
june 18 then it goes to the kimbell art museum in fort worth 
texas july 15 to oct 8 the national academy of design in new 
york nov 5 to jan 28 1990 the high museum of art in atlanta 
georgia feb 20 to may 6 1990 and the los angeles county museum of 
art june 21 to sept 9 1990

prices are on the upswing even as signs of an 
economic slowdown emerge suggesting americans may have to pay now 
for earlier robust growth in the economy and wait until later for 
inflation relief 
concern about inflation heightened last week after the labor 
department reported that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in 
february for the second straight month representing a 126 percent 
annual rate of inflation so far this year 
consumer prices meanwhile rose 06 percent in january a pace 
that would translate into a 72 percent annual inflation rate at the 
retail level if sustained all year financial markets will be 
anxiously awaiting februarys readout on consumer prices due to be 
released tuesday 
a booming economy can generate inflation if tight labor markets 
and strong demand for goods and services create shortages that drive 
up wages and prices which then chase one another upward 
the federal reserve board for a year has been nudging interest 
rates higher in order to cool the redhot economy and restrain 
inflation but the latest reports show that prices were accelerating 
nonetheless 
the troubling news came just as economists were starting to take 
some cheer from indications that economic growth may be moderating 
to a more sustainable level retail sales factory operating rates 
and housing starts all were down last month 
so why did prices rise 
it reflects mainly strong growth in the economy in the past 
couple of years and full employment and high operating rates said 
robert ortner outgoing commerce undersecretary for economic affairs 
he cautioned that given the lag time between an economic slowdown 
and the resulting downward pressure on prices the worst of both 
worlds is not impossible 
the risk is that we will get both slower economic growth and 
continued inflation and that certainly is what we hope to avoid 
ortner said 
the concern was echoed by michael evans head of a washington 
consulting firm to find out that inflation is almost out of 
control here just as we see evidence the economy is slowing is 
clearly the worst possible scenario he said we could have a 
rough couple months ahead the old nemesis stagflation could come 
back to haunt us 
the term stagflation was coined in the 1970s when america 
experienced the unprecedented combination of slower economic growth 
and rising prices 
initial forecasts for this year were that inflation would 
increase somewhat from the 44 percent pace of the last two years 
but many estimates are being revised upward based on the surprising 
price increases in january and february 
meanwhile growth in the economy is expected to slow this year as 
the record peacetime expansion extends through its seventh year 
indeed some critics of the federal reserve say the central banks 
tight grip on the money supply could dampen the economy so much that 
the country topples into a recession 
the fed must be patient because it takes a long time for 
changes in monetary policy to have an impact on prices said 
richard w rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce 
the immediate focus must be on the signs of economic contraction 
which indicate that fed policies have become too severe 
some analysts however believe a recession may be the only way 
to reduce inflation once it starts spiraling 
unless we have a recession we dont think inflation is going 
to come down that much said economist john hagens of the wefa 
group in bala cynwyd pa it shows the cost of reducing inflation 
it also shows the cost of not keeping inflation from accelerating 
americans paid that price in the last economic downturn when 
thenfederal reserve chairman paul volcker pushed the prime rate up 
to a high of 215 percent to combat the nations worst case of 
inflation since the civil war 
volcker won the war but not without plunging the country into 
the 198182 recession the worst downturn since the great depression

freshmen have become graduates ronald reagan 
has served a second term in the white house and retired president 
bush has come to office with an inaugural call for those who hold 
americans captive to free them and beget an era of good will 
and terry anderson prisoner of beirut has seen none of it 
incredibly it has been four years since the saturday morning the 
telephone rang with word that anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press had been kidnapped by gunmen 
on the way home from a game of tennis 
at the time it seemed to his editors and others among his 
colleagues that the kidnapping probably was an outrageous scare 
tactic aimed at reporters and that anderson would be held for a 
day perhaps a few days 
that had happened before to other journalists in the chaos 
among the factions still battling in beirut 
but the days stretched into a sentence that has passed its fourth 
year with no sign of a way out 
the signal dates that might be chosen for release a birthday 
then another and another the presidential election the bush 
inauguration have passed with no respite for anderson the first 
and only declared demand of the captors was for the release of 
radical moslems imprisoned in kuwait for terrorist activities 
in his inaugural address bush spoke of the hostages anderson 
and eight other americans seized after he was taken reagan seldom 
had spoken of their captivity since the scandal that embroiled his 
administration over the sale of arms to iran three american 
hostages were freed in lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985 
and 1986 
there are today americans who are held against their will in 
foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for bush said 
assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered good 
will begets good will 
in an interview bush was more explicit saying that he looked to 
a day of better us relations with iran and saw the hostage issue 
as one that could help lead to such a thaw he said that while 
tehran clearly has influence over the captors he is not certain the 
iranian government has clear control of the hostage situation 
at the same time bush said there would be no change in the us 
policy against concessions or ransom to free hostages a policy 
reagan declared but abridged during the arms sales we are not 
going to escalate the currency of holding americans hostages he 
said 
one gesture that could be made within that framework remains 
pending but stalled it is the standing us offer of compensation 
to the families of 290 people killed when a us warship mistakenly 
shot down an iran air jetliner over the persian gulf on july 3 1988 
the state department said the united states remains committed to 
compensation payments but that iran has not provided information 
about the families data needed to determine payment levels and set 
up a distribution system the us offer was to make payments 
directly to families not through the iranian government 
while the administration has barred concessions for hostage 
release it has said it is willing to talk with the captors 
but there has been no direct contact official or for hostage 
families that silence intensifies the frustration for andersons 
colleagues who are after all communicators accustomed to asking 
questions gaining information getting answers 
so when they gather as at thursdays fourth anniversary they 
deliver to one another their message to the captors words that may 
find a way to the faction holding anderson in beirut 
they say that holding anderson and the other hostages is no way 
to tell a story but is instead damaging the moslem image they say 
that kidnappers keep out reporters who would otherwise come to learn 
and tell others about lebanon 
they say that what is happening to anderson and the others is so 
unjust as to be unthinkable 
this cannot continue said peggy say andersons sister 
enough for gods sake enough

travel industry leaders are worried that 
visitors who bring an estimated 2 billion a year in tourism and 
convention spending to washington may start shunning shun the city 
because its distinction as the nations capital is being 
overshadowed by its image as the nations murder capital 
were very concerned about it said muneer deen president of 
the washington hotel association some of the associations are 
calling us and saying whats going to happen to your city do we 
have to cancel another thing it might affect is the family traffic 
in the summertime 
deen said the hotel association is embarking on a major public 
relations and advertising effort to assure potential tourists the 
district of columbia is a safe place to visit 
as of midday friday 113 people had been killed in the city so 
far this year many the victims of drug turf wars 
the american bankers association which is sponsoring two major 
meetings here this year has contacted the washington convention and 
visitors association to urge that action be taken to counter 
negative national publicity 
aba is just trying to anticipate a potential problem and 
prevent it said association spokesman mark serepca the problem 
would be a decline in our conference attendance we havent seen any 
yet 
leaders of the greater washington board of trade a regional 
chamber of commerce have begun studying the problem a spokeswoman 
said 
federal drug czar william j bennett announced this week that the 
district may be a laboratory for testing ways to attack the nations 
drug problem 
were very encouraged with mr bennetts announcement that 
hell make the city a model for his program said deen thats a 
very positive thing he did 
but some people in the travel business believe tourists will keep 
coming to the district of columbia despite its flagging image 
thus far theres been no impact on the tourism industry 
said marie tibor director of tourism at the convention and visitors 
association she said tourism went up 3 percent in 1988 a year in 
which a record 372 homicides were committed 
washington is not going to get hurt as far as the tourism 
business even though its pr public relations is at the lowest ebb 
its ever been said dan bohan owner of omega world travel which 
has 120 agencies nationwide 
most visitors are coming to the capital for some specific 
reason theyre either politically motivated or theyre bringing 
school groups or something he explained its a destination 
city versus just a convention city 
other cities problems gang wars in los angeles riots in miami 
and the high crime rate in los angeles have been more damaging 
but the district of columbia with its monuments and the federal 
governments presence has unique appeal bohan said 
i think they realize the victims of the murder rate are not 
visitors to the district he said 
however bohan said he does see a trend in which many tourists 
are choosing to stay in hotels in the adjacent suburbs of virginia 
and maryland rather than downtown 
charles tampio vice president of the crystal city vabased 
close up foundation which organizes high school trips to 
washington said the citys problems havent changed the groups 
plans but have aroused parents fears 
parents are concerned thats what we have to deal with he 
said close up brought 25000 young people here last year 
we show them all of washington we dont try to hide 
washingtons warts said tampio we want to show them that 
washington besides being the home to the federal government is a 
real american city with all of its problems and possibilities

l matheney hours before lisa m bianco 29 was beaten to death 
march 4 outside her northern indiana home 
bayh says the program may never be restored and directed seven 
prison officials to face disciplinary hearings 
most state prisons allow limited inmate furloughs brief periods 
of freedom ranging from a few hours to a week when prisoners can 
look for a job visit a relative get a medical exam or attend a 
funeral thousands of other prisoners work day jobs and return to 
prison at night 
these people are going to get out eventually says 
pennsylvania prisons spokeswoman iris crumbly were preparing 
them easing them out getting them reacclimated to living in the 
community 
a furlough can be a payoff too for an inmate who doesnt make 
trouble its a reward for good behavior and adherence to 
discipline says francis archibald a spokesman for south 
carolinas prison department 
a few states such as illinois and nevada dont allow furloughs 
or work release other states including oregon and georgia have 
turned to extended furloughs and early release to relieve prison 
overcrowding 
the system appears to work smoothly most of the time 
florida runs an extensive furlough program granting 5658 
workrelease permits and 14 compassionate furloughs last september 
alone only one inmate failed to return missouri reports 999 
percent of inmates furloughed in 1988 obeyed the rules and committed 
no new crimes 
indiana has become only the latest in a growing number of states 
however that are tightening the rules on furloughs or eliminating 
some programs entirely even the very few failures may shatter 
public confidence threaten political careers and end lives 
willie horton the furloughed massachusetts inmate who terrorized 
a maryland couple and became a political battering ram in george 
bushs presidential campaign against massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis is merely the bestknown of those failures there are 
others 
in the indiana case matheney 38 had been sentenced to eight 
years for beating ms bianco in 1987 two years after their divorce 
and she had become a counselor and advocate for battered women 
prison officials knew of matheneys continued hostility toward her 
but failed to warn ms bianco as promised of his release 
in an interview videotaped by prosecutors two years ago a badly 
bruised ms bianco said matheney had threatened to make my life so 
miserable that i would wish daily that i was dead 
i bartered for my life yesterday and told him that i would not 
prosecute she continued im afraid if he does get ahold of me 
again that im not going to be able to talk about it 
matheney will face the death sentence if convicted 
in louisiana prison trusty wesley dyson jr was charged with 
shooting to death his girlfriend during a weekend release in august 
1988 dyson was serving a life sentence for killing his wife in 1982 
in seattle businesswoman diane ballasiotes was slain last 
september by workrelease inmate gene raymond kane jr kane whom 
psychiatrists had described years earlier as a sexual psychopath 
was sentenced to life without parole 
in las vegas a judge gave edward beets 29 a 48hour furlough 
from a trespass and battery jail sentence to attend the funeral of 
an aunt beets now is charged in the march 10 hammering death of 
oretha hames 71 and the attempted murder of her daughter beets 
girlfriend vanita hames 28 
should i punish everyone in the future because this man did 
something horrible asked las vegas municipal judge gary davis 
who granted the furlough it was a kindness to beets family 
that turned into a nightmare 
prison officials say inmates are carefully screened before 
furloughs are granted but murderers are eligible in several states 
including missouri a utah rapist won work release and was charged 
again with rape a delaware murderer was granted weekend passes 
although rules forbade it 
even inmates with clean prison records can be unpredictable 
after all they are prisoners says oklahoma prison spokesman 
jerry massie they have been convicted of crimes against society 
some states have clamped down on furloughs and early releases 
after wellpublicized crimes while others have taken similar steps 
to avoid borrowing trouble 
dukakis tightened furlough rules after the 1987 horton case 
choosing not to eliminate either that program or work release 
louisiana gov buddy roemer implemented tougher policies since 
dyson was charged the new standards would have kept dyson who won 
an exception because he was assigned to the governors mansion 
under guard the old policy treated furloughs as some kind of 
reward for service within the institution roemer said to me 
thats not valid 
marylands patuxent institution a psychiatric center came under 
criticism when it was revealed one triple murderer had regular 
furloughs and a convicted rapist was charged with rape while on 
work release patuxent suspended all furlough and workrelease 
programs in november 
five years ago missouri sharply cut furloughs after two 
furloughed inmates were charged with a series of rapes in st louis 
st louis circuit attorney george peach a critic of the program 
says he still worries despite more stringent regulations 
all i can say is that we havent recently had a frontpage 
story of a furlough guy committing a crime peach says i think 
thats probably luck

prime minister yitzhak shamir hoping to 
strengthen his hand before an upcoming trip to washington is 
bringing together jewish leaders from 30 countries monday in a show 
of jewish solidarity 
critics say the meeting of 1100 jewish leaders will boost 
shamirs hardline views at a time when many jews are criticizing 
israels harsh treatment of rioting palestinians 
the threeday meeting in jerusalem is to close at the western 
wall judaisms holiest shrine with an expected declaration of 
support for a strong peaceseeking israel 
it is billed as a nonpartisan show of support for the jewish 
state rather than for any specific foreign policy line including 
shamirs refusal to talk to the palestine liberation organization 
the israeli leader plans to visit washington in april and is 
expected to come under increasing pressure from us officials to 
produce new ideas for a peace initiative 
washington recently launched a dialogue with the plo and 
secretary of state james baker iii said tuesday that israel may have 
no alternative but to reverse its policy and negotiate with the 
guerrillas it calls terrorists 
shamir 73 reiterated in an interview published friday in 
jerusalem that he will never talk to the plo and rejects giving up 
the occupied gaza strip and west bank in exchange for peace a 
concept at the heart of us middle east policy 
cabinet minister mordechai gur a labor party leader helping to 
organize the conference said the meeting will not be used to 
legitimize or boost shamirs rightwing positions gurs 
leftofcenter party is a partner in the national unity government 
headed by shamir of the likud bloc 
it is not going to be a shamir conference it is not going to 
be a likud conference it is going to be a jewish conference in 
support of the state of israel of the government of the state of 
israel said gur who has no portfolio 
like a small number of other labor ministers gur has publicly 
supported talks with the plo under certain conditions 
ehud olmert the cabinet minister in charge of arab affairs who 
is from likud said the conference was called precisely because 
there are divisions among israelis and jews outside the country 
about the peace process 
we believe it is important at this particular time to reaffirm 
solidarity for the state of israel there will not be any specific 
resolution calling for support for a particular policy line he 
said 
israel has faced mounting international criticism because of 
harsh methods the army uses to suppress the palestinian revolt 
against israeli occupation now in its 16th month 
at least 395 palestinians have been killed during the uprising 
most from israeli army gunfire seventeen israelis also have died 
some jewish circles also are critical a recent poll conducted by 
the american jewish committee showed american jews still support 
israel but they are embarrassed by its actions against palestinian 
rioters 
a spokesman for the antidefamation league of bnai brith a new 
yorkbased jewish service organization said the conference is 
designed to counter the impression that criticism of israel by jews 
means they have abandoned support for the state 
we believe that too many enemies of israel have mistaken 
the open communal discussion of israels current difficulties and 
the legitimate differences within our own community as a withdrawal 
of our general support for israel it says in a statement to be 
published in sundays jerusalem post 
among leaders expected at the conference are morris abrams 
former head of the conference of presidents of major jewish 
organizations and rabbi alexander schindler a leader of americas 
reform jews 
among critics are michael lerner editor of the american liberal 
jewish magazine tikkun who charged those gathering in jerusalem 
will be dancing to shamirs tune and colin schindler editor of 
the londonbased jewish quarterly who voiced similar criticism 
history will judge that the americans coming to israel next 
week betrayed the jewish people when it needed to hear sober words 
of truth lerner wrote in the jerusalem post

it has been a twodecade offseason for little 
league baseball in harlem where the crack of the bat has given way 
to crack cocaine and gun shots 
but that is to change april 8 with an opening day parade to a 
city park for four games 
were not out trying to grow bigleague ballplayers were 
trying to grow bigleague citizens says w dwight raiford who 
along with his wife iris is the guiding light behind the 
renaissance of harlem little league 
raifords organization already has its charter from the 
williamsport pabased little league baseball inc which is 
celebrating its 50th anniversary this year with 7000 leagues 
worldwide and 25 million youths 
the community on the north end of manhattan is so starved for 
recreation for its children that harlem hospital which treats 
growing numbers of youths for stab and gunshot wounds is lending 
financial and medical support 
you can walk out of the hospital at night and hear the pop pop 
pop of guns said dr barbara barlow the hospitals chief of 
pediatric surgery 
a lot of the streetselling of crack is done by youngsters and 
theyre armed kids shoot at each other if they get angry or in a 
fight with so many violent episodes its like war in the 
streets she said 
in harlem one of every 100 children is hospitalized with a 
serious injury each year 10 times the national average the doctor 
said 
and 12 percent of the major injuries to children last year were 
gunshot wounds compared with the two children treated for gunshot 
wounds at the hospital in the 1960s she said 
frustrated hospital officials began recreation programs they 
considered starting a little league program themselves but the 
raifords did it first 
jack laughlin administrator of little leagues new york district 
23 said a harlemhudson little league started in 1958 but disbanded 
by about 1970 the reasons are unclear 
mrs raiford said she began planning the new league last fall 
after striking a deal with her 8yearold son joshua she would 
start a league if joshua practiced piano with minimal complaints 
she prepared an 8000 budget so as many as 120 boys and girls 
could play and recruited sponsors to pay for the teams and 
equipment for at least one year 
half the kids cannot afford a 25 fee and others lack gloves 
raiford said but thanks to our sponsors and a strong financial 
aid program any kid who cant afford the registration fee still 
plays baseball 
formation of the harlem league one of seven leagues in 
manhattan has brought dozens of letters to the raifords and nearly 
100 phone calls 
harlem has its image mrs raiford said when you think of 
new york city you think of it as very cold and people uncaring but 
we have seen the best side of new york city you read letters and 
tears come to your eyes 
one 77yearold woman on social security wrote a letter praising 
the effort especially with so much drugs and crime out there 
and promising to send a check raiford said 
i told her to send us her prayers he said i think she did 
because other people have come through 
among the most interested have been the children including 
11yearold george salter he said hes excited about wearing 
uniforms because youll be playing and knowing youre playing for 
fun and youre appreciated 
akhnaten spencerel 9 said the ball fields will be a nice 
alternative to the streets where some people are a little crazy

syrian soldiers set up mortars and rocket 
launchers on rooftops in the moslem sector saturday after the 
commander of the christian army vowed to drive the syrian army out 
of lebanon 
sporadic artillery fire resounded across beirut on saturday as 
syrianbacked druse gunners fired into the staterun beirut port and 
christian residential neigborhoods near the citys dividing green 
line 
police said three people were wounded 
the hostilities violated a ceasefire called thursday to give 
mediators a chance to end fighting that began 10 days ago killing 
49 people and wounding 164 by police count the truce was to expire 
at midnight saturday 
the fighting between moslem and christian forces began after gen 
michel aoun the commander of the christian army blockaded illegal 
ports used by moslem militias to import supplies 
the syrians on saturday deployed mortars and rocket launchers 
atop highrise apartment buildings in outlying residential districts 
of west beirut and the shiite moslem southern slums they apparently 
were preparing for a resumption of the fighting when the truce ends 
the syrians maintain a 12000strong contingent in west and south 
beirut part of 40000 troops stationed in north east and central 
lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
reliable witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
syrians also were digging artillery gun pits and foxholes and 
erecting new sandbag positions in and around the southern suburbs 
you should not panic one syrian officer told a visibly 
worried resident while the reinforcements were being brought in 
were not going to start any fighting we are here to protect 
you 
however hundreds of shiite residents were seen packing luggage 
beds and mattresses and leaving the slums on the outskirts of the 
capital in cars heading for south lebanon 
un officials who requested anonymity said more than 8000 
shiites from beirut have taken refuge with relatives living in areas 
policed by the united nations peacekeeping forces 
we do not need a guardian who claims he is protecting us 
while in reality he is killing us sponging away our wealth and 
usurping our sovereignty aoun said friday 
our option is liberation we shall fight and use every other 
means to bring about the syrian withdrawal said aoun 53 a 
maronite catholic who commands 20000 mostly christian troops in 
lebanons fractured army 
his remark was criticized by acting prime minister salim hoss a 
prosyrian official who heads the mainly moslem cabinet competing 
for legitimacy with the christian military cabinet under aoun 
you are planting war but you are not going to reap any 
liberation said hoss a sunni moslem the syrians are here at 
the request of legitimate authorities and their departure can be 
decided only by a united cabinet 
their remarks appeared to dim the chances of an agreement to 
resolve the latest round of fighting in the 14yearold civil war

bulldozers and rescue workers searched 
through rubble saturday for two teenage girls feared buried in the 
collapse of a 900yearold tower 
two people were killed and 15 injured when the 255foot tower 
crumbled onto a square in this northern italian town friday morning 
the search for the two girls began after they were reported 
missing by their parents they had failed to show up for work or 
return home friday 
throughout the night bulldozers firefighters and volunteer 
rescue workers dug through the tons of bricks and dirt authorities 
said the cleanup operation would last through the weekend 
the tower destroyed a newspaper stand buried several parked cars 
and damaged adjoining shops and parts of the adjacent 501yearold 
cathedral 
experts said natural decay of the mortar cementing the bricks 
likely caused the collapse however heavy august rains that damaged 
the church and a recent threemonth dry spell that may have weakened 
ground around the tower are also being considered as possible causes 
for the collapse 
a magistrate was investigating whether negligence was involved 
culture ministry officials and other departments dealing with 
preservation of monuments will meet in pavia next week to examine 
the causes of the collapse and determine measures for preventing 
similar incidents

with discovery safely back on earth 
nasa will move forward on its ambitious launch schedule by taking 
atlantis to the launch pad wednesday for an april 28 liftoff with 
the first space shuttle planetary payload 
magellan a 7600pound spacecraft that resembles a giant insect 
will be dispatched by atlantis crew for a 466day outward journey 
to venus the probe is to orbit the cloudshrouded planet and map 
its surface with highresolution radar 
discoverys successful launch last monday with a communications 
satellite was the first of seven shuttle flights planned this year 
as the space agency continues its recovery from the 1986 challenger 
explosion working toward a flight rate of 12 a year by 1992 
shuttle boss richard truly said after discoverys return from 
space on saturday that our goal is to fly again and again with 
safety always a prime consideration 
he said discovery returned in better condition than any other 
shuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launch 
schedule 
it shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is 
truly said 
it also demonstrates he said that nasa has the capability of 
flying a busy and safe launch rate 
one stumbling block in the shuttle schedule may be the extensive 
modifications being made to columbia the first shuttle in the 
fleet truly said that shuttles july 1 target launch date with a 
classified military payload already has slipped about two weeks 
any additional delay could push back another military shuttle 
flight planned in august and that could begin impacting the 
highpriority october launch of atlantis with the galileo probe to 
jupiter 
we want very much to launch columbia in july truly said 
if not well delay it to meet the galileo window 
magellan and galileo are highpriority missions because there is 
only a month or so every two years when their planetary targets are 
in the proper alignment for a launch 
the space agency also is conscious that no american spacecraft 
has been launched toward the planets since 1978 
heres the present launch schedule for this year 
april 28 atlantis with the magellanvenus spacecraft 
midjuly columbia with a defense department payload 
midaugust discovery with a defense department payload 
oct 12 atlantis with the galileojupiter spacecraft 
nov 13 columbia whose crew is to deploy a communications 
satellite and retrieve for return to earth a scientific satellite 
orbiting since 1984 
dec 11 discovery with the hubble space telescope 
ten flights are scheduled in 1990

discoverys astronauts generally toed 
the line on a new nasa edict to cut the comedy at least for public 
viewing but they showed some flashes of fun in space mainly in the 
battle of wakeup songs 
when discovery made the first postchallenger flight last 
september the five astronauts awoke to beach boys music parodies 
and clowned for television cameras in bright hawaiian shirts 
and even though the december flight of atlantis was a classified 
military mission word leaked of special wakeup music not 
particularly flattering to the pentagon 
and both crews videotaped themselves playing in the 
weightlessness of orbit turning somersaults throwing a football 
and feeding each other candy the tapes were shown at public 
gatherings 
the astronauts wacky wakeup calls and zany acrobatics got 
attention which upset nasa because it felt the reports made the 
flights look like all play and no work 
weve learned that if you crack a joke or show somebody doing 
something funny thats the 10 seconds that gets on the evening 
news and not the two hours worth of work you just showed 
discovery commander michael coats said in a prelaunch interview 
so space agency officials told discoverys crew to cool it when 
the cameras or microphones were on 
nasa has no officia sense of humor anymore said bob 
springer one of coats crewmates so were somewhat restricted 
now on what we can do 
discoverys flight started out strictly following the policy 
with wakeup calls played by mission control limited to presentations 
like the marine hymn for the two crewmen who are marines 
but on day 3 things loosened up 
the astronauts preempted mission control by playing their own 
wakeup music first the theme music from star trek 
they followed that with a tape recorded for them by actor william 
shatner who gave a brief performance in his character of capt 
james t kirk in the star trek movies and television series 
discovery tell scotty to beam me up replied capsule 
communicator david low in houston 
mission control then responded with its planned wakeup a medley 
of school songs from the alma maters of the crew members 
the next day the astronauts again were first in the wakeup 
battle broadcasting a recording of hi ho hi ho its off to 
work we go the work song of the seven dwarfs in the animated 
movie classic snow white 
mission control regained the upper hand on the final day 
saturday hitting the airwaves first with a raucus recording of the 
astronauts children shouting such things as get up dad get out 
of bed and get to work and hi daddy this is your darling 
daughter telling you to wake up

few residents of this city in northeast ohio 
remember a fairhaired boy named terry anderson who played at his 
parents home while his father worked at a local steel mill 
but 30 years later many in the city of 75000 claim anderson as 
one of their own as they work to free him from captivity in lebanon 
the city of lorain has a soft spot in its heart for any lorain 
native said jack lavriha chairman of the free terry anderson 
committee the andersons are a deeprooted family here terrys 
grandfather had a grocery store in south lorain and his dad worked 
in the steel mills 
anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld of nine american hostages in lebanon he 
began his fifth year in captivity thursday 
andersons parents are dead but he still has relatives in 
lorain an industrial city 30 miles east of cleveland on lake erie 
the house where anderson lived until he was 6 or 7 years old has 
been torn down as has the school where he went to first grade said 
gwen jones 78 andersons aunt 
the family left that house when andersons father glenn left 
the steel mills to work as a truck driver and moved the family to 
batavia ny 
while lavriha said he is unaware of any lorain resident other 
than mrs jones who has seen anderson in the past 30 years that 
hasnt stopped lorain residents from working on andersons behalf 
last christmas the committee gathered 28000 christmas cards for 
anderson that were sent to the state department with the hope that 
the greetings might reach lebanon some of them were published in a 
beirut newspaper 
every oct 28 residents hold a party in honor of andersons 
birthday on march 16 they gather in remembrance of the day he was 
captured in 1985 lavriha said 
the committee has done a lot of work to keep his name alive 
said a cousin of andersons leila arden 45 who said she hasnt 
seen him since he moved from lorain theyve done a lot of work in 
making him one of our own 
about 500 people wore yellow ribbons heard music written in 
andersons honor and released hundreds of balloons thursday at city 
hall to symbolize their hope that anderson will be released more 
than 100 of those attending were members of six veterans 
organizations said another of andersons cousins james anderson 
vice commander of a local veterans of foreign wars post 
if you are a native of lorain whether a veteran or not we 
would have been there he said but terrys being a marine and a 
veteran of vietnam makes him kind of special 
lorain native richard bacher who has never met anderson wrote a 
song called we want you home again in andersons honor last 
december the song recorded by the lorain high school choir 
implores andersons captors to listen to our plea and send him 
home 
lavriha said it has been broadcast by more than 80 us radio 
stations and by the voice of america overseas 
he said the committee will continue to work to free anderson 
the main thing is to keep this thing alive once we forget the 
hostages theyll be gone lavriha said

to spend several days this week in rebelcontrolled territory in el 
salvador here is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rebels say they will not stop 
salvadorans from voting in sundays presidential election but none 
of the votingage residents in this village of 2500 plans to cast a 
ballot 
no one here believes in this election said rodrigo lainez a 
local leader of this town which was repopulated in 1987 after being 
abandoned for seven years 
this election is to prolong the war said a man who 
identified himself only as victor 
no love is lost between this town in north central salvador and 
the government of president jose napoleon duarte his administration 
and its army consider this like others revived by people returning 
from refugee camps in honduras as hostile territory 
in an interview a local rebel commander known only as 
antolin said under no circumstances would voters be targets in 
the guerrilla campaign to discredit the elections 
but no election was scheduled in santa marta where sympathies 
clearly lie with the leftist farabundo marti national liberation 
front which has waged a 9yearold war against the usbacked 
government 
the rebels have called for an election boycott to prove that a 
political solution is impossible without their participation 
every day from 6 am to 8 am radios in santa marta are tuned 
to the rebels radio farabundo marti and radio venceremos 
women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee before 
heading to the fields on one morning this week all listened to a 
radio account of overnight attacks on the puppet army and 
admonishments that every salvadoran do his part to prepare for 
insurrection 
guerrillas are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice 
government soldiers on their rare appearances are shunned 
the soldiers three times set fire to the cornfields around 
here said lainez the last time they came through a few went 
up to people and told them just wait until arena is in power 
well be back with a bomb for every house 
alfredo cristiani of the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance or arena is expected to win sundays election in its 
campaign arena has taken a hard line on the war threatening a 
military solution 
in an attempt to disrupt voting on sunday rebels announced a 
transportation strike that government officials said paralyzed more 
than 90 percent of the nations transport services rebels also 
sabotaged utilities leaving much of the nation without power or 
water for the past five days 
the government has said soldiers will be stationed at polls to 
guarantee voter safety 
we will attack military objectives in the countryside in the 
cities and on the roads but the people will never become a military 
target antolin said from his mountain stronghold 
if civilians are killed or wounded they will be victims of 
rightist terrorists trying to make us look bad he said 
but santa marta and at least 23 other rebelcontrolled towns 
residents were to follow the rebel lead and boycott polls sunday 
col jose herrarte provincial military commander said support for 
the guerrillas was firmly entrenched in santa marta 
the subversives count on them for supplies recruitment and 
rest he said they portray us only as murderers violators of 
human rights ogres 
an estimated 20000 salvadorans were driven from their homes by 
the war aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s 
since october 1987 about 6500 have returned 
when we came back this was just woods and brush said 
lainez every house had been burned and the fields were 
overgrown 
now many people are enlarging their homes and working cooperative 
farms 
because of the war there are lots of widows and orphans 
here said lainez if we werent a cooperative those people 
would die

surgeon general c everett koop has joined 
other federal health officials in trying to assure the public it is 
safe for children to eat apples 
i wish to send a message to mothers across the country its 
ok mom apples are good for your kids koop said in a statement 
released by his office over the weekend 
last week officials of the food and drug administration the 
environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture 
went to capitol hill in an effort to calm public fears over the 
chemical alar used by some apple growers to retain the crispness of 
their fruit 
many apple growers say they dont use alar which has been linked 
to cancer in animal tests but the industry is reeling from reaction 
to a recent a private environmental groups report that youngsters 
are at especially high risk from alar because they eat so many more 
apples than adults 
many parents are reported to have stopped giving apples to their 
children and some school districts are no longer serving apples in 
their cafeterias 
trying to allay their fears koop said that in 1988 only 5 
percent of the apple crop was treated with alar 
as surgeon general i support my colleagues in the federal 
government and scientific community in the belief that it is safe to 
eat apples he said 
fda commissioner frank young has said that even in those apples 
containing alar the level is no more than 10 percent the level 
found acceptable under epa regulations 
public furor over the alar controversy was intensified last week 
by the unrelated ban of fruit from chile because two grapes were 
found to have been injected with cyanide

chinas legislature opens its annual meeting 
monday and some observers expect a tough fight between delegates 
calling for democratic change and government officials stressing 
stability 
the government argues that it needs stability to solve chinas 
pressing economic problems many intellectuals say the economic 
problems will persist unless the government relaxes tight political 
controls 
prodemocratic forces are expected to continue an openletter 
campaign urging an amnesty for political prisoners and respect for 
human rights 
since january four such letters have been sent signed by more 
than 100 leading intellectuals the last letter was sent last week 
despite threats of punishment by government officials 
delegates also said they expected the issue of human rights to be 
raised at the congress itself an unprecedented act of defiance 
it will be a lively time said one communist party member 
intellectuals will push as far as they can go 
government officials have ordered the staterun media to censor 
reports of disagreements at the 2796member national peoples 
congress and portray the delegates as united communist party 
sources said 
and the restrictions are apparently not limited to the domestic 
press 
on friday night chinese authorites interrogated two taiwanese 
journalists after they had interviewed a delegate two teams of hong 
kong reporters were also stopped from talking with delegates 
lu zhichao a government spokesman apologized for the incidents 
but he said he could not assure it would not happen again 
it will be a step back from last year said one delegate 
during last years congress the chinese news media was allowed 
to report some disagreements between delegates as part of the 
states attempt at openness 
the government has been emphasizing that it needs stability to 
solve chinas weighty economic problems 
by doing so party sources said china hopes to persuade wavering 
delegates that its best to remain quiet and follow the government 
line 
in an attempt at conciliation the government has announced it 
will appoint more members of democratic parties to government 
positions the first appointments were made friday when 
noncommunist party members were appointed viceminister of labor 
and viceminister of agriculture 
delegates said the appointments will be made to present an image 
of democracy and to take some of the blame off the communist party 
for failed policies 
but it will fail said one party member all the delegates 
know that the democratic parties are even more communist than the 
communist party 
the congress is also expected to pass some laws two of which are 
critical to the reform of chinas political system 
one law gives civilians the right to sue the government it has 
been criticized by liberal thinkers because it does not acknowledge 
that the government can break the law but moderates have hailed it 
as a step in the right direction 
another law delineates the powers of the congress an important 
step in reforms designed to separate the functions of the communist 
party from the government 
the congress opens against a backdrop of serious political and 
economic problems 
inflation is running at a record 36 percent grain harvests have 
been below target for the past five years electricity is in scarce 
supply steel production has dropped salt and cotton are hard to 
buy 
corruption among government officials and party members appears 
at an all time high newspapers are filled with reports of official 
malfeasance

for tibetans this is a place of crushed 
hopes and cherished dreams a sanctuary far from the chinese who now 
rule their homeland and close to their spiritual leader the dalai 
lama himself an exile for 30 years 
high in the himalayan foothills of north india with big brown 
monkeys scampering across slate roofs and shaggy little terriers 
yapping in muddy streets dharmsala is a way station for tibetan 
activists who fled from the chinese a storehouse of tibetan 
culture a shrine for buddhist pilgrims and a center for plotting 
political strategies 
sonam tobgyal a 47yearold man with hard eyes and a network of 
scars across his thumbs and knuckles left tibet six weeks ago 
because he thought the chinese were on the verge of arresting him 
for proindependence activities 
it was not fear of prison that made him leave he said but fear 
of torture that might cause him to betray others who were not yet 
under suspicion for organizing demonstrations or slipping 
information to foreign travelers 
i was getting known by the chinese one of my friends was 
arrested he said seated in the sunshine on a rooftop terrace 
i had to escape 
tobgyal said he knew about torture from the 11 years he had 
already spent in chinese prisons in tibet speaking through an 
interpreter he said the scars on his hands were the result of 
beatings with wooden clubs and iron bars and being suspended by his 
thumbs from the ceiling for 15 minutes to an hour at a time 
he said he was released from prison in 1979 and started peddling 
clothing from village to village a job that enabled him to spread 
news of upcoming antichinese demonstrations 
dekey is a rosycheeked angelicfaced 2yearold who hugs 
strangers exuberantly and demands to be cuddled 
she was brought to dharmsala from lhoka a town in southern 
tibet a year ago by a mother who returned home to the rest of her 
family and may never see dekey again 
dekey is one of 1449 children between the ages of 5 months and 
18 years who live in the stone bungalows at the tibetan childrens 
village on a ridge above dharmsala some are orphans others have 
parents either in india who for reasons of health or poverty are 
unable to care for their children or in tibet who smuggled them out 
so that they might be brought up in the tibetan culture they say is 
being stifled by china 
the childrens village like so many things in dharmsala from the 
tibet memory restaurant to the dalai lamas namgyal monastery is 
dedicated to preserving tibetan identity and above all the 
struggle for a tibetan nation 
the tibetans say they were never part of china which invaded the 
himalayan feudal theocracy in 1950 and annexed it a year later 
china maintains tibet has been an integral part of its territory for 
centuries 
three decades ago a tibetan uprising failed the dalai lama 
fearing he would be killed or captured and his people left 
leaderless slipped out of the tibetan capital of lhasa on march 17 
1959 and fled across the himalayas to india where 100000 tibetans 
now live 
he formed a governmentinexile in dharmsala home to about 7000 
of his fellow refugees 
in june he offered china control over tibets foreign policy and 
the right to keep troops on tibetan soil in exchange for allowing 
tibet to become a selfgoverning democratic political entity 
in association with china 
the chinese rejected the proposal but said they were willing to 
talk to the dalai lama although formal negotiations have not begun 
it is a measure of tibetans faith in the dalai lama that many 
people still believe he will win total freedom for tibet although 
the buddhist leader has said repeatedly as he did again in an 
interview last thursday i am trying to find a middle way we are 
not insisting on complete independence 
nima assae a 51yearold former resistance fighter who was 
captured by the chinese in 1961 and imprisoned for nearly two 
decades is one of the believers 
i have full faith that the dalai lama will gain our 
independence the chinese will not be able to terminate the 
tibetans he said

secretary of state james a baker iii favors 
sending a special envoy to the afghan rebels battling the 
sovietbacked kabul regime as a means of broadening us influence 
among the longfeuding rebel factions administration officials said 
saturday 
it is under consideration a white house official said of the 
proposal 
the official who spoke on condition his name not be used said 
the proposal is still on bakers desk and has not reached 
president bush 
but baker may be close to a decision point on the matter the 
official said 
one state department official who also spoke privately said the 
proposal has been under consideration for a long time but said 
he was uncertain of the potential timing for a decision 
the first official emphasized that the move would not imply us 
recognition of any interim government established by the rebels 
also known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
he confirmed the move is aimed at limiting pakistans influence 
among the afghan guerrillas in particular its backing of radical 
moslem fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions 
throughout the war the united states has funneled aid to the 
rebels through pakistan 
the soviets entered afghanistan in 1979 to help fight an 
insurgency that began after a communist coup in 1978 the red army 
withdrew under an agreement mediated by the united nations 
in recent weeks the sovietbacked afghan government has been 
battling a renewed offensive by the moslem rebels in the wake of the 
midfebruary withdrawal of the soviet unions 115000 soldiers 
but last week the soviets renewed arms shipments to kabul saying 
they will continue to supply equipment to president najibs troops 
as long as pakistan and the united states supply the guerrillas 
civil war has ravaged afghanistan for more than 11 years and 
divisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting the 
seven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based in 
pakistan but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle for 
power as they attempt to form a transitional regime leading to a 
postwar islamic republic of afghanistan 
last year sen gordon humphrey rnh pushed a law through 
congress that required the appointment of a special ambassador but 
former secretary of state george shultz only named a lowerranking 
envoy to the us embassy in pakistan to fill the post 
on friday the senate renewed the call for a higherlevel 
appointment in a bipartisan resolution 
the resolution which was referred to the senate foreign 
relations committee also said the united states should not cut the 
amount of military equipment it gives the afghan guerrillas until it 
is absolutely clear that the soviet union has ended its 
assistance to its proxies 
sen robert byrd dwva authored the resolution which was 
signed by senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan among others

bringing philosophers writers and psychologists 
together to ponder the roots of hatred is not naive its a 
necessity in this era of plastic explosives skinheads and the furor 
over the satanic verses organizers of a new program say 
anatomy of hate a threeday seminar scheduled to begin 
sunday at boston university will tackle some tough questions and 
diverse subjects from the threats against author salman rushdie 
for his novel to the january riots in miami 
thats a very strong word hatred said nobel prizewinning 
humanitarian elie wiesel whose foundation organized the event 
usually all the conferences are for love and for compassion and 
i wanted to name the disease 
and the disease is simple concrete and conjugal and its 
here all around us thats why i begin with the anatomy of hatred 
to explore it to analyze it to dissect it 
the elie wiesel foundation for humanity has tentative plans to 
hold other beyond hate gatherings this year and next year in 
israel the soviet union paris and san francisco a pbs series with 
bill moyers as host is also in the works 
the foundation cites several positive events last year the 
ceasefire in the iraqiran war dialogue between the united states 
and the soviets the palestinian liberation organizations 
recognition of israels right to exist international cooperation in 
rushing aid to earthquaketorn armenia 
but it also gives an example of violent hatred for every one of a 
good event 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland four 
days before christmas 
ethnic violence in soviet armenia and azerbaijan 
the escalation of assaults and vandalism by racist skinhead 
groups in the united states 
continuing strife between roman catholics and protestants in 
northern ireland 
to ask why hate continues in the face of humanitarian 
cooperation and political understanding is neither naive nor 
utopian the foundation said in a statement it is a necessity 
in a world where global annihilation lies seconds away and the 
technology of destruction whether plastic explosives or nerve gas 
is readily available to a handful of extremists the costs of hatred 
are too high for the subject of hate not to be a topic of the 
highest concern 
more than 25 professors writers psychologists and peace 
advocates are scheduled to participate in the forum including 
boston university president john silber and camelia sadat the 
daughter of slain egyptian president anwar sadat 
one of the participants krister stendahl of the harvard divinity 
school said the religious aspect of hatred is a particularly 
delicate issue 
religion is a very dangerous thing stendahl said these 
are enormous powers we are dealing with my tasks are to ask why 
there has been this dark side 
people who tend to see the world in a strongly adverse 
antagonistic form stendahl said can easily play into the hands 
of the patterns of hatred the arabichebrew word shalom doesnt 
actually mean peace it means harmony thats a nonhateful 
image 
wiesel born in romania 60 years ago was deported along with his 
family to the auschwitz concentration camp when he was 15 his 
mother and sister died there he and his father were transferred to 
buchenwald where his father died before the camp was liberated in 
1945 
weisel won the nobel peace prize in 1986 for his international 
work to foster human rights he is the author of more than 30 books 
and is a professor at boston university 
he said he hopes the seminars will explore the conditions that 
transform negative attitudes into destructive behavior 
how do you start to educate people without the education the 
hatred in the world has produced more hatred he said 
we will try to explore all aspects of hatred wiesel said 
with the rushdie affair it is very topical the fanaticism 
mounting with the head of a world religion hiring hitmen its just 
unheardof its what hate can do

ships were being loaded with 700000 crates of grapes apples pears 
and kiwis he said navy troops were deployed around the clock to 
watch over the shipments and access to the port was tightly 
controlled 
twelve more ships were to be loaded over the weekend the officer 
said

us health officials said they found traces of cyanide on two 
chilean grapes in the port of philadelphia

produce announcing tougher security measures japan and canada 
which had issued similar warnings followed suit

percent of the nations exports may lose up to 1 billion 
government officials said 
manuel feliu president of the nations largest business 
association said chile had already lost 200 million while 
authorities said 200000 fruit industry workers were laid off

the crisis including a subsidized advertising campaign in the 
united states designed to regain consumer confidence 
other measures included a 12 million emergency job program 
emergency credit lines to fruit exporters and producers and the 
purchase of 1 million crates of stocked fruit 
under new security measures taking effect monday army patrols 
were to be posted in fruit fields and at packing houses and police 
were to step up security checks on trucks carrying produce to ports 
urbina said 
officials from the us food and drug administration also were to 
join chilean colleagues in reinforcing sanitary controls in ports 
and fruit packing plants 
in the united states japan and canada health officials were to 
step up spot checks of chilean produce initial checks of chilean 
fruit were made after embassies in santiago received anonymous

two weeks into a strike against eastern 
airlines organized labor has succeeded beyond expectations in 
crippling the carrier but has not for a number of reasons carried 
out prestrike threats to disrupt the rest of the nations 
transportation system 
support from the airlines pilots gave striking machinists an 
early and impressive boost in their bitter war with eastern 
management and other unions have been equally impressive in their 
support of the strikers principally through attendance at rallies 
and donations to strike funds 
but as the strike enters its third week with eastern all but 
grounded and mired in bankruptcy court even many labor leaders 
agree that their nemesis texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo is 
the early winner because he is losing less money per day now on 
eastern than he was before the strike 
but they say the lasting verdict is not yet in and that the 
strike has given labors morale a muchneeded boost 
the strike is holding firm and i think its a great show of 
solidarity aflcio president lane kirkland said in an interview 
friday the future of this airline under bankruptcy proceedings is 
largely uncharted waters but this man had this company on the 
rocks and when youre on the rocks uncharted waters look much 
better 
unions representing eastern workers marked the two week point of 
the walkout saturday with a rally across the street from the white 
house chiding president bush for not intervening to block the 
strike and promising continued solidarity 
our resolve is rock solid and so are our picket lines said 
randy babbitt of the airline pilot association which along with 
easterns flight attendants union has been honoring pickets of 
striking machinists 
as labor prepared for the strike which began when 8500 members 
of the international association of machinists walked off the job 
march 4 its plans included major disruptions of other airlines and 
railroads through secondary pickets it believed would be honored by 
union workers 
but those efforts have been stymied by court injunctions in new 
york and washington prohibiting other unions from honoring pickets 
of eastern workers they are appealing those rulings but labor 
leaders have not pressed further boycotts because they do not want 
to endanger the public support the strikers have garnered 
everything weve done to date is legal and i think the public 
appreciates that and has been on our side said iam spokesman jim 
conley 
david bensman director of the labor studies program at rutgers 
university concurred with that view 
if the unions had immediately succeeded in getting sympathy 
strikes going and disrupting things i think the public might have 
turned against the unions bensman said labor now has made its 
case and painted lorenzo as an irresponsible employer i think that 
has left labor in a strong position with the public if the strike is 
expanded in the future 
for now labors goal is to keep eastern virtually grounded the 
airline has been able to fly roughly 10 percent of its prestrike 
schedule of 1040 daily flights while pursuing a possible 
employeeled buyout of the company and drafting a union 
reorganization plan to counter any proposal lorenzo submits to the 
bankruptcy court 
labors efforts so far have won praise from outsiders who follow 
the movement particularly iteling more powerful leads you to 
act more powerfully said bensman it seems to me what has 
happened so far has been about as good as the unions could have 
expected 
lorenzo has been aided by the bankruptcy filing the unions 
concede because it has stopped a financial drain on cashpoor 
eastern that was 1 million a day before the strike and several 
times that in the days immediately following the walkout 
in many ways hes already won said conley hes taken 
hundreds of million in assets from this airline and transferred them 
to continental and texas air 
but union leaders are encouraged by indications lorenzo is trying 
to sell the airline and by polls and other indications public 
support is with the striking workers who hope antilorenzo 
sentiment will affect nonunion continental which has been losing 
money nearly as fast as eastern 
bensman said labor also has sent a powerful message throughout 
the airline industry where workers at several carriers have been 
forced to accept wage concessions in recent years 
if lorenzo had succeeded here in splitting the machinists from 
the pilots and then imposing harsh concessions it would have sent 
the green light to management at other airlines he said labor 
has strengthened its position in the industry as a whole 
peripheral to the strike itself has been a related political 
debate and much like easterns ultimate fate the ramifications of 
the strike in that context remain unclear 
by refusing to block the walkout by naming an emergency mediation 
board bush has soured his relations with labor congressional 
democrats who benefit heavily from labors political warchest are 
pushing legislation that would force bush to intervene but do not 
appear to have the votes to override a veto 
kirkland accused bush of siding with a pirate by refusing to 
intervene but said it was too soon to discuss the longterm impact 
the strike would have on labors relations with the new 
administration im still hopeful better judgment will prevail

communist north korea saturday demanded 
the united states and south korea halt joint military exercises and 
accused the us air force of staging simulated nuclear attacks with 
b52 bombers on the korean peninsula 
us officials denied north korean charges as propaganda us 
forces in south korea are believed to have nuclear weapons but 
washington has declined to confirm or deny such reports 
students in the south korean capital seoul and the southern city 
of kwangju battled police with firebombs and rocks saturday to 
demand an end to the team spirit exercises and an immediate 
withdrawal of us troops based in south korea 
riot police fired tear gas to drive back about 800 protesters at 
chonnam university in kwangju and about 400 students at dongguk 
university in the south korean capital protesters in seoul burned 
an us flag shouting yankee go home and drive out us 
forces 
also saturday millions of seoul commuters were stranded for a 
third day as many subway workers remained on strike 
north korean delegates to the military armistice commission said 
the us air force was using nine b52 bombers from bases in guam to 
stage practice nuclear attacks in south korean areas that resemble 
potential targets in the communist north 
the armistice commission which meets at the border site of 
panmunjom polices the truce that ended the korean war in 1953 
about 200000 us and south korean troops are taking part in the 
14th annual exercises which began tuesday and end next week team 
spirit practices bringing in us reinforcements in the event of a 
north korean attack 
about 42000 american soldiers are normally stationed in south 
korea under a mutual defense pact 
north korean officials said the exercises were a threat to peace 
on the divided peninsula and barrier to peace talks

the supersecret national security agency has 
ordered the construction of its own computer chip manufacturing 
plant defense officials said saturday 
lt col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman said that in 
september 1988 national semiconductor corp received an 85 million 
contract to construct and operate a microelectronics facility for 
the us government over a period of 45 months 
a defense department official who spoke on condition that he not 
be identified confirmed that the plant was to be built at the nsas 
headquarters at fort meade md located about halfway between 
washington and baltimore 
the nsa is the nations biggest intelligence agency with a work 
force topping 60000 employees more than all other us spy 
agencies combined and a budget said to be upwards of 10 billion a 
year 
its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the

addition to building the computer chip plant we will also train 
government personnel in the operation of the facility 
she declined to say when construction might start or how many 
people were expected to work at the plant 
the sun also quoted george heilmeier senior vice president and 
chief technical officer of dallasbased texas instruments inc as 
saying that the new plant would be a unique facility with a unique 
purpose 
by making its own chips at fort meade he said the government 
gains more direct control circumvents the bidding process on 
essential microchips and increases plant security

hundreds of thousands of people marched 
through this northern city in the spanish basque region saturday 
demanding an end to basque separatist violence news reports said 
spanish national radio said the crowd stretched out more than 1 
miles along the march route through the center of bilbao 
the independent ser network estimated the throng of marchers at 
nearly 300000 police declined to give crowd estimates 
representatives of the six major political parties representing 
83 percent of the basque electorate headed the demonstration 
carrying a banner reading peace now and forever calling on the 
basque separatist group eta to lay down its arms 
on friday jose antonio ardanza head of the autonomous basque 
regional government called on the basque separatist group to extend 
indefinitely a ceasefire the separatists first declared jan 8 and 
renewed 15 days later to extend through march 26 easter sunday 
eta an acronym for homeland and liberty in the basque language 
has killed more than 600 people in its 20year violent campaign to 
secure independence for the threeprovince spanish basque country 
known as euskadi 
we have come here today also to make clear our clear desire for 
reconciliation ardanza said we dont want a divided 
conflictive society we dont want victors or vanquished 
there were no reports of incidents during the march that was 
supported by organizations ranging from leftist trade unions to the 
red cross 
on jan 15 the government of socialist prime minister felipe 
gonzalez resumed talks in algeria with exiled eta leader eugenio 
antxon etxeveste in algeria in an attempt to get eta to give up 
its weapons 
it was not immediately clear what impact the march might have on 
the ceasefire or the talks 
political observers interpreted wide support shown for the march 
as a symbol of the growing public rejection of separatist terrorism 
since the major basque parties in the basque regional parliament 
signed a pact against terrorism on jan 19 1988

cloth napkins and flowers which he said are just as important as 
the food 
its all part of the book and the cook an annual promotion 
sponsored by the city and the philadelphia convention and visitors 
bureau the city is alone in its approach but backers say others

participating 
a visiting chef collaborates with a restaurants to come up with a 
dish not normally found on the menu

literature listing locations and chefs rates the menus with dollar

a year before julius and ethel 
rosenberg were executed for spying pablo picasso did a lithograph 
of the couple to raise money for their legal defense 
dozens of artists since then have been moved by the life and 
death of the rosenbergs who in 1953 became the only americans ever 
executed for espionage after they refused to confess to helping the 
soviets get atomic bomb secrets and were convicted of conspiracy 
a collection of 59 works by picasso and other artists from the 
1950s to the 1980s is touring the country in an exhibition titled 
unknown secrets art and the rosenberg era 
theres still an ongoing controversy there are still 
questions said randy ploog assistant curator at pennsylvania 
state universitys palmer museum of art where the show was 
scheduled to open sunday in the fourth of its nine stops 
rob a okun who organized the exhibit said that even though the 
rosenbergs were arrested nearly 40 years ago a number of galleries 
and museums balked at showing the controversial works i did have 
more difficulty placing the show than i thought he said 
in a telephone interview from his home in montague mass okun 
said he began looking for art relating to the rosenbergs in 1985 
with a halfdozen names supplied by robert meeropol one of the 
rosenbergs two sons who is a friend of okuns 
the artwork of the rosenberg era serves as a visual diary of 
one of the most horrific political events of the 1950s okun wrote 
in a book that accompanies the exhibit 
i wanted to raise the issue that artists can effectively 
address social and political issues in their art and have it be good 
art he said 
okun found art relating to the rosenbergs from the united states 
mexico sweden holland germany italy and france all of it 
sympathetic to the couple he also asked contemporary artists to do 
new works about the couple 
picassos lithograph is a simple flattering dual portrait of the 
rosenbergs but most of the other works in the exhibition are more 
directly political portraying the couple as scapegoats or martyrs 
or as an example of an unjust government 
french artist fernand legers 1952 silkscreen liberty peace 
solidarity shows the rosenbergs with a dove between them 
in alex grays 1987 work in memory of julius and ethel 
rosenberg two goat skulls hang on a canvas shaped in the star of 
david an american flag fills the canvas and covers the goat heads 
in karen atkinsons 1987 era after era pictures of events 
such as a ku klux klan rally and an atomic bomb explosion are placed 
on a map of the world where they occurred a picture of the 
rosenbergs is placed above new york state 
okun said he could not find any art that was not sympathetic to 
the couple 
my personal opinion is that they were framed that they were 
the most severely treated victims of a dark time in our history 
he said 
meeropol who was 6 when his parents were executed and is now an 
attorney in springfield mass said they continue to evoke strong 
images because they never confessed 
their refusal is what made them powerful he said 
after the exhibit closes here it will travel to the university 
of colorado art gallery in boulder opening june 8 installation 
gallery in san diego sept 8 san francisco jewish community 
museum jan 7 1990 spertus museum of judaica in chicago may 21 
1990 and aspen art museum sept 20 1990

a former supermarket clerk trying to 
rise to fame with a sport called turkey bowling that he says he 
invented has ruffled some feathers at the company that sells 
butterball brand turkeys 
executives at chicagobased swifteckrich are mad because every 
time derrick johnson of santa ana shows up on television to bowl 
a frozen turkey at 2liter plastic soda bottles his bird of choice 
is a 12pound butterball 
johnson who thought up the pastime one night while stocking 
turkeys at a supermarket has demonstrated turkey bowling on 
national television including the syndicated arsenio hall show 
and cbss sunday morning 
but swifteckrich told johnson in a terse fourparagraph letter 
last month to stop using its turkeys because it damages the 
butterball quality image that we have spent millions of dollars to 
develop 
the company threatened johnson with a lawsuit and said it may 
seek a court order to force him to quit using butterballs and may 
also seek damages 
but johnson 29 a former los angeles rams cheerleader and 
chippendales nightclub dancer refuses to abandon turkey bowling 
no way johnson said friday this is my ticket into the big 
time if swifteckrich wants me to stop all they have to do is 
write me a check better yet why dont they hire me as their west 
coast spokesman apparently ive done more to spread their name and 
reputation than all their highpriced pr guys 
people ask why i dont use another turkey johnson said 
listen i love butterballs thats all we had when i was growing 
up lets just say i am a loyal customer 
he said he is too busy promoting his sport and himself to worry 
about a lawsuit he said he already has endorsements from a 
sportswear and shoe company 
he also is working with a local market to put on grocery 
games to raise money to buy food for the homeless 
this is the sport of the 90s johnson said i can see it 
now the party invitation will read byob bring your own bird

claude montana gave the starring role to enormous 
soft collars and corolla shapes in his winter readytowear show 
saturday that was an exercise in restrained beauty 
this influential designer switches gears regularly moving from 
football shoulders to pyramid shapes but switching to soft lines in 
winter collections 
the clothes were not very feminine but in just a few perfect 
shades and fabrics they were so well constructed that the fashion 
world took notice 
for the early 1990s futuristic montana kicked off with a line of 
every imaginable subtle shade of blue pairing slim petrol blue 
cuffed pants with glacier or deep blue belted peignoir tulipwrapped 
coats 
the collars were outsized and oval or flounced in waves down the 
front sleeves were often flared like bluebells 
the most amazing toppers here also in everything from sky or 
ice blue to aqua or spotted like ocelot were in dyed sheared mink 
it looked like iridescent plush and appeared in handsome hooded 
boleros ponchos or puffy shrugs 
besides the important collar styles montana also went in for a 
tinybusted silhouette with a swelling around the hips which he 
dubbed a peanut shape a sort of weird variation on the 
redingote coat or jacket 
skirts didnt appear often but when they did they were long and 
straight worn with tights in matching shades 
browns from mahogany to peanut and charcoal or black with 
suggestions of other shades like green or rust completed the 
lowkeyed color palette 
japanese designer issey miyake as usual was interested in 
sculpting or shaping his fabrics in outfits that ended up looking 
more like art than clothes 
his zigzag line of brown or blue knits turned out with 
pleated and pointed effects 
he gave stiffened square outlines and collars to some of his long 
raincoats and the hats were folded into points to look like paper 
gliders 
this time his synthetic silk chinese lanternpleated fabric was 
molded so that the models moved along jerkily like automatons 
guy paulin turned to the past for his inspiration but it was 
nothing baroque or fancy choosing rather the sleek vein of greta 
garbo he began with a nice line of clothes inspired by garbos film 
queen christina 
in heather and misty blue plaids knickers and long pants were 
topped by loose and long vests or short coats with natural 
shoulders full and long tweed skirts under full doublecaped short 
coats had a nice easy trapeze style 
the lowkey but wearable day clothes also featured good 
cableknit twin sets with sandy tweed pants offwhite jackets with 
paisley linings soft jersey pants suits in teal taupe and rust 
things were a lot more feminine at balenciaga as the designer 
michel goma featured a lot of dressy evening wear 
he offset the autumnal shades and androgynous tendencies seen in 
the rest of the days shows with a screaminghot line of red taffeta 
lace and chiffon

a hundred animal lovers demonstrated saturday 
against the slaughter of baby seals off newfoundlands north coast 
saying it is worse now than when it was made illegal in 1982 
hunters have shifted their sights to pups older than nine days 
since the 1982 legislation prohibited killing of white coats 
seals under that age said a spokesman for demonstrators from 
montreal ottawa and toronto who marched peacefully around 
parliament building 
that makes it even worse said stephen best of toronto vice 
president of the international wildlife coalition that organized the 
protest 
where the white coats were taken on the pan ice around the 
north shore of newfoundland and just about all that were killed were 
harvested the hunt now is mainly at sea where its estimated three 
pups have to be killed for every one got into the boats 
now its on the open seas where it is almost impossible to 
regulate there arent any inspectors or scientists out there 
nobody knows whats going on he said 
the harvest which bottomed out at 20000 seals a year right 
after the legislation was enacted since has risen to 80000 best 
said 
he also said the government issues 9000 licenses a season to 
hunt seals compared to 5000 before the legislation the government 
quota for this season is 186000 harp seals and 2340 hooded seals 
he said 
we thought we had won in 1982 and so did everyone else best 
recalls but we didnt win we lost now weve got to start all 
over again

president bush met with key cabinet members 
saturday to consider whether to enter a joint agreement with japan 
to produce a new generation of fighter plane and a decision is 
expected early in the week his press secretary said 
among those summoned to the white house for an unusual saturday 
working session were secretary of state james a baker iii treasury 
secretary nicholas brady commerce secretary robert mosbacher chief 
of staff john sununu national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
newly confirmed defense secretary richard cheney 
bush is considering a proposed joint venture with the japanese 
for production in japan of a new version of the f16 jet fighter 
called the fsx 
bush on saturday laughed and waved off a question on whether he 
had made a decision about the project when he happened upon a small 
group of reporters who were chatting with first lady barbara bush at 
the white house 
in remarks to reporters on friday he sought to play down earlier 
suggestions that a basic commitment had been made to the project 
with only details remaining to be worked out 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush called his team to the 
white house saturday because he wanted to review some of the 
technical issues 
he said bushs decision probably would come early next week 
bush has been studying data on the controversial proposal which 
critics say would give the japanese advanced us technical data a 
move that would undercut the us industrial and trade base 
bushs advisers are known to be divided on the merits of the 
deal mosbacher has taken the lead in raising concerns over 
commercial and technological implications of the agreement which 
was negotiated by the pentagon and state department 
under the usjapan deal initialed late last year st 
louisbased general dynamics would join forces with japans 
mitsubishi heavy industries to codevelop and coproduce the 
nextgeneration fighter 
proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the 
united states could negotiate in the face of japanese opposition to 
buying f16s directly from the united states they say the deal 
would serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both 
directions while generating income and jobs for us industry 
but critics contend the tentative arrangement amounts to a 
giveaway of advanced technology that japan may use to help propel 
its civilian aircraft industry into headtohead competition with 
the united states in the world market they say tokyo should 
purchase americanmade planes to help offset the 50 billion us 
trade deficit with japan 
while the president worked and played tennis and horseshoes on a 
balmy afternoon first lady barbara bush was preoccupied with her 
dog millies new litter born friday night and early saturday 
by the time mrs bush was ready to play tennis with supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor at midafternoon the sky had clouded 
and a blustery rain was falling 
but mrs bush said the family had lunch at poolside earlier 
bush had said friday that he was eager to unleash all the 
athletic events for the weekend at the white house 
his new horseshoe pit was to be formally opened in a couple of 
weeks with what bush called a very big gala opening featuring 
horseshoe pitchers from across the country 
bush said he was also expecting to pick up his outdoor running 
again he has been using an indoor treadmill he said he had a 
hiatus from his usual twomile jog in recent weeks because he 
had the flu

the head of a un office in 
afghanistan said saturday that the pact that ended the soviet 
military involvement in the nation has been breached but he would 
not say who committed them or what they were 
the comments came on the same day as at least four soviet il76 
military transports arrived in kabul the soviets which completed 
its troop withdrawal last month resumed military aid to the 
government last week 
the un official maj gen rauli helminen said pakistan and 
afghanistan have repeatedly charged each other with violating the 
accord but their complaints have often proved inaccurate others 
are difficult to check he told a news conference

after nine years in afghanistan

there are problems after 11 months more than half of our 
mandate remains unfulfilled said helminen who is from finland

thousands 
of moslems paraded through salman rushdies hometown saturday 
demanding a judicial inquiry into the police killings of 13 people 
during a protest against rushdies novel the satanic verses 
in france authorities in lyon banned a demonstration planned 
saturday afternoon to protest the novel saying the march threatened 
public order 
irans staterun media on saturday said moslem leaders 
condemnation of rushdie last week was a victory for iran even 
though the leaders stopped short of supporting irans call for 
rushdies death as punishment for the book which many moslems find 
blasphemous 
also saturday britains ambassador to lebanon said the 
controversy over the satanic verses may not have hurt prospects 
for the release of 15 foreign hostages there 
in the 10milelong bombay march young moslems waving black 
banners and shouting down with bombay police tried to surge 
ahead but older men held them back while steelhelmeted policemen 
stood along the road watching silently 
all shops had closed along the processions route and traffic had 
thinned thousands of armed policemen in riot gear followed the 
procession 
during a demonstration feb 24 police opened fire to stop 
defiant moslems from marching to the british consulate killing 13 
people the crowd was demanding a ban in britain on rushdies book 
nineteen people in india and pakistan have died in violence 
related to the novel 
bombayborn rushdie is a british citizen who maintains that his 
book is neither against islam nor its holy book the koran iranian 
clerics last month offered a 52 million reward for rushdies 
murder and he has been in hiding since 
the satanic verses banned in india and several other 
nations includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of 
mohammeds wives and the suggestion that the prophet wrote the koran 
rather than receiving it fromn allah 
irans official tehran radio said saturday hailed the decisive 
stance taken by leaders at the meeting of the 45nation 
organization of islamic conference at the meeting which ended 
thursday in saudi arabia the members voted to declare rushdie an 
apostate 
the conference did not confirm khomeinis death sentence as iran 
hoped but iranian news commentaries played down that fact and said 
declaring rushdie an apostate was tantamount to confirming 
khomeinis death sentence 
the islamic republic news agency also monitored in nicosia said 
that the conference decision made headlines in all the iranian 
papers each callin the organizations declaration a victory for 
iran and islam 
iran severed ties with britain earlier this month over what it 
saw as londons role for protecting rushdie and leading the european 
reaction against iran 
the 12 members of the european economic community recalled their 
ambassadors from tehran to protest iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis execution order against rushdie 
the british ambassador in beirut allan ramsay said in an 
interview with the british broadcasting corp that although many 
felt the rushdie affair set back prospects for release of the 
foreign hostages i am not sure that is correct 
i was encouraged i must say by the statements made by some 
leading moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms 
that there is no reason to continue holding hostages this is very 
much a crime against islam ramsay said 
but he warned i do not want to raise release hopes and i do 
not want to sound overoptimistic 
fifteen foreigners including nine americans are being held in 
lebanon by proiranian islamic fundamentialists american terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
is the longestheld he was kidnapped march 16 1985

live on the edge of poverty but this is our country we have to 
save it for ourselves and our children union chairman jozef slisz 
told 450 farmers from every region of the country 
slisz said the congress must ensure authorities keep a promise to 
legalize rural solidarity and that the union must prepare for 
national elections of the union in december 
the meeting took place before the end of talks between 
authorities and the opposition which have yielded agreement in 
principle to legalize solidarity rural solidarity and the 
independent students association 
all three were banned after martial law was introduced december 
1981 parliament will consider draft legislation tuesday to legalize 
them again 
during those eight years which we spent in prison or in 
hiding we did not forget the ideals of solidarity some of our 
colleagues paid with their lives slisz reminded members and some 
50 invited foreigners and advisers 
we can meet again after eight years thanks to mr walesa 
thanks to his persistence and determination he is the symbol of 
solidarity for cities and villages he said of lech walesa leader 
of the allied workers union solidarity

meet and decide about your own activities he told cheering

helped clarify things walesa told reporters afterward 
the meeting came as the talks near their final phase and a day 
after the union declared a crisis over the authorities decision to 
submit an electoral reform bill to parliament without consulting the 
opposition

for what would be the communist blocs first democratic elections 
the government late friday said it only wanted parliament to 
discuss the bill not prejudge any agreement 
wladyslaw frasyniuk the powerful solidarity leader from silesia 
said saturday he did not think the conflict would derail final 
agreement on political and economic reforms 
i cannot see such a possibility in which this accord would not 
take place he said

disclosures of detailed warnings in europe 
before the bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland have prompted 
calls for new investigations and appeals for more government 
openness about terrorist threats 
a congressional subcommittee analysis of federal aviation 
administration security warnings due for release sunday will show 
that many faa warnings are woefully inadequate according to a 
committee staff member 
transportation secretary samuel skinner dispatched top aides to 
europe this weekend to examine the growing controversy over the 
warnings and to determine the safety of us airlines from terrorist 
attack 
and some of the relatives of the 270 people killed in the dec 
21 disaster planned a white house protest april 3 the 103rd day 
after the bombing 
bert ammerman the brother of one of those killed pleaded id 
like the opportunity to make my own decison on whether i die on a 
plane or not 
the latest actions follow revelations and discussions in london 
and washington about very specific warnings that airlines and 
government officials were sharing in europe and the united states in 
the weeks before the bombing over lockerbie scotland 
none of the information got to passengers 
pan am after it did warn passengers of a bomb threat against a 
new yorkparis flight last week said it has a longstanding policy 
of advising travelers and giving them the option of taking other 
flights when there is a specific threat against an individual flight 
the lockerbie disaster was not preceded by any reported threat 
that named a specific plane 
but disclosures over the past several weeks indicate that 
authorities had several other warnings including what airline and 
flights might be endangered in what month the bombing could occur 
what type of explosive and triggering device might be used and even 
how the bomb might be concealed in a radiocassette 
investigators concluded that a radiocassette containing plastic 
explosives set to go off at a certain altitude blew up pan am flight 
103 
both british aviation authorities and the federal aviation 
administration had described a radiocassette bomb in security 
warnings a month earlier after one was confiscated in a raid in 
west germany on the syrianbacked popular front for the liberation 
of palestinegeneral command 
pan am acknowledges that it received a warning about such a 
device from the west german government on nov 10 
various other warnings that have elements similar to what 
occurred in the pan am bombing also were issued dec 5 to all 
airlines dec 13 to us embassies nov 17 to us airlines nov 
22 to british airlines and dec 19 to british airports and several 
airlines some of the warnings including the final one two days 
before the bombing were not received for several days 
although investigators apparently have focused much of their 
attention on the palestinian guerrilla group which was the subject 
of some of the warnings british officials said friday that contrary 
to london press reports they had not captured or identified any 
suspected bomber 
on capitol hill where several committees have been examining 
issues raised by the destruction of flight 103 house government 
operations subcommittee staff members were compiling 27 faa security 
warnings issued in 1988 and another four this year most of them not 
made public 
the subcommittee planned to look into how each one was handled 
who was warned when they were warned and how the government and 
airlines dealt with the threats a subcommitee source said 
discussing the report on condition of anonymity 
we are looking at their accuracy timeliness and usefulness 
the source said 
the report is to focus particularly on the nov 17 warning 
dealing with a radiocassette bomb the source said subcommittee 
chairwoman rep cardiss collins dill decided to conduct the 
analysis because there of confusion about the warnings and a host of 
complaints from victims relatives and others 
ammerman a new jersey high school administrator who was one of 
about 20 victims relatives who met with skinner said the families 
are calling for a ban on all batteries on airliners because plastic 
explosives cannot be set off without a battery 
the group also wants a system set up so passengers can call a 
number and find out about any threats more efforts to match luggage 
with passengers and routine questioning of passengers as they board 
flights 
at best this has been handled in a chaotic way said 
ammerman whose brother tom was killed in the bombing at worst 
theres been a coverup

maryland has a state fish a state bird a 
state dog a state butterfly it even has a state fossil shell 
but what is arguably marylands most popular member of the animal 
kingdom at least among diners is nowhere to be found in the list 
of official state symbols 
the house constitutional and administrative law committee voted 
saturday to correct that oversight approving a bill by democratic 
delegate dana dembrow designating the maryland blue crab as the 
official state crustacean 
now only the approval of the house the senate and gov william 
donald schaefer are needed to allow the crab to take its rightful 
place alongside the rockfish the baltimore oriole the chesapeake 
bay retriever the baltimore checkerspot butterfly and the ecphora 
quadricostata on the list of state symbols 
incidentally the ecphora quadricostata inhabitated the 
chesapeake bay and other east coast tidal waters 5 million or more 
years ago and lives on as the state fossil

a 36step pencil sharpener devised by 
the home team won the rube goldberg machine contest on saturday by 
making a simple task hard 
goldberg who died in 1970 was a cartoonist famous for his 
humorously complicated machines to perform simple tasks in keeping 
with his spirit student teams from three universities invented 
machines designed to sharpen a wooden pencil in less than five 
minutes with at least 25 steps 
purdue university engineering students won with a contraption 
called watchnponder in part because unlike the entries from 
the university of detroit and the university of wisconsin at 
madison no one had to nudge and prod their machine to the finish 
line 
the watchnponder was set in motion by placing a test paper in 
the hand of a doll dressed like a student which activated a panic 
sign thirtysomeodd steps later a newly sharpened pencil fell 
through a series of guides into the arms of the doll who then 
exclaimed with a cartoonstyle caption whew thanks 
a 100 secondplace prize went to the university of wisconsin 
team for bucky badgers hydroelectromechanical allpurpose 
pencil sharpener the badger is the wisconsin school symbol 
the rube goldberg machine contest originated at purdue in 1949 as 
a competition between two engineering fraternities it died out in 
the mid50s but was revived six years ago and opened to all purdue 
students 
this year was the first national competition which drew the 
entries from detroit and wisconsin some other schools held local 
contests but didnt send teams here organizers said

a teamsters official threatened on saturday to 
expand the eastern airlines strike to rival pan american while 
union leaders discussed ways for employees to buy both carriers in 
the opportunity of a lifetime 
eastern employees rallied in washington new jersey and new york 
where gov mario cuomo threw his support behind the workers and 
challenged president bush to intervene in the labor war with eastern 
boss frank lorenzo 
easterns 8500 machinists entered their third week on strike 
which has crippled the nations seventhlargest airline and forced 
it to seek bankruptcy protection the workers have refused to give 
wage concessions 
and a top teamsters official warned that the strike could be 
expanded to struggling pan am which competes with eastern on the 
bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle route 
one of the strike targets would be the shuttle of pan 
american where eastern airlines is now being picketed said 
william f genoese director of the teamsters air division 
therefore we could tie up the northeast corridor of the united 
states 
the strike at eastern airlines is a fight for every working 
person in the united states 
federal judges have restrained other unions from sympathy strikes 
that could have extended to the nations railways and other 
airlines but genoese said a pan am strike would be legal because 
its 4200 teamsters employees have an open contract and other unions 
could honor their picket lines as pilots and flight attendants have 
done at eastern 
pan american has beefed up its shuttle service since easterns 
strike began march 4 while eastern dropped fares to attract 
passengers to its shuttle flights 
genoese said he didnt want to discuss strike timing or strategy 
further 
meanwhile rallies in washington new york and newark launched 
the third week of the walkout 
a crowd estimated by police at more than 1000 turned out for a 
rousing flagwaving rally at new yorks laguardia airport gov 
mario cuomo wearing a black satin pilots jacket and a pilots cap 
challenged president bush to intervene in the labor war with lorenzo 
focus your thousand points of light on this situation its 
time to lead mr president he said 
in washington about 300 people gathered across the street from 
the white house to hear similar remarks aimed at bush who was 
reported to be relaxing on the white house grounds playing 
horseshoes and tennis 
cmon george get with it said interntional association of 
machinists president william winpisinger pointing at the white 
house he called for bush to intervene by naming an emergency board 
to mediate the dispute 
bush declined to impose a coolingoff period that would have 
delayed the strike by 60 days and has remained opposed to 
government intervention in the walkout that began march 3 
jesse jackson who has been walking picket lines with the 
strikers in the past two weeks said he was making an appeal to 
presidential leadership an appeal for mercy and justice 
in newark a crowd estimated at about 700 people attended a rally 
in front of the continental airlines terminal that was cut short by 
torrential rains 
genoese made his comments after having breakfast saturday with 
charles e bryan head of easterns machinists union and local 
teamsters and machinists officials to discuss strategy including a 
proposed joint employee buyout that would combine the two struggling 
airlines 
this is the opportunity of a lifetime genoese said they 
can save two airlines 
bryan has been pushing several years for employee control of 
eastern as a solution to its problems and genoese said easterns 
situation provides an opening to combine that goal with a similar 
effort he has pushed for years at pan am 
bryan said the employees had ample financial backing but 
declined to give details 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the company wouldnt comment 
on the bryangenoese remarks there was no answer saturday at pan am 
corporate headquarters 
although eastern and pan am are two of the weakest major 
carriers bryan and genoese said their route structures and 
personnel combined could create a strong stable airline 
bryan added that other possibilities are still being explored 
such as a buyout of lorenzo by financier carl icahn owner and 
chairman of trans world airlines inc lorenzo has expressed renewed 
interest in selling eastern 
pan am like eastern has been racked by financial losses and 
labor tensions pan am chairman tom plaskett recently said the 
carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure 
its survival 
in a memo circulated friday eastern said it could no longer wait 
for its pilots to return to work 
new pilots are our only viable option the message said in 
summary total pilot capacity will determine whether eastern lives 
or dies 
however the pilots union says few experienced pilots are 
available for eastern to hire 
eastern with only 200 pilots crossing picket lines has been 
able to operate about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1040 
daily flights 
bryan said the eastern unions will fight in bankruptcy court 
against all sales and transfers of eastern assets including the 
airlines notice late last week that it was putting narrowbody 
planes in its 250aircraft fleet up for sale 
he said transfers of assets such as eastern landing slots in new 
york and washington to texas airs predominantly nonunion 
continental are part of an enormous psychological war against 
eastern employees

of support for the palestinian rebellion in the west bank and gaza 
strip

flags waved tears of pride 
flowed and a spontaneous rendition of the national anthem broke out 
in the desert dawn saturday among the 450000 people who watched the 
return of the space shuttle discovery 
im just fascinated by it said bob dube 34 of canyon 
country calif a veteran of the temporary encampments that spring 
up on rogers dry lake here for landings of the winged spacecraft 
the crowd many of whom arrived earlier in the week burst out in 
whistles and cheers at the thump of two sonic booms that preceded 
discoverys arrival over this mojave desert base 60 miles north of 
los angeles 
about two minutes later the ship appeared seemingly straight 
overhead as a speck glinting in the dawn sunlight most lapsed into 
surprised silence at the shuttles steep descent but the 
celebration resumed as discovery landed on a strip about five miles 
distant at 635 am pst 
spectators clapped whooped snapped pictures and waved american 
flags many spontaneously began singing the national anthem some 
cried others hugged their children 
the patriotic spirit here is really something said ernie 
weiss 70 of garden grove who flew a flag atop a telescoping 
60foot pole i even bought a new flag for this 
nasa officials estimated the crowd at the public viewing area at 
450000 and said an additional 10000 watched at the nasa facility 
that was second only to the 500000 who joined president reagan to 
watch shuttle columbias july 4 1982 landing 
shortly after landing the estimated 138000 motorhomes cars and 
trucks jammed the two narrow onelane blacktop roads that led to 
the nearest highway 30 miles from the vewing site 
remembering the fivehour traffic jam that followed the last 
landing dube was one of hundreds poised for a quick getaway and 
was on the road right after the shuttle touched down 
its saturday if it was a work day id hang around a little 
longer he said 
spectators began gathering earlier in the week to stake out prime 
viewing spots the came in flagbedecked motorhomes aboard 
motorcycles and in cars pulling travel trailers 
as many as 300 people who arrived after roads to the base were 
closed simply pulled off the highway and drove onto the desert to 
watch the landing several got stuck or damaged their axles when 
they accidentally drove into holes in the desert hardpan 
on friday the strains of country music blared over loudspeakers 
at the makeshift campground as military helicopters buzzed overhead 
and skateboarders rattled across the hardened lake bed

taking part in a smear campaign against it but the military denied 
the charge 
ruben zamora coordinator of the democratic convergence said

heeded an order from attorney general roberto garcia not to air any 
call to boycott the election 
there were no new reports of rebel attacks overnight but the 
guerrillas maintained a ban on public transportation and sabotaged 
electrical power affecting the water supply in some places 
voters who defy a rebel boycott will have a chance to replace an 
incumbent government with a different philosophy for the first time 
in their history 
they will be looking for someone who can bring an end to nine 
years of civil war that left 70000 dead and who can right a 
crippled economy that has an unemployment and underemployment rate 
of 60 percent

arenas free market economics and tough stance against the 
guerrillas to the leftwing alliance which is linked to the 
farabundo marti national liberation front

professor who spent seven years in exile as head of the democratic 
revolutionary front which is allied with the guerrillas

organizations denied a newspaper report that it predicted victory 
for cristiani

the space shuttle discovery 
plunged out of space to a desert landing at dawn saturday ending an 
almost flawless mission that included completion of nasas satellite 
communication system 
well done discovery thats one to be proud of capsule 
communicator frank culbertson said 
the shuttle bearing a fiveman crew four crippled rats 32 
fertilized chicken eggs and other experiments landed on schedule at 
636 am on a paved runway on rogers dry lake watched by a 
nearrecord 460000 spectators 
nasa and the countrys happy this morning its a beautiful day 
in california rear adm richard h truly the space agencys 
associate administrator said after discovery touched down 
its marvelous people can come out on such a pretty morning and 
watch it truly added i think the country realizes were back 
the landing looked perfect as promised from orbit when shuttle 
commander michael l coats a veteran navy aircraft carrier pilot 
radioed 3 wire to mission control he referred to the best 
arresting cable for a plane to snag when landing on the deck of a 
carrier 
nasa television closeups of the shuttle after its 
19millionmile trip showed numerous white marks on the black 
thermal tiles that protect the shuttles underside from the heat of 
reentry 
but truly described the damage as a few minor chips 
the vehicle is just as clean as it can be truly said at a 
postlanding news conference 
in december the shuttle atlantis suffered severe tile damage 
when it was hit by insulation falling off a booster rocket and fuel 
tank during the launch 
about seven hours after discovery landed the astronauts and 
their wives arrived in houston where they were greeted by their 
children and a cheering crowd of about 500 people 
coats told the crowd of friends fellow nasa workers and space 
program fans that he had an awful lot to be thankful for and an 
awful lot to be proud of 
all the crew members praised nasa employees for getting the 
shuttle program back on track and for discoverys performance 
it was an awful lot of fun being out in space said astronaut 
robert c springer who added that all the crew members had waited a 
long time to fly 
the fiveday missions main objective deployment of nasas third 
tracking and data relay satellite was accomplished monday the day 
discovery was launched from kennedy space center at cape canaveral 
fla results of a variety of experiments carried out by the crew 
awaited scientific analysis 
the four rats with intentionally injured leg bones were killed 
about four hours after landing as were four others in a control 
group kept on the ground nasa spokeswoman terri sindelar said the 
dead rodents were sent to orthopaedic hospital in los angeles for 
analysis she said 
the eggs were destined for an analysis of weightlessness on 
embryo development the student experiment was sponsored by kentucky 
fried chicken 
the eggs are in wonderful shape none are cracked none are 
broken said company spokesman richard detwiler he said half the 
eggs were opened for study immediately while the remainder were 
being flown to company headquarters in louisville ky one of the 16 
allowed to hatch will go to the louisville zoo while purdue 
university scientists will study the others 
the crew of coats pilot john e blaha and mission specialists 
james f buchli james p bagian and springer also shot miles of 
film with a 70mm imax camera to document environmental damage on 
earth 
their last day began with a wakeup call from ground controllers 
that included recordings of their children saying such things as 
get up dad get out of bed get to work the astronauts 
responded with a recording of simon and garfunkels homeward 
bound 
other experiments included growing plants in microgravity plus 
growing protein crystals in a project aimed at developing new drugs 
discoverys flight was the 28th shuttle mission and the third 
since the shuttle challenger exploded after launch on jan 28 1986 
killing its seven astronauts 
the crowd that watched the landing was second in size only to the 
500000 who joined thenpresident reagan in watching columbia touch 
down on july 4 1982 good weather a weekend landing and the start 
of spring vacation combined to more than double the anticipated 
crowd said nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato 
the 100million tdrs the third satellite placed in orbit 
completed the space agencys vital shuttle communications system 
which allows nearconstant communication between shuttles and ground 
controllers the relay system also shortens what used to be a 
15minute blackout during the heat of reentry to about three 
minutes 
the system also will allow nasa to shut down six ground stations 
at an annual savings of 13 million 
the only major hitch of the flight occurred tuesday when one of 
three hydrogen tanks feeding the fuel cells that generate 
electricity for the shuttle developed erratic pressure unnecessary 
lights and computers were shut off and controllers considered ending 
the flight a day early but by wednesday the problem had been 
corrected 
the several miles of film shot with the imax camera will be made 
into a movie documenting ocean pollution flooding in africa burned 
areas of the florida everglades and western united states 
deforestation in brazil and erupting volcanoes in southeast asia 
and south america 
nasa had several options for landing depending on the weather 
if there had been a good cross wind discovery would have landed 
on the hard clay lake bed runway to test crosswind handling 
but wind died so the bases 15000footlong 300footwide paved 
runway was used so that tests of moderate brake pressure could be 
conducted 
the landing tests are intended to enable a resumption of landings 
on the concrete runway at kennedy space center eliminating the need 
to ferry shuttles back from edwards atop a boeing 747

italys large communist party announced saturday it 
will form a shadow government to convince voters it could 
effectively govern the country 
achille occhetto party secretary said the shadow government 
will be composed of both communist party officials and intellectuals 
or other specialists and it will put forth policy and 
governmental proposals 
occhetto outlined the proposal in a speech opening the 18th 
congress of the italian communist party or pci which is the 
countrys secondlargest party but has suffered a steady slide in 
votes 
occhetto who took the party reins last summer called for a 
change in the composition of italys government which for four 
decades has been dominated by the conservative christian democrats 
while the communists have been kept out of governing coalitions 
he appealed for new alliances with roman catholic groups and with 
lay parties particularly the four parties in the current governing 
coalition led by the christian democrats 
he also said the increasingly popular green party should look 
beyond ecological issues and team with parties committed to 
widespread reform 
turning to foreign affairs occhetto said the communists had a 
clear commitment to italys alliances with the west particularly 
nato 
at the same time he said we want to develop in a more open 
and rich way a policy of dialogue and collaboration with the 
party of soviet president mikhail gorbachev and with other 
communist parties committed to the democratization of the countries 
they govern 
the italian communist party broke with the soviet union in the 
1970s and has since pursued its own course which included an effort 
to rule with the christian democrats in the mid70s occhetto 
suggested saturday that that effort known as the historic 
compromise was mistaken 
the party has declined steadily in the polls over the past 
decade winning just 266 percent of the vote in parliamentary 
elections in 1987 after nearly overtaking the christian democrats in 
1976 
communist party members gathered in a rome convention hall 
applauded occhetto when he called for the political rehabilitation 
of alexander dubcek the former czechoslovak communist party leader 
who introduced the illfated prague spring reforms 
dubcek was invited to the congress but czechoslovak authorities 
did not grant him a visa

antiapartheid leaders in 
soweto say a prolonged rent boycott is likely to continue until the 
vast black township is unified economically and politically with 
neighboring johannesburg 
a committee of activists including anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu concluded in a new report that soweto will never be able to 
pay off a 300 million debt accumulated since most families stopped 
paying rent and service charges in 1986 
the committee is urging the whitecontrolled government to write 
off the debt and create a single tax base for johannesburg and 
soweto so money spent by blacks in johannesburg can be returned to 
their own community for development and services 
no development policy for soweto will succeed until 
johannesburg and soweto are treated as one urban economy said the 
rev frank chikane chairman of the sevenmember committee at a 
news conference thursday 
chikane generalsecretary of the south african council of 
churches said the proposal represents a fundamental challenge to 
apartheid because a unified economy would entail a unified political 
entity 
the demand is actually for a normal country with normal 
cities he said the system must be deracialized 
an estimated 25 million blacks live in soweto the countrys 
largest municipality the white population of johannesburg and its 
adjacent suburbs is about 600000 
the rent boycott launched to press grievances against the 
government has evolved into one of the most effective forms of 
protest available to blacks under the 33monthold state of 
emergency 
authorites have used numerous tactics in futile attempts to break 
the boycott including latenight eviction raids such as one in 
august 1986 that led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a clash 
with police 
chikanes committee said the soweto town council should write off 
rental arrears owed by householders implement affordable service 
charges and establish a formula for transferring ownership of 
rented homes to longterm occupants 
a study released by the committee said sowetans spend 400 
million annually in johannesburg generating tax revenue that 
benefits white residents without returning to soweto 
according to the study businesses provide about 70 percent of 
johannesburgs tax revenue enabling white homeowners to pay lower 
service fees than sowetans yet get better services 
compared to johannesburg soweto has only a handful of licensed 
businesses the most common businesses in the township are 
unlicensed grocery stores and pubs which pay no taxes 
chikanes committee already has met with the soweto town council 
and hopes to arrange a further meeting the activists also want to 
confer with the johannesburg city council 
soweto mayor sam mkhwanazi has surprised the activists by 
acknowledging their influence in the community the committee 
includes the generalsecretary of the black miners union cyril 
ramaphosa and albertina sisulu wife of jailed african national 
congress leader walter sisulu

new security orders have been issued to all of 
britains major airports a manchester airport spokesman said 
saturday the orders came amid controversy over warnings received 
before the december bombing of pan am flight 103 
the british news media said it was believed the new directive 
requires passengers to remove all electric and electronic equipment 
from luggage before checkin and to pack such items in hand luggage 
to be examined at boarding gates 
investigators have said the bomb that blew up flight 103 on dec 
21 over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people on the plane and 
11 on the ground was concealed in a radiocassette player 
a manchester airport spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping 
with british practice said the orders were received friday night 
but he could not give details because it was a security matter 
the department of transport would not say if a new directive had 
been sent but it reaffirmed a feb 18 message that advised all 
airlines using british airports to begin asking travelers if their 
baggage contained radios computers or such equipment and then to 
examine the items for possible explosives 
the message did not say if examined items should be carried as 
hand baggage or be checked through with other luggage 
the conservative party government of prime minister margaret 
thatcher came under renewed attack saturday for its handling of a 
bomb warning before flight 103 blew up 
it was disclosed friday that the transport department had 
prepared a warning dated dec 19 that included photographs of a bomb 
disguised in a radiocassette player but it did not mail the 
advisory until after christmas 
transport secretary paul channon said the advice was of little 
importance because similar information had been disseminated a month 
earlier by the us federal aviation administration and by west 
germany 
flight 103 originated in west germany and changed planes at 
londons heathrow airport before departing for new york 
early editions of two sunday newspapers the observer and the 
sunday telegraph said the dec 19 warning carried several details 
that would have helped security people spot a rigged radiocassette 
player 
the sunday telegraph quoted channon as saying yes maybe the 
security information contained in the december 19 letter should have 
been sent out by telex the reason this was not done was because the 
crucial element of the message consisted of a color photograph of a 
possible explosive device 
the opposition labor party on saturday repeated its request for 
an independent inquiry into the flight 103 disaster john prescott

searchers who followed 
directions given by executed killer ted bundy have found bones and 
the tattered remnant of a blouse near a site where bundy said he 
buried a 17yearold girl he killed in 1974 
wayne county sheriff kerry ekker wayne said saturday the bones 
were recovered from three separate sites just outside the boundaries 
of this park 200 miles south of salt lake city 
at one site searchers found widely scattered bones and what 
appeared to be a piece of a tan blouse with lace ekker said 
we have our suspicions that the bones from the two locations 
are not human but there will have to be a positive identification 
on all three ekker said in one location we did find some 
teeth so were sure its an animal 
sheriffs chief deputy leeon brinkerhoff said the remains would 
be turned over to the utah state crime laboratory for analysis 
if any are found to be human the sites will be carefully 
excavated to preserve evidence however ekker said a positive 
identification would be possible only if a skull and teeth are found 
so they can be compared with wilcoxs dental records 
the bones were in a general area described by bundy to detectives 
who interviewed him at florida state prison in the days before his 
jan 24 execution in the electric chair 
bundy was convicted of only three murders in florida but before 
his execution he confessed to more than 20 killings and is 
considered a suspect in more deaths and disappearances eight of 
those he confessed killing were in utah but he gave descriptions of 
only two of their burial sites 
if the bones found are not human ekker said his office will make 
only one more effort to recover the remains of nancy wilcox who 
disappeared from her salt lake city neighborhood on oct 2 1974 
the sweep on friday was the fourth since bundys death 
bundy confessed that he killed the girl and buried her between 
torrey and fruita just outside the national park boundaries 
brinkerhoff said 28 members of the wayne and sevier county search 
and rescue squads combed the area marking any mound which might be 
a grave of five mounds marked three produced bones

more than 60 people were arrested saturday when protesters 
gathered in several cities and at a new jersey military base to 
protest us involvement in el salvador

demonstrators turned out in front of the chicago tribune offices 
and 40 people in new jersey where more than 300 demonstrators 
marched on mcguire air force base 
in new york more than 1200 signwaving protesters marched on 
times square no arrests were reported smaller demonstrations were 
held in san francisco and providence ri 
leslie schuld an organizer of the chicago demonstration said 
there were 60 such rallies being held across the country but that 
figure could not be independently confirmed the actions were timed 
to coincide with the presidential elections in el salvador 
scheduled for sunday 
in new york demonstrators gathered in union square where they 
heard a speech from arnoldo ramos of the fmlnfdr the salvadoran 
rebel alliance us rep major owens dny addressed the group 
when it arrived in times square 
its going quite well the feelings here are quite strong 
said michael delia spokesman for the new york coalition to stop 
the us war in el salvador 
the rally was to be followed by civil disobedience on monday 
with protesters blockading a federal building in lower manhattan 
the bush administration must choose between negotiations or 
an escalation of us military involvement said coalition 
coordinator miguel ramirez many fear a vietnamlike disaster if 
the administration chooses the latter course 
the rally in new jersey was orderly at first with 300 to 400 
people gathering outside the front gate of the air force base in 
southern new jersey base spokesman ken bogdan said 
however he said some protesters began climbing over gates and 
fences to get into the base and then sat down and refused to move 
some were carried away bogdan said no injuries were reported 
the point of the demonstration was to be arrested to show we 
are resisting the war with our bodies and feel so strongly against 
this usfinanced war in el salvador said coalition spokeswoman 
kate woods 
of the 28 people arrested in chicago three were charged with 
disorderly conduct and the rest were charged with obstructing 
traffic on michigan avenue said police sgt robert mccracken

el salvador

said adding 36 billion has been sent to el salvador over the 
last eight years to support death squads 
the rally was held at the tribune tower to underline what ms 
schuld called very weak press coverage of events in the central 
american nation

the largely hispanic mission district to the federal building no 
one was arrested 
about 100 people gathered in providence to hear speakers at a

the first criminal trial stemming from wall 
streets insider trading scandals faced the prospect of a second 
mistrial when a jury on saturday reported an 111 deadlock after 
eight days of deliberations 
a federal judge asked jurors in the gaf corp stock manipulation 
case to reconsider all evidence after they reported the split 
following more than 65 hours of deliberations 
the gaf case is the first trial based on the confessions of 
insider trader ivan boesky which led to the indictment and is 
considered a test of the governments ability to try wall street 
corruption 
your honor we need help there are 11 jurors who have come to 
a unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror who 
does not agree the jury reported in a note read in us district 
court in manhattan 
the panel reported that the juror said under no circumstances 
could he agree with the other jurors decision 
gaf two subsidiaries and vice chairman james t sherwin are 
charged with allegedly trying to boost the stock price of union 
carbide corp in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of 
shares they also were charged with securities fraud wire fraud and 
conspiracy among the eight counts 
under an instruction known as the allen charge us district 
judge mary johnson lowe asked the jurors to reconsider their 
positions in the securities fraud case and sent them back to 
deliberate 
before i declare a mistrial and discharge you i want to point 
out a few things to you lowe said it is desirable that if a 
verdict can be reached that this be done 
but lowe told the jury that they should not reverse positions 
solely to reach a verdict and left resolution to the conscientious 
judgment of each juror 
after hearing the judges statement the jury said it wanted to 
continue deliberating sunday afternoon 
the point of conflict among the jurors and whether the 11 
supported acquittal or conviction were not known 
a mistrial would be the second in the case lowe declared a 
mistrial jan 10 after ruling that the prosecution unintentionally 
withheld a key piece of evidence the second trial lasted six weeks 
gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building materials 
manufacturer faces a maximum fine of 12 million or 500000 on 
each of the eight counts sherwin 55 of princeton nj faces 40 
years in prison and a fine of up to 2 million 
the gaf case is being closely followed by wall street defense 
attorneys as a key indication of prosecutors ability to convince 
juries of wall street crimes and of the reliability of information 
supplied by boesky who is serving a threeyear term on insider 
trading charges 
the purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize 
gafs profits from the planned sale of a large block of union 
carbide stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical 
concern earlier in 1986 
gaf denied the charges in what became the first case to reach the 
trial phase in a wave of wall street corruption investigations by 
the manhattan us attorneys office 
the us attorneys office has brought charges in more than 50 
securities fraud cases since 1983 nearly all the claims however 
have involved civil charges criminal frauds to date including 
pending charges against drexel burnham lambert inc have been 
settled through plea bargains 
the government based its case on the testimony of los angeles 
broker boyd l jefferies an admitted felon expected to play a key 
role in other securities fraud cases as part of a plea arrangement 
with the government

the records of a historic 1956 forum of 
hungarian intellectuals who espoused views later known as 
eurocommunism will be published this year speakers at an academic 
meeting said saturday 
in 1956 before the uprising against communist rule that same 
year a circle of university students and other intellectuals 
organized seven gatherings to discuss a variety of political 
economic and cultural themes 
texts of the lectures and debates of the petoefi circle named 
after the 19th century poet sandor petoefi have never been 
published 
the forum proposed reforms adopted by the eurocommunists more 
than 10 years later eurocommunism advocated independence from the 
soviet union and democratic elections 
speakers at saturdays meeting of about 500 people including 
many petoefi circle supporters said the full minutes of the forum 
would be published between june and september 
the meeting called to discuss the importance of the petoefi 
circle in hungarys contemporary history was announced in the 
hungarian press which has recently become increasingly open 
one of the organizers was andras hegedues a sociologist who was 
prominently involved in the 1956 forum and kept records of the 
debates for eventual publication 
we wanted reforms we certainly did not want a 
counterrevolution but it should also be admitted that we did not 
want a revolution either hegedues told participants 
the 1956 uprising has officially been described as a 
counterrevolution designed to break communist rule but politburo 
member imre pozsgay and other reformers have called it a popular 
uprising setting off a fierce debate in the party on the sensitive 
issue 
a recent party central committee session issued a statement 
saying the 1956 revolt began as a popular uprising but later turned 
into a counterrevolution

from the thomas a edison national historic site he promised to 
give all the artifacts back 
petersen 68 admitted friday that he hadnt kept his word 
the former stanford university professor pleaded guilty to 
selling more artifacts from the museum admitting that he had hidden 
some of his booty from federal agents investigating the heist three 
years ago 
petersen of redwood city calif faces up to 20 years in prison 
after entering the plea in us federal district court 
federal officials said petersen visited the museum in west 
orange nj about 30 times between 1974 and 1976 on the pretense 
that he was conducting historical research on edisons invention of 
the phonograph

left said assistant us attorney kevin mccarthy we believe 
this is it though 
fahy whitaker superintendent of the west orange historic site 
said many of the items recovered in the two fbi raids were one of 
a kind things 
they all add to our understanding of edison and how he 
worked ms whitaker said were happy weve gotten these back

poll showed that 72 percent favor a permanent ban on selling them 
while 21 percent opposed such a ban

attorney general dick thornburgh tentatively has 
decided to abolish most or all of the governments special strike 
forces established decades ago to fight the mafia according to a 
published report 
in its sunday editions the new york times reported that 
thornburgh is planning to dismantle the 24 regional organized crime 
strike forces because he believes the job can best be done by local 
us attorneys 
thornburgh told the times in an interview that the problem with 
strike forces is that they are an independent field office of the 
department of justice that competes with the us attorneys 
the proposal is supported by most of the nations 94 us 
attorneys but is meeting resistance from about 130 strike force 
attorneys the times said 
the strike force lawyers argue that us attorneys have limited 
resources for combating organized crime and that they lack personnel 
familiar with or experienced with dealing with such activity the 
newspaper reported 
the proposal which is under study by edward sg dennis head of 
the justice departments criminal division already has the 
tentative approval of thornburgh the paper reported 
dennis strongly advocates abolishing the strike forces the paper 
said 
the local us attorneys are pressing for a system similar to one 
already in use in the southern district of new york where the 
strike force attorneys were merged into the local office and no 
longer reported directly to washington dc 
supporters of the new york system credit it for allowing former 
us attorney rudolph giuliani to successfully prosecute several 
mafia cases 
in the interview thornburgh said he would prefer to replace the 
strike forces with a cadre of experienced prosecutors who could 
be dispatched to work with local us attorneys when needed 
the times said thornburgh will decide the future of the strike 
forces in a few weeks 
the strike forces originated in the 1960s under thenus 
attorney general robert kennedy the strike forces were to marshal 
the resources of the fbi other federal agencies local law 
enforcement agencies in ridding mafia influence in a region 
the strike forces operated out of washington dc because most 
organized crime activity extends beyond state borders 
thornburghs proposal is not new former attorney general edwin 
meese unsuccessfully tried to dismantle the strike forces 
thornburgh was a us attorney in pittsburgh from 1969 to 1974 
as a prosecutor there he gained attention by jailing many 
middlelevel members of the mafia

a majority of americans think abortion is 
immoral but they also firmly believe that each woman should be free 
to make her own decision about abortion according to a nationwide 
poll 
the survey published in sundays editions of the los angeles 
times also showed overwhelming opposition to any constitutional 
amendment outlawing abortion with 62 percent against such a move 
and 28 percent for it said poll director ia lewis 
the poll was taken as antiabortion groups prepare for a series 
of protests this week with proabortion groups planning counter 
demonstrations 
the poll noted however that american public opinion has been 
largely unswayed by the intense and often unruly debate over 
abortion showing opinion is about the same as a decade ago 
sixtyone percent of 3583 people surveyed by the times poll said 
they believe abortion to be morally wrong while 22 percent said 
it is morally right another 24 percent were unsure 
fiftyseven percent said they felt abortion is murder while 
35 percent disagreed with that judgement 
but 74 percent agreed with a key statement i personally feel 
that abortion is morally wrong but i also feel that whether or not 
to have an abortion is a decision that has to be made by every woman 
for herself the poll showed 21 percent disagreed with the 
statement and 5 percent were unsure 
overwhelming majorities favored abortion when a womans life was 
threatened by her pregnancy 88 percent when the pregnancy 
resulted from incest 84 percent and when a serious birth defect 
was detected 74 percent 
but most opposed abortion as a means of birth control 80 
percent and when an unmarried woman doesnt want to marry the 
father 51 percent only 49 percent opposed abortion when the 
family is poor and cant afford more children 
compounding the conflicting findings was lukewarm support 46 
percent against 35 percent opposed for the supreme courts 
16yearold ruling making abortion legal 
the telephone poll surveyed 2406 adults of both sexes in a 
crosssection sample and another 1177 women lewis said the second 
sample was added because of abortions special significance to 
women but was adjusted to fit properly into a normal percentage mix 
of men and women he said 
the surveys margin of error was 3 percent

ms rice blamed her predicament on irresponsible reporters 
although she noted that some journalists maintained professional 
conduct she said she agreed to appear at the seminar only because 
she hoped to help others avoid similar experiences 
i basically lost everything i had worked for all of my life 
she said her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood 
ms rice said she has tried to stay out of the public spotlight 
after being basically a fugitive for months a prisoner of 
perception 
she said she is recognized frequently in public and has tried to 
hide her appearance by pulling her hair back 
in addition she added i have a disguise i have buck teeth 
that i put on they cost me 80 bucks you guys want to see 
when the audience said yes ms rice donned a pair of glasses 
bent over and inserted the false teeth she stood upright looking 
like quite a different person

this

lee walden owner of a chiropractic clinic that bears his name 
also was placed on six months probation and agreed to stop 
advertising and performing a sinus treatment in which a balloon is 
inserted into the nose and inflated until it bursts said jim 
gallagher a deputy attorney general for consumer protection 
the agreement between walden the state board of chiropractic 
examiners and the state attorney generals office was signed march

in which walden was ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination he

possessed records show

south african archbishop desmond tutu backed the sandinista 
governments recent reform measures saturday and called on 
washington to help resettle the rebels 
the clerics who arrived in nicaragua tuesday issued a statement 
that was read by the rev edmond browning primate of the episcopal 
church of the united states 
the statement asked that funds provided by the us government to 
help hondurasbased nicaraguan rebels known as contras be used 
to repatriate or relocate the rebels in other countries 
it said we reject using this aid to maintain the contras in 
honduras 
the central american presidents signed a peace proposal feb 14 
that seeks ways to disband the contras and promote democratic 
reforms by nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
washington has supported the rebels since 1981 and the us 
congress is set to vote next month on additional humanitarian aid to 
the estimated 11000 contras in honduras president bush is asking 
about 4 million a month for the rebels 
browning said he will carry a message back to bush based on his 
observations 
i hope that i will be able to do it in a manner that he will 
understand browning said

opposition against south africas policy of segregation headed the 
delegation that came to nicaragua at the invitation of the rev 
sturdie downs bishop of nicaraguas episcopal church 
the delegations statement praised recent measures taken by the 
government as contributing to reconciliation and peace 
among those measure was the release last week of nearly 1900 
former national guardsmen and the decision to allow 10 clergymen to 
return to nicaragua most of the guardsmen had been in prison since 
the sandinistas won a civil war and ousted the conservative 
government of president anastasio somoza in july 1979 
browning said his visit to nicaragua will cause certain 
conflicts among members of the episcopal church in the united 
states but he added he would be willing to return to nicaragua to 
help the people in the reconstruction of their faith as well as 
social justice 
members of the anglican group met with president daniel ortega

national drug director william j bennett is 
making plans for a federallocal strike force to give shock 
treatment to druginfested areas of washington dc according to 
a published report 
bennett who was sworn in monday as the nations first director 
of national drug control policy had said he may make the district 
of columbia a test case in the war against drugs the district 
has had 114 murders so far this year as saturday and most were 
drugrelated 
the washington post in sundays editions quoted aides to 
bennett as saying that the strike force would target repeat drug 
offenders and try to shut down the citys 90 openair drug markets 
also abandoned military facilities could be converted into 
temporary prisons to provide more space to house the large number of 
drug offenders officials expect to arrest during the anticipated 
crackdown the newspaper said 
the paper quoted a source as saying that the strike force which 
could be created as soon as next month would perform simultaneous 
drug busts in specific neighborhoods these are going to be 
targeted operations were not just going to commit 5000 
people to the streets of dc the source said 
the antidrug abuse act of 1988 authorizes bennett to declare 
certain cities high intensity drug trafficking areas and to 
temporarily reassign federal personnel to those areas to work with 
state and local officials 
some local law enforcement officials have questioned if the 
district qualifies as a high intensity drug area 
however district police chief maurice t turner jr said the 
plan was encouraging news we arrest them but they dont go to 
jail they dont fear jail if the federal government assists us by 
sending them to jail it certainly will help 
bennett had said friday he did not plan to displace the local 
police department but that the federal government would seek to aid 
local efforts 
the strike force will include agents borrowed from the federal 
bureau of investigation the drug enforcement agency the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms and the us marshals service as well 
as district and county police departments the paper said 
bennett appointed sherwood chuck wexler to serve as a liaison 
for the agencies and a draft of the plan is expected within three 
weeks with a formal announcement to come later

the defense department is satisfied with 
assurances that an israeli air force officer indicted in the 
espionage case of jonathan j pollard is not employed by an israeli 
firm which supplies the us military a pentagon official said 
friday 
the pentagon had sought clarifications from israel after a news 
report that the officer col aviem sella joined electro optics 
industries which manufactures sophisticated optical devices 
including night vision equipment for pilots 
the inquiry was undertaken because under pentagon policy the 
us government might have had to cancel its contracts with the 
israeli firm because of a ban on dealings with an indicted 
individual like sella 
the pentagon has seen a letter from the chief executive officer 
of electro optics saying sella was not employed by the company said 
the official who spoke on condition he not be named 
we have no information to contradict that letter he said 
as far as were concerned that closes the issue 
sella was indicted on charges he acted as the handler for 
pollard a civilian navy intelligence analyst convicted in 1987 of 
selling thousands of secrets to israel pollard is serving a life 
sentence 
sella is one of several israelis involved in the affair whom the 
united states is seeking to prosecute israeli officials have held 
periodic talks with the justice department on clearing up the 
lingering controversy but have failed to reach agreement 
sella returned to israel before his indictment and was appointed 
commander of a large air force base despite us objections in 
keeping with pentagon policy us officials and contractors acting 
on government business were banned from any dealings with sella 
that fact combined with his inability to come to the united 
states on business reportedly hindered sella in his job 
the weekly defense news reported last week that sella left the 
military earlier this year and joined electro optics on march 1 the 
company one of israels leading exporters has a 10 million 
contract with martin marietta aerospace to supply night vision 
equipment for the apache attack helicopters elop also supplies 
sight displays for jet pilots visors which allows them to fly at 
night 
in response to the defense news report elop director nathan 
sharoni wrote a letter to the weekly denying that sella was employed 
by the company in any capacity that same letter was brought to 
the attention of the pentagon said the defense official 
it is true we did intend to employ him as a consultant 
sharoni wrote but this intention did not materialize israeli 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the decision not 
to employ sella appeared to stem from strong indications that the 
united states would object

national drugcontrol director william j 
bennett who says he may make the district of columbia a test 
case in the war against drugs said friday his plans dont include 
federal control of the local police 
the citys soaring number of murders 114 as of friday with 
many of them drugrelated has prompted talk on capitol hill by two 
senators that perhaps the local police department should be replaced 
with a federally controlled police force district officials have 
expressed fear that they may lose control over their city 
but bennett said in an interview we have no plan to displace 
the washington dc police department which i actually think has 
done pretty well i think chief maurice turners made valiant 
efforts here 
on monday the day bennett was sworn in as the nations first 
director of national drug control policy he told a news conference 
that in the next few weeks he may declare washington recently 
becoming known as the nations murder capital a high intensity 
drug trafficking area such a designation would allow him to 
allocate federal personnel and cash to combat the problem 
sen warren rudman rnh on thursday blamed the citys crime 
wave on inept local government that doesnt understand what its 
doing and said that if the killing continues he will consider 
taking a look at home rule at least the law enforcement aspect 
sen ernest hollings dsc supported rudmans remarks 
city officials worried aloud that home rule the right to 
selfgovernance that city residents obtained in 1973 may be more 
vulnerable now than ever before 
if the federal government thinks it can do a better job of 
stopping drugs from coming into the city why cant they do a better 
job of stopping drugs from entering the country asked mayor 
marion barry jr 
bennett said friday i certainly dont think were going to 
solve this problem by taking over from the city 
our effort will not be to say dc is no more and were 
taking it over he said it will be to say were going to 
help wed like to get in and help and get out 
in the long run bennett said whats going to sustain 
washington is not going to be federal agencies or drug czars its 
going to be its own people their neighborhoods their communities 
their governments theyve got to stand on their own feet run their 
own community they have to take back the streets we might be 
able to help in the interim

a poll released saturday indicated support of prime 
minister noboru takeshita has plunged to 15 percent with his 
government embroiled in a stock trading scandal and planned sales 
tax 
the poll was published by a leading newspaper the asahi shimbun 
which said in an editorial taking account of takeshitas support 
rate no one would be surprised if his cabinet should resign at any 
time 
it said 3000 adults throughout the nation were polled march 15 
and 16 and support of takeshitas government dropped to 15 percent 
from 28 percent in january the newspaper did not list a margin of 
error in the poll 
the editorial said it is indispensable to reconstruct politics 
from the beginning by dissolving parliament and holding general 
elections 
takeshitas liberal democratic party government passed an 
unpopular 3 percent consumption tax that will go into effect april 1 
and proscutors have arrested 12 people in the stock profiteering 
scandal 
the scandal centers around an information conglomerate recruit 
co which offered hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in its 
real estate subsidiary to more than 150 people including political 
and business leaders 
takeshitas former finance minister was among three government 
officials who resigned in the scandal 
the asahi shimbun poll gave takeshita the third lowest rating in 
japans postworld war ii history public support was polled at only 
12 percent for prime ministers nobusuke kishi in 1960 and kakuei 
tanaka in 1974 kishi had pushed through parliament a revision of 
the japanus security treaty and tanaka was connected to a bribery 
case involving the usbased lockheed corp 
the opposition on friday demanded again that takeshita and his 
cabinet resign and even the prime ministers advisory panel urged 
him to apologize to the public 
takashi ishihara a member of the wisemens club on political 
reform that takeshita formed in january said it is important for 
him the prime minister to apologize and make his responsibility 
clear in the recruit case 
the very idea of a politician making money through stock 
transaction is wrong said ishihara chairman of nissan motor co 
the panel also urged takeshita to accept opposition demands to 
summon his predecessor yasuhiro nakasone to parliament to testify 
about his role in the affair 
takeshita said friday since this problem surfaced during my 
term in office i cannot turn my back on it we must work to restore 
the public trust by initiating political reforms 
opposition parties have stalled parliamentary debate on the 
countrys budget since wednesday when the ldp rejected their demands 
that takeshita resign or summon nakasone to parliament for

state treasurer a james manchin 
testified at his impeachment hearing friday that he received 
documents showing massive losses in the states consolidated 
investment fund but didnt pay attention to them 
stating repeatedly im not a financial expert the twoterm 
democrat said he did not understand investment reports that crossed 
his desk and had no idea the fund lost 279 million until late 
november or early december 1988 
the house judiciary committee which has heard more than 50 hours 
of testimony in the past two weeks is to vote next week on whether 
the house of delegates should impeach manchin 
if the house does so the treasurer would be tried by the state 
senate 
manchin the last witness scheduled to appear before the 
committee said he depended on his staff to handle the investment 
division in his office and that thenassociate treasurer arnold 
margolin and theninvestment director kathy lester kept the losses 
from him 
the system failed manchin said the checks didnt check 
the balances didnt balance 
since the losses became public manchin said he has been keeping 
a close eye on the investment division but when delegate rod berry 
asked manchin how much the investment division made or lost last 
week manchin would not answer 
we can get you a report on that the treasurer said 
the losses occurred when the bond market took a nosedive in april 
1987 and the treasurers office traded extensively to keep the 
losses at a minimum other witnesses have testified instead the 
losses continued to mount 
manchin also was questioned friday about a report he said was 
sent to his office that showed the investment fund losing millions 
of dollars in june 1987 manchin expressed some confusion about the 
meaning of the document and why some figures were shown in 
parentheses a common method of showing losses on financial 
documents 
manchin said he paid no attention to the report when he received 
it even though 87 of 90 figures on it indicated losses 
all these reports look alike manchin said i am not a 
financial expert i hired the best management team available

of all the nomination processes that lead to 
academy awards none is more complicated or controversial than 
the foreign language film award 
its commonly called the foreign film award not so nominees 
must be in a language other than english hence films from england 
australia and canada except for canadian films in french such as 
the recent the decline of the american empire are not eligible 
in this category 
the controversial part of the foreign language award stems from 
the fact that the national academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences and its voters have no control over the nominations the 
countries themselves can nominate one film per year the system has 
been criticized for its inequities 
critics claim that governments especially military or communist 
dictatorships sometimes refuse to nominate films showing those 
countries in a bad light politics in the selection committee can 
also eliminate likely choices 
three years ago akira kurosawas widely acclaimed ran was not 
submitted because of wrangling among japanese committee members the 
directors branch of the academy rallied to the great filmmaker and 
nominated him for best director

big success in the united states 44 million in 17 weeks of 
limited release and critics have compared it to the screwball 
comedies of howard hawks leo mccarey and george stevens 
the star carmen maura is not surprised by the american 
response her friendship with almodovar goes back to when he worked 
for the madrid telephone company and she was a television talkshow 
hostess 
when i began to work with pedro 10 years ago and we had a very 
special situation together she said during a visit here i said 
to him hey pedro dont worry because in one time the americans 
will understand you 
i am very proud of pedro almodovar i think hes very genuine 
his sense of humor is very american sometimes and mine also so i 
understand why you americans like women on the verge 
max von sydow who stars in pelle the conqueror along with 
young pelle hvenegaard as his son also has high praise for his 
director danish bille august 
hes very very sensitive and has a great hand with people 
especially children very softspoken he seems almost shy but hes 
a brilliant man and im really looking forward to seeing what hell 
do in the future 
pelle 11 million during 11 weeks of limited domestic 
release concerns a swedish peasant who brings his son to a danish 
farm where the father endures a series of indignities as a lowly 
worker the film was shot on the bleak landscape during one of the

if the academy award race for supporting actor 
goes according to form the winner would be alec guinness for 
little dorrit or so the experts say 
after all the reasoning goes for the past three years the award 
has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work 
don ameche cocoon 1985 michael caine hannah and her 
sisters 1986 sean connery the untouchables 1987 
the trouble is that academy award voters dont always follow 
tradition and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the 
six hours of little dorrit 
the britishmade film is based on charles dickens last often 
overlooked novel guinness oscar winner as best actor for the 
bridge on the river kwai in 1957 was cast as william dorrit 
longtime resident of debtors prison 
the character itself i found fascinating said the 
74yearold actor in a magazine interview because in many ways 
its unsympathetic feckless and foolish you know youd like to 
kick him and yet at the same time there is a sympathy for him 
because of the social situation at that time being chucked into 
prison for 20odd years for debt 
but oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote first theres 
martin landau nominated for tucker the man and his dream for 
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such

francis coppola gave landau the role of his life as abe karatz 
financial adviser to car builder preston tucker of coppola landau 
54 remarks like all the good ones he lets you go he hires you 
thats a vote of confidence francis really creates a background for 
you the more you bring the happier he is 
landau is a director of the actors studio in hollywood and he 
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness once an 
illustrator for the new york daily news he drew portraits of abe 
and analyzed him as a lonely new york businessman who really has 
no family no friends and no life outside work 
then theres dean stockwell nominated as the outrageous mafia 
don in married to the mob hes been in films for 46 of his 52 
years the son of singer harry stockwell dean was a child actor in 
such films as anchors aweigh gentlemans agreement and 
the boy with the green hair 
his career since then has been a roller coaster obscurity after 
his childstar days success as a young man in compulsion 
sons and lovers and other films descent into hippiedom during 
the 1960s he tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act 
but found jobs scarce thinking his career over he and wife joy 
moved to santa fe nm suddenly producers were sending for him 
stockwell credits director jonathan demme for taking a chance on 
him in married to the mob he remarked no one had ever 
thought of me for this type of role its a romantic comedy and i 
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid 
of and its charming and funny prior to that everyone always 
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and 
neurotics and sensitive people 
kevin kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious 
underworld type in a fish called wanda known for his flamboyant 
roles in the theater kline 41 has created a series of indelible 
performances on the screen as meryl streeps erratic lover in 
sophies choice the college reunion host in the big chill 
the swashbuckling buccaneer in the pirates of penzance 
the actor believes that his screen potential hasnt been reached 
ive done tons of roles on the stage that i havent even

bill feuchter lovingly taps the bright yellow 
bulldozer awaiting finishing touches on the caterpillar inc 
production line you can hardly point to a part on there that 
isnt steel he says 
steel is the backbone of caterpillars business and nobody knows 
it more intimately than feuchter who buys 500000 tons a year of 
the metal that winds up in the formidable earthmoving machines 
under the cat name 
as it searches for the cheapest materials available caterpillar 
finds itself at odds with its major supplier the us steel 
industry over quotas that limit imports of foreign steel 
twenty percent of the halfmillion tons of the steel caterpillar 
uses annually comes from europe canada and other countries 
overseas the company joined by a coalition of about 250 mostly 
small manufacturers is fighting efforts to extend the quotas 
it is a fight not just about trade but about politics 
president bush made a campaign promise to renew the socalled 
voluntary restraint agreements vras when they expire sept 30 and 
54 senators are cosponsoring legislation to extend for five years 
the vras which limit the european community and 19 other countries 
to a 20 percent share of the us market despite complaints from 
the steel industry the united states refused to subject canada to 
the vras in 1984 
bush however is an ardent champion of free trade and a foe of 
what he calls the fools gold of protectionism 
indeed in the same letter to sen john heinz rpa pledging to 
support continuation of the vras bush also vowed to press for an 
international consensus on fair trade that would eliminate the need 
for the us barrier 
even now toplevel bush trade and economic officials are 
debating internally just how long the extended vras should last and 
what types of steel they should cover us trade representative 
carla hills has echoed bushs sentiments that the vras are a stopgap 
and the real goal is to end the subsidies dumping and closed 
markets that distort the price of steel 
it is the first major test of trade policy for the bush 
administration if the united states insists on some protective 
barrier to shelter its steel industry how much force will it carry 
when it insists on dismantling the barriers that protect farmers in 
europe or japan 
political realities at home may force bush like ronald reagan 
before him to temper disdain for protectionism against the pressing 
need to rein in the 137 billion trade deficit and bolster a vital 
us industry that saw 290000 jobs disappear in the past decade 
the us steel industry is operating today at 89 percent of 
capacity rolling up profits of 3 billion in the past two years 
after being staggered by losses of 12 billion in the previous five 
caterpillar and its allies charge the vras will force us 
companies to pay artificially high prices for the next five years 
impairing their ability to sell goods here and abroad 
the vras cost us dearly said patrick a thompson president 
of transmatic inc of holland mich and chairman of the precision 
metalforming association if we are ever going to get the trade 
deficit down people in manufacturing are going to have to start 
shipping product out of this country but before we can do that 
weve got to have the material 
but the steel industry counters vehemently that what is at stake 
is the survival of the american mills still struggling to regroup 
and modernize after the calamitous downturn in the first half of the 
1980s 
the vras are in the longrun interests of american consumers 
as well as producers said alan w wolff a former deputy us 
trade representative leading the industry fight 
obviously in the united states everyone wants to buy everything 
at the lowest possible price now said wolff but no other 
industrialized country has considered it acceptable to lose its 
selfsufficiency in steel 
thomas c graham president of the uss division of usx corp the 
biggest us steel maker put it more bluntly at a recent washington 
debate on vras 
if we keep putzing around with this vra question more of 
the industry will liquidate and there will be all this 
handwringing about allocation graham said 
caterpillar and its coalition notwithstanding graham claimed 
that 95 percent of our customers are with us in support of the 
import quotas 
theyve seen a third of the domestic steel industry liquidate 
and they know that process can continue its in their enlightened 
selfinterest said graham the chairman of the american iron amp 
steel institute

a few years ago peoriabased caterpillar like the us steel 
industry was on the industrial critical list the company lost 953 
million in 198284 and saw japans komatsu pose a stiff challenge to 
its world leadership in the heavy construction field 
big cat battled back by restructuring factory floors forging a 
new relationship with workers and looking for every possible way to 
lower costs and stay competitive in the world marketplace last year 
it posted profits of 616 million on record sales of 104 billion 
half of them abroad 
the weaker dollar helped revive caterpillars fortunes but 
company officials say the recovery was also sped by radically 
altering their production methods to emphasize quality and minimize 
costs stacks of empty parts bins outside one of the caterpillar 
plants straddling the illinois river testify to the companys 
success in eliminating the need for huge stockpiles of parts 
feuchter manager of central purchasing for caterpillars steel 
division said our chief needs are high quality materials on time 
and at the right price vras dont help any of that they inhibit 
our ability to shop the best way we know how 
while steel prices fell during the first two years under vras 
timothy l elder caterpillars manager of governmental affairs 
said they were overpriced to begin with 
he cited a study done for the antivra coalition by the stern 
group a trade advisory group headed by former international trade 
commissioner paula stern that concluded us manufacturers paid an 
average of 5 billion or 25 percent more for steel each year from 
1969 through 1985 than their counterparts in japan and west germany 
strong worldwide demand has pushed steel prices up since 1986 
caterpillar blames the quotas for helping push up its prices for 
plate steel 17 percent a year ago and for inducing shortages of 
large tractor track shoes that are only made overseas 
the commerce department allowed caterpillar last summer to import 
an extra 13000 tons of the steel track shoes because of the short 
supply

at ltv steels indiana harbor works in east chicago ind one of 
the mammoth mills that line the lakeshore between chicago and gary 
ind general manager richard a veitch finds it inconceivable that 
anyone could accuse the steel industry of not modernizing 
were high tech were a far more sophisticated industry than 
people realize said veitch 
ltv which went into chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986 invested more 
than 325 million to modernize its operations last year a sizable 
chunk went to indiana harbor which recently opened a 76 million 
ladle metallurgy facility to produce high quality ultralow carbon 
steel 
in 1987 ltv spent 130 million rebuilding a huge blast furnace at 
indiana harbor and relined a second major furnace last year at a 
cost of 70 million 
five years ago said veitch blast furnaces didnt have 
computers and all these crt screens with all this stuff flashing on 
them but today one guy sits in a room and knows whats going on in 
the whole furnace 
behind other weathered hulking steel facades small crews sit in 
computerlined pulpits running fiery steelmaking operations 
that once required twice as many workers 
the indiana harbor works has a continuous casting facility that 
set a world production record in 1987 instead of pouring the molten 
steel into ingots the caster allows steel to be molded into slabs 
and sent hurtling down the line like a glowing tobaggan stretched 
to thousandths of an inch by rollers and cooled with torrents of 
water the steel emerges in hot rolled coils produced in a fraction 
of the time and cost of old methods 
indiana harbor is ltvs frontline plant that gets the first 
orders and the first improvements a sister plant in cleveland still 
makes half its steel in ingots and lacks a ladle metallurgy facility 
we have just begun to scratch the surface of trying to climb 
back up and become economically viable said veitch as an 
industry weve got to get to 100 percent continuous cast 
instead of the current 65 percent 
just from this plants perspective ive got a lot more that 
needs to be done to be truly consistently world competitive said 
veitch who speaks enviously of advances the japanese and europeans 
have made on hotstrip rolling mills 
veitch is nonplused by the complaints from caterpillar 
if you look at the whole world market situation were not out 
of line in terms of prices the plant manager said were just 
approaching levels pricewise that we were at in 1982 
in chicago at the top of the inland steel building inland 
director of corporate communications sam h saran grumbled what 
do they want us to do give our steel away like we did for four 
years 
the us mills boast they are now producing a ton of steel at a 
lower average cost than any country in the world costs are down 35 
percent since 1982 productivity is up 40 percent and quality is 
greatly improved they say 
the steelmakers say they reinvested 9 billion in modernizing 
plants and equipment between 198287 a third more than their cash 
flow from steel the vra legislation requires such reinvestment 
graham the president of the usx steel division said when you 
see chryslers lee iacocca on television announcing a new 
sevenyear car guarantee you want to recall that thats made 
possible by technological innovation in the domestic steel 
industry 
nowhere in the world is steel sold at prices as low as it is 
currently in the us graham said at a recent vra debate 
sponsored by the economic policy institute 
american auto makers are paying about 100 per ton less for 
their domestic steel than toyota is paying in japan said heinz 
the pennsylvania senator

the rise of the yen and mark have narrowed the once formidable 
wage gap between us steel workers and their foreign counterparts 
us steel workers wages have risen only 25 percent since 1982 to 
1478 per hour according to the wefa group a fact that the 
united steelworkers union will emphasize in negotiations to renew 
labor contracts that expire this july 31 at four of the big six us 
steelmakers fringes add almost 10 an hour to the steel workers 
compensation 
steel imports which claimed 26 percent of the us market in 
1984 dropped to 21 percent in 1988 just above the vra target 
level some countries did not ship their full quotas to the united 
states presumably because they could fetch higher prices elsewhere 
while 20 million tons were imported last year us steel makers 
exported 2 million tons 
in the event that the vras are not extended steel companies are 
keeping trade law specialists like alan wolff busy preparing 
hundreds of unfair trade cases to bring before the international 
trade commission against foreign producers 
it was in part the difficulty of trying to resolve a myriad of 
such disputes through the itc that prompted the reagan 
administration to embrace vras in 1984 
gary hufbauer a georgetown university professor of international 
finance who favors a phaseout of the vras said the steelmakers want 
insurance against a cyclical downturn or an overvalued dollar in 
the 1990s 
but wolff countered that the international conditions that 
gave rise to the vras have not changed significantly 
steel and the state a 580page book coauthored by wolff 
charges the steel industry in europe was kept alive only by 
repeated massive injuections of state aid including 35 
billion between 1980 and 1985 alone currently italys stateowned 
finsider group is getting almost 6 billion in new subsidies said 
wolff 
getting plant and equipment at zero cost is an unbeatable 
competitive advantage he said 
usxs graham has a ready answer when asked why the renascent 
steel industry is putting so much vigor into the fight for vras 
were at the top of the cycle this is a cyclical business and 
we know it will turn down someday thats when vras are important 
they are a softmarket mechanism graham said but theyre a 
political device so youve got to get them in place 
heinz isnt ready to declare victory 
it isnt over til its over said the cochairman of the 
senate steel caucus trade disputes are always very chancy 
several major newspapers have railed against extension of the 
vras saying its time for big steel to stand on its own 
inlands saran replies were getting the same kind of 
misguided editorials from all the newspapers all of whom are free 
traders except when it comes to their own business 
if there was some way tomorrow for the japanese to set up a 
competitive newspaper in chicago and give the tribune a run for 
their money and they were subsidized by the japanese government 
guess whos side theyd be on asked saran theyd probably be 
on the side of having the laws observed

bargain prices for coveted airport gates and 
computer reservation systems millions in loans from a debtswamped 
airline to its growing sister moneylosing deals to buy fuel from 
the parent 
in court papers eastern airlines recalcitrant pilots make a 
strong case that texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo has plotted 
to suck easterns blood to buoy nonunion continental airlines a 
key issue as the saga of the strikedecimated carrier moves through 
bankruptcy proceedings 
either a sophisticated asset stripping scheme is under way or 
management is incompetent the pilots state in documents filed in 
us bankruptcy court last week 
the pilots cite alleged bargain sales nogain loans and 
moneylosing arrangements they say have undermined parent texas 
airs claim that its affiliated airlines are separate entities they 
say lorenzos management clearly benefited continental and texas air 
at easterns detriment 
eastern which was losing money long before lorenzo arrived in 
1986 says it transacted aboveboard fairmarket deals among 
subsidiaries with no illicit intermingling of eastern and 
continental blood 
nonetheless a 59page court brief filed last week by the air 
line pilots association provides illuminating details that at least 
raise major questions about eastern managements behavior 
the brief culls information from securities and exchange 
commission filings federal court testimony a transportation 
department report and company financial records to make the case 
that eastern and continental are deeply interwoven 
the most striking deal the red flag on the bull in the 
bullring in the words of one aviation analyst was the 1987 
transfer of easterns coveted computerized reservation system to 
continental for 100 million 
at the time the system was worth at least triple that amount 
moreover debtswamped eastern didnt get a 100 million cash 
infusion from the deal which it badly needed to support daytoday 
operations instead it got 100 million in notes bearing 6 percent 
interest payable in full in the year 2012 
analysts have questioned the financial wisdom of transferring the 
computerized reservation system to its new sister similar networks 
soon after fetched 280 million 500 million and 650 million 
eastern maintains it couldnt afford to upgrade its network in a 
highly competitive battle for travel agents who book tickets 
through airlinerun computers eastern says it was paying 130 
million a year to operate the network money it now pays to texas 
air for a better product 
the question of whether eastern and continental have been kept 
separate is central to the bankruptcy proceedings 
a judge ultimately could decide whether lorenzo allowed eastern 
to languish and refused to merge the two subsidiaries in an attempt 
to destroy easterns unions texas air wants to avoid placing its 
assets on the line to cover easterns more than 3 billion in 
liabilities 
by keeping the companies separate lorenzo doesnt get the two 
groups together to be unionized said a new york aviation lawyer 
who asked not to be identified if he put the two together he 
would face a situation where if he allowed enough parity of 
employees that would force an election 
then lorenzo has a completely unionized property which is what 
he got out of five years ago 
the pilots court brief also alleges the following action damaged 
eastern 
eastern loaned 40 million to continental last spring at the 
same time it was seeking an internal revenue service waiver on a 
105 million contribution to its pension fund eastern says the loan 
was repaid 
for almost two years eastern failed to demand a noninterest 
bearing 16 million payment due for mergerrelated expenses from 
texas air the inaction cost the airline about 28 million a year 
in lost interest earnings eastern called it a bookkeeping 
transaction that has since been paid 
in march 1987 eastern paid texas air 25 million for a note 
worth 30 million owned by nearly bankrupt people express which 
texas air had previously acquired texas air made 44 million on 
the deal the pilots called it a senseless investment since people 
express had no creditworthiness and eastern needed to conserve cash 
eastern paid 22 million to continental for strikerelated 
services in december 1987 and another 19 million last fall for 
similar services that have not been used eastern maintains the 
money was wellspent 
continental the pilots claim disproportionate gained from a 
merger of sales offices with eastern in january 1987 eastern 
brought in 166 offices while continental contributed 27 the 
arrangement was dissolved last december 
continental paid 11 million to eastern for 11 newark 
international airport gates allegedly worth twice as much the court 
papers compare the deal with easterns 1986 sale of eight charlotte 
nc gates to piedmont airlines for 25 million eastern says it 
got the market price 
a fuel purchase agreement with texas air costs eastern about 18 
million annually but provides no apparent savings the papers state 
eastern claims it saves 6 million a year texas air claims the 
arrangement merges purchases of eastern and continental giving them 
greater clout with suppliers 
the pending sale of the northeast shuttle to donald trump for 
365 million will reduce easterns cash flow by 30 million to 40 
million the pilots say the airline says sale of the shuttle 
despite its profitability is necessary for the airlines survival 
the pilots claim downsizing eastern last year by closing its 
kansas city mo hub and selling planes routes and airport gates 
as part of 130 million in asset sales has hurt profitability while 
benefiting continental they also say most of easterns directors 
and managers used to work at texas air continental or both and 
dont have easterns best interests in mind 
another key issue involves easterns pension obligations put at 
320 million by the company but 750 million by the federal pension 
benefit guarantee corporation under federal law texas air and 
continental could be held liable for the total underfunding of 
easterns pension plans 
if eastern fails to make a 100 million payment due in september 
lawyers said the government could tap money from elsewhere in the 
texas air structure to guarantee payment eastern may sell more 
assets 
the pilots court papers ask judge burton r lifland to appoint a 
trustee to run eastern during bankruptcy proceedings charging that 
lorenzo would continue dismantling eastern and try to break its 
unions as he did after taking continental into bankruptcy in 1983 
it may not win over the long run but it certainly puts a lot of 
flies in the ointment in terms of trying to get the assets sold 
piecemeal said louis marckesano an analyst with janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
but lawyers said obtaining a trustee is difficult and may be 
viewed by lifland as unnecessary moreover the judge may not view 
eastern managements sale of assets and other actions as 
irresponsible 
these asset sales have kept eastern in business eastern 
spokesman robin matell said without these sales this company 
would have gone bellyup a long time ago

a benign winter for stock market investors is 
approaching its end with some increasingly chilling worries about 
inflation 
in their strongest sustained performance since the great bull 
market of 198287 stock prices began to rally late in november 
gathered strength in january and established new postcrash highs in 
early february 
after a modest pullback they came on strong again and nearly 
equaled their february highs this past week 
but the upbeat mood in the financial world suddenly took an 
anxious turn on friday when the labor department reported that the 
producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point 
in february for the second straight month 
two months figures dont make a trend but anyone who projected 
the figures out over a full year was bound to stir memories of the 
dread phenomenon of a decade ago doubledigit inflation 
few economists on wall street had considered that as even a 
remote possibility even after the data were in forecasters believe 
there is very little chance of an economic replay of the soaring 
prices seen in the late 1970s 
but the widely held belief that the federal reserve would succeed 
in its effort to keep inflation in check without much economic pain 
has suffered a serious challenge 
and some nagging questions took on a new urgency in a 
deregulated economy that operates on huge international flows of 
money how much power does the fed have to achieve its 
antiinflationary goals 
assuming that the mission can be accomplished what degree of 
credittightening will be needed and how high will that drive 
interest rates 
lastly will the central bank have to squeeze the economy to the 
point of recession before it sees any evidence that it is getting 
inflation under control 
as traders faced those issues stocks fell sharply on friday 
giving up nearly all of a strong gain they had amassed earlier in 
the week when it looked as though the strains on the economy might 
be easing 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 4857 on friday 
finished the week with a net gain of 1000 at 229214 
the new york stock exchange composite index slipped 19 to 
16466 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
dropped 371 to 40219 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 416 at 32836 
volume on the big board averaged 17728 million shares a day up 
from 15980 million the week before 
the core inflation rate excluding food and energy which is 
now almost 5 percent has been inching up consistently since 
mid1988 observed suresh bhirud chief investment strategist at 
oppenheimer amp co 
any further increases either in food commodity prices or crude 
oil prices would only worsen inflationary fears the fact that 
inventories have been consistently low will only result in further 
inflationary pressure as reordering may prove to be costly for most 
businesses 
it may no longer be an easy task to slow down the economy or 
reduce inflationary pressures 
hopes still persist in many minds on wall street however that 
the feds efforts will soon start to yield some tangible results 
inflation scares have hit the markets numerous times in recent 
years they point out and all to date have proved unwarranted 
said michael sherman an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
we believe the time is fast approaching when interest rates start 
to slow the economy

the governments latest news on inflation has 
sent investors scurrying for cover like targets of a semiautomatic 
assaultrifle attack and left stunned economists wondering how high 
interest rates will go 
i think of it as the st pattys day massacre said robert 
brusca a senior vice president at nikko securities international 
inc after the labor department said wholesale prices surged 10 
percent in february if this shocks you into thinking we have an 
inflation problem thats right 
the report this past friday matched a jump in january and 
translated into an annual wholesale inflation rate exceeding 12 
percent more than triple the level of last year 
it incited one of the biggest setbacks of the year for the stock 
and bond markets where prices tumbled on fear that inflation is 
eroding the value of these investments and will require a stiff 
curative dose of higher interest rates orchestrated by the federal 
reserve the nations central bank 
the prospect of sharply tighter credit in turn signaled a range 
of potential consequences that included higher mortgage rates more 
loan defaults and rising unemployment possible elements of a 
recession 
if you hold debt thats based on an adjustrable rate it will 
raise your monthly expenses said michael moran a strategist at 
daiwa securities america in new york as for big ticket items like 
housing the higher cost of credit will slow demand for these 
things 
on a broader scale the higher cost of borrowing could derail the 
bush administrations plan for reducing the national debt and budget 
deficit which is largely based on economic growth and no tax 
increases 
rising rates also could intensify problems faced by hundreds of 
sickly thrifts by driving up their own business expenses and the 
cost of a federal bailout program already estimated at more than 
100 billion 
the wholesale inflation number deeply disturbed economists not 
only because it exceeded expectations but affected every major area 
from clothing to food to energy expenses 
the sense here is that the acceleration in inflation has been 
steady and the forces keeping inflation going are still in place 
brusca said everything thats going on here is negative 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
inflation fears were further aggravated by rising oil prices 
which surged to the highest level in nearly two years as of friday 
april contracts for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude cost 
2033 on the new york mercantile exchange 
despite the inflation news other government figures indicated 
the economy is slowing down for february industrial output 
remained largely unchanged factory use fell to 843 percent from 
845 percent a month earlier housing starts fell 114 percent 
retail sales fell 04 percent imports and exports declined in 
january 
new twists complicated a bitter strike at eastern airlines with 
no sign of resolution in bankruptcy proceedings pilots and 
machinists accused management of deliberate negligence and sought a 
courtappointed trustee to run the airline management won an 
emergency court order directing other carriers to honor prestrike 
business agreements union officials talked of a possible 
employeeled buyout 
rjr nabisco inc target of the biggest successful takeover in 
history got a new chief louis gerstner a former american express

theres been much talk in the last few years of 
shareholder rights now the financial markets may be seeing the 
emergence of a new movement bondholder rights 
the recent experience of gaf corp when it redeemed several bond 
issues as part of its plan to go private shows that some bondholders 
no longer will sit by passively while a corporation restructures 
when gaf announced it would redeem the bond issues before 
maturity as part of its 146 billion managementled buyout major 
institutional holders of the securities banded together hired an 
adviser and went to battle with the wayne nj chemical and 
buildingproducts company until it raised the bondredemption prices 
several times 
the bondholders were able to receive a reasonable premium and 
not have to suffer any losses said jack ackerman president of 
bondreview inc the adviser to the gaf bondholder group 
in order to undertake the buyout gaf needed the approval of the 
holders of three issues of its highyield or junk bonds 
covenants written into the bond issues required the approval of the 
bondholders before the company could restructure ackerman said 
such covenants typically restrict a company from incurring 
additional debt without bondholder approval 
gaf offered to pay the bondholders a fee for their consent to 
disregard the covenants and at the same time buy back their bonds 
but some institutional holders of the bonds primarily insurance 
companies believed the bonds were worth more than gaf was offering 
ackerman said with his help they formed a group and decided not to 
tender their bonds right away 
gaf responded by raising its tender offer but not by much 
ackerman said 
they were testing to find out if a group had been formed he 
said nobody tendered 
the bondholder group then negotiated with gaf and reached 
agreement on the price gaf offered for the bonds and for the consent 
fee or the amount it paid for bondholders to relinquish their right 
to reject gafs restructuring 
by forming these groups and staying together and by a 
reasonable negotiation position with the company bondholders 
increased their payment by about 20 million overall for the three 
bond issues involved ackerman said 
he said the sweetened offers represented improvements ranging 
from 5 percent to 8 percent for each of the bond issues compared 
with the first gaf offers 
gaf refused to comment on the bond redemption an unidentified 
gaf official told bondweek a weekly trade newsletter that the 
final gaf offer for one of the bond issues wound up being more 
expensive than we planned 
ackerman said one important reason for bondholders to negotiate 
as a group is that if the company receives approval from holders of 
51 percent of its bonds it can undertake the changes barred by the 
bond covenants 
for example he said if holders of 51 percent of the gaf bonds 
agreed to give up their covenant rights holders of the other 49 
percent would face the prospect that their bonds would be worth less 
as the company incurred more debt during a buyout 
youve got a potential tyranny of the majority over the 
minority he said 
some bond market analysts believe more bondholders will become 
more active in protecting their interests because of corporate 
restructurings in addition to enforcing covenants in existing 
bonds investors increasingly are demanding that new issues contain 
covenants protecting them from managements that load up on debt 
institutional investors are looking at the way things are going 
these days and are deciding not to take a passive attitude said 
david blitzer chief economist for standard amp poors corp the 
securityrating company 
several industry watchers pointed to the recent leveraged buyout 
of rjr nabisco inc as a turning point in bondholder awareness 
a lot of big investors in rj reynolds thought they had been 
unfairly treated blitzer said he said rjr had completed a debt 
issue shortly before the leveraged buyout was announced people 
thought they were given the short end of the stick 
the rating of some rjr debt fell after the companys 
debtfinanced buyout by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co two major rjr 
bondholders metropolitan life insurance co and itt corps 
insurance subsidiary sued the company for alleged damage to the 
value of their investment 
clearly bondholders are becoming more active in standing up 
for their rights and that has been especially true since the rjr 
nabisco lbo said lewis knox an executive editor of bondweek 
i dont mean to say that rjr treated its bondholders badly 
he added it was just that people though rjr was a safe bet 
because it was so big

as veteran fire department paramedics working some 
of chicagos meanest streets kevin roche and joe guzzardo thought 
theyd seen just about everything then they they took parttime 
jobs staffing the medical office at the chicago board of trade 
the one ill never forget said guzzardo is the time a guy 
came in here with part of a pencil sticking out of his chest i 
mean it gets rough in the trading pits every so often and we get 
lots of guys stabbed with pencils 
hands are pretty common and every once in a while a guy will 
get stuck in the face but this guy got it in the chest and the poor 
guy was panicking so much we pulled it out ourselves instead of 
sending him over to the hospital 
and as soon as we finished bandaging him up guzzardo said 
he puts his jacket back on and went back to trade 
roche nods then adds thank god theyre making pencils out of 
graphite 
because if they were still using lead wed have lost a few 
guys 
to be truthful a typical day at the board of trades medical 
office located just a few stops down the marblepaneled hallway 
from the coat room of the sprawling futures market is less like an 
episode of the television series mash than a commercial for 
maytag appliances 
an average of 10 to 15 traders find their way into the office 
each day about half for what amounts to regularly scheduled 
maintenance and the other half for cuts and bruises flu your 
normal stuff said roche 
we monitor about 200 guys on a regular basisblood pressure 
headaches and dizziness the occasional diabetic the funny thing 
he said is that people probably guess with all the pressure and 
high stakes around this place wed get lots of guys coming 
inhyperventilating and such 
but ive been here since they opened the office and never once 
has a guy come in here sweating or bugeyed or anything and said 
jeez i just lost my shirt 
most of the guys with a history of high blood pressure or heart 
troubles are under the regular care of the doctor we see them at 
the beginning of the day or the end he said you can never get 
a feel for whats going on in the pits by what happens in here 
the medical office was created in 1978 in case of health 
emergencies at the fastgrowing exchange a leading us center for 
trading futures contracts in items that range from grains to 
soybeans to treasury bonds 
today if offers a range of services and equipment far beyond its 
humble origins in the beginning roche notes pointing to a small 
photo on the wall the office was a cabinet with a single oxygen 
tank inside 
today it boasts emergency lifesupport and stateoftheart 
heart and respiratory monitoring systems and is staffed by six 
chicago fire department paramedics working on a revolving basis 
during their 36 hours between shifts 
despite having worked at the board of trade for 10 years roche 
said he does little other than keeping abreast of how some of the 
commodities traded there might be doing strictly for the sake of 
conversation and doesnt dabble 
no way he said you might hear somebody say something 
about this or that or the other but its something id never get 
into 
look he added ive got more than enough stress in my 
regular job

retail giant sears roebuck and co in the midst 
of an overhaul of its operation has for the first time signed up an 
outside designer to develop three new lines of housebrand womens 
wear 
the move is limited in scope said sears spokeswoman kathy 
gucfa but has tremendous potential 
sears occasionally had used outside consultants in the past she 
said but never to the extent of having them handle the entire 
project 
its an indication were more open to some fresh outside 
ideas ms gucfa said were looking at difference approaches to 
our business 
sears tends to be better known for its durable goods than for 
fashions 
the companys recent restructuring moves ranging from the 
marketing of its landmark sears tower the worlds tallest building 
to everyday low prices systemwide include a move toward increased 
use of outside name brands 
but that move was not so strong in clothing departments ms 
gucfa said 
the whole store still has more private that national brands 
but in apparel even more so she said 
the new lines will be privatelabel merchandise from associated 
merchandising co of new york owned by a group of the nations 
largest department stores 
ms gucfa said the new sportswear lines from amc are to include 
premises fashionable separates at better prices middlebrook 
park offering more traditional styles and a third line not yet 
named more of larger apparel 
while premises is a little more upscale than the clothing 
traditionally offered sears women customers none of it is a 
departure for us she said its still sears

the first time in 19 months capping a fiveday rally on the new 
york mercantile exchange

benchmark grade of crude oil hit 2033 a barrel on friday the 
highest level since aug 14 1987 when crude prices closed at 
2057 the contract closed at 1984 in the previous session 
on monday crude prices crossed a resistance level of 19 after 
fluctuating in the 18 range the previous two weeks since friday 
when the contract stood at 1850 prices have risen 183 driven 
by several reports pointing to a decline in available raw petroleum 
traders said 
this week had one piece of bullish news after another in a 
market that is technically strong said james r fiedler vice 
president in charge of energy brokering for edampf man 
international futures inc 
the reports indicated falling us inventories a tightening of 
crude oil supplies in the gulf of mexico a major us oilproducing 
region problems in the north sea that temporarily disrupted 
production at a large norwegian oil complex and sharp cutbacks by 
saudi arabia to japan europe and the united states 
among refined products traded on the exchange friday unleaded 
gasoline for april delivery declined 021 cent to 5562 a gallon and 
april heating oil fell 026 cent to close at 5357 cents 
traders said april and may gasoline prices were under pressure 
from fridays announcement that the environmental protection agency 
would not enforce new higher octane rules for some northeastern 
states until after june 1 instead of may 15 as previously announced 
traders said the strong showing on the april crude oil contract 
was due largely to short covering or buying to repay borrowed 
positions in advance of the contracts expiration on monday when 
many players will be out of the market for a national petroleum 
refiners conference 
there was a definite reluctance to sell people were buying 
said stephen piasio vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc

gains for secondhalf contracts traders said investors remained 
uncertain about opecs intentions after june when the cartels 
current production quota expires the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries hasnt revealed whether it will raise or lower 
output for the rest of the year although speculation is that the 
cartel will boost production slightly 
opec agreed to its current quota of 185 million barrels a day 
last november after the cartel flooded the market with oil and 
prices sank to 1986 lows since the accord prices have risen more 
than 5 a barrel
