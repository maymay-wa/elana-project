soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
urging an end to suspicions and the legacies of the past called 
wednesday for international cooperation on the environment space 
and afghanistan in a dramatic un speech punctuated by his pledge 
to reduce moscows troops 
gorbachev in an upbeat visit to new york that mixed business 
with tourism said presidentelect george bush will find in us a 
partner who is ready without long pause or backtracking to 
continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism openness and good 
will 
late wednesday a senior communist party official said gorbachev 
would cut short his trip to the united states and cancel his planned 
excursions to cuba and london to return home because of a 
devastating earthquake that struck the soviet caucasus region while 
the soviet leader was in new york a scientist in the capital of the 
republic of armenia estimated the death toll would run into 
thousands 
in his first address to the 159nation general assembly 
gorbachev also suggested the united nations deploy a peacekeeping 
force to afghanistan to oversee the withdrawal of soviet soldiers 
and the transition to a broadbased government he called for a jan 
1 ceasefire in the country 
gorbachev covered a range of topics and extolled peaceful 
coexistence in the world in his hourlong address he urged an end 
to cold war animosities 
after his speech gorbachev ate lunch with president reagan and 
bush on nearby governors island standing along a fence facing the 
statue of liberty gorbachev said the men had a good 
conversation 
later he and his wife raisa visited the world trade center 
where he thanked new yorkers for this warm hospitality dressed 
in a grey overcoat gorbachev said he hoped the superpowers would 
get rid as soon as we can of all suspicions and the legacies of 
the past 
asked if he pressed reagan for anything in return for his pledge 
to trim the soviet military by 500000 troops gorbachev said in 
developing our relations we can work only together so we do hope 
that the united states and the europeans will work with us and will 
take certain steps 
but the luncheon session was not a negotiating meeting 
gorbachev said adding he was happy to join reagan and bush in 
this gettogether 
it was the fifth meeting between reagan and gorbachev who was in 
washington a year ago to sign a treaty reducing intermediate and 
mediumrange missiles 
we are at the birth of a new model of ensuring security not 
through the buildup of arms but to the contrary through their 
reduction on the basis of compromise gorbachev said 
besides detailing troop reduction gorbachev outlined a number of 
proposals on a broad array of topics in his un speech 
he said for instance the soviet union is ready to impose a 
moratorium of up to century on debt servicing by poor countries and 
in some cases write off the debts 
he suggested an international space station monitor the 
environment and discussed having the international court of justice 
in the hague arbitrate human rights cases 
at home he said soviet democracy will be place on a solid 
normative basis with glasnost or openness and freedom of 
conscience enshrined in law 
members of the general assembly greeted gorbachev with sustained 
applause at the end of his 26page speech but they did not give him 
a standing ovation 
general assembly president dante caputo the foreign minister of 
argentina praised gorbachevs address as a very important speech 
with specific proposals on disarmament regional conflicts 
development and ecology he said it contained a new 
philosophical approach in soviet foreign policy 
gorbachev emphasized disarmament which he called the main 
issue and provided details of his unilateral initiatives to 
reduce the red armys strength 
today i can report to you that the soviet union has taken a 
decision to reduce its armed forces he said 
within the next two years their numerical strength will be 
reduced by 500000 men the numbers of conventional armaments will 
also be lsubstantially reduced this will be done unilaterally 
without relation to talks on conventional disarmament in vienna 
he said 
by agreement with the warsaw pact allies the soviet union will 
withdraw and disband six tank divisions from east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary by 1991 
altogether he said soviet forces stationed in those three 
countries will be reduced by 50000 men some 5000 tanks will also 
be slashed he said 
the soviet union will also reorganize soviet divisions in eastern 
europe so they are clearly defensive 
gorbachev said the soviet union plans to cut soldiers and 
armaments in european part of his country and in its asian 
territory in mongolia for instance a major portion of soviet 
troops temporarily stationed there will return home he said 
but gorbachev warned we shall maintain our countrys defense 
capability at a level of reasonable and reliable sufficiency so 
that no one might be tempted to encroach on the security of the 
ussr and our allies 
turning to relations with the united states he said no one 
underestimates the seriousness of our differences and the 
toughness of outstanding problems 
but he said we have graduated from the primary school of 
learning to understand each other and seek solutions in our own and 
common interests 
the soviet union wants to work with the bush administration for 
consistent movement toward a treaty on 50 percent reduction in 
strategic offensive arms while preserving the antiballistic 
missile treaty he said

the best news for fans of animated movies came 
with last weeks boxoffice report which showed big grosses for 
the land before time and oliver and company 
revival of animation the most tedious and expensive kind of 
filmmaking has been predicted every few years until recently 
though economics made animation features risky but in their first 
weekend the land before time topped all releases with 75 
million in 1395 theaters 5395 average and oliver and 
company in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no 4 with 4 
million 4226 average 
those are big numbers and theyre likely to grow through the 
holiday season thats encouraging for the animation trade which 
has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but 
the nature of the audience 
a large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission 
price said don bluth who produced the land before time 
if we make a boffo with a picture its because we sold more 
tickets bluth who formerly worked for the disney co cautiously 
predicts a renaissance of animation 
walt disney pictures which produced oliver and company has 
pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional 
facility at the disneymgm studio tour in florida roy e disney 
nephew of walt is largely responsible for the revival four years 
ago when roy helped create a new management at disney the outlook 
was dismal 
animation was dying around here he said in an interview at 
his studio office there had been 10 years of a kind of lack of 
faith in it and a lack of direction to it there were an awful lot 
of discouraged artists working here 
we were finishing up the black cauldron which had been an 
enormous sevenyear effort with the kind of strange idea of doing 
an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of 
what the story was there were a lot of people who thought we just 
werent going forward with the animation department there was even 
talk of getting out of the movie business entirely 
disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads 
who were trained in liveaction films to the uniqueness of the 
animation process 
first of all its a matter of time oliver for eample took 
four years to complete he said his campaign was aided by having 
the great mouse detective in good story form when the movie 
proved a hit all doubts were erased 
oliver and company resulted from a gong show session in 
which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas 
most were shot down but an updated oliver twist survived 
members of fagins gang became dogs as was the newcomer oliver 
but during story development oliver became a kitten 
the young animators worked at a fast clip inspired by the 
casting of the voices including bette midler billy joel dom 
deluise and robert loggia many of the new artists have come from 
the disneyendowed california institute of the arts but disney 
observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art 
the studio wont reveal the cost of oliver and company but 
disney said it was in the middle range for an animated feature 
estimate 18 million computers will increasingly relieve some of 
the tedium of inking and painting he said helping to bring down 
expenses 
but the animation of a character handdrawn in pencil i think 
will never change he said 
bluth who produced the land before time for 12 million 
found a way to reduce animation expense he moved his entire studio 
to ireland because of the labor cost of animation the irish 
government offered a 10year commitment for tax breaks grants for 
irish artists who would be trained and access to bank loans he said 
it was like moses leading the children of israel out of 
egypt said bluth the artists had to pull up all their stakes 
many of them sold their homes 
many of them have bought homes there they all have irish 
accents some have joined the catholic church its a conversion to 
another way of life i dont think many plan to stay there forever 
but they have embraced the irish society 
bluth led an earlier exodus of disney animators during the 
studios low period and produced the secret of nimh a failure 
then he combined with steven spielberg on an american tail a 
rousing success the land before time also resulted from a 
spielberg idea 
i cant understand why no one has made a film about 
dinosaurs bluth recalled spielberg telling him its a 
natural there is a great interest in dinosaurs george lucas and 
myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times but we didnt 
want to do it with puppets we tried that and it didnt work 
with spielberg and lucas as executive producers bluth could 
hardly miss he admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs but he said 
spielberg told him you can learn 
bluth and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating 
dinosaurs for instance the brontosaurus with the long neck it 
has a little head like a ball on a stick it doesnt have the 
shoulders and the hands to give you gestures it all has to be done 
with facial expressions 
but how to make the beasts move bluth and company reasoned that 
the prehistoric creatures were reptiles and birds evolved from 
reptilian forms so the artists copied moves from films of chickens 
and turkeys 
after the opening of the land before time bluth returned to 
the dublin studio where production is under way on the next feature 
all dogs go to heaven which takes place in the hereafter

previous euphemisms for lying are now to use one 
outdated word inoperative in the latest british lingo to withhold 
the truth is to be economical 
economical has been enshrined in the longman register of new 
words among 1200 words and phrases including plonker 
loadsamoney bonk journalism and yah 
all according to longmans editor john ayto have insinuated 
themselves into the language of chaucer shakespeare and dickens 
since 1986 
economical owes its new meaning to court cases involving 
spycatcher the expose by former intelligence official peter 
wright that the government attempted to suppress 
in a court case in australia over spycatcher former british 
civil service head sir robert armstrong admitted he had previously 
been economical wth the truth 
economical thus has come to be euphemism for deliberately 
withholding something from public knowledge the register said 
sexy has been tamed now meaning attractive enjoyable or 
trendy the register said but the language has found new ways to 
talk about the birds and the bees 
the press infatuation with sex has produced the term bonk 
journalism defined in the register as journalism concerned with 
obtaining and printing accounts of the supposed sexual activities of 
wellknown people 
plonker the insult which del boy constantly hurls at his 
younger brother in the british broadcasting corp tv sitcom only 
fools and horses has established itself as a synonym for a 
dimwitted and ineffectual person 
the register regretfully chronicled a growing tendency blamed on 
the former 13 colonies to use nouns as verbs to nuke a usage 
which was denounced as an alarmingly cozy euphemism for starting 
world war iii to stiff or fail in a commercial venture and 
to gender or stereotypically associate something with men or 
women 
several new words and phrases the derogatory dependency 
culture and learned helplessness along with the approving 
can do are owed to prime minister margaret thatcher 
she also is credited with reviving a term from her native 
lincolnshire frit meaning someone who is frightened 
one of her wealthy supporters in the financial world is now said 
to be wellwedged a real loadsamoney 
loadsamoney noun british informal extensive and conspicuous 
wealth the register defines the word comes from a comedian 
harry loadsamoney enfield who portrays a grotesque cashwaving 
character and launched the term on its way from cabaret through the 
house of commons and into the vernacular 
in the wallet of a loadsamoney one might find an archer or 
2000 pounds 3700 a sum that figured prominently in a 1987 
libel suit won by novelist and former conservative party chairman 
jeffrey archer against a newspaper 
a loadsamoney plonker who is soon parted from his archers is to 
be pitied as a lombard loads of money but a real dunce or 
words to that effect 
yuppie tendencies in the political opposition are now disparaged 
as ramada socialism a term credited to labor party lawmaker 
dennis skinner to describe in luxuryhotel terms the 
bourgeoisification of the labor party 
to which the yuppie might concur yah which the register 
describes as the nasal bray of the sloane that refers to the 
fashionable west london turf around sloane square where smart young 
things became known years ago as sloane rangers 
the longman register of new words will be published jan 9

space shuttle atlantis suffered 
heavier than normal damage to its thermal tiles during liftoff on 
its justcompleted flight and about 150 tiles will have to be 
replaced a space agency official said wednesday 
the damage comparatively is significant but its not a major 
concern said conrad nagel atlantis processing director we 
have to understand why we had this damage and keep it from happening 
again 
he said the damage would be easy to repair and would not affect 
atlantis next flight scheduled for liftoff on april 28 overall 
he said the shuttle returned from its secret military mission in a 
very clean condition 
a nasa spokesman dismissed as a hoax a south dakota 
television report that quoted a man as saying shuttle conversations 
from the topsecret military mission came over his phone line during 
a call to california 
roy nyberg who owns a hardware store in sioux falls told 
station kelo he heard ground controllers telling astronauts keep 
your cool amid a problem controlling the cabin temperature he 
also said he heard some vacuum had been lost 
in response nagel said late wednesday that there was a minor 
malfunction in the shuttles air conditioning system the problem 
caused about a gallon of water to leak into the cabin and the 
astronauts recaptured it with a vacuum cleaner nagel said 
david garrett chief of news and information at nasas 
washington dc headquarters nevertheless doubted nybergs story 
theres no way you couldnt hear it youve got a hoax on your 
hand garrett said all the communication was encripted theres 
no way he could have heard it there was no way that i know of that 
anybody couldve heard any airtoground voice communications 
nagel reported the tile bruising apparently occurred during the 
launch phase probably by impact with something loose and that in 
flight the five astronauts inspected and assessed it using a 
television camera on the end of the ships 50foot robot arm 
the shuttle is covered with about 28000 tiles made of various 
materials designed to protect the orbiter from atmospheric reentry 
heat he said the tile damage posed no threat to the shuttles 
return to earth 
nagel said the heaviest damage was concentrated in a strip 
3to4feet long down the right hand side along the line of the 
fuselage 
he said one tile in the nose was missing and it looked like it 
was popped off by the impact of something 
there was speculation here that a part from the solid fuel 
booster rockets the external tank or the orbiter might have fallen 
off and hit the craft nagel said he did not want to speculate 
he said a small fiberglass panel was missing from one of 
atlantis maneuvering engines but nasa said this probably did not 
cause the problem 
nagel made his comments in an interview from edwards air force 
base calif where he leads a team that is inspecting atlantis and 
preparing it for return to the kennedy space center here atop a 
boeing 747 airliner 
he said atlantis tile damage was about twice that suffered by 
discovery which made the first postchallenger shuttle flight two 
months ago 
it appears that between 125 and 175 tiles will have to be 
scrapped and replaced nagel said in addition he said scores of 
tiles with scratches and dings will have to be repaired in place 
dinged tiles are common on a shuttle with much of the damage 
being caused by objects kicked up from the runway when the vehicle 
lands 
he reported brakes and about 200 other systems modified since the 
challenger explosion 34 months ago worked well he said that during 
the fourday flight there were only a few technical problems most 
involving system monitoring instruments 
he said atlantis and the boeing 747 would leave edwards on sunday 
and stop overnight at kelly air force base near san antonio before 
arriving at the kennedy space center on monday

this muggy port city has become the 
base of operations for colombian drug gangs that are turning tiny 
ecuador a nation of just 10 million people into a crossroads for 
the world cocaine trade 
in the last two years the amount of colombian cocaine flowing 
through the andean nation en route to the united states and europe 
has increased dramatically according to ecuadorean narcotics police 
and the us drug enforcement administration dea 
officials also fear colombias drug barons are seeking to use 
ecuador to launder their huge cocaine profits and to invest in 
legitimate enterprises 
the enormous profits from drug trafficking have converted it 
into an octopus whose tentacles are threatening to strangle 
ecuador president leon febres cordero said in may three months 
before his term ended 
john powell head of dea operations in ecuador estimated that 30 
to 50 tons of cocaine will have been smuggled into and out of 
ecuador by the end of this year 
just in the first six months of this year theres been over 5 
tons of cocaine seized in other countries that we know came through 
ecuador powell said in an interview 
the significance of the figures can be seen in us estimates 
that 72 tons of cocaine are consumed annually in the united states 
colombias drug lords have diverted much of their cocaine through 
ecuador after narcotics officials in the united states and europe 
began searching colombian planes and ships more thoroughly say 
police and us drug officers 
ecuador is wedged between peru and colombia on the northwest 
shoulder of south america peru is the worlds largest grower of 
coca leaf the raw material of cocaine colombia is home to the drug 
cartels that control the worlds cocaine trade 
if you put pressure on in one place the traffickers have to go 
somewhere else and ecuador is handy powell said theyve been 
using it for a while anyway to get coca paste from peru to colombia 
for processing 
the seizures of pure cocaine smuggled in containers aboard 
freighters from guayaquil this year include 
5129 pounds discovered in a chocolate shipment at newark 
nj in june it was the largest cocaine seizure ever made by us 
authorities outside florida 
2860 pounds discovered by us federal agents in april in port 
everglades fla it was buried in a shipment of frozen fruit pulp to 
prevent detection by dogs trained to sniff out drugs 
759 pounds found hidden between the wood paneling of 
prefabricated walls shipped in march to barcelona spain it was one 
of the largest seizures of cocaine ever made in europe 
since 1986 us customs officials also have seized five 
ecuatoriana cargo and passenger planes that have landed in miami and 
new york with cocaine hidden aboard the stateowned airline has had 
to pay more than 4 million in fines to gain the release of the 
planes 
ecuador is beginning to feel the breath of the colombian 
mafia said col gustavo gallegos head of interpol in ecuador 
the menace of the mafia also is seen in the attempt to convert 
ecuador into a major moneylaundering country 
because of its bank secrecy laws this is an ideal place to 
launder drug profits powell said 
ecuadorean bankers estimate that 200 million to 400 million in 
cocaine money will have entered ecuador by the end of this year 
either for laundering or for investment in legitimate businesses 
thats a lot of money coming into a small country like ecuador 
it can have a corrupting influence powell said 
newspapers have complained in recent editorials about colombian 
drug money corrupting judges and driving up the price of real estate 
tracking down the source of the money is complicated by the fact 
that investments by apparently legitimate colombian companies have 
also increased sharply in the last few years 
ecuadors largest brewery is among the most recent and prominent 
of the colombian purchases 
some 120000 colombian tourists are expected to visit ecuador 
this year making it hard for ecuadors narcotics police to keep 
track of suspicious visitors 
colombian traffickers enter here easily with false identities 
they buy property open businesses interpols gallegos said in an 
interview in quito the highland capital once they are set up 
with everything in legal order they begin to export cocaine 
authorities are investigating some 20 guayaquil export companies 
bought by colombians in the past year including the firm that 
shipped cocaine in containers of chocalate to the united states 
febres cordero the former president is credited by us 
narcotics officials with destroying nearly all the coca plantations 
that colombian cocaine traffickers tried to set up several years ago 
in remote jungle regions bordering colombia 
powell said us officials are confident ecuadors new president 
rodrigo borja and his police officials will try to outperform 
the febres cordero government in the drug war 
they see narcotics as a threat to the stability of the 
government he said it doesnt take any genius to look next 
door to peru or colombia to see the disastrous effects the cocaine 
trade has had on those countries

president jose napoleon duarte of el salvador 
has left a military hospital where he spent six days after falling 
ill during inauguration ceremonies for mexicos president 
duarte who suffers from incurable liver cancer was released 
wednesday 
he was hospitalized with stomach pains shortly after carlos 
salinas de gortari was inaugurated last week and doctors said he 
was suffering from an intestinal infection 
hes in high spirits he feels good and well be going to el 
salvador soon said duartes doctor jose luis saca hes 
reacted well to a bland diet 
he said duarte might be able to return home today 
in june doctors diagnosed duarte with cancer and gave him from 
six to 18 months to live however they have said recently that his 
condition has improved remarkably 
at a brief news conference before leaving the hospital duarte 
said it would be hard to set up a christmas truce with the rebel 
farabundo marti liberation front 
the problem is that the terrorists have a concept of violent 
war of reaching objectives via terrorism that i cant agree 
with duarte said

new york tycoon donald trumps 
282foot yacht is too much for palm beach or fort lauderdales 
upscale pier 66 hotel and marina but just right for the best 
western 
the trump princess was arriving today but its too big to tie up 
behind maralago his palm beach mansion or navigate the channel 
to pier 66 
it turns out that the only private marina in the area large 
enough for the big boat is the best western marina inn and yacht 
harbor 
weve never had anything like this at the best western said 
general manager shirley kilpatrick 
she said she doesnt expect trump himself to stay in the hotel 
but if he does well certainly quote him a corporate rate 
the hotel owner was not too happy about the yachts arrival 
saying she was worried the princess might crash through the sea wall 
that however raised the troubling prospect of how to say no 
to trump 
what really had me worried was that if i told them they 
couldnt stay they would just say how much do you want for the 
place ms kilpatrick said

a project thats supposed to be the west 
coasts rival to the statue of liberty is drawing bad reviews from 
some who say the proposed avantgarde monument resembles earthquake 
rubble and would be an eye sore 
the winning design for the privately funded project that will 
cost up to 45 million was unveiled this week by a blueribbon 
committee appointed by mayor tom bradley 
the winning entry called clouds of steel follows the 
deconstructivism movement of modern architecture in which buildings 
seem to lack symmetry 
it was designed by new york architects hani rashid and lise anne 
couture whose mission was to create a structure to celebrate los 
angeles ethnic diversity 
it looks like a freeway that just blew up or after an 
earthquake said city councilwoman gloria molina of the monument 
that would straddle the hollywood freeway this is too strange for 
los angeles to ever appreciate it or grow to like 
councilman ernani bernardi is concerned motorists will pay more 
attention to the monument a conglomeration of twisted steel than 
to driving i think it will be a terrible hazard he said 
we have to be open to possibilities argued former gov 
edmund g brown jr people are always laughing at innovation art 
is what isnt it is creation 
michael rotondi director of the southern california institute of 
architecture and one of 13 members of the international selection 
committee conceded many on the panel had never been to los angeles 
but he said they are some of the most forward thinkers in 
architecture even if they havent been to los angeles they know 
the work of los angeles

here is the englishlanguage text of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs speech to the united nations as 
provided by the soviet mission 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
esteemed mr president esteemed mr secretary general 
distinguished delegates 
we have come here to show our respect for the united nations 
which increasingly has been manifesting its ability to act as a 
unique international center in the service of peace and security 
we have come here to show our respect for the dignity of this 
organization capable of accumulating the collective wisdom and will 
of mankind 
recent events have been making it increasingly clear that the 
world needs such an organization and that the organization itself 
needs active involvement of all of its members their support for 
its initiatives and actions and their potentialities and original 
contributions that enrich its activity 
a little more than a year ago in an article entitled realities 
and the guarantees of a secure world i set out some ideas on 
problems of concern to the united nations 
the time since then has given fresh food for thought world 
developments have indeed come to a crucial point 
the role played by the soviet union in world affairs is 
wellknown and in view of the revolutionary perestroika under way in 
our country which contains a tremendous potential for peace and 
international cooperation we are now particularly interested in 
being properly understood 
that is why we have come here to address this most authoritative 
world body and to share our thoughts with it we want it to be the 
first to learn of our new important decisions 
what will mankind be like when it enters the twentyfirst 
century people are already fascinated by this not too distant 
future we are looking ahead to it with hopes for the best and yet 
with a feeling of concern 
the world in which we live today is radically different from what 
it was at the beginning or even in the middle of this century and 
it continues to change as do all its components 
the advent of nuclear weapons was just another tragic reminder of 
the fundamental nature of that change a material symbol and 
expression of absolute military power nuclear weapons at the same 
time revealed the absolute limits of that power 
the problem of mankinds survival and selfpreservation came to 
the fore 
we are witnessing most profound social change 
whether in the east or the south the west or the north hundreds 
of millions of people new nations and states new public movements 
and ideologies have moved to the forefront of history 
broadbased and frequently turbulent popular movements have given 
expression in a multidimensional and contradictory way to a 
longing for independence democracy and social justice the idea of 
democratizing the entire world order has become a powerful 
sociopolitical force 
at the same time the scientific and technological revolution has 
turned many economic food energy environmental information and 
population problems which only recently we treated as national or 
regional ones into global problems 
thanks to the advances in mass media and means of transportation 
the world seems to have become more visible and tangible 
international communication has become easier than ever before 
today the preservation of any kind of closed society is 
hardly possible this calls for a radical review of approaches to 
the totality of the problems of international cooperation as a major 
element of universal security 
the world economy is becoming a single organism and no state 
whatever its social system or economic status can normally develop 
outside it this places on the agenda the need to devise a 
fundamentally new machinery for the functioning of the world 
economy a new structure of the international division of labor 
at the same time the growth of the world economy reveals the 
contradictions and limits inherent in traditionaltype 
industrialization its further extension and intensification spell 
environmental catastrophe 
but there are still many countries without sufficiently developed 
industries and some have not yet moved beyond the preindustrial 
stage one of the major problems is whether the process of their 
economic growth will follow the old technological patterns or they 
can join in the search for environmentally clean production 
and there is another problem instead of diminishing the gap 
between the developed and most of the developing countries is 
increasingly growing into a serious global threat 
hence the need to begin a search for a fundamentally new type of 
industrial progress one that would meet the interests of all 
peoples and states 
in a word the new realities are changing the entire world 
situation the differences and contradictions inherited from the 
past are diminishing or being displaced but new ones are emerging 
some of the past differences and disputes are losing their 
importance but conflicts of a different kind are taking their place 
life is making us abandon established stereotypes and outdated 
views it is making us discard illusions 
the very concept of the nature and criteria of progress is 
changing 
it would be naive to think that the problems plaguing mankind 
today can be solved with the means and methods which were applied or 
seemed to work in the past 
indeed mankind has accumulated a wealth of experience in the 
process of political economic and social development under highly 
diverse conditions but that experience belongs to the practices and 
to the world that have become or are becoming part of the past 
this is one of the signs of the crucial nature of the current 
phase in history 
the greatest philosophers sought to grasp the laws of social 
development and find an answer to the main question how to make 
mans life happy just and safe two great revolutions the french 
revolution of 1789 and the russian revolution of 1917 exerted a 
powerful impact on the very nature of history and radically changed 
the course of world developments 
both of them each in its own way gave a tremendous impetus to 
mankinds progress to a large extent those two revolutions shaped 
the way of thinking that is still prevalent in social consciousness 
it is a most precious spiritual heritage 
but today we face a different world for which we must seek a 
different road to the future in seeking it we must of course 
draw on the accumulated experience and yet be aware of the 
fundamental differences between the situation yesterday and what we 
are facing today 
but the novelty of the tasks before us as well as their 
difficulty goes beyond that today we have entered an era when 
progress will be shaped by universal human interests

the awareness of this dictates that world politics too should 
be guided by the primacy of universal human values 
the history of past centuries and millennia was a history of wars 
that raged almost everywhere of frequent desperate battles to the 
point of mutual annihilation 
they grew out of clashes of social and political interests 
national enmity ideological or religious incompatibility all this 
did happen 
and even today many would want these vestiges of the past to be 
accepted as immutable law 
but concurrently with wars animosities and divisions among 
peoples and countries another trend with equally objective causes 
was gaining momentum the process of the emergence of a mutually 
interrelated and integral world 
today further world progress is only possible through a search 
for universal human consensus as we move forward to a new world 
order 
we have come to a point when the disorderly play of elemental 
forces leads into an impasse the international community must learn 
how it can shape and guide developments in such a way as to preserve 
our civilization to make it safe for all and more conducive to 
normal life 
we are speaking of cooperation which could be more accurately 
termed cocreation and codevelopment 
the formula of development at the expense of others is on the 
way out in the light of existing realities no genuine progress is 
possible at the expense of the rights and freedoms of individuals 
and nations or at the expense of nature 
efforts to solve global problems require a new scope and quality 
of interaction of states and sociopolitical currents regardless of 
ideological or other differences 
of course radical changes and revolutionary transformations will 
continue to occur within individual countries and social structures 
this is how it was and how it will be 
but here too our time marks a change internal transformations 
no longer can advance their national goals if they develop just 
along parallel courses with others without making use of the 
achievements of the outside world and of the potential inherent in 
equitable cooperation 
in these circumstances any interference in those internal 
developments designed to redirect them to someones liking would 
have all the more destructive consequences for establishing a 
peaceful order 
in the past differences were often a factor causing mutual 
rejection now they have a chance of becoming a factor for mutual 
enrichment and mutual attraction 
behind differences in social systems in the way of life and in 
preferences for certain values stand differing interests there is 
no escaping that fact 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
but equally there is no escaping the need to find a balance of 
interests within an international framework which has become a 
condition for survival and progress 
pondering all this one comes to the conclusion that if we are to 
take into account the lessons of the past and the realities of the 
present if we are to reckon with the objective logic of world 
development we must look for ways to improve the international 
situation and build a new world and we must do it together 
and if so we ought to agree on the basic truly universal 
prerequisites and principles of such action 
it is obvious for instance that the use or threat of force no 
longer can or must be an instrument of foreign policy this applies 
above all to nuclear arms but that is not the only thing that 
matters all of us and primarily the stronger of us must exercise 
selfrestraint and totally rule out any outwardoriented use of 
force 
that is the first and the most important component of a 
nonviolent world as an ideal which we proclaimed together with 
india in the delhi declaration and which we invite you to follow 
after all it is now quite clear that building up military power 
makes no country omnipotent what is more onesided reliance on 
military power ultimately weakens other components of national 
security 
it is also quite clear to us that the principle of freedom of 
choice is mandatory its nonrecognition is fraught with extremely 
grave consequences for world peace 
denying that right to the peoples under whatever pretext or 
rhetorical guise means jeopardizing even the fragile balance that 
has been attained freedom of choice is a universal principle that 
should allow for no exceptions 
it was not simply out of good intentions that we came to the 
conclusion that this principle is absolute we were driven to it by 
an unbiased analysis of the objective trends of today 
more and more characteristic of them is the increasingly 
multioptional nature of social development in different countries 
this applies both to the capitalist and to the socialist system the 
diversity of the sociopolitical structures that have grown over the 
past decades out of national liberation movements also attests to 
this 
this objective fact calls for respect for the views and positions 
of others tolerance a willingness to perceive something different 
as not necessarily bad or hostile and an ability to learn to live 
sidebyside with others while remaining different and not always 
agreeing with each other 
as the world asserts its diversity attempts to look down on 
others and to teach them ones own brand of democracy become totally 
improper to say nothing of the fact that democratic values intended 
for export often very quickly lose their worth 
what we are talking about therefore is unity in diversity if 
we assert this politically if we reaffirm our adherence to freedom 
of choice then there is no room for the view that some live on 
earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quite by chance 
the time has come to discard such thinking and to shape our 
policies accordingly that would open up prospects for strengthening 
the unity of the world 
the new phase also requires deideologizing relations among 
states we are not abandoning our convictions our philosophy or 
traditions nor do we urge anyone to abandon theirs 
but neither do we have any intention to be hemmed in by our 
values that would result in intellectual impoverishment for it 
would mean rejecting a powerful source of development the exchange 
of everything original that each nation has independently created 
in the course of such exchange let everyone show the advantages 
of their social system way of life or values and not just by 
words or propaganda but by real deeds 
that would be a fair rivalry of ideologies but it should not be 
extended to relations among states otherwise we would simply be 
unable to solve any of the worlds problems such as 
developing wideranging mutually beneficial and equitable 
cooperation among nations 
making efficient use of the achievements of scientific and 
technological revolution 
restructuring the world economy and protecting the environment 
overcoming backwardness eliminating hunger disease illiteracy 
and other global scourges 
nor of course shall we then be able to eliminate the nuclear 
threat and militarism 
those are our reflections on the patterns of world development at 
the threshold of the 21st century 
we are of course far from claiming to be in possession of the 
ultimate truth but on the basis of a thorough analysis of the past 
and newly emerging realities we have concluded that it is on those 
lines that we should jointly seek the way leading to the supremacy 
of the universal human idea over the endless multitude of 
centrifugal forces the way to preserve the vitality of this 
civilization possibly the only one in the entire universe 
could this view be a little too romantic are we not 
overestimating the potential and the maturity of the worlds social 
consciousness we have heard such doubts and such questions both in 
our country and from some of our western partners 
i am convinced that we are not floating above reality 
forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or 
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace the peoples and 
large sectors of the public do indeed ardently wish for an 
improvement in the situation they want to learn to cooperate 
it is sometimes even amazing how powerful this trend is it is 
also important that it is beginning to shape policies 
changes in philosophical approaches and in political relations 
form a solid prerequisite for imparting in line with worldwide 
objective processes a powerful impetus to the efforts designed to 
establish new relations among states 
even those politicians whose activities used to be geared to the 
cold war and sometimes linked with its mostcritical phases are now 
drawing appropriate conclusions of all people they find it 
particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes and past practices 
and if even they are changing course it is clear that when new 
generations take over opportunities will increase in number 
in short the understanding of the need for a period of peace is 
gaining ground and beginning to prevail this has made it possible 
to take the first real steps in creating a healthier international 
environment and in disarmament 
what are the practical implications of that it would be natural 
and sensible not to abandon everything positive that has already 
been accomplished and to build on all the gains of the past few 
years on all that we have created working together 
i am referring to the process of negotiations on nuclear arms 
conventional weapons and chemical weapons and to the search for 
political approaches to ending regional conflicts 
of course i am referring above all to political dialogue a 
more intense and open dialogue pointed at the very heart of problems 
instead of confrontation at an exchange of constructive ideas 
instead of recriminations without political dialogue the process 
of negotiations cannot advance 
we regard prospects for the near and more distant future quite 
optimistically 
just look at the changes in our relations with the united states 
little by little mutual understanding has started to develop and 
elements of trust have emerged without which it is very hard to 
make headway in politics 
in europe these elements are even more numerous the helsinki 
process is a great process i believe that it remains fully valid 
its philosophical political practical and other dimensions must 
all be preserved and enhanced while taking into account new 
circumstance 
</TEXT>

current realities make it imperative that the dialogue that 
ensures normal and constructive evolution of international affairs 
involve on a continuous and active basis all countries and regions 
of the world including such major powers as india china japan 
and brazil and other countries big medium and small 
i am in favor of a more dynamic and substantive political 
dialogue of strengthening the political prequisites needed to 
improve the international climate that would make it easier to find 
practical solutions to many problems tough as it may be this is 
the road that we must travel 
everyone should join in the movement toward greater unity of the 
world 
today this is particularly important for we are approaching a 
very important point when we shall have to face the question of how 
to assure the worlds solidarity and the stability and dynamism of 
international relations 
and yet in my taiks with foreign government and political 
leaders with whom i have had over 200 meetings i could sometimes 
sense their dissatisfaction over the fact that at this crucial time 
for one reason or another they sometimes find themselves as it 
were on the sidelines of the main issues of world politics 
it is natural and appropriate that no one is willing to resign 
oneself to that 
if although different we are indeed part of the same 
civilization if we are aware of the interdependence of the 
contemporary world then this fact must be increasingly present in 
politics and in the practical efforts to harmonize international 
relations perhaps the term perestroika would not be quite 
appropriate in this context but i do call for building new 
international relations 
i am convinced that our time and the realities of todays world 
call for internationalizing dialogue and the negotiating process 
this is the main the most general conclusion that we have come 
to in studying global trends that have been gaining momentum in 
recent years and in participating in world politics 
in this specific historical situation we face the question of a 
new role for the united nations 
we feel that states must to some extent review their attitude to 
the united nations this unique instrument without which world 
politics would be inconceivable today 
the recent reinvigoration of its peacemaking role has again 
demonstrated the united nations ability to assist its members in 
coping with the daunting challenges of our time and working to 
humanize their relations 
regrettably shortly after it was established the organization 
went through the onslaught of the cold war for many years it was 
the scene of propaganda battles and continuous political 
confrontation 
let historians argue who is more and who is less to blame for it 
what political leaders today need to do is to draw lessons from that 
chapter in the history of the united nations which turned out to be 
at odds with the very meaning and objectives of our organization 
one of the most bitter and important lessoms lies in the long 
list of missed opportunities as a result at a certain point the 
authority of the united nations diminished and many of its attempts 
to act failed 
it is highly significant that the reinvigoration of the role of 
the united nations is linked to an improvement in the international 
climate 
in a way the united nations blends together the interests of 
different states it is the only organization capable of merging 
into a single current their bilateral regional and global efforts 
new prospects are opening up for it in all areas that fall 
naturally under its responsibility in the politicomilitary 
economic scientific technological environmental and humanitarian 
areas 
take for example the problem of development which is a truly 
universal human problem conditions in which tens of millions of 
people live in a number of third world regions are becoming a real 
threat to all mankind 
no closed entities or even regional communities of states 
important as they are are capable of untangling the main knots that 
tie up the principal avenues of world economic relations 
northsouth eastwest southsouth southeast and easteast 
what is needed here is joining the efforts and taking into 
account the interests of all groups of countries something that 
only this organization the united nations can accomplish 
external debt is one of the gravest problems 
let us not forget that in the age of colonialism the developing 
world at the cost of countless losses and sacrifices financed the 
prosperity of a large portion of the world community the time has 
come to make up for the losses that accompanied its historic and 
tragic contribution to global material progress 
we are convinced that here too internationalizing our approach 
shows a way out 
looking at things realistically one has to admit that the 
accumulated debt cannot be repaid or recovered on the original terms 
the soviet union is prepared to institute a lengthy moratorium of 
up to 100 years on debt servicing by the least developed countries 
and in quite a few cases to write off the debt altogether 
as regards other developing countries we invite you to consider 
the following 
limiting their official debt servicing payments depending on the 
economic performance of each of them or granting them a long pariod 
of deferral in the repayment of a major portion of their debt 
supporting the appeal of the united nations conference on trade 
and development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks 
guaranteeing government support for market arrangements to 
assist in third world debt settlement including the formation of a 
specialized international agency that would repurchase debts at a 
discount 
the soviet union favours a substantive discussion of ways to 
settle the debt crisis at multilateral forums including 
consultations under the auspices of the united nations among heads 
of government of debtor and creditor countries 
international economic security is inconceivable unless related 
not only to disarmament but also to the elimination of the threat to 
the worlds environment in a number of regions the state of the 
environment is simply frightening 
a conference on the environment within the framework of the 
united nations is scheduled for 1992 we welcome this decision and 
are working to have this forum produce results that would be 
commensurate with the scope of the problem 
but time is running out much is being done in various countries 
here again i would just like to underscore most emphatically the 
prospects opening up in the process of disarmament particularly 
of course nuclear disarmament for environmental revival

let us also think about setting up within the framework of the 
united nations a center for emergency environmental assistance its 
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts 
to areas with badly deteriorating environment 
the soviet union is also ready to cooperate in establishing an 
international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed 
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment 
in the general area of space exploration the outlines of a 
future space industry are becoming increasingly clear 
the position of the soviet union is well known activities in 
outer space must rule out the appearance of weapons there here 
again there has to be a legal base the groundwork for it the 
provisions of the 1967 treaty and other agreements is already in 
place 
however there is already a strongly felt need to develop an 
allembracing regime for peaceful work in outer space the 
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a 
world space organization 
we have put forward our proposal to establish it on more than one 
occasion we are prepared to incorporate within its system our 
krasnoyarsk radar station a decision has already been taken to 
place that radar under the authority of the ussr academy of 
sciences 
soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign 
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an 
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and 
refitting certain units and structures and to provide additional 
equipment 
the entire system could function under the auspices of the united 
nations 
the whole world welcomes the efforts of this organization and its 
secretarygeneral mr perez de cuellar and his representatives in 
untying knots of regional problems 
allow me to elaborate on this 
paraphrasing the words of the english poet that hemingway took as 
an epigraph to his famous novel i will say this the bell of every 
regional conflict tolls for all of us 
this is particularly true since those conflicts are taking place 
in the third world which already faces many ills and problems of 
such magnitude that is has to be a matter of concern to us all 
the year 1988 has brought a glimmer of hope in this area of our 
common concerns as well this has been felt in almost all regional 
crises on some of them there has been movement we welcome it and 
we did what we could to contribute to it 
i will single out only afghanistan 
the geneva accords whose fundamental and practical significance 
has been praised throughout the world provided a possibility for 
completing the process of settlement even before the end of this 
year that did not happen 
this unfortunate fact reminds us again of the political legal 
and moral significance of the roman maxim pacta sunt servanda 
treaties must be observed 
i dont want to use this rostrum for recriminations against 
anyone 
but it is our view that within the competence of the united 
nations the general assembly resolution adopted last november could 
be supplemented by some specific measures 
in the words of that resolution for the urgent achievement of a 
comprehensive solution by the afghans themselves of the question of 
a broadbased government the following should be undertaken 
a complete ceasefire effective everywhere as of jan 1 l989 
and the cessation of all offensive operations or shellings with the 
opposing afghan groups retaining for the duration of negotiations 
all territories under their control 
linked to that stopping as of the same date any supplies of 
arms to all belligerents 
for the period of establishing a broadbased government as 
provided in the general assembly resolution sending to kabul and 
other strategic centres of the country a contingent of united 
nations peacekeeping forces 
we also request the secretarygeneral to facilitate early 
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on 
the neutrality and demilitarization of afghanistan 
we shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds 
of the war and are prepared to cooperate in this endeavor both with 
the united nations and on a bilateral basis 
we support the proposal to create under the auspices of the 
united nations a voluntary international peace corps to assist in 
the revival of afghanistan 
in the context of the problem of settling regional conflicts i 
have to express my opinion on the serious incident that has recently 
affected the work of this session the chairman of an organization 
which has observer status at the united nations was not allowed by 
us authorities to come to new york to address the general 
assembly i am referring to yasser arafat 
what is more this happened at a time when the palestine 
liberation organization has made a constructive step which 
facilitates the search for a solution to the middle east problem 
with the involvement of the united nations security council 
this happened at a time when a positive trend has become apparent 
toward a political settlement of other regional conflicts in many 
cases with the assistance of the ussr and the united states we 
voice our deep regret over the incident and our solidarity with the 
palestine liberation organization 
ladies and gentlemen 
the concept of comprehensive international security is based on 
the principles of the united nations charter and is predicated on 
the binding nature of international law for all states 
being in favor of demilitarizing international relations we want 
political and legal methods to prevail in solving whatever problems 
may arise 
our ideal is a world community of states which are based on the 
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to 
law 
the achievement of this goal would be facilitated by an agreement 
within the united nations on a uniform understanding of the 
principles and norms of international law their codification with 
due regard to new conditions and the development of legal norms for 
new areas of cooperation 
in a nuclear age the effectiveness of international law should 
be based not on enforcing compliance but rather on norms reflecting 
a balance of state interests 
in addition to the ever increasing awareness of the objective 
commonality of our destiny this would make every state genuinely 
interested in exercising selfrestraint within the bounds of 
international law 
democratizing international relations means not only a maximum 
degree of internationalization in the efforts of all members of the 
world community to solve problems it also means humanizing those 
relations 
international ties will fully reflect the genuine interests of 
the peoples and effectively serve the cause of their common security 
only when the human being and his concerns rights and freedoms 
become the center of all things

in this context i would like to join the voice of my country in 
the expressions of high appreciation of the significance of the 
universal declaration of human rights adopted 40 years ago on dec 
10 1948 
today this document retains its significance it too reflects 
the universal nature of the goals and objectives of the united 
nations 
the most fitting way for a state to observe this anniversary of 
the declaration is to improve its domestic conditions for respectlng 
and protecting the rights of its own citizens 
before i inform you on what specifically we have undertaken 
recently in this respect i would like to say the following 
our country is going through a period of truly revolutionary 
uplifting 
the process of perestroika is gaining momentum we began with the 
formulation of the theoretical concept of perestroika we had to 
evaluate the nature and the magnitude of problems to understand the 
lessons of the past and express that in the form of political 
conclusions and programmes this was done 
theoretical work a reassessment of what is happening the 
finalization enrichment and readjustment of political positions 
have not been completed they are continuing 
but it was essential to begin with an overall concept which as 
now confirmed by the experience of these past years has generally 
proved to be correct and which has no alternative 
for our society to participate in efforts to implement the plans 
of perestroika it had to be democratized in practice under the 
sign of democratization perestroika has now spread to politics the 
economy intellectual life and ideology 
we have initiated a radical economic reform we have gained 
experience at the start of next year the entire national economy 
will be redirected to new forms and methods of operation this also 
means profoundly reorganizing relations of production and releasing 
the tremendous potential inherent in socialist property 
undertaking such bold revolutionary transformations we realized 
that there would be mistakes and also opposition that new 
approaches would generate new problems we also foresaw the 
possibility of slowdowns in some areas 
but the guarantee that the overall process of perestroika will 
steadily move forward and gain strength lies in a profound 
democratic reform of the entire system of power and administration 
with the recent decisions by the ussr supreme soviet on 
amendments to the constitution and the adoption of the law on 
elections we have completed the first stage of the process of 
political reform 
without pausing we have begun the second stage of this process 
with the main task of improving the relationship between the center 
and the republics harmonizing interethnic relations on the 
principles of leninist internationalism that we inherited from the 
great revolution and at the same time reorganizing the local system 
of soviet power 
a great deal of work lies ahead major tasks will have to be 
dealt with concurrently 
we are full of confidence we have a theory and a policy and 
also the vanguard force of perestroika the party which also is 
restructuring itself in accordance with new tasks and fundamental 
changes in society as a whole 
what is most important is that all our peoples and all 
generations of citizens of our great country support perestroika 
we have become deeply involved in building a socialist state 
based on the rule of law work on a series of new laws has been 
completed or is nearing completion 
many of them will enter into force as early as in 1989 and we 
expect them to meet the highest standards from the standpoint of 
ensuring the rights of the individual 
soviet democracy will be placed on a solid normative base i am 
referring in particular to laws on the freedom of conscience 
glasnost public associations and organizations and many others 
in places of confinement there are no persons convicted for their 
political or religious beliefs 
additional guarantees are to be included in the new draft laws 
that rule out any form of persecution on those grounds 
naturally this does not apply to those who committed actual 
criminal offenses or state crimes such as espionage sabotage 
terrorism etc whatever their political or ideological beliefs 
draft amendments to the penal code have been prepared and are 
awaiting their turn among the articles being revised are those 
related to capital punishment 
the problem of exit from and entry to our country including the 
question of leaving it for family reunification is being dealt with 
in a humane spirit 
as you know one of the reasons for refusal to leave is a 
persons knowledge of secrets strictly warranted time limitations 
on the secrecy rule will now be applied every person seeking 
employment at certain agencies or enterprises will be informed of 
this rule in case of disputes there is a right of appeal under the 
law 
this removes from the agenda the problem of the socalled 
refuseniks 
we intend to expand the soviet unions participation in the 
united nations and csce conference of security and cooperation in 
europe human rights monitoring arrangements we believe that the 
jurisdiction of the international court of justice at the hague as 
regards the interpretation and implementation of agreements on human 
rights should be binding on all states 
we regard as part of the helsinki process the cessation of 
jamming of all foreign radio broadcasts beamed at the soviet union 
overall this is our credo political problems must be solved 
only by political means human problems only in a humane way 
now let me turn to the main issue disarmament without which 
none of the problems of the coming century can be solved 
international development and communication have been distorted 
by the arms race and the militarization of thinking 
as you know on jan 15 1986 the soviet union put forward a 
program of building a nuclear weaponfree world translated into 
actual negotiating positions it has already produced material 
results 
tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the signing of the inf 
treaty i am therefore particularly pleased to note that the 
implementation of the treaty the elimination of missiles is 
proceeding normally in an atmosphere of trust and businesslike 
work 
a large breach has thus been made in a seemingiy unbreakable wall 
of suspicion and animosity we are witnessing the emergence of a new 
historic reality a turning away from the principle of super 
armament to the principle of reasonable defense sufficiency 
we are present at the birth of a new model of ensuring security 
not through the buildup of arms as was almost always the case in 
the past but on the contrary through their reduction on the basis 
of compromise 
the soviet leadership has decided to demonstrate once again its 
readiness to reinforce this healthy process not only by words but 
also by deeds 
today i can report to you that the soviet union has taken a 
decision to reduce its armed forces 
within the next two years their numerical strength will be 
reduced by 500000 men the numbers of conventional armaments will 
also be substantially reduced this will be done unilaterally 
without relation to the talks on the mandate of the vienna meeting 
by agreement with our warsaw treaty allies we have decided to 
withdraw by 1991 six tank divisions from the gdr czechoslovakia and 
hungary and to disband them

assault landing troops and several other formations and units 
including assault crossing units with their weapons and combat 
equipment will also be withdrawn from the groups of soviet forces 
stationed in those countries 
soviet forces stationed in those countries will be reduced by 
50000 men and their armaments by 5000 tanks 
all soviet divisions remaining for the time being in the 
territory of our allies are being reorganized their structure will 
be different from what it is now after a major cutback of their 
tanks it will become clearly defensive 
at the same time we shall reduce the numerical strength of the 
armed forces and the numbers of armaments stationed in the european 
part of the ussr 
in total soviet armed forces in this part of our country and in 
the territories of our european allies will be reduced by 10000 
tanks 8500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft 
over these two years we intend to reduce significantly our armed 
forces in the asian part of our country too by agreement with the 
government of the mongolian peoples republic a major portion of 
soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return home 
in taking this fundamental decision the soviet leadership 
expresses the will of the people who have undertaken a profound 
renewal of their entire socialist society 
we shall maintain our countrys defense capability at a level of 
reasonable and reliable sufficiency so that no one might be tempted 
to encroach on the security of the ussr and our allies 
by this action and by all our activities in favor of 
demilitarizing international relations we wish to draw the 
attention of the international community to yet another pressing 
problem the problem of transition from the economy of armaments to 
an economy of disarmament 
is conversion of military production a realistic idea i have 
already had occasion to speak about this we think that indeed it 
is realistic 
for its part the soviet union is prepared 
in the framework of our economic reform we are ready to draw up 
and make public our internal plan of conversion 
in the course of 1989 to draw up as an experiment conversion 
plans for two or three defense plants 
to make public our experience in providing employment for 
specialists from military industry and in using its equipment 
buildings and structures in civilian production 
it is desirable that all states in the first place major 
military powers should submit to the united nations their national 
conversion plans 
it would also be useful to set up a group of scientists to 
undertake a thorough analysis of the problem of conversion as a 
whole and as applied to individual countries and regions and report 
to the secretarygeneral of the united nations and subsequently 
to have this matter considered at a session of the general assembly 
and finally since i am here on american soil and also for other 
obvious reasons i have to turn to the subject of our relations with 
this great country i had a chance to appreciate the full measure of 
its hospitality during my memorable visit to washington exactly a 
year ago 
the relations between the soviet union and the united states of 
america have a history of 5 decades as the world changed so did 
the nature role and place of those relations in world politics 
for too long a time they developed along the lines of 
confrontation and sometimes animosity either overt or covert 
but in the last few years the entire world could breath a sigh of 
relief thanks to the changes for the better in the substance and the 
atmosphere of the relationship between moscow and washington 
no one intends to underestimate the seriousness of our 
differenees and the toughness of outstanding problems we have 
however already graduated from the primary school of learning to 
understand each other and seek solutions in both our own and common 
interests 
the ussr and the united states have built the largest nuclear 
and missile arsenals but it is those two countries that having 
become specifically aware of their responsibility were the first to 
conclude a treaty on the reduction and physical elimination of a 
portion of their armaments which posed a threat to both of them and 
to all others 
both countries possess the greatest and the most sophisticated 
military secrets but it is those two countries that have laid a 
basis for and are further developing a system of mutual verification 
both of the elimination of armaments and of the reduction and 
prohibition of their production 
it is those two countries that are accumulating the experience 
for future bilateral and multilateral agreements 
we value this we acknowledge and appreciate the contribution 
made by president ronald reagan and by the members of his 
administration particularly mr george shultz 
all this is our joint investment in a venture of historic 
importance we must not lose this investment or leave it idle

the next us administration headed by presidentelect george 
bush will find in us a partner who is ready without long pauses or 
backtracking to continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism 
openness and goodwill with a willingness to achieve concrete 
results working on the agenda which covers the main issues of 
sovietus relations and world politics 
i have in mind above all consistent movement toward a treaty on 
50 percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while preserving 
the abm treaty 
working out a convention on the elimination of chemical weapons 
here as we see it prerequisites exist to make 1989 a decisive 
year 
and negotiations on the reduction of conventional arms and armed 
forces in europe 
i also have in mind economic environmental and humanistic 
problems in their broadest sense 
it would be quite wrong to put the positive changes in the 
international situation exclusively to the credit of the ussr 
and the united states 
the soviet union highly appreciates the major and original 
contribution of socialist countries in the process of creating a 
healthier international environment 
during the course of negotiations we are constantly aware of the 
presence of other major powers both nuclear and nonnuclear 
many countries including mediumsized and small ones and of 
course the nonaligned movement and the intercontinental group of 
six are playing a uniquely important constructive role 
we in moscow are happy that an ever increasing number of 
statesmen political party and public figures and i want to 
emphasize this scientists cultural figures representatives of 
mass movements and various churches and activists of the socalled 
peoples diplomacy are ready to shoulder the burden of universal 
responsibility 
in this regard i believe that the idea of convening on a regular 
basis under the auspices of the united nations an assembly of 
public organizations deserves attention 
we are not inclined to simplify the situation in the world 
yes the trend touard disarmament has been given a powerful 
impetus and the process is gaining a momentum of its own but it 
has not yet become irreversible 
yes the willingness to give up confrontation in favor of 
dialogue and cooperation is felt strongly but it is still far from 
becoming a permanent feature in the practice of international 
relations 
yes movement toward a nuclearweaponfree and nonviolent world 
is capable of radically transforming the political and intellectual 
identity of our planet but only the first steps have been made and 
even they have been met with mistrust in certain influential 
quarters and face resistance 
the legacy and the inertia of the past continue to be felt 
profound contradictions and the roots of many conflicts have not 
disappeared and there remains another fundamental fact which is 
that a peaceful period will be taking shape in the context of the 
existence and rivalry of different socioeconomic and political 
systems 
however the thrust of our international efforts and one of the 
key elements of the new thinking is that this rivalry should be 
given a quality of reasonable competition with due regard for 
freedom of choice and a balance of interests 
then it will even become useful and productive from the 
standpoint of global development 
otherwise if the arms race as before remains its basic 
component this rivalry will be deadly 
more and more people throughout the world leaders a well as 
ordinary people are beginning to understand 
esteemed mr president distinguished delegates 
i am concluding my first address to the united nations with the 
same feeling that i had when i began it a feeling of 
responsibllity to my own people and to the world community 
we are meeting at the end of a year which has meant so much for 
the united nations and on the eve of a year from which we all expect 
so much 
i would like to believe that our hopes will be matched by our 
joint effort to put an end to an era of wars confrontation and 
regional conflicts to aggressions against nature to the terror of 
hunger and poverty as well as to political terrorism 
this is our common goal and we can only reach it together 
thank you

again there has to be a legal base the groundwork for it the 
provisions of the 1967 treaty and other agreements is already in 
place 
however there is already a strongly felt need to develop an 
allembracing regime for peaceful work in outer space the 
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a 
world space organization 
we have put forward our proposal to establish it on more than one 
occasion we are prepared to incorporate within its system our 
krasnoyarsk radar station a decision has already been taken to 
place that radar under the authorities of the ussr academy of

soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign

shultzs news conference on governors island 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
shultz the president the vice president and the general 
secretary and the accompanying parties just finished a set of 
meetings first a private meeting between the three men and then 
the general discussion over lunch that i think can well be 
characterized as a discussion that was direct and open lots of 
humor cordial and marked by a general desire for a continued 
positive development in relationship between the united states and 
the soviet union 
in the discussion among the three the subjects as i heard them 
reported to me were first of all a discussion of human rights 
second some discussion of changes taking place in the soviet union 
and some looking back and remembering that this was the fifth 
meeting between the president and the general secretary and the 
general secretary remarked that it was a special meeting because of 
the vice presidents presence and there was some recall of the 
first one in geneva 
over lunch we had a kind of intermingling of substantive and 
cordial informal talk about such a variety of things as the politics 
of change the difficulties with bureaucracies the healthgiving 
properties of horses as the president somehow got onto that subject 
and talked about it laughter i think the general secretary 
brought it up and we were off for a good ride but at any rate the 
whole atmosphere was very informal and cordial and flowed back and 
forth between substance and general informal talk 
the general secretary gave a report on the earthquake that 
affected armenia principally but other areas of the soviet union 
and turkey as well very serious in some places the president 
expressed his sympathy the president had had a brief report on the 
general secretarys speech at the united nations he wasnt able to 
see it of course because he was in the air most of the time i 
told him a bit about it and the president remarked that he could 
see that it was a constructive and important speech 
as far as the statements about conventional arms reductions are 
concerned the president welcomed them as described they are of 
course decisions made by the soviet union about unilateral steps 
that they intend to take 
there was some general discussion over luncheon about the 
relationship of perestroika to developments in human rights and 
legal changes as these were outlined by the general secretary in 
his speech and again the president expressed his welcome of those 
developments 
we had some discussion of the krasnoyarsk radar and it was 
pointed out that in his speech the general secretary had used the 
word dismantled did we hear that word right and he said 
yes that was the word i used but it wasnt pursued further 
than that 
there was a fairly lengthy period of discussion about chemical 
weapons and the importance of concluding a protocol or a treaty in 
geneva to ban them the vice president on the one hand argued for 
the importance of doing that and on the other hand pointed up how 
difficult it is particularly on verification so theres lots of 
work to do and there was general support for the effort to 
highlight this area represented by the conference in paris that is 
to take place

there was discussion of regional issues the president mentioned 
the cooperative effort that we are making together on southern 
africa the general secretary commented on his readiness to continue 
cooperation on seeking peace in the middle east and while we were 
waiting for the private meeting to end mr shevardnadze and i 
discussed cambodia at some length and his meeting and the general 
secretarys meeting with the chinese foreign minister and korea 
there were also references to peopletopeople exchanges 
so you can see that all elements of what we have described as the 
fourpart agenda came into play although this was not a kind of 
formal meeting so it was an informal flow from one thing to 
another but i think in many respects very illuminating as the 
one person or another was drawn out on a subject in an informal way 
and in that sense served a good purpose of people not only saying 
that they wished to see continuity but in the interplay kind of 
bringing that about by virtue of the presence of the vice president 
and the president together there with the general secretary 
q mr secretary did you have any reaction to his criticism of 
our decision on the plo did that come up during the meeting do you 
have any reaction to what he said during his speech independent of 
whether that came up and do you have any comment on mr arafats 
meeting in sweden 
shultz well as far as his comments in his speech are concerned 
i have we have described at length the reasons for my decision the 
president supports that decision most members of the united states 
senate do i recognize there are many differences of opinion and he 
expressed his but thats where we are 
as far as the meeting in stockholm is concerned i read the 
report of what was said this morning and it seems to be a little 
bit further clarification and i welcome that and theres still a 
considerable distance to go 
q mr secretary this unilateral troop reduction that gorbachev 
announced seems to amount to about 10 percent of soviet and eastern 
bloc forces in that area does it appear to you at first glance that 
that will bring a parity about because we contend that the eastern 
bloc has superiority in conventional forces now 
shultz there is a superiority more troops more tanks more 
various other categories of weapons and these reductions being 
unilateral are a welcome and significant step in the right 
direction but even after theyre completed in 1991 there still 
will be a very significant asymmetry so theres a lot of 
negotiating to do

i think the principal thing that is notable about them as 
described in the speech and then as asked about them during our 
meeting is the attention to trying to affect things like bridging 
capabilities that are offensive in nature and therefore to try to 
have the forces arranged so that theyre more clearly defensive in 
their nature but it still remains that after these reductions take 
place and if nothing else takes place there will be a major 
asymmetry in important categories of force structure for the soviet 
union but nevertheless this is a welcome step in the right 
direction 
q can i just follow that up that was the point that mr 
gorbachev made he said that at the end of these reductions would be 
clear that his forces were in a defensive posture what do you think 
shultz some of the reductions and i mentioned an illustration 
seemed to be pointed in that direction and thats a welcome 
development obviously we have sat i have sat in the hall and 
others watched on television his exposition of this and so im 
giving you a general reaction but obviously were going to sit and 
study this out carefully in the united states and in nato and factor 
it into our thinking about how to position ourselves in the coming 
conventional arms talks 
q mr secretary do you agree with mr gorbachev there are no 
political prisoners in the soviet union and could you tell us what 
you think youre getting two questions here for the price of one 
what do you think of his proposal for a mutual suspension of arms 
supplies to the belligerents in afghanistan 
shultz well as far as prisoners of conscience political 
religious prisoners are concerned there have been a great many 
released a great many in our opinion there still are such 
prisoners in the soviet union but the number is far less in our 
count now there can be differences of opinion about whether 
somebody is in prison because of political expression or religious 
expression or because of violation of the law so what we need and 
what i believe it will be possible to construct is a procedure a 
means through which we will go through with them name by name the 
people on our list and try to determine whether or not that person 
should be released or whether there is some valid reason for the 
imprisonment and i believe that we will be able to get that into 
place and so thatll be a way of answering the question in a kind 
of direct personal sense now youre other question was what 
q the proposal he had a very detailed proposal including the 
mutual suspension of assistance and military supplies to the 
belligerents in afghanistan is that a good idea 
shultz well of course we proposed to the soviet union quite 
some time ago a mutual cessation of supplies and they rejected 
that and so as we insisted and they agreed that there had to be 
symmetry we said well if you insist on supplying then we 
insist that we will have that right actually the mujahedeen 
dont need a lot of more supplies because theyre capturing a great 
deal of supplies 
but at any rate we have been prepared for such a proposal but 
it is tied in with a lot of other things of course the question of 
peacekeeping of trying to help people with reconstruction and 
development that there will be a massive effort needed 
but i dont think there is any way there could be agreement that 
forces would just continue to hold the ground that they have because 
the people of afghanistan broadly speaking do not accept the fact 
that the puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that 
country 
lets review the situation 
there were 15 million people estimated as the population of 
afghanistan in 1979 right now there are a little over three million 
refugees in pakistan a little over two million in iran its 
estimated there are a million and a half casualties over two 
million internal refugees 
so i dont think its surprising that people who have been 
subjected to that kind of turmoil dont want to have anything to do 
with a puppet regime that seemed to have participated in it 
now i think it is a good thing that the soviets are now talking 
directly to the mujahedeen and certainly it is possible the 
mujahedeen are ready to negotiate arrangements whereby there wont 
be attacks on soviet forces as they leave but the key here is 
first and foremost for the soviet troops to leave as they are 
scheduled to do and i believe and hope that that will take place 
q mr secretary you mentioned in your opening statement that 
the presence of vice president bush himself meant a certain 
continuity in the relationship was there any discussion there of 
meetings between mr bush when he becomes president and mr 
gorbachev or of their foreign ministers or any of these other 
apparatus of meetings that we have seen over the past several years 
shultz there were general references to the desirability of 
having the level of contact the intensity of contacts at all levels 
maintained theres no immediate plan for any meeting that came out 
of the session as i saw it of the vice president when he becomes 
president and the general secretary although obviously there will 
be one at some appropriate moment no doubt therell be a foreign 
ministers meeting or two before that but as the vice president has 
said publicly he has to review the bidding for himself with his new 
team and assess the various elements in the relationship and no 
doubt hell proceed to do that and things will move forward on an 
orderly basis but the underlying intent is to see things develop in 
a positive way insofar as its possible and it certainly is quite 
possible 
q mr secretary returning to one of your answers earlier your 
comment on yasser arafats statement in sweden you said theres 
a considerable way to go a considerable way to go before what is 
the us having heard these kinds of comments from arafat now 
prepared to enter a dialogue of any sort of representative of the 
plo 
shultz we have for a long time had certain set things that we 
have said must be said by the plo positions they need to adopt if 
we are to have a substantive dialogue with them and theyre well 
known it is the acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 as a 
basis for negotiation of mideast peace number two recognition of 
israels right to exist and number three the renunciation of 
terrorism in all its forms and a pledge not to engage in it those 
are the things that we have insisted on and it is our view that 
they need to be said directly not inferentially not conditioned 
so we have seen at the pnc meeting and while i havent had a 
chance to study what was said this morning ive just heard a brief 
report of it so i dont want to be too definitive about it but it 
seems that there were some further clarifications in it i welcome 
that but so far as its been reported to me they havent meet 
these conditions if they meet these conditions then were prepared 
for a substantive dialogue weve said that well continue to say 
that thats our position 
q mr secretary could you give us a bit more of an idea of what 
the vice president contributed to todays forum 
shultz well the vice president was quite active in the 
discussion during the luncheon i cant really say from firsthand in 
the private meeting but i gather that he spoke there too 
naturally he is he came here very deliberately as the vice 
president and so it was up to the president to carry the meeting 
which he did as he always does but the vice president was very 
active in the discussion about chemical weapons 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP881208-0029 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
and he made his comments about continuity and at the same time 
his own need of course to study the situation for himself and 
develop his own positions so he was in and out of the conversation 
in a very comfortable and strong way 
q its not clear to me how much real discussion there was on 
gorbachevs conventional cut proposal 
shultz there was very little discussion of it at the luncheon 
and you have to remember he made this speech this morning the 
president and the vice president neither one of them heard it and 
i heard it but it was an extensive thing and we tried to write it 
down as best we can but thats no basis for having any intensive 
discussion beyond asking him well what does he have in mind he 
has in mind trying to restructure things so that theyre more 
clearly defensive in nature so we are interested in that comment 
and well study this carefully 
q you didnt draw him out and he didnt really elaborate that 
much on his proposal 
shultz well ive reported on the range of things that we talked 
about the meeting was a luncheon broad discussion it was a very 
i thought it was a very it was a very interesting luncheon to take 
part in it was hit interesting topics and there was a good flow 
across things that had important substance connected with them and 
at the same time rather informal and mr gorbachev talked about the 
situation in azerbaijan and what that meant and so on it was that 
kind of a discussion it wasnt in any remote sense a negotiating 
session or anything of that kind but in many ways better than a 
negotiating session 
q mr secretary in his speech soviet leader gorbachev talked 
several times about new thinking he talked about the need for 
cooperation coexistence of several systems do you believe that 
this new thinking is for real to stay an element of propaganda 
shultz ill just give you my own opinion i dont think there is 
a shadow of a doubt that an effort is under way to change the nature 
of the soviet system that is what mr gorbachev says that is what 
all of the evidence that we can see suggests so i chuckling i 
dont have any doubt that thats so now how successful can he be 
in making these changes and how fast will it happen of course 
nobody can answer those questions but that there is a major effort 
going on to change things i really dont see how thats even an 
open question 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP881208-0030 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
q do you agree with his appeal then that the days of the cold 
war are past 
shultz well i listened to the vice president answer that 
question yesterday i thought he gave a pretty good answer which 
was the words cold war mean one thing to you another thing to 
me another thing to somebody else and i think the important point 
is that there has been a very powerful change in the nature of the 
relationship between the us and the soviet union and more 
broadly in the eastwest relationship and you can see it in the 
things that have been settled in arms control you can see it in 
for example the ability we have to collaborate effectively for 
example in what were doing in southern africa you can see it in 
an altogether different manner of discussion of the area of human 
rights you can see it in our bilateral relations so i dont know 
whether you want to say thats the end of the cold war or not but 
its different a lot different and for my tastes a lot better 
q mr secretary with respect to the last answer if you could 
amplify it do you have any concern that the allies will show 
disagreement about what is going on in the soviet union 
particularly do you have any concern that the level of credit going 
from the europeans to the soviet union might not serve to dismantle 
the soviets military inaudible 
shultz well we meet a lot the allies do the european allies 
and we and the japanese and koreans australians and so forth we 
have a very active process of talk among us that goes on constantly 
as soon as we get through here i get on my plane and go to brussels 
and ill spend all day tomorrow and friday morning with the nato 
allies and ill spend friday afternoon at the european commission 
and these are the things we talk about and people have different 
views but we kind of put them in a pot and look at them and there 
has emerged from it a rather common view and a cohesive set of 
policies and of course its a constant sort of a moving target in a 
way 
now as far as credit is concerned we have a general 
understanding that noncocom restricted trade with the soviet union 
is no one sees any problem with that and that if there are 
credits they should be on a strictly commercial basis no one feels 
that it is that the soviet union should be subsidized so after 
youve said that then you observe these credits and in terms of 
the total flow of such things at this point at least it doesnt 
appear to me to be any particular problem but the creditors as 
commercial creditors of course have to ask themselves im going 
to loan some money am i going to get it back am i going to get it 
serviced and so on they have to make those calculations as 
people whose money that is 
q mr secretary can you say whether or not mr gorbachevs 
assurances on 
shultz i cant hear you 
q can you say whether mr gorbachevs assurances on 
institutionalizing human rights reforms in the soviet union were 
satisfactory enough to now conclude the vienna talks and go on to 
the conventional force talks 
shultz well as far as the vienna talks are concerned of 
course this is a multinational negotiation and we reflect our views 
into that in vienna and decisions will have to emerge from that 
setting but i think there is no question that in his speech mr 
gorbachev touched all of the key issues that we have been 
discussing one of them was the importance of institutionalizing and 
making law making rules whereby things are regulated so you get 
away from ad hoc decisions by some person in the bureaucracy that 
say yes well let this person go or we wont let that person 
go and rather you say there is a regulation about for 
instance the question of security secrets and therell be a time 
limit and therell be an understanding when somebody is hired and 
so on so we welcome that kind of procedure 
now what will we want to do well we will want to dig in with 
them and get the detail that lies underneath the statements that the 
general secretary made in his speech today however when the leader 
of the soviet union gets up in front of the world in effect and 
says that they are going to do certain things then i think you have 
to expect that those things are going to happen and we will of 
course explore them but i thought that it was a very helpful 
speech in that regard 
staff we have just time for one more question 
q mr secretary in his speech mr gorbachev also referred to 
the start talks and recommitted himself to the goal of a 50 percent 
reduction in strategic weapons was that discussed in the lunch at 
all or in the meeting this afternoon particularly in the context of 
continuing these under president bush 
shultz it really wasnt discussed much beyond the general 
secretary mentioning it and the vice president saying that of 
course he was interested in that but he will have to study it for 
himself and take his position so thats about the extent of it 
there wasnt any detailed discussion of that just as there wasnt 
any sort of detailed negotiatorlike discussion of any of these 
issues it was a much more general kind of discussion 
q well when you say that the vice president will actually 
decide on his position on it do you have any reason to doubt that 
those negotiations will continue in the next administration and be 
precedent 
shultz well i would think that they would be but a new 
president comes in he collects a new national security group around 
him so naturally he will want to look at the various positions that 
have been taken and where the issues now are and what are his views 
about them and since the vice president has been part of what has 
happened in the reagan administration there is a certain builtin 
presumption of continuity but i think that the vice president is 
quite correct in saying obviously hes a new president and hes 
got to look at it for himself and decide for himself where he wants 
to go so hes i think being properly straightforward in saying 
hes going to do that while at the same time expressing his 
general view of the importance of continuity in that and other 
things 
q and did he tell secretary gorbachev that 
no response

here is the text of president reagans remarks 
at the annual dinner of the american enterprise institute 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
reagan applause thank you thank you very much and thank 
you president ford jeane kirkpatrick michael novak irving 
crystal and bill butcher for those humbling words of praise and 
thank you chris demuth for the honor that you have bestowed upon 
me 
i think the honor you pay me is more truly due to everyone here 
tonight for many of the ideas that animated our administration can 
trace their ancestry to the pens and typewriters and word processors 
of all of you 
of course it would be a massive understatement to say i see a 
lot of familiar faces in this room in fact for a minute i thought 
id stumbled into the white house mess laughter but then i 
remembered you dont have to wear black tie in the mess well not 
until january 20th anyway laughter applause 
but as you know ive just been to new york and back for a 
meeting with mikhail gorbachev we were joined by vice president 
bush our discussions were positive and encouraging as usual and i 
was pleased by this opportunity to have a last meeting with 
president gorbachev before leaving office 
the discussion covered our entire fourpart agenda with the 
soviet union and he looked in particular at what had been achieved 
since our last meeting in moscow and what still needed to be 
accomplished in the future 
i expressed to president gorbachev my confidence that the work we 
began together at geneva in 1985 will continue under the bush 
administration 
you will not be surprised to hear that i particularly stressed 
the importance of human rights in ussoviet relations applause 
i told the president that we americans welcomed the changes that 
he has initiated in the soviet union and we hope that much more 
will be done to benefit the soviet people and also the relations 
between our countries 
we also reviewed progress in arms control resolution of regional 
conflicts and our bilateral relationship i think we both expressed 
satisfaction in what we have achieved in recent years but we also 
recognized that fundamental differences between our countries remain 
in many areas and that determined efforts by both sides will be 
necessary in the months and years ahead to overcome such differences 
now i dont need to tell all of what this may mean it would be 
useless anyway since over the course of the next few days ill 
probably be reading immensely informed and pointed articles about 
what it means in all sorts of publications laughter and 
theyll all be by people in this room laughter 
about the soviet unilateral troop reduction i can only say that 
if it is carried out speedily and in full history will regard it as 
important significant 
and we did see history today an american president and vice 
president meeting a president of the soviet union under the gaze of 
the statue of liberty well its something to remember applause 
now all of this is testimony to a process that was begun in 1985 
in geneva testimony too to the sacrifices of the people of the 
free world throughout the postwar era 
so while our hopes today are for a new era let us remember if 
that new era is indeed upon us that there was nothing inevitable 
about it it was the result of hard work and of resolve and 
sacrifice on the part of those who love freedom and dare to strive 
for it 
let us remember too at this critical junction our 
responsibilities grow more not less serious we must remain strong 
and free of illusion for only by doing so can we reach out and 
embrace this new era and transfrom this hope of peace and freedom 
for all the world into reality

so the meeting today was a time for reflection and for 
continuity now let me do the same with you and consider how weve 
done these last eight years and whether weve done well and i do 
mean we 
we have come a long way together from the intellectual 
wilderness of the 1960s through the heated intellectual battles of 
the 1970s to the intellectual fruition of the 1980s 
the american enterprise institute stands at the center of a 
revolution in ideas of which i too have been a part our ideas 
were greeted with varying degrees of scorn and hostility by what we 
used to call the establishment institutions 
the universities once the only real home for american 
scholarships have been particularly unresponsive and so it became 
necessary to create our own research institutions as places where 
scholars could congregate and important studies could be produced 
that did not kowtow to the conventional wisdom and your 
institutions remarkably distinguished body of work is testimony to 
the triumph of the think tank 
for today the most important american scholarship comes out of 
our think tanks and no think tank has been more influential than 
the american enterprise institute applause 
what we wanted was a chance to try our ideas out on the world 
stage we have and my friends i hope youre as proud as i 
because despite the naysayers and the conventional wisdom the 
words of the pundits and the false prophecies of false cassandras 
who proclaimed we could not succeed we knew we were right 
and i believe that yes we have been vindicated 
and nowhere is that more true than in the realm of foreign 
policy we came to washington together in 1981 both as 
anticommunists and as unapologetic defenders and promoters of a 
strong and vibrant america i am proud to say i am still an 
anticommunist applause and i continue to be dedicated to the 
idea that we must trumpet our beliefs and advance our american 
ideals to all the peoples of the world until the towers of the 
tyrants crumble to dust 
yes it seems to me that weve been as one these past eight years 
in an effort to establish a foreign policy that stood in firm 
opposition to the previous decades misguided attempt to place this 
country on what they used to call in the 1970s the right side of 
history by which those who used that unpleasant marxist phrase 
meant we should accept the dominion of our adversaries over large 
parts of the world 
we said no we said we must propound and advance our national 
ideals abroad and once again hold high the banner for what i will 
until the breath is gone from my body continue to call the free 
world applause 
we promulgated a foreign policy whose fundamental basis was the 
truths all americans hold to be selfevident that all men are 
created equal that they are endowed by their creator with 
unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness 
we have done this not solely because we believe it is right but 
because we know it is in our national interest to do so 
a foreign policy based on our bedrock principles allows us to 
offer a practical solution to the suffering peoples of the world a 
means of achieving prosperity and political stability that all 
americans take for granted as their birthright 
what we are telling them and their ofttimes recalcitrant 
leaders is that they cannot achieve prosperity and stability 
through redistribution of resources or by taking up arms against a 
sea of selfinflicted troubles 
weve seen how that last monstrous idea has worked this decade 
the war between iran and iraq whose initial aim was control over an 
oilrich province has done more damage to both countries than 10 
plagues

no we have told the world the truth we have learned from the 
noble tradition of western culture and that is that the only answer 
to poverty to war to oppression is one simple word freedom 
now freedom is not only a moral imperative for our foreign 
policy its also if i may use a word for which few in this room 
have much use supremely pragmatic for if there is anything the 
world has learned in the 1980s it is that as alan keyes has said 
freedom works 
that is a historic lesson because until very recently many 
intellectuals believed to the contrary they supported political 
philosophies that argued for tyranny and more particularly 
communist tyranny 
the claim was that these tyrannies worked better than freedom and 
were more equitable these intellectuals believed that the people of 
maos china hos vietnam castros cuba and other socialist 
utopias were actually happy to sacrifice their freedom for food and 
shelter and socalled literacy programs 
these noxious ideas have not to put it mildly withstood the 
scrutiny of honest scholars and the testimony of those fortunate 
enough to escape from those national prison camps 
refugees have told us what diligent researchers at aei were 
meticulously demonstrating that where there is little freedom 
there is little food that where there is totalitarian 
indoctrination instead of education literacy programs are a form of 
spiritual and psychological coercion that in these countries 
infant mortality is shockingly high and is getting worse that the 
povertystricken tyrannies of the 1980s have only grown poorer and 
poorer that tyranny is a parasite that saps the strength of a 
nation in its sway that like those who lived under macbeths 
tyranny the tyrannized millions will ever cry out our country 
sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a 
gash is added to her wounds 
tyranny fails freedom works these facts so little accepted 
only a decade ago are now indisputable there is little need here 
to rehearse the evidence in great detail 
the tiny freeexchange experiments in the east bloc and the 
liberalization in the peoples republic of china are stunning 
evidence of the communist worlds desperate efforts to find a way 
out of the economic morass of state socialism 
at the same time the abject failure of the sandinistas in 
nicaragua a nation where the standard of living has dropped 
precipitously since the 1979 revolution is stark proof of 
communisms inherent inability to compel an enslaved population to 
do much of anything but suffer 
i know it is often said of me that i am an optimist 
over the years ive been described as an inveterate optimist an 
eternal optimist a reflexive optimist scattered laughter a 
born optimist a canny optimist a cagey optimist even as quote 
defiantly optimistic unquote laughter 
it just goes to show there is no word that cannot be turned into 
a pejorative if the pundits work hard enough at it laughter 
applause 
but yes i am perfectly happy to admit that i am an optimist and 
i would like to explain why i believe in contrast to some of you 
here tonight that optimism is an appropriate attitude to bring to 
bear when thinking about our foreign policy 
the story of this century is actually two stories its a 
terrible story of world wars totalitarian enslavement 
concentration camps but it is also the story of freedom the 
fulfillment of the promise of freedom inside the united states and 
the triumph of democratic systems in western europe japan israel 
el salvador and many other places 
we have seen the thrilling spectacle of mankind refusing to 
accept the shackles placed upon us when we read the works of 
solzhenitsyn and valladares consider the heroism of sharansky and 
sakharov and watch in wonder these last months as hundreds of 
thousands throughout the captive nations gather to press for freedom 
now one may if one chooses take the first story as the 
representative tale of the 20th century well i look to the second 
and find glorious examples of what freedom can bring 
i think of how astonishing it is that italy and germany and 
japan three nations that engaged us in a struggle literally to the 
death have in just two score become our brethren our friends 
the nations of western europe which existed in a state you might 
call cold war for most of the past millennium with periods of 
real war thrown into the bargain are now the best of friends and 
are on the verge of creating the worlds largest free market 
latin america once a despots paradise is now 90 percent 
democratic the brave people of el salvador have faced down those 
who would still their voices by turning out to vote in great number 
in the far east democracy has taken unprecedented strides in 
such countries as south korea and the philippines 
freedom works and freedom is on the march and yes i am an 
optimist and yes i believe i have every reason to be 
i am an optimist because we are rapidly developing the means to 
neutralize the extraordinary threat of nuclear missiles through our 
strategic defense initiative 
i an an optimist because i believe that we have proved with our 
policy of peace through strength that when we are strong peace and 
freedom will prevail 
this november the electorate told us they agreed 
but while i believe that optimism is appropriate and while i 
believe that freedom is on the march i believe optimism must be 
tempered with prudence and its assumptions challenged every waking 
moment of every day 
the new democracies around the world are fragile and inattention 
to their fragility and their needs may result in the end of freedom 
there 
in central america our policy of peace through strength has been 
undercut by a wavering democratcontrolled congress that seems less 
concerned about the threat of a consolidated marxistleninist regime 
in nicaragua than the possibility of scoring points against a policy 
so closely associated with our administration 
and yes i still believe the noble freedom fighters who have been 
battling for the soul of their homeland continue to be the best hope 
for freedom and democracy in nicaragua applause 
i am troubled by something else as well 
the 1980s have been the glory years of the nato alliance the 
soviet deployment of intermediaterange missiles presented nato with 
its greatest challenge since the construction of the berlin wall 
and the alliance not only survived but was vindicated by the 
signing of the inf treaty in washington one year ago tomorrow 
the nato alliance is the best example we have to show the less 
fortunate peoples of the world how freedom and democracy create 
friendship and comity between peoples and nations 
but 40 scattered applause but 40 years after the north 
atlantic treaty there are still some who question the alliance 
thus we hear just months after the destruction of the first 
intermediaterange missile that somehow the united states is being 
mistreated by our friends and allies 
the argument they use is that our allies are not sharing their 
burden of their own defense equitably 
i agree that our nato allies could be sharing the burden better 
but we must also solve our economic disputes more fairly 
but we must always remember the very real burden our allies bear 
that we never will we must remember our allies perform a role that 
geography has forced upon them 
they are literally on the front lines for the west our fortunate 
geography has kept the wars of the 20th century well away from the 
american mainland but in europe the memory is as fresh as the 
memories of a 50yearold and the tales of a grandfather

their soldiers their children their homes their civilization 
itself hang in the balance every day we cannot we must not forget 
this and we should not give in to the temptation to transmute a 
small difference in a historic relationship into a major 
disagreement that might end up damaging the greatest foreignpolicy 
success of the postwar era 
i believe we can and will make progress on these matters as long 
as we hold true to our principles and do not give up the battle 
now i would like to ask those of you in this room who consider 
yourselves foreign policy skeptics to do me one last favor i want 
to ask you to remain vigilant 
you are the people who play the vital role of reminding 
politicians and policymakers of many important and necessary truths 
we sometimes forget 
its true that sometimes you cant see the forest for the trees 
indeed sometimes you cant even see the trees for the grass that 
surrounds them 
so please for george bushs sake and for the sake of all we hold 
dear please keep watching the forest 
i take my leave of you now by offering a final prayer that god 
may bless and keep all of you all the days of your life thank you 
and good night applause

the loss in terms of one human life rather than just the huge total 
number national park service spokesman mike stuckey said

sen daniel inouye dhawaii attended the ceremony aboard the

a minute of silence was observed at 755 am the moment the 
first bombs fell the silence was broken as national guard jets 
roared overhead in missing man formation the ceremony ended 
with prayers a 21gun salute and marine corps buglers playing taps 
the park service said about 3000 people attended a simultaneous 
onshore ceremony to commemorate the assault that plunged the united 
states into world war ii about 5000 others attended programs and 
lectures throughout the day at the memorial and visitor center

his sorrow for lost friends deepens each year 
ive been coming to these tributes forever and theyre almost 
the same every time but i get more emotional every year said 
louis grabinski 68 of long beach calif when i hear taps i 
still get choked up because i know who theyre playing for 
grabinski then a 21yearold shipfitter was resting aboard the 
uss west virginia when japanese submarines and aircraft blitzed the 
harbors battleship row 
we were just forward of the arizona we took a lot of heavy 
hits but counterflooded the ship so we sank slower and most of us

santa claus got run out of wall street and was 
not permitted to shake his bell at soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs motorcade 
three hours before the sirens screamed the cops told me to 
pick up my chimney and move it grumbled john davis a sidewalk 
santa collecting for the volunteers of america three blocks from his 
usual location outside the new york york stock exchange 
as gorbachevs armorplated zil limousine rolled past the 
cathedral of capitalism the narrow sidewalks were jammed with 
yuppie types unable to cross police lines to get to their own 
stretch limos 
in harrys bar where traders gather after the closing bell the 
soviet tourist was jokingly dubbed the most famous russian to shake 
up wall street since ivan boesky the junk bond tycoon indicted in 
insidertrading scandals 
from the observation deck of the world trade center the soviet 
leader got to see new york on one of those rare smogfree late fall 
evenings with the setting sun gilding the windows of the 
skyscrapers and a view for miles of the jersey coast beyond the 
greengarbed statue of liberty 
but loud groans went up against glasnost in the waiting room of 
the staten island ferry when service was delayed for security 
reasons while gorbachev president reagan and presidentelect bush 
lingered over their lunch on governors island 
some passengers shook their fists at city hall when the no 6 bus 
ended its runs there a mile from the tip of manhattan because the 
motorcade had preempted the rest of its route 
the trouble with this country is that we should be spending 
that million dollars on the homeless and not for police overtime to 
protect this gorbachev shouted meyer gelman who identified 
himself as a brooklyn lawyer 
and the trouble with gorbachevs country the bus driver 
joined the debate is that youd be put in jail for saying that 
although severe gridlock developed late in the afternoon many 
commuters heeded warnings against bringing private cars to town one 
local tv station had cautioned its listeners in a singing commercial 
to the tune of santa claus is coming to town 
dont bring in your car 
stay off of the road 
if you try to park 
youre gonna get towed 
gorbachev is coming to town

wouldnt it be great if this caught on and mens hats came back in 
style 
while the soviet motorcade moved through times square leggy 
russian models in skimpy leather miniskirts promenaded down a 
runway at the javits convention center in practice session to 
launch style wars 
soviet fashions are part of a huge export exhibit of almost 
everything from bicycles and computers to pianos and electric 
samovars gorbachev was originally supposed to visit the exhibit 
thursday in hopes of helping rescue his countrys flagging economy 
with good old capitalist sales techniques 
the visit was later canceled when it was announced the soviet 
leader would return home thursday because of a devastating 
earthquake in three southern soviet republics

deer hunters found more than whitetails 
in the woods this season they bagged a murder suspect and found 
a human skull a crashing helicopter and a bazooka officials say 
we always seem to come up with lots of things during deer week 
that we arent really looking for allan mcgroary head of the 
states environmental police said wednesday as the 10day shotgun 
deer season ended 
the season began nov 28 on the second day a hunter in 
northwest massachusetts found the body of mark branch the suspect 
in the killing of greenfield community college student sharon 
gregory hanging in a tree a few miles from where his car was found 
abandoned oct 25 said greenfield police chief david mccarthy 
i was only surprised they didnt find it opening day 
mccarthy said that area was just saturated with hunters 
he said authorities had searched for branchs body but we just 
didnt have the manpower 
the helicopter which otherwise might have taken hours or days to 
locate went down friday over a boy scout camp in an isolated 
section of russell in southwest massachusetts killing the pilot as 
four stunned hunters dived for cover 
the skull was turned up by a hunter in the beartown state forest 
in great barrington in the states southwest corner judging from 
its size the skull was believed to be that of a woman or a child 
police officer nancy porter said today adding that tests on the 
skull were still being conducted 
the bazooka which police described as a oneshot disposable 
model apparently abandoned by army reserve or national guard troops 
on summer maneuvers was bagged in the nearby october mountain state

the mousetrap the worlds longestrunning 
play goes on and on and on 
agatha christies thriller has its 15000th performance on 
friday however producer sir peter saunders has become inured to 
such milestones records are meaningless now arent they he 
says 
the play which marked its 36th birthday on nov 25 has 
outlasted nine us presidents and eight british prime ministers to 
become as much a part of london life as big ben 
it originally cost 5000 pounds then about 20000 to stage 
mousetrap when it opened at the ambassadors theater on nov 25 
1952 it since has moved next door to the st martins theater and 
has grossed over 14 million pounds 256 million with its story of 
murderous intrigue on a stormy night at a deserted country manor 
since its premiere 230 actors have appeared in the play 66 
miles of shirts have been ironed and 75 million people have seen 
it consuming 269 tons of ice cream and about 48000 gallons of 
beverages during intermissions 
it started out with richard attenborough playing det sgt 
trotter the famed actorfilmmaker has gone on to become the academy 
awardwinning director of gandhi a chorus line and cry 
freedom 
saunders 77 said he remains mystified by the plays success 
how it got to be the longestrunning play is a question i cant 
answer said saunders who has produced many other christie plays 
all far less durable 
however he acknowledged that the plays momentum is related less 
to the theater than to being a british mainstay 
if you go to paris you have to go see the louvre once even if 
you hate pictures the same applies to the mousetrap he said 
the cast is annually changed to keep the play fresh and its 18th 
director kim grant took over on nov 28 
saunders advises directors against excessive tampering this 
play is like a famous dundee cake which has the same recipe for 100 
years you may change the way its cooked but you dont change the 
ingredients 
grant who directed a 1983 revival of noel cowards hay 
fever has two weeks to rehearse his mousetrap cast as 
opposed to the usual west end londons broadway minimum of four 
he said the material was deceptively difficult 
to make it all plausible and realistic is a great challenge 
he said christies plays are actually very difficult to act 
partly because the dialogue is dated in a way 
the play has been presented in 24 different languages in 44 
countries including a sixmonth offbroadway run in the early 
1950s saunders sold the film rights to romulus films in 1956 with 
the stipulation that no movie version appear until six months after 
the the conclusion of the london run he has twice offered to buy 
back the rights but to no avail 
the producer also has vetoed any broadway runs 
the american press would crucify it he said besides i 
want people to come over here to see it

president mikhail s gorbachev will cut short his 
visit to the united states to return to moscow because of a 
devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in three 
southern soviet republics foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
said wednesday 
shevardnadze called a surprise news conference late wednesday 
night and announced that gorbachev was to depart prematurely 
sometime early thursday 
despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken 
mr gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to 
be there he has to lead the efforts shevardnadze said through an 
official interpreter 
the soviet foreign minister said the earthquake wednesday hit 
armenia azerbaijan and his native georgia in the caucasus region 
south of moscow shevardnadze said the epicenter was near the 
armenian town of leninakan and the quake registered 80 although 
it was not clear whether he was referring to the richter scale of 
ground motion or a different soviet system of calibration 
the us geological survey in golden colo said the quake 
registered 69 on the richter scale 
a 7 reading on the richter scale is a major earthquake 
capable of widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable 
of tremendous damage 
i understand that turkey too has been affected but i dont 
have any information shevardnadze said 
shevardnadze said premier nikolai ryzhkov had flown to the 
armenian capital of yerevan to take charge of emergency relief 
operations 
gorbachev had been scheduled to travel to cuba on friday and on 
to london monday before returning to moscow 
the soviet foreign minister said gorbachev would depart early 
thursday as for the visit to britain and cuba they will take place 
later but at an appropriate time shevardnadze said 
its a terrible tragedy not only for the armenian people but 
for all the soviet people shevardnadze said he said the quake 
had killed thousands of people but more accurate figures were not 
yet available 
initial word of the sudden change in plans from an official in 
the presidents entourage who refused to be quoted by name came only 
hours after the top soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov told reporters gorbachev would not abbreviate his visit 
due to the earthquake 
ambassador yuri dubinin called white house national security 
adviser lt gen colin powell at about 1130 pm to tell him that 
gorbachev was going home early because of the quake said 
presidential spokesman bj cooper 
shevardnadze said that president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush had expressed their condolences during the lunch meeting 
with gorbachev at governors island in new york harbor before the 
extent of the catastrophe became clear to the soviet delegation 
reports from the soviet union indicated the earthquake caused 
severe damage and loss of life in the caucasus although it 
reportedly did not do major damage in yerevan 
armenia and the neighboring republic of azerbaijan also have been 
troubled recently by racial strife leading to the virtual 
declaration of martial law in that region

air traffic control problems increased delays 
in the busy chicago area but overall the nations major airlines 
reported that better than four in five flights arrived on time 
during october the transportation department says 
the 13 largest domestic air carriers reported 834 percent of 
their flights arrived within 15 minutes of the scheduled times the 
margin considered on time by the government it was the seventh 
straight month the ontime record averaged over 80 percent 
eastern airlines which early this year was consistently among 
the worst ontime performers compiled the best record in october 
with eastern planes arriving on or close to schedule 903 percent of 
the time during the month 
eastern was followed by america west 891 percent and delta air 
lines 878 percent alaska airlines had the worst record at 779 
percent usair and united airlines which has a concentration of 
flights at chicago was barely ahead with a 797 percent ontime 
mark 
meanwhile the transportation department continued to receive 
fewer complaints about air travel 
the department reported that 1196 air traveler complaints were 
received by its consumer affairs office during november fewer than 
the month before and down 60 percent from the number received in 
november l987 trans world airlines had the highest rate of 
complaints with 812 per 100000 passengers flown 
the consumer complaints are released with the ontime statistics 
although they cover different months 
nearly one in four flights into chicagos ohare international 
airport was delayed during october ranking the airport 26th among 
the 27 airports on which information was provided in september 
ohares ontime rate had been 816 percent 
the federal aviation administration reduced the number of flights 
it would allow into chicagos airports including ohare from 96 an 
hour to 80 an hour on oct 3 because of concern that air traffic 
controllers were being forced to handle too much traffic 
controllers had made an unusually high number of traffic control 
errors prompting the faa action 
salt lake city had the best arrival record in october with 896 
percent of the flights landing on time san francisco had the worst 
record with 621 percent of the planes arriving on time followed by 
ohare 
since april better than 80 percent of airline flights have been 
arriving on time compared to an average of about 74 percent during 
the prior six months 
airlines no longer bunch flights together during peak travel 
periods as much as they once did and often provide more flying time 
in their posted flight schedules so the schedule more closely 
reflects actual flying conditions officials suggested 
according to the monthly transportation department consumer 
report the number of complaints about mishandled bags increased in 
october to 609 per 1000 passengers compared with 571 per 1000 
passengers in september 
southwest airlines had the largest percentage of flights that 
were late 70 percent of the time twentyone southwest flights or 
24 percent of the airlines total were late at least seven out of 
10 times during october overall however southwest had the sixth 
best ontime record with an 828 percent mark

legislators praised soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs announcement of a unilateral troop cut but said they 
want to see the words backed up with action and renewed eastwest 
talks to reduce troop levels in europe 
with congress out of session few legislators were in the capitol 
and most reacted cautiously saying they wanted to see more details 
of how the soviets will carry out the plan made public wednesday by 
gorbachev at the united nations 
they also noted that the soviets now have a large numerical edge 
in troops and various categories of weapons in europe 
sen george mitchell dmaine the incoming senate majority 
leader said he welcomed gorbachevs statement but added while 
these proposals are commendable they must be considered in view of 
overall levels of forces in europe and the offensive structure of 
soviet forces 
mitchell said he hopes the announcement will lead to the 
reinvigoration of longstalled efforts to negotiate cuts in 
military strength in europe 
house speaker jim wright dtexas called the speech certainly 
the most positive signal from moscow in 70 years much more positive 
because words at last are being accompanied by deeds 
we must not abandon caution but neither should we slam the 
door in the face of opportunity wright said in a statement 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan said mr gorbachev 
has promised a lot but can he deliver only his actions not just 
words will tell the world whether his un speech becomes a 
oneofakind christmas gift or just another stocking stuffer 
if we really see such cutbacks in eastern europe then we might 
indeed be seeing a goodfaith first step toward real conventional 
force parity our negotiators in vienna will be insisting on no 
less said dole 
sen tim wirth dcolo a member of the armed services 
committee said we need to bear in mind that we in the west have 
heard about a number of interesting proposals from gorbachev and 
other top soviet officials 
but what we havent seen is any real change in soviet military 
forces said wirth what we have seen is largely improvements in 
soviet forces 
sen alan cranston dcalif a member of the foreign relations 
committee was the most euphoric 
gorbachevs speech could be the end of the cold war the end of 
the arms race and the end of the danger of nuclear war he said 
of course we need deeds not words we have to see what the 
soviets actually do 
the top republican on the senate armed services committee sen 
john warner rva said i would urge a note of caution 
even if the soviets go ahead with the promised 10 percent troop 
reduction warner said they will have two and onehalf times as 
many tanks three and onehalf times as many artillery pieces 
its too early to tell exactly the impact of these dramatic 
announcements he said they may simply eliminate older less 
capable weapons the soviet union has quite a collection of 
antiquated military equipment 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said gorbachev has done more than anyone thought he 
could do politically his cuts are dramatic and significant 
especially that he will make them unilaterally 
but aspin warned dont be distracted by all the dramatic 
numbers youre hearing we dont fight wars by the numbers 
gorbachev promised to reorganize the soviet military aspin 
noted explaining that a reorganization that removes the soviet 
offensive capability declaws the russian bear and is far more 
important than numbers on a chart 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee called gorbachevs statements profoundly 
welcome 
if the soviet government follows through on gorbachevs pledge 
this will challenge the united states and its allies to act 
imaginatively to start a similar process of arms reduction said 
pell 
pell said the administration should take advantage of the 
openings created by gorbachevs speech to accelerate the momentum of 
arms control negotiations on conventional as well as nuclear 
weapons

the republic the statement said 
armenia was the hardesthit area in the caucasus

armenia and the neighboring republic of azerbaijan have been 
wracked by ethnic strife leading to the virtual declaration of

york a small village has practically disappeared from the face of 
the earth but he did not identify it

the temblor followed by a moderate aftershock measuring 58 on 
the richter scale struck a mountain region in the soviet union 
already wracked by months of ethnic violence between armenians and 
azerbaijanis 
staterun television in an unusually prompt and detailed report 
from the scene showed film of crumbled buildings in kirovakan 
armenias thirdlargest city and in spitak a regional center of 
armenia 
workers were shown picking up huge slabs of concrete amid the 
rubble in one dramatic shot a man put his hands over his head in 
grief as he stood amid a collapsed building 
the spontaneous elements didnt spare onestory or multistory 
building a tv correspondent said on the evening broadcast 
the correspondent said thousands were homeless and that there 
are casualties injured but neither he nor soviet news reports 
gave figures 
in several regions of armenia there is significant damage 
deaths and injuries tass said 
officials said communications had been cut off with leninakan 
near where the quake was centered and with much of the disaster 
area leninakan is 100 miles northwest of yerevan and close to the 
sovietturkish border 
they said the loss of communications complicated efforts to 
assess the damage and casualties 
the government set up a commission to oversee rescue and salvage 
operations and sent soldiers and civilian volunteers to the disaster 
area tass said 
state turkish radio quoted the kars provincial governor hasan 
fakir as saying four residents of the town of akyaka were killed in 
the quake many houses were damaged in akyaka and in the nearby 
cildir township it said 
tass said the quake reached 9 on the 12point soviet scale which 
measures tremors on the basis of their visible effects an 
earthquake of 8 on the soviet scale is described in soviet reference 
works as destructive causing cracks on sharp slopes and in 
wet soils monuments are moved or turned over houses are 
considerably damaged 
the moscow central seismic center put the epicenter 30 miles from 
leninakan 
because of violence between armenians and azerbaijanis more than 
180000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border between 
their two republics in the past three weeks the earthquake was 
likely to cause further dislocation 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

security at airport passenger checkpoints is 
improving but the government has found enough lapses to levy 16 
million in fines against 29 airlines 
the federal aviation administration announced the civil penalties 
tuesday and also said the detection rate for hidden weapons at the 
checkpoints has improved significantly during the past year 
the civil penalties ranged from 1000 against a handful of 
commuter carriers the minimum for a single violation to more 
than 200000 apiece against american airlines northwest airlines 
and united airlines for each having more than two dozen violations 
the airlines are responsible for the checkpoints although the 
screening by metal detectors and xray machines is normally done by 
a separate security firm under contract to the air carriers using 
the airport 
the penalties stemmed from security lapses discovered mostly 
between april and september of this year when undercover faa 
officials attempted to smuggle mock weapons through the checkpoints 
and were successful 236 times according to the agency 
as part of a stepped up effort to improve passenger screening at 
airports the government began to levy fines against the airlines 
earlier this year in september 32 airlines were fined about 1 
million for security lapses in late 1987 and early 1988 those fines 
were separate from the penalties announced wednesday 
shortcomings at the airport checkpoints came to light in 1987 
when during congressional testimony it was learned that more than 
one in five phony weapons planted by faa officials failed to be 
detected at major airports then on dec 7 1987 a disgruntled usair 
employee smuggled a revolver aboard a pacific southwest airlines jet 
and began shooting during flight the plane crashed killing all 43 
aboard 
according to faa figures the airlines in 1987 detected only 789 
percent of the mock weapons being passed through checkpoints by faa 
undercover agents during the first six months of this year the 
success rate increased to 856 percent and during the julyseptember 
period it improved to 889 percent the faa said 
but transportation secretary jim burnley told reporters wednesday 
he would like to see even fewer weapons missed and said the faa 
undercover work will continue 
although the detection rate has improved since last year i 
will not be satisfied until we achieve a 100 percent success rate in 
detecting weapons burnley said 
dot spokesman ed ohara said airlines were fined 1000 for each 
violation that occurred at a checkpoint where the overall detection 
rate was 95 percent or better and 10000 at a checkpoint where the 
overall rate was less than 95 percent 
in some cases a single violation resulted in several airlines 
being fined because a number of air carriers shared responsibility 
for a checkpoint the faa declined to provide a breakdown of the 
detection rates at various airports or disclose how many airports or 
which airports were checked 
four airlines were cited for at least two dozen violations 
united 33 violations for 24900 in fines northwest 29 violations 
for 209000 in fines american 28 violations for 208000 in 
fines and usair 26 violations for 179000 in fines 
other airlines and their violations and fines were 
pan american world airways 19 and 154000 delta air lines 17 
and 116000 continental airlines 14 and 85000 eastern 
airlines 11 and 65000 alaska airlines 10 and 64000 trans

infant health problems in the nations poorest 
rural areas grew worse during the first half of the 1980s reversing 
the trend of the late 1970s a consumer research group said 
public voice for food and health policy said wednesday that its 
analysis of infant health data from the nations 332 poorest rural 
counties found that the proportion of babies born at dangerously low 
weight dropped from 91 percent to 83 percent between 1975 and 
1980 then increased to 88 percent in 1985 
the study said the rate of low birthweight babies in the 332 
poorest counties those where at least onefourth of the population 
was below the federal poverty level was almost 30 percent higher 
than in the nation as a whole 
low birthweight is a major cause of infant death and longterm 
disability the study said the infant mortality rate in the poor 
counties was 136 per 1000 live births in 1985 compared with a 
rate of 106 nationally 
if the infant mortality rate in the poor rural areas had been as 
low as the national average during the decade the study said there 
would have been between 4000 and 6400 fewer infant deaths in those 
poor counties 
this country has long had one of the highest infant mortality 
rates among the worlds industrialized nations said rep roy 
rowland dga the only physician in congress and the vicechairman 
of the national commission to prevent infant mortality 
rowland whose district includes 13 of the 332 counties that were 
part of the study said infant health problems in rural areas have 
been worsened by reagan administration cuts in spending on health 
care programs 
he said the problem also stems from a decline in the number of 
physicians in rural areas a lack of transportation for pregnant 
women requiring health care and a failure to educate poor pregnant 
women on the importance of prenatal care

rep christopher cox won dismissal of a 
libel claim in a 5 million lawsuit by werner erhard and associates 
but slander allegations against the newly elected congressmen were 
allowed to stand 
although the slander charges remain undecided as a result of the 
judges decision attorneys for both sides claimed victory 
the lawsuit filed in may stemmed from a campaign pamphlet that 
criticized cox opponent nathan rosenberg for his ties to est the 
humanpotential movement founded by his brother erhard 
the pamphlet was sent to about 110000 households before the june 
7 republican primary in which cox defeated rosenberg it asked 
voters to read a los angeles magazine article that said the 
chicagobased cult awareness network has called est and other erhard 
programs destructive cults 
in a ruling released tuesday orange county court commissioner 
eleanor palk who is overseeing the case granted a request by cox 
attorneys to dismiss the libel charge 
palk said the pamphlet was a constitutionally protected political 
statement 
however she denied a request to dismiss charges that cox 
supporters posing as pollsters phoned voters and asked residents if 
they could vote for a candidate tied to est 
erhard attorney william ohare said the ruling vindicated his 
client cox attorney sue himmelrich also claimed victory

churches are gaining in numbers while providing 
a vital source of charitable funds and volunteer activities 
according to a study that says religious congregations devote nearly 
half the money they receive to charitable use 
the study from belief to commitment says churches surpass 
foundations and corporations as financial resources for charities 
the study was done by independent sector a washingtonbased 
group representing organizations involved in philanthropy and 
voluntary activities the gallup organization assisted in the study 
released wednesday 
the survey yielded much information on churches and their 
memberships in addition to the data on charitable activities 
for example 54 percent of congregations reported that their 
memberships had increased over five years compared with 18 percent 
reporting a decrease thirty percent of congregations were founded 
before 1900 16 percent between 1900 and 1930 25 percent between 
1931 and 1970 and 15 percent since 1971 indicating the continued 
vitality of religious institutions in the united states 
but the main aim of the study was to determine whether and how 
much churchrelated giving could be counted as evidence of the 
nonprofit sectors service to society 
the study found that 191 billion of the 414 billion 
contributed in 1986 to congregations was used in ways that express 
religious conviction about service to others 
in addition volunteer activities by clergy and church members 
were valued in the study at 131 billion some 253000 volunteer 
clergy gave an average of 70 hours per month and 104 million 
volunteers other than clergy worked an average of 10 hours per month 
on congregational programs 
the survey found that nearly nine out of 10 of the nations 
296000 congregations had one or more programs in human services and 
welfare with a heavy focus on family counseling activities 
seventy percent were involved in overseas charitable activities 
and 56 percent were involved in institutional care such as 
hospitals nursing homes or hospices 
this study makes clear how very large their community services 
are dwarfing all funds contributed to and by other voluntary 
organizations for local human services says a foreword to the 
study the report documents that religious congregations are the 
primary voluntary service providers for neighborhoods 
the 191 billion given by congregations mostly in the form of 
collections and pledges was in addition to the approximately 11 
billion contributed by other sources to religiously affiliated 
organizations such as schools nursing homes and day care centers 
the group said 
of the 481 billion in total expenditures by congregations in 
1986 84 billion was donated directly to other organizations and 
individuals the study said of that 55 billion went to 
denominational organizations and charities such as catholic 
charities 19 billion went to other charitable organizations in 
the community and 1 billion was given directly to individuals 
this compares to the total of financial support from all us 
foundations in the same year of 59 billion and of us business 
corporations of 45 billion making religions a primary source of 
financial grants independent sector said 
on the makeup of church congregations the study also found 
the bulk of congregations 124000 were mediumsized having 
100 to 399 members the nextlargest number 103000 were large 
with more than 400 members and 60000 were small with fewer than 
100 members not all reported their size 
fourteen percent of congregations ranked themselves liberal 26 
percent moderate 39 percent conservative and 18 percent very 
conservative congregations founded before 1900 were equally as 
likely to report their orientation as liberal to moderate as they 
were to report their orientation as conservative or very 
conservative of those founded since 1971 69 percent reported their 
orientation as conservative or very conservative 
more than 100 denominations protestant roman catholic mormon 
jewish muslim and others and all regions were represented in the 
sample 
the survey conducted from may 1987 through march 1988 included 
telephone interviews with 4205 local congregations and more 
detailed questionnaires given to a smaller sampling 
details on giving by individual congregations and denominations 
were kept confidential 
independent sector president brian oconnell said the study was 
undertaken before the outbreak of scandals involving television 
evangelists and was not intended to offset the negative publicity 
they caused

united states marshals live in legend as the 
men who tamed the wild west but their 200year career is 
intertwined with more of the countrys history than just bringing 
bandits to justice 
the countrys oldest law enforcement organization looks back at 
its storied history today as it begins a bicentennial celebration 
with the opening of an exhibit at the supreme court and a blacktie 
gala at a nearby hotel 
at almost every point in history when the federal government 
was involved in a significant event there were marshals 
participating says stephen boyle a spokesman for the us 
marshals service 
a marshal fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a 
homestead in the oklahoma land run of 1889 marshals guarded the 
first black student at the university of mississippi during the 
desegregation battles of the 1960s they ringed the pentagon during 
the vietnam war protests of the early 1970s 
they smashed whiskey stills during prohibition and arrested 
gangster al capone twice took the census until 1880 captured 
fugitive slaves before the civil war and protected freed slaves 
during reconstruction and did the hanging for hanging judge 
isaac parker in fort smith ark when oklahoma was still indian 
territory and bank and train robbers hid in the brush 
this is our heritage the preservation of history said clint 
peoples of waco texas peoples is the executive marshal for the 
bicentennial and served as a marshal for 15 years in north texas 
and as chief of the texas rangers 
sponsored by the united states marshals foundation a nonprofit 
fundraising organization the special guest at tonights event will 
be james arness who played marshal matt dillon on televisions 
gunsmoke for 20 years one of those being honored is deputy 
marshal rey f cestero of savannah ga for his assistance in 
apprehending two murder and abduction suspects in august 
included in the exhibit organized with the help of the 
smithsonian institution are the arrest warrant for geronimo an 
1870 ku klux klan robe from the klans birthplace of pulaski tenn 
a 1790 still from the whiskey rebellion era and one of the two 
machine guns from the st valentines day massacre in chicago the 
bloodiest of prohibition 
the exhibit which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2 
years also includes a jesse james vest and sidearm and original 
drawings by the legendary wyatt earp of four gunfights including one 
at the ok corral 
during their first 100 years marshals were the federal 
government at the local level says marshals historian frederick 
s calhoun there was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy so when 
the citizens got mad they took it out on the federal marshals 
partly as a result at least 400 and as many as 700 people in the 
marshals service died in the line of duty more casualties than in 
any other law enforcement agency officials say the reason they 
lack specific numbers is that officials are unsure whether all those 
who died had been deputized or were simply parts of posses and that 
makes it very fuzzy said stanley morris director of the 
marshals service 
appointed by the president the 94 us marshals are a part of 
the executive branch created by the first congress in the judiciary 
act of 1789 the same law that established the federal judicial 
system 
the marshals of the 1980s provide security in federal courts and 
protect supreme court justices when they travel beyond washington 
they track down federal fugitives and operate the witness protection 
program that gives new identities to those whose lives are 
jeopardized by testifying for the government 
they also are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs 
and other federal offenses and currently have threequarters of a 
billion dollars in their inventory boyle said marshals have 
managed horse ranches restaurants condominiums a golf course and 
a greenhouse taken in such raids 
with just the 94 marshals aided by some 2000 deputies and about 
1000 support staff the service is smaller than the new york city 
police department morris said yet its ranks are spread across 
every us judicial district from guam to the virgin islands 
calhoun who has a doctorate in history from the university of 
chicago says the deadliest era in the services history was before 
oklahoma statehood when about 100 marshals died in indian territory 
between 1872 and 1896 
with the exception of indian territory the far most dangerous 
time to be a marshal was in the south after the civil war calhoun 
said if the ku klux klan didnt get you the moonshiners did

some of the 83480 loan delinquencies targeted 
last month for official collection already had been settled by the 
time notices were sent out the farmers home administration says 
moreover many state fmha offices have been reporting far fewer 
delinquencies than the agriculture department agency listed on nov 
25 when it finished sending out the notices 
agency spokesman joe oneill said the 83480 loan delinquencies 
reported last month represented everybody who owed money and 
were behind in their payments to fmha 
in all more than 8 billion in overdue loans is involved the 
notices give a delinquent borrower 45 days to fill out forms showing 
how the debt will be settled 
oneill said in an interview that lists of 83490 delinquent 
loans were sent to county fmha offices so local officials could weed 
out those who had already made arrangements to settle their debt or 
for some other reason were not slated to get the notices 
as a result several thousand borrowers were pared from the 
tally he said those remaining were sent notices by certified mail 
over a 10day period beginning nov 15 
no indeed we did not sent out that many oneill said 
its probably closer to 80000 somewhere in there 
congress ordered fmha in the agricultural credit act of 1987 to 
revise its lending practices and to come up with ways of handling 
longoverdue debt owed by thousands of farmers one of the important 
features is a debt writedown or foregiveness provision which took 
effect last month 
the purpose of the notices is to give tardy payers an opportunity 
to let fmha know how they want to handle their debt under the new 
law if a farmer does not respond within the 45day period after 
receiving the notice the agency can begin collection proceedings 
including foreclosure and forced liquidation 
oneill said another point of misunderstanding is the manner in 
which local fmha offices have been carrying some of the borrowers on 
agency books for example he said some offices may not be 
including those whose overdue accounts have been accelerated or 
put into the foreclosure or forcedsale pipeline 
the 1987 law also changed the definition of a borrower to include 
anyone who owes fmha money so all those pastdue loans in 
acceleration and even those where the borrower is no longer 
farming are included in the list of delinquencies 
anytime you start playing with numbers its difficult at 
best oneill said

nearly 600 farms that have been in the same 
families for 200 years have been located and more are expected to 
be found the agriculture department says 
the departments effort to identify national bicentennial farms 
was undertaken last year as part of the 200th anniversary of the 
signing of the us constitution 
assistant secretary wilmer d mizell said the farms located so 
far are in 16 states mostly along the east coast the program was 
led by state food and agriculture councils which are made up of 
usda officials at the state level 
each of the farms located has been given a certificate signed by 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng to acknowledge the vital 
contribution of farm families to the growth and strength of this 
great nation 
also the families have been given metal signs to display in 
front of their homes identifying them in red white and blue as 
bicentennial farms 
mizell said wednesday that a total of about 700 farms is expected 
to be located families wishing to submit applications may contact 
state and local usda and extension offices for more information 
the oldest farm discovered dates back to 1632 when apprentice 
barrelmaker john tuttle survived a shipwreck off the coast of maine 
and found his way to dover conn to claim 15 acres granted him by 
charles i then king of england 
his decendant hugh tuttle and hughs three children still own 
the farm an enterprise that includes a roadside store 
as of nov 1 bicentennial farms identified by state included

the government is doing a poor job protecting 
the strategic petroleum reserve the nations main defense against a 
sudden cutoff of foreign oil supplies from possible sabotage or 
terrorist attack a house panel was told 
improvements are needed in the security program keith fultz 
of the congressional general accounting office told the house 
government operations subcommittee on environment energy and 
natural resources on wednesday 
there are vulnerabilities that exist said joe la grone an 
energy department official responsible for the strategic oil reserve 
the reserve created by congress in 1975 in response to the 1973 
arab oil embargo currently holds 550 million barrels of oil in 
caverns in texas and louisiana 
the house panel also heard details of a mock attack on the oil 
reserve in march 1987 by 11 army special forces troops to test 
security at the facility which includes 240 miles of pipelines and 
extensive support facilities such as power substations 
in the mock attack the invaders successfully knocked out the 
support facilities that are vital to pumping and transporting the 
stockpiled petroleum in an emergency they also recorded 53 mock 
casualties among the reserves defenders including 12 national 
guardsmen mistakenly killed by local sheriffs deputies 
la grone said officials have taken steps to improve security at 
the 18 billion reserve including more defense forces and a better 
communications network so defenders can avoid shooting each other 
fultz said that although the department has made some 
improvements in security were not convinced the spr could meet 
drawdown requirements if certain circumstances occur he did not 
elaborate 
fultz and la grone said the sheer size of the petroleum reserve 
including six depots and four marine terminals makes it 
impractical to try to protect every foot of it against sabateurs 
the energy departments defense plan envisions an attack at only 
one point compared with the four facilities hit simultaneously by 
the mock invaders officials said however that there have been no 
new multipoint attack tests since last years 
officials said their approach is to concentrate on key sites and 
to quickly repair any damage and get the emergency oil supplies 
flowing after an attack but they conceded their repair plans have 
never been tested 
fultz said the energy department has only one contractor to 
repair the 240 miles of pipeline a situation leaving the 
contractors equipment and spare parts vulnerable to sabotage la 
grone said a second contractor will soon be hired 
a detailed general accounting office study of the reserves 
security contained a series of recommendations for improvement but 
the study has been classified secret by the energy department 
la grone said those areas that need fixing that need upgrading 
they will get that 
after a closeddoor session following the public hearing 
subcommittee chairman mike synar dokla said department officials 
had agreed to implement some of the specific recommendations made by 
gao and to rethink their assumption that an attack would involve 
only one site 
im pleased that the department has finally acknowledged the 
seriousness of the security problems synar said all of the oil 
in the world wont do you any good if you cant get it out of the 
ground and to where you need it

an aide to presidentelect george bush says the 
new administration would use an international environmental 
conference to push for global cuts in carbon dioxide emissions and a 
ban on ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbon chemicals 
the aide bob grady told a luncheon wednesday at the climate 
institute that the bush administration also would advocate growing 
more forests and clearing fewer of them 
the climate institue is a nonprofit group trying to call 
attention to environmental threats from climate changes 
bush pledged during the presidential campaign to convene an 
international conference on the greenhouse effect causing global 
warming and said he would bring a conservation ethic to the 
white house 
he was not specific though on what results should come from a 
conference on the greenhouse effect he said only that it should 
develop a strategy for tackling this global problem 
his experience is that international cooperation is indeed 
possible in these matters said grady 
i sincerely believe george bush will use his foreign policy 
experience informed by the conservation ethic to work toward 
global consensus 
the agenda is clear we must work together to reduce the 
emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases 
we must plan to phase out cfcs chlorofluorocarbons that 
destroy stratospheric ozone we must stem the alarming net loss of 
forests around the world 
carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the principal gas 
whose buildup in the atmosphere trapping the earths heat is blamed 
by many scientists for the warming trend 
cfcs which contribute importantly to the warming already are 
the subject of an international agreement to reduce production by 50 
percent by 1998 because they destroy the highaltitude layer of 
ozone that protects the earths surface from the ultraviolet rays of 
the sun 
these chemicals are used abroad for aerosol propellants and 
everywhere for solvents refrigeration fluids and plastic foam 
production 
forest clearing in addition to other harm such as removal of 
wildlife habitat releases carbon tied up in plant tissue which 
becomes carbon dioxide when burned a growing forest however 
removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
brazilian forest burning to create farmland has been estimated to 
account for 10 percent of the 56 billion tons of carbon dioxide 
that reaches the atmosphere every year

worldwide acceptance of basic human rights 
standards has loosened the grip of a kgb mentality in the soviet 
union and made totalitarian terror unacceptably costly to most world 
leaders deputy secretary of state john whitehead said today 
whitehead commenting at state department ceremonies marking the 
40th anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of 
human rights said there has been significant human rights progress 
not only in the soviet union but in such eastern european nations as 
poland and hungary 
thousands have been allowed to emigrate hundreds of political 
prisoners have been freed and we have seen some loosening of 
controls on religious worship whitehead said 
he also said state security has become less a subject for 
official paranoia 
open discussion of important issues has become more widespread 
throughout the soviet union whitehead said i say let it 
continue and grow 
but he said there has been no forward movement on human rights in 
czechoslovakia bulgaria or east germany and said that in romania 
we are witnessing a regression 
whitehead also complained that in the soviet union millions of 
eastern rite catholics remain unable to practice their religion 
officially 
much change will have to occur before we can say that the 
average soviet citizen no longer fears his government that the rule 
of law has been established and that the arbitrary use of power by 
soviet officialdom has ended whitehead said 
still who would have thought eight years ago that the soviet 
union would be so changed he said 
leadership changes in the soviet union brought a loosening of 
the grip of what i would call the kgb mentality whitehead said 
many of the leaders of the soviet union began to take a more 
practical view of the world 
he said there are a number of reasons for these developments one 
is the fact that the growth of acceptance for universal standards 
of civil and political rights has today made that old standby 
totalitarian terror and oppression unacceptably costly in the eyes 
of most leaders 
whitehead said the united states cant claim credit for the 
changes taking place inside the soviet union but we can claim 
credit for having capitalized on the opening we found and pushed 
hard to accelerate the rate of change 
the universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the 
united nations on dec 10 1948 the actual 40th anniversary falls 
on saturday but is being commemorated in the united states today 
the declaration contains many of the civil rights laid out in the 
first 10 amendments to the constitution the bill of rights 
it also includes the right to leave and return to the country of 
ones origin and the right to send and receive information from any 
source across international borders 
it also calls for a limit to the power of a government to coerce 
individual citizens against their will and such affirmative rights 
as the right to an education the right to work at the occupation of 
ones choosing and the right to own property

a sports medicine expert says ailments such as 
black heel bikini bottom joggers nipples and toxic 
sock syndrome bother athletes and fitness fans more often than 
broken bones or strained muscles 
skin injuries such as these are among the most common of locker 
room complaints says medical professor rodney s w basler whose 
list of athletic ailments also includes runners rump and 
surfers nodules 
the skin bears the brunt of the punishment from exercise and 
develops injuries in unexpected ways basler said wednesday in an 
interview at the annual meeting of the american academy of 
dermatology 
the percentage of people in fitness conditioning or good 
athletic programs who develop some types of skin problems is quite 
large i wouldnt be surprised if threequarters or fourfifths of 
everybody in a fitness program has some type of skin injury said 
basler an assistant professor at the university of nebraska medical 
center and a fitness medicine expert 
most of the skin injuries will go away when the exercise is 
halted he said but the ailments can cause irritation pain and 
cosmetic concern 
joggers and marathoners whose skin must endure hours of 
punishment are heir to a number of dermatological problems ranging 
from black heel to runners rump 
black heel develops when constant flexing of the foot causes two 
layers of the skin the dermis and the epidermis to rub against 
each other in a shearing force said basler this breaks small blood 
vessels and causes blood to pool between the skin layers usually at 
the heel the result is blackened skin 
the same problem can occur on the palms of baseball players 
golfers weightlifters and mountain climbers basler said 
he said black heel will correct itself when the activity stops 
but many patients seek treatment because they worry about cancer 
runners rump is a discoloration at the base of the spine 
where the buttocks come together the doctor said it is a 
pigmentation change caused by the friction of the buttocks rubbing 
against each other the only concern said basler is cosmetic 
joggers nipple is a more painful problem usually 
experienced by men 
basler said it develops among runners who wear shirts that are 
not soft the friction of the cloth during exercise rubs the nipples 
raw few women experience the problem because they wear soft bras 
he said 
its surprising how big a problem this can be it actually 
stops some people from running basler said 
prevention is simple wear a soft cotton undershirt or cover the 
nipples with petroleum jelly or paper medical tape or run 
barechested 
pool chemicals can cause swimmers to develop a variety of skin 
problems 
basler said many pools use bromide instead of chlorine to control 
bacteria in the water and this can lead to a form of acne called 
bikini bottom 
the ailment usually consists of acnelike pimples and nodules 
most often on the backside 
it looks very much like classic acne said basler except 
its usually under the swimsuit 
treatment and prevention are both achieved by not sitting 
around in wet swimsuits he said 
basler said some patients who swim frequently also come to him 
because of lightcolored hair that suddenly turns green 
the color change is a result of copper in the pool water that 
gives a real distinctive greenish tint to the hair he said the 
treatment is to bleach the hair with peroxide 
another waterrelated injury is actually considered a scar of 
triumph he said 
he said people who spend hours riding the waves on boards develop 
what is called surfers nodules these are bumps of hard tissue 
that arise on the foot as a result of longterm contact with the 
surf board often the bumps contain grains of sand 
the nodules cause no harm said basler and the surfers 
consider them a badge of honor theyre proud of them 
all athletes who spend hours exercising in sweaty sneakers can 
develop something that basler calls toxic sock syndrome 
the ailment is characterized by an outrageously powerful foot 
odor and is caused by a bacterium that grows in the soft tissue of 
the feet left alone it can cause pits to develop in the skin he 
said 
treatment is with overthecounter acne medication containing 
benzol peroxide and prevention is accomplished by using more 
absorbent socks and a foot powder 
athletes foot a fungal infection that can cause itching and 
cracking between the toes remains one of the major skin problems of 
the locker room the doctor said medication and care can clear it 
up for three months or so but most people will get it again he 
said because the fungus takes advantage of a mild immune deficiency 
that many people have 
its essentially an incurable problem basler said with a 
sigh ive had it for 25 years myself

atampt and sprint are the winners in a fierce 
contest to provide telephone and hightech communications services 
to the federal government a prize worth up to 25 billion by the 
year 2000 
the losers were martin marietta corp and its bidding partner 
mci 
mci said it may challenge the decision which was made wednesday 
by the general services administration martin marietta asked for a 
detailed briefing on the decision which awarded contracts for a new 
federal telecommunications system called fts2000 providing service 
to government agencies through the 1990s 
gsa awarded the multibilliondollar contracts three years after 
outlining its needs for a new governmentwide phone service system 
that will include video computer and other stateoftheart 
communications 
we are elated us sprint communications co president 
william esrey said 
american telephone amp telegraph co officials expressed equal 
delight at the decision which provided contracts that are among the 
largest ever awarded by the us government aside from military and 
space program purchases 
gsa estimated the combined value of the contracts at between 3 
billion and 10 billion over 10 years but it could reach a maximum 
25 billion the contracts limit government spending to 15 billion 
on the atampt network and 10 billion on sprints 
the estimates are based on the governments purchase of 
longdistance telephone services over a 10year period actual value 
will depend on how much service the government actually uses 
acting gsa administrator richard g austin said atampt received a 
contract to provide approximately 60 percent of the service and 
sprint was awarded the remainder 
mci spokeswoman kathleen keegan said the company would challenge 
the decision in court and before the federal communications 
commission if it determines that atampt used predatory pricing 
that is below its direct costs 
mci priced the longdistance portion of the fts2000 bid as 
aggressively as possible she said if the longdistance portion 
of the winning bids were priced below mcis then we do not believe 
it is possible for the winners to provide that service on a 
profitable basis 
the bidding companies designated subcontractors in their 
proposals to the gsa those included in the losing martin marietta 
bid were gerca americacom and mcdonnell douglas tymnet 
boeing co and computer sciences corp were designated atampt 
subcontractors in the winning bid as well as regional bell 
telephone companies and other local telephone companies 
boeing is to provide program management and information services 
and computer sciences corp will develop and maintain a software 
system for billing the regional telecommunications holding 
companies and local companies will provide local network access 
according to atampt officials 
sprints subcontractor partners include gte and the regional 
telephone companies 
this is an important competitive win for atampt and our partners 
in this project said richard j lombardi atampt vice president for 
federal services 
the system is to be phased in over three years with the first 
users to begin service in 1989 and all federal users to be on line 
in 1991 lombardi said he expected service to be in place by next 
fall 
the contract provides for a new alldigital integrated network 
replacing what is already the worlds largest private 
telecommunications network with service by atampt the current system 
is capable of carrying only voice and slowspeed data transmissions 
the gsa said

the conservative heritage foundation today 
released the full 927 pages of what it hopes will be a blueprint for 
the incoming bush administration 
the third quadrennial mandate for leadership book contains 
more than 2000 recommendations on running the government in a 
manner acceptable to the conservative thinktank major portions of 
the report had already been made public prior to todays formal 
release 
the reagan administration adhered to many of the recommendations 
in the first such volume issued in 1980 and the foundation hopes 
for similar results once george bush takes office next month 
the new book includes recommendations on how to run the 
transition how to deal with congress foreign affairs and all the 
departments and major agencies 
it recommends a hardernosed approach on holding down federal 
spending including subjecting all programs including social 
security to the grammrudman deficit ceiling law 
the book repeats a host of other heritage positions including 
letting workers opt out of social security in favor of private 
retirement accounts pressing ahead with president reagans star 
wars missile defense system and renewing military aid to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
this mandate is actually 166 pages shorter than the 1980 
tome which ran 1093 pages mandate for leadership ii in

washington ap mikhail s gorbachev arrived at the united 
nations this week with precisely the message people across the globe 
most wanted to hear from a man with his finger on the button its 
time to stop using military might to settle political disputes 
nobodys omnipotent 
even in his hurried departure from the united states gorbachev 
was showing a face of kremlin leadership that stood in stark 
contrast to the shoewaving visit of the last soviet leader to visit 
the united nations 
addressing diplomats who know well that he is wrestling with 
difficult choices between guns and butter gorbachev on wednesday 
delivered a poignant call for peaceful coexistence punctuated with a 
theatrical announcement of red army troop reductions 
our people want to live in peace with the american people he 
said at one point later sightseeing in manhattan he remarked 
were very pleased by the fact that thousands of new yorkers have 
come out to see us we saw their faces we saw their eyes their 
friendliness 
all in all quite different from the 1960 visit of nikita 
khrushchev 
it was khrushchev who took off his shoe waved it around and then 
pounded it on his desk in anger he was unhappy when a speaker had 
referred to eastern europe as nations which have been swallowed 
up more or less by the soviet union 
gorbachev was polished and polite making friends from his 
arrival on but never so many as with his declaration on unilateral 
troop reductions even his sudden departure demonstrated a fresh 
character of soviet leadership gorbachev was returning home to cope 
with a devastating earthquake had killed thousands in the soviet 
caucasus region 
despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken 
mr gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to 
be there he has to lead the efforts the soviet foreign minister 
said late last night 
gorbachev left behind him a troopreduction timetable that many 
experts had expected last spring as a welcometomoscow gesture 
toward president reagan the american view clearly was better late 
than never and officials applauded gorbachevs call at the united 
nations for less reliance on military force 
the commander of armaments as ferocious as any in history told 
the united nations that the days were over when military force can 
or must be an instrument of foreign policy 
it may well come as a surprise to students of history students 
of chiles humiliation of bolivia and peru in the war of the 
pacific for example or of genghis khans mastery of the feigned 
retreat in establishing the mongol empire that force is not the 
only way to settle disputes 
in a world besot with thermonuclear arms where the next war 
could be the last the world thirsts for another way 
the internal problems of the soviet union have apparently 
prompted the politburo to seek another way as well 
it is now quite clear that building up military power makes no 
country omnipotent gorbachev said tacitly acknowledging the 
realities of a sputtering economy at home he added whats more 
onesided reliance on military power ultimately weakens other 
components of national security 
he said the soviet union will reorganize soviet divisions in 
eastern europe so they are clearly defensive he said it plans 
to cut soldiers and armaments in the european part of his country 
and in its asian territory in mongolia for instance a major 
portion of soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return 
home words that are sure to gain favor with khans ancestors and 
the communist leaders of china 
gorbachev has called on the united states and its allies to 
respond with some certain steps of their own but western 
leaders distrustful of soviet leaders generally and of the public 
relations wizardry of mikhail gorbachev specifically will want to 
see and hear more from moscow 
secretary of state george shultz praised the announced troop 
reductions as a significant step in the right direction but 
said even after they are complete in 1991 moscow would still enjoy 
an advantage in european conventional forces 
asked if the cold war were over shultz mulled the semantics and 
finally said he thought at least that things were now different 
different in large part because gorbachev continues to present a 
wholly different face to the west than the stolid leonid brezhnev or 
khrushchev perhaps best remembered for snarling we will bury 
you gorbachev toured new york and called it a unique city a 
city of splendid identity and architecture 
there is no question that mr gorbachev is a very different 
individual than his predecessors presidentelect bush said in 
assessing gorbachev after wednesdays power lunch he is a warm 
human being

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
claiming to have resolved his countrys human rights problems at 
home says the world court should have binding jurisdiction over 
enforcement of international human rights agreements 
in a wideranging address wednesday to the un general assembly 
the soviet leader called for vastly expanded responsibilities for 
the world body once shunned by his predecessors he also declared 
his government no longer holds political prisoners 
responding to western criticism of soviet emigration policy 
gorbachev said the kremlin has applied strict time limits on the use 
of state secrecy as a reason for refusing jews permission to 
emigrate 
although western observers generally acknowledge there have been 
dramatic reductions in the number of political prisoners since 
gorbachev rose to power human rights groups still count about 150 
people they say are being held solely because of their political or 
religious beliefs 
gorbachev said the problem of exit from and entry to our 
country including the question of leaving it for family 
reunification is being dealt with in a humane spirit but he gave 
no indication the soviet union is prepared to open its borders to 
unrestricted travel or emigration 
gorbachev also proposed a substantially broader role for the un 
and world organizations including the international court of 
justice at the hague netherlands commonly known as the world court 
the soviets have long promoted the concept of making the world 
courts humanrights rulings mandatory particularly on the five 
permanent members of the un security council the soviet union 
united states china britain and france 
the courts opinions now are advisory and nations tend to abide 
by them only when they so choose 
we believe that the jurisdiction of the international court of 
justice at the hague as regards the interpretation and 
implementation of agreements on human rights should be binding on 
all states gorbachev said 
our ideal is a world community of states which are based on the 
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to 
law he said 
on the subject of soviet emigration policy one of gorbachevs 
closest advisers alexander yakovlev a member of the communist 
partys ruling politburo told an american peace coalition after the 
speech that he does not believe that there are any serious 
obstacles to those who want to emigrate 
he said the process of disarmament has not reached a stage at 
which it is possible to let those with military secrets leave the 
country but yakovlev contended there are fewer than 46 such cases 
remaining 
this is unfortunate he added but it is another motivation 
to disarm 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said this is a 
problem that has disappeared with the establishment of an appeal 
procedure to permit review of refuseniks cases 
in his speech gorbachev also called for sending un 
peacekeepers into afghanistan and for barring weapons from outer 
space 
the soviet president proposed establishment of a peace corps 
to rebuild wartorn afghanistan and a team of international 
scientists to deal with environmental disasters 
turning from war on the ground to peace in the heavens gorbachev 
said the soviet union is also ready to cooperate in establishing 
an international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed 
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment 
all activities in outer space must rule out the appearance of 
weapons there there is already a strongly felt need to develop 
an allembracing regime for peaceful work in outer space the 
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a 
world space organization an idea that the soviets have been 
promoting in the united nations for several years 
we are prepared to incorporate within its system our 
krasnoyarsk radar station in siberia he added the united states 
has claimed the facility violates the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty and must be dismantled 
gerasimov said wednesday all military personnel have been 
withdrawn from the radar station and there is no krasnoyarsk 
radar station any more 
soviet scientists gorbachev declared are prepared to 
receive their foreign colleagues and discuss with them ways of 
converting it into an international center for peaceful cooperation 
by dismantling and refitting certain units and structures and to 
provide additional equipment the entire system could function under 
the auspices of the united nations 
a major function of the space laboratory would be to keep track 
of pollution for which gorbachev had another proposal 
let us also think about setting up within the framework of the 
united nations a center for emergency environmental assistance its 
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts 
to areas with badly deteriorating environment he said 
developing nations have been crushed by debt repayment schedules 
during the 1980s the total third world debt is over 12 trillion 
and many nations cant even pay the interest on their loans 
gorbachev proposed limiting their official debtservicing 
payments depending on the economic performance of each of them or 
granting them a long period of deferral in the repayment of a major 
portion of their debt 
he offered a moratorium on debt service of up to 100 years for 
the most needy debtor nations 
he backed the appeal of the genevabased un conference on trade 
and development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks which 
are almost exclusively in western nations

russian revolutionary leader nikolai bukharin 
returned to moscow from paris never dreaming that hed be jailed and 
executed in a stalinist purge his widow said in a television 
interview 
bukharins ignorance of dictator josef stalins murderous plans 
may explain the mystery of why bukharin came home despite the purge 
anna larina bukharin said in wednesdays broadcast 
her husband and other victims of stalin may have had some idea of 
what was going on but not to such an extent she said 
bukharin and 15 other veteran bolsheviks were posthumously 
rehabilitated july 9 and readmitted to the ruling communist party 
in february the soviet supreme court cleared bukharin and the 
others of treason spying and other charges for which they were 
executed or imprisoned 
mrs bukharin interviewed in moscow spoke in russian in a 
british broadcasting corp program titled bukharin and the 
terror that claimed to shed new light on one of the most notorious 
episodes in soviet history 
mrs bukharin said stalin in planning to get rid of her husband 
sent him to paris in 1936 ostensibly to collect party documents 
bukharins motives for returning to moscow have long been a 
subject of speculated since it was widely believed he must have 
known that he was under threat 
nikolai didnt have an inkling no i think he still wouldnt 
have believed if he had known he would have returned just the 
same he wasnt like that he would have returned to have his say 
to put his case mrs bukharin said 
bukharin was often seen as a likely successor to his close friend 
vladimir lenin who led the 1917 revolution and founded the soviet 
union and to whom bukharian acted as economic adviser 
lenin called bukharin not only the most valuable theoretician 
of the party but the favorite of us all 
stalin the party organizer used bukharin as his theorist and 
ally after lenin died in 1924 but bukharin opposed excesses in 
stalins forced collectivization and industrialization and in 
february 1937 he was arrested and tortured in prison before being 
tried in march 1938 and executed 
the program said bukharins body has never been found and that 
his widow was also arrested banished to astrakhan on the caspian 
sea and kept in prisons and camps for 20 years not seeing their 
only son in all that time until he was 21 
stalin died in 1953 mrs bukharin said that in 1961 when nikita 
khrushchev was in power she was called to a commission 
investigating her husbands case and shown a testament he had 
written the same document that her husband had asked her to 
memorize 
in his testament bukharin said he felt his helplessness in the 
face of a hellish machine 
he said he was sure history would prove him innocent and that a 
young and honest generation of party leaders would vindicate him 
and reinstate him in the party 
know comrades that on the banner which you will bear on the 
triumphant procession toward communism there is also a drop of my 
blood bukharin wrote 
mrs bukharin who was her husbands third wife and 25 years his 
junior said she first met him when they and stalin occupied 
apartments in what is now moscows metropole hotel

one hospitals solution to the runaway use of 
caesarean sections could eliminate 450000 needless operations and 
save more than 1 billion a year if adopted nationally according to 
a study published today 
however some experts question whether the program developed at 
mount sinai medical center in chicago could easily be copied at 
other hospitals because doctors are too afraid of malpractice suits 
to follow the proposed rules 
doctors at mount sinai reduced the caesarean rate to half the 
nationwide level by instituting five guidelines for performing them 
according to the report in todays new england journal of medicine 
use of forceps deliveries also fell 
to a large extent there has been a more handsoff attitude 
toward taking care of our patients said dr stephen a myers 
director of maternalfetal medicine 
caesarean sections are the most common form of surgery in the 
united states many experts agree that physicians perform far too 
many caesareans but there is little consensus over how to cut back 
between 198587 mount sinais program lowered the caesarean rate 
from 175 percent to 115 percent of deliveries the number of 
maternity patients at the hospital for the years totaled 6099 
nationwide last year 244 percent of the 38 million births were 
caesarean deliveries 
we lowered it not from 24 to 17 percent but from 17 to 11 
percent which is even harder to do said myers 
its like going on a diet the first five pounds are easy the 
last five pounds are tough 
the hospital accomplished the reduction by setting these rules 
except in emergencies second opinions must be obtained before 
all caesareans 
vaginal deliveries are preferred for all patients who have 
undergone previous caesareans 
difficult birth is considered to be an acceptable reason for a 
caesarean only if a women fails to deliver after two hours of strong 
regular uterine contractions 
fetal distress must be confirmed by a blood sample drawn from 
the fetus 
vaginal deliveries are recommended for nearly all breech births 
those in which the baby appears bottom first 
a peer review process ensures that all doctors follow the rules 
those who seem to be performing too many are notified although no 
disciplinary action is taken 
myers and colleague dr norbert gleicher estimated that if their 
program were adopted by other hospitals the united states could 
avoid 450000 caesareans hospitals charge about 3000 more for 
caesareans than for vaginal births and doctors charge 250 to 500 
more 
at beth israel hospital in boston dr benjamin sachs said 
doctors frequently do caesareans at the first sign of fetal distress 
because they fear they will be sued for malpractice if anything goes 
wrong 
i dont think what they have done in this particular hospital 
is going to be easy to duplicate in the environment that we have 
today sachs said 
in an editorial dr frederick c battaglia of the university of 
colorado questioned whether the chicago doctors paid enough 
attention to the safety of sharply reducing caesareans 
the doctors said the reduction made no difference in the death 
rate among babies or mothers although there were more reports of 
depressed breathing among infants they said this was probably 
because doctors were more alert to this problem not because of a 
true increase in its occurrence 
myers said doctors at the hospital were generally enthusiastic 
about the program although some women were unhappy when told they 
could not have caesareans 
some women say i dont want to go through that aggravation i 
want another caesarean section myers said but because they 
say it thats not a valid reason to do it we said no we are 
going to have a trial of labor

women who accept a 725 compensation offer for 
injuries caused by dalkon shield birthcontrol devices may be giving 
up claims worth many times that amount according to representatives 
of organizations that support these victims 
weve waited for years and we urge women to take the time now 
to make a careful decision about this first offer nancy worth 
davis of the dalkon shield oversight consortium told a news 
conference on wednesday 
nearly 200000 women have filed claims of dalkon shieldrelated 
injuries ranging from infections to sterility miscarriage and 
children born with birth defects 
us district judge robert merhige of richmond va has approved 
a 24 billion trust fund for women injured by the birth control 
device on dec 5 the administrators of the trust fund sent letters 
to women who used the shields offering them 725 to settle all 
claims as option 1 
the letter makes clear that it is only for women whose injuries 
are less severe or have very little if any proof to support their 
claim and who feel that 725 is fair and adequate compensation a 
separate option 1 will be offered to those who claim injury 
because of someone elses use such as the husbands or children of 
users 
other options not yet available will address more serious and 
specific injuries 
ms davis said this letter does not tell women what they are 
giving up in exchange for the 725 that it asks women to take the 
first offering is a throwaway offering 
this letter is for women who were not seriously injured women 
who have minimal claims or women who may have worn a shield for a 
couple of months and suffered from it and removed it immediately 
she said 
the ah robins co which manufactured the dalkon shield 
declared bankruptcy three years ago last july american home 
products corp agreed to buy the company and set up a trust fund to 
compensate the claimants 
sybil shainwald of health action international said there were 
17 million foreign users of the device and many of them are still 
wearing this time bomb in their bodies since no adequate recall 
campaign has ever been undertaken by robins or by any government 
robins spent 45 million in the us and approximately 
500000 outside the us to notify women of their rights an 
obvious discrimination at the time against foreign women women 
throughout the world were the guinea pigs for an unsafe and untested 
birth control device they paid with their wombs and their lives 
she said women should remember this is not a final offer but 
an elimination process 
several women at the news conference objected to the judges 
recent removal of the female chairman and two of the trustees 
supervising the trust 
merhige removed the trustees nov 28 after a complaint that they 
had shown bad judgment resulting in inaction and delays there were 
only five members on the board 
judge merhige fired the only women who were trustees of the 
victims settlement fund and the only trustees who were nominated by 
the victims said constance millerengelsberg a board member of 
the international dalkon shield victims educational association 
karen hicks of the dalkon shield information network said the 
dismissals threaten the independence and integrity of the trust fund 
we have watched our strongest advocates get chewed up and spit 
out discredited and disempowered she said

the man chosen by george bush to be united 
nations ambassador told irancontra congressional investigators he 
acted as a courier in a secret plan to provide military equipment to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels at a time us government assistance 
was prohibited 
thomas pickering testified in july 1987 before the senate select 
committee that investigated the reagan administrations secret arms 
sales to iran and the subsequent diversion of profits to the contras 
pickering told the panel he carried a document provided by a 
private group that planned to provide weapons to the contras giving 
it to thennational security aide oliver north 
he said he believed the document discussed a donation or sale of 
weapons and equipment with a dollar value which was in the 
millions 
pickering was ambassador to el salvador when he delivered the 
document to north in his testimony he said he did not consider his 
action to have violated the boland amendment which at the time 
prohibited us aid to the contras 
he said he did not report his actions through normal state 
department channels because of the sensitivity of the private 
operation and he wouldnt have known whom in the department to 
notify 
pickering said he had been contacted by someone representing the 
group and asked if he would help deliver the document pickering did 
not identify the group in his testimony other than to say it was 
engaged either in soliciting or receiving assistance for the 
contras 
pickering told the panel the group had information about a 
donation and wanted the document to go to contra leader adolfo 
calero pickering said he delivered the document to north who 
subsequently confirmed receiving it 
pickering currently the us ambassador to israel was named 
tuesday by presidentelect george bush as his un ambassador 
the washington post recounted pickerings irancontra testimony 
in an article in its editions today 
pickering testified that the document contained a list of 
military equipment purported to be available for support of the 
contras i think either from a private source or a foreign 
government source he said he delivered the document to north at 
the white house either in december 1984 or early in 1985 
pickering said during his testimony that he could not recall 
exactly when congress had enacted the boland amendment which in 
october 1984 prohibited the us government from aiding the contra 
rebels but he said he believed us officials were in complete 
observation of the amendment because of conversations he had with 
an official whose name is blacked out in the testimony

the atlantis returned from its 
fourday secret space mission more bruised than normal but the 
damage is not severe enough to delay its next scheduled launch nasa 
says 
up to 175 thermal tiles were heavily damaged apparently during 
liftoff possibly by something loose hitting the orbiter said 
conrad nagel atlantis processing director 
the damage comparatively is significant but its not a major 
concern he said wednesday we have to understand why we had 
this damage and keep it from happening again 
nagel said the damage would be easy to fix and that it would not 
affect atlantis next flight scheduled for launch april 28 with a 
spacecraft that is to be dispatched to the planet venus overall he 
said atlantis returned from its classified military mission on 
tuesday in very clean shape 
there were only a few minor technical problems during the flight 
he said one entailed a minor malfunction in the shuttles air 
conditioning system causing about a gallon of water to leak into 
the cabin the astronauts used a vacuum cleaner to clean it up 
nagel said 
during the flight the five astronauts inspected and assessed the 
battered tiles using a television camera on the end of the ships 
50foot robot arm nagel said 
the shuttle is covered with about 28000 tiles made of various 
materials designed to protect it from atmospheric reentry heat he 
said the tile damage posed no threat to the shuttles return to 
earth 
nagel said the heaviest damage was concentrated in a strip 
3to4feet long down the right hand side along the line of the 
fuselage 
one tile in the nose was missing and it looked like it was 
popped off by the impact of something he said 
there was speculation here that a part from the solid fuel 
booster rockets the external tank or the orbiter might have fallen 
off and hit the craft nagel said he did not want to speculate 
a small fiberglass panel was missing from one of atlantis 
maneuvering engines but this probably did not cause the problem 
officials said 
nagel made his comments in an interview from edwards air force 
base calif where he leads a team that is inspecting atlantis and 
preparing it for return to the kennedy space center here tuesday 
atop a boeing 747 airliner 
he said atlantis tile damage was about twice that suffered by 
discovery which made the first postchallenger shuttle flight two 
months ago 
it appears that between 125 and 175 tiles will have to be 
scrapped and replaced nagel said in addition he said scores of 
tiles with scratches and dings will have to be repaired in place 
dinged tiles are common on a shuttle with much of the damage 
being caused by objects kicked up from the runway when the vehicle 
lands 
he reported brakes and about 200 other systems modified since the 
challenger explosion 34 months ago worked well

more than 1700 civilians were 
killed and another 231 noncombatants disappeared in political 
violence this year the independent human rights commission of el 
salvador says 
in a report released wednesday the commission said 1747 
civilians were killed in politically related violence between 
january and november 
citing witness testimony it said 140 of the civilians reported 
to have disappeared had been abducted by government troops 
the report did not specify who was responsibvle for the remainder 
of the disappearances saying it had found no witnesses 
the government had no immediate comment on the report 
the commission did not include combat casualties in the 
9yearold war pitting marxistled guerrillas against the 
ussupported government 
in november alone the commission said 170 civilians were 
assassinated and 16 others kidnapped it said its findings coincided 
with an increase in the activities of socalled death squads and 
reported discoveries of corpses bearing signs of torture 
the activities indicate the interest of the armed forces and 
the government to return to the state of terror and the peace of the 
cemeteries said a commission official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
more than 65000 salvadorans have been killed in the civil war 
the majority of them civilians 
deaths squad activity reached a peak in the early 1980s when 
paramilitary groups reportedly linked to the armed forces persecuted 
suspected government opponents 
armed forces reports compiled by the associated press allege that 
the guerrillas are responsible for more than 300 civilian deaths in 
1988 suffered either in attacks or explosions of rebel land mines

elephant and rhinoceros populations declined in 
zambian wildlife areas because antipoaching efforts covered too 
much land scientists reported today 
developing countries should concentrate antipoaching efforts on 
portions of their large wildlife conservation areas if they cannot 
protect all the land adequately the researchers said 
rhino populations declined 63 percent a year and elephant numbers 
dropped 12 percent a year between 1979 and 1985 in zambias luangwa 
valley despite an antipoaching operation than began in 1979 the 
researchers wrote 
areas most patrolled by authorities showed the least decline and 
vice versa taking into account the size of each area the 
researchers wrote in todays issue of the british joural nature 
results support the view that an important factor in the 
overall decline in rhino and elephant numbers across the rest of 
africa is a shortage of manpower and ultimately of resources 
within national conservation departments said n leaderwilliams 
and sd albon of the university of cambridge in england 
in countries that spend relatively little on conservation the 
best strategy to protect economically valuable animals is probably 
to concentrate resources on relatively small areas of the reserves 
the researchers wrote 
such an approach has already helped in stabilizing numbers of 
black rhinos in kenya over the past year or so they said

college endowments buffeted by the october 
1987 stock market crash still posted a small gain in the last 
fiscal year a college business group reports 
the national association of college and university business 
officers said preliminary results from its survey of 100 major 
endowment funds indicated an average gain of 02 percent for the 
year ended last june 1 
that was down from a 138 percent gain for the campus endowments 
in fiscal 1987 the group said wednesday it beat the minus71 
percent return on the standard amp poors 500 during the year 
government and corporate bonds rose 75 percent during the same year 
the business officers have tracked major campus endowments 
annually since 1971 
caspa l harris executive vice president of the association 
said to the extent that one can point to a single reason for the 
sharp decline in endowment returns the october crash is 
responsible 
endowment funds are invested primarily in publicly traded 
securities and history suggests that the market values of such 
securities fluctuate widely based on changes in investor 
psychology he said

consumer spending was up in october as 
americans took out 356 billion more in consumer debt than they 
paid off the government said 
the october increase followed a tiny 2 million rise in debt 
during september the smallest change in six years the federal 
reserve said wednesday consumer credit fell by 81 million in 
october 1982 at the bottom of the last recession 
the october advance which translated into credit growth at an 
annual rate of 65 percent was still down from the 875 percent 
annual rate of growth recorded over the first nine months of the 
year 
still analysts said they believed consumer spending was 
strengthening after a period of sluggishness they noted that retail 
sales shot up 09 percent in october the biggest gain in seven 
months 
the latest numbers suggest that consumers are a little more 
optimistic about buying said michael evans head of a washington 
consulting firm i think they are not fighting higher prices as 
much as they had in the past 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall economic 
activity newfound strength in the consumer sector has prompted some

leaders of both major political parties are 
looking at ways to update and perhaps shorten the next national 
conventions in 1992 
the commission on national political conventions plans to make 
recommendations to both the democratic and republican parties before 
the parties begin planning their next nominating conventions 
frank j fahrenkopf jr who steps down in january as republican 
national chairman and charles t manatt former democratic national 
chairman are cochairmen of the commission both said at a news 
conference wednesday they want to update conventions in an era when 
changing nominating rules and growth of the primary system have 
removed much of the suspense 
fahrenkopf said in some cases professional wrestling programs on 
competing stations drew more viewers than the television networks 
coverage of the two conventions last summer it may have been more 
interesting at times he said 
the gop leader said the commission would consider whether 
conventions could be streamlined in some way to make it crisper 
make it cleaner from the standpoint of presenting a program that 
will attract more americans to watch it 
he said the panel which includes some network television 
representatives would also take a hard look at what really the 
role should be of the media particularly television in covering 
conventions

three decades of rock n rollers and 
country stars paid tribute to roy orbison remembering the 
blackclad balladeer as an angelvoiced original who pioneered the 
early days of rock 
roy didnt copy anybody but it cannot be said that a lot of 
people didnt borrow from orbison and theyll tell you that from 
the beatles to bruce springsteen veteran recording artist carl 
perkins said wednesday 
he was and always will be one of the greats of rock n roll 
said former beatle paul mccartney 
orbison who rose to fame with early 1960s hits like oh pretty 
woman only the lonely and cryin and recently returned to 
the charts with a group of rock legends died of a heart attack 
shortly before midnight tuesday in a hospital in nearby 
hendersonville he was 52 
he had been visiting his mother nadine earlier in the day 
it hurts too much today to say a lot about roy orbison said 
johnny cash who lived next door to orbison for more than 20 years 
in hendersonville 
for 30 years we were heart to heart sharing the good times 
and the bad i have lost one in my most inner circle of friends he 
more than deserves all the praise and plaudits that he has received 
lately cash said 
orbison had 27 straight records on the charts during his heyday 
in the early 1960s he recorded for sam phillips at sun records the 
label that launched the careers of elvis presley jerry lee lewis 
cash and perkins 
his dark attire ebony pompadour and everpresent sunglasses were 
a virtual trademark but fellow artists remembered him for his 
effortless threeoctave voice that crooned ballads of lost love 
he had to be one of the best if not the best singers ive 
ever worked with phillips said he was an unusual guitarist 
also and a great one but he could sing things that would make you 
stop and stand at attention 
lewis called orbison a great singer he worked hard at it 
it probably will be a big loss to a lot of fans i was a fan ill 
miss him 
he had the voice of an angel said billy joel his loss 
with be felt by anyone who loves rock n roll 
orbisons recent recordings as one of the traveling wilburys 
along with exbeatle george harrison tom petty bob dylan and jeff 
lynne brought him a new generation of fans the groups handle 
with care is no 45 on the charts and their swiftselling album 
the traveling wilburys is no 8 
ive been rediscovered by young kids who had never heard of me 
before the wilburys orbison said earlier this year in an 
interview with the associated press 
its very nice to be wanted again but i still cant quite 
believe it 
harrison and petty said through publicists that they were too 
stunned by orbisons death to comment immediately 
he was as gentle wise and mysterious as his voice said 
u2s bono who recently recorded with orbison in memphis 
starting over more than once he was at the time of his death 
the finest white pop singer on the planet writing a song for him 
was like writing a song for elvis presley the only other comparable 
vocal talent 
orbisons career peaked in the first half of the 1960s but tailed 
off in the aftermath of his wifes death in a motorcycle accident in 
1966 and the deaths of two of his three sons ages 10 and 6 in a 
fire that destroyed his 150000 lakeside home in 1968 
his biggest success came with oh pretty woman about a 
flirtatious episode which sold more than 7 million copies in 1964 
a cover version later was a hit for van halen 
presley one year orbisons senior introduced him in 1977 as 
the greatest singer in the world bruce springsteen saluted him 
in his song thunder road 
emmylou harris who collaborated with orbison on the 
grammywinning 1980 song that loving you feeling again called 
him one of the greatest singers that ever lived there will never 
be another like him 
roy orbison was a great musician and a great friend to country 
music we have lost a giant said dolly parton 
orbisons business managerwife barbara was en route to 
california from germany early today to arrange for services

opposed unilateral cuts in red army conventional forces resigned 
the same day president mikhail s gorbachev announced a major 
cutback of 500000 troops 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov confirmed 
wednesdays resignation of sergei akhromeyev 65 but said the 
marshals decision was based on poor health and not in protest of 
gorbachevs move

the united nations gerasimov said the soviet leader announced a 
reduction in soviet forces by a halfmillion from its present 55 
million

news conference in new york the timing of the resignation was 
merely a coincidence he said

central committee whose military career spans 48 years will remain 
as an adviser to gorbachev gerasimov said 
akhromeyevs resignation was not immediately reported by soviet 
media

summits with president reagan and visited the pentagon in july to 
meet with us military officials

mikhail s gorbachev decided to fly back to the 
soviet union today ahead of schedule to direct relief efforts in the 
wake of a devastating earthquake when the people are suffering he 
has to be there his foreign minister said 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush expressed their 
condolences for the tragedy during their meeting wednesday with 
gorbachev on governors island in new york harbor 
before the day was over a stream of steadily worsening reports 
from the southern caucasus region of the soviet union had prompted 
gorbachevs decision to cut his visit to the united states short 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze called a sudden 
news conference late wednesday night to announce that gorbachev was 
canceling the remainder of his appointments in new york and dropping 
plans to fly on to cuba and britain he said gorbachev would depart 
for moscow before noon est 
despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken 
mr gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has to 
be there he has to lead the efforts shevardnadze said 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin called white house national 
security adviser lt gen colin powell at about 1130 pm and 
announced that gorbachev was going back early because of the 
earthquake said presidential spokesman bj cooper 
the earthquake prompted an abrupt end to a tour that had already 
won plaudits for the soviet leader at the united nations and praise 
from reagan and bush following a twohour meeting 
the soviet leader went on the diplomatic offensive in a speech to 
the united nations general assembly announcing that within three 
years he would reduce the soviet military machine by 10000 tanks 
and 500000 troops he also called for a jan 1 ceasefire in 
afghanistan proposed a 100year moratorium on third world debt and 
promised to prohibit political and religious persecution in his own 
country 
and he prodded bush not to let the momentum of recent 
armscontrol achievements lapse he said the soviets are ready to 
negotiate a dramatic cut in longrange nuclear weapons without 
long pauses or backtracking 
reagan and bush applauded the spirit of his remarks but were 
cautious in responding bush said he had made it clear that we 
needed some time 
reagan returned to washington and said in a speech to 
conservatives that he was still an anticommunist although he 
said the soviet troop reduction will be an important step 
forward if it is carried out 
with his diplomatic business accomplished gorbachev began what 
was to have been two days of sightseeing in new york but the fun 
ended quickly as damage reports mounted from the soviet earthquake 
shevardnadze said the quake hit armenia azerbaijan and georgia 
in the caucasus mountains near the soviet border with turkey and 
iran and that the epicenter was near the armenian town of leninakan 
armenia and azerbaijan have been wracked for months by racial 
strife leading to the virtual declaration of martial law in that 
region 
the geological survey in golden colo said the quake occurred 
wednesday morning and registered 69 on the richter scale a quake 
of that magnitude is capable of causing widespread heavy damage 
its a terrible tragedy not only for the armenian people but 
for all the soviet people shevardnadze said he said precise 
figures were not yet available but estimated that the quake had 
killed thousands of people 
he said some remote areas in the mountainous region had been cut 
off from the outside world 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov has been appointed head of a 
special government commission to cope with the emergency and was in 
the region shevardnadze said 
shevardnadze said gorbachevs havana and london visits would be 
rescheduled

mikhail s gorbachevs cancellation of a 
threenation tour to return to his earthquakestricken nation 
demonstrates the soviet leaders ability to respond quickly to 
events in a country he often complains is bound by its own 
bureaucracy 
barely four hours before the presidents decision was announced 
at a surprise latenight news conference chief foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov had dismissed any suggestion 
gorbachev might cut short his stay in new york 
although the spokesman acknowledged the situation was serious and 
a small village has practically disappeared from the face of the 
earth he told reporters that relief efforts were being handled 
routinely by mobilization of the armed forces and physicians he 
noted it was a natural disaster and gave no indication any 
presidential action was necessary or even under consideration 
gorbachev at the time was attending a starstudded reception at 
the united nations at the end of a day marked by his announcement of 
a dramatic military force reduction earlier in the day he had bid 
a friendly farewell to president reagan his fourtime summit 
partner urged presidentelect george bush not to delay the 
strengthening of ussoviet ties and toured new york for the first 
time 
a short time later as other members of his entourage were going 
to bed gorbachev instructed foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
to round up reporters for the announcement of his imminent return 
home 
although such decisions are still reached in the secrecy of the 
high soviet counsels it was apparent the remainder of gorbachevs 
highly publicized new york stay including the opening of a trade 
show a stroll through central park and a tour of an art museum 
would have contrasted sharply with the stark pictures of disaster at 
home 
and gorbachev whose nationally televised personable chats with 
constituents have set a new modern style for a soviet leader could 
hardly ignore the human tragedy to continue on to cuba and britain 
in the coming days almost certainly would have evoked comparison 
with reagan who hesitated before breaking off a california vacation 
to return to washington after the soviets shot down a korean air 
lines passenger jet in 1983 
the caucasus calamity took on an added dimension because it 
struck a region that for months has been the scene of ethnic strife 
between armenians and azerbaijanis and more recent nationalist 
demonstrations in shevardnadzes native georgia 
the unrest which has exploded into fatal rioting in several 
azerbaijani cities and sparked massive demonstrations and general 
strikes in armenia has prompted authorities to deploy troops and 
tanks in the streets in some areas tens of thousands of refugees 
have fled their homes in fear of pogroms 
but despite the military presence gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness also has been evident in the region 
authorities have tolerated dissent and criticism they once would 
have crushed with brutal force

president roh taewoo replaced the top 
leaders of his political party today as he continued efforts to 
sever ties to his authoritarian predecessor 
roh named veteran legislator park joonkyu chairman of the 
governing democratic justice party park replaced yoon gieljoong in 
the partys no 2 post with roh remaining as party president 
park immediately promised to work with the opposition parties to 
remove all vestiges of the authoritarian rule of former president 
chun doohwan and ensure the introduction of full democracy 
roh replaced his cabinet monday and is planning further shakeups 
as part of efforts to defuse nationwide furor over demands for 
action against chun he has promised to release political prisoners 
and compensate people who suffered under chun 
about 200 radical students demanding chuns arrest attacked the 
governing partys office in the southern city of taegu today the 
yonhap news agency reported no injuries were reported and police 
arrested five protesters the agency said 
down with president roh taewoo who protects chun 
doohwan read placards carried by protesters 
park who will oversee the daily workings of the party said he 
wanted to clear all questions about corruption and other abuses 
under chun by the end of the year he urged the opposition to 
cooperate with the government and said he would retain his post for 
just one year to show his good intentions 
a veteran lawmaker park was a top political leader in the 1970s 
and is regarded as a moderate he has headed the south korean 
delegation in recent talks with communist north korea on easing 
tension 
as part of his promise to bring in more moderate officials roh 
also removed secretarygeneral park junbyung a retired army 
general and noted hardliner

appointment of park as party chairman saying he had helped suppress 
democracy in the past and his selection casts doubt on rohs

lee sangsoo spokesman of the party for peace and democracy 
said we get the impression that president roh is retreating from 
his promise that he will cut off ties with the chun era 
the reunification democratic party the other main opposition 
party said parks selection proved roh wanted to maintain military 
dictatorship 
roh asked the nation to forgive chun after the former president 
apologized to the nation nov 26 for abuses under his rule and went 
into voluntary internal exile but opposition parties say there can 
be no question of pardon until chun cooperates with a national

east side west side and all around the town 
mikhail gorbachev sampled the sights of this unique city twice 
stepping out of his limousine to the delight of cheering new yorkers 
and the dismay of his security detail 
nobody booed at all everybody cheered said mark johansen 
30 after the soviet president and his wife raisa emerged from 
their motorcade briefly wednesday in the middle of broadway in 
manhattans theater district 
the gorbachevs watched dusk spread over the twinkling city from 
the top of the citys tallest building the 110story world trade 
center then sped uptown to the gaudy lights of times square as 
crowds lining the streets cheered and applauded 
the crowd was just going hysterical said joe crawford a 
17yearold high school student from connecticut it was really 
exciting that he stopped here in front of us 
the gorbachevs did it again minutes later uptown when they 
greeted onlookers outside that consumer cornucopia bloomingdales 
department store 
but after only one day of diplomacy and sightseeing they cut 
their visit short soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
announced late wednesday that the soviet leader would leave new york 
a day early because of a catastrophic earthquake in three soviet 
republics 
the cancelled plans today included a soviet trade show and a 
stroll through central park and the metropolitan museum of art with 
his wife 
the gorbachevs and their 45car motorcade toured manhattan on 
wednesday after he addressed the united nations general assembly and 
attended a luncheon with president reagan and vice president george 
bush on governors island 
following a short ferry voyage to manhattan the communist party 
leader sped through the heart of us capitalism to wall street and 
the world trade center 
the motorcade did not cause the massive gridlock feared by 
officials and commuters and provided normally unimpressed new 
yorkers and tourists with a novel diversion 
i just saw gorbachev a messenger said after the motorcade 
passed ill never wash my eyes again 
for gorbachev known for his westernstyle politicking the 
feeling of excitement seemed mutual 
were very pleased by the fact that thousands of new yorkers 
have come out to see us gorbachev said on the buildings 
observation deck we saw their faces we saw their eyes their 
friendliness 
believe me we appreciate this we are grateful for this warm 
hospitality 
atop the twin towers the gorbachevs received gifts a steuben 
crystal sculpture of a bald eagle for gorbachev and a bouquet of 
roses and a silver bowel from tiffanys for mrs gorbachev 
the soviet president said it was nice to be here as a tourist 
almost half a mile over new york 
what i particularly liked about the city is this is a unique 
city a city of splendid identity and architecture gorbachev 
said you see different areas in the city that have their own 
special identity 
as the sun set the gorbachevs gazed out the windows 
just beautiful just beautiful mrs gorbachev said 
when the empire state building was pointed out her husband 
quipped that he had heard of it 
then they headed uptown 
night had fallen by the time they reached times square and its 
dazzling illuminated signs welcome general secretary 
gorbachev read one frisky wives ii proclaimed a movie 
theater marquee 
the gorbachevs stop at 50th street and broadway lasted less than 
a minute much to the relief of jumpy guards who quickly surrounded 
him the soviet first couple waved and raised locked hands over 
their heads and the crowd went wild 
i waved to him he waved back with a smile said a tickled 
tina russo 16 of new jersey 
he surprised us said chief of department robert j johnson 
the citys highest ranking uniformed police officer when the 
gorbachevs limo stopped the advance part of his police escort 
continued along broadway but made a quick uturn and returned when 
they realized what had happened 
the motorcade continued uptown and east to bloomies and the 
gorbachevs second impromptu stop before arriving at the soviet 
mission 
while her husband gave his un speech and met with reagan and 
bush mrs gorbachev had lunch with nancy reagan and barbara bush at 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars east side residence 
the stylish soviet first lady later went to estee lauder incs 
offices near central park where she sampled perfume and examined 
the companys selection of cosmetics 
i am happy to be in the city you call the big apple she said 
at the luncheon speaking through an interpreter

claims that the greenhouse effect already is 
warming earths climate are under attack by researchers who say the 
theorys advocates are like chicken little 
william kellogg went undefended wednesday during the american 
geophysical unions fall meeting when he asserted we are in the 
grips of an irreversible global change that has already started to 
warm the atmosphere 
i liken my position to being like daniel in the lions den 
said kellogg a retired atmospheric scientist from the national 
center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
i think youre more like chicken little replied retired 
climatologist arnold court of california state university 
northridge 
theres going to be a greenhouse effect but that doesnt say 
where or when its going to happen im denying its here now 
said meteorologist jerome namias who headed the national weather 
services extended forecast division for 30 years 
the anticipated warming of the climate by carbon dioxide and 
other pollutants which trap heat from the sun like glass in a 
greenhouse is a very convenient scapegoat for the drought that 
baked much of the nation this summer but there is no evidence it 
caused the drought said namias now with the scripps institution of 
oceanography 
many climatologists predict the greenhouse effect will warm the 
earths climate by 4 to 9 degrees fahrenheit by about 2050 
increasing total precipitation but making some areas drier and also 
perhaps melting enough polar ice to raise sea levels and flood some 
coastal areas but they disagree on whether the phenomenon is under 
way 
kellogg said records kept by the university of east anglia in 
norwich england show average global temperatures rose by 11 to 
14 degrees from 1880 to 1986 consistent with the theory that 
carbon dixoide from increased burning of fossil fuels has warmed the 
earth since the industrial revolution 
kevin trenberth a researcher at the boulder center said 
temperature measurements tend to be made in cities which got warmer 
due to rapid growth 
william sprigg director of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations climate office in rockville md said the case 
has not been made that greenhouse gases explain what we see 
namias said his study shows this years drought fit the pattern 
of many earlier dry periods and had many causes the causes included 
complex changes in interacting patterns of the jet stream and other 
winds ocean and air temperatures atmospheric pressure and soil 
moisture all of which explain what went on quite adequately 
without the greenhouse effect he said 
the drought has been blamed for at least 128 billion in us 
agricultural losses 
in june experts told a congressional committee that rising 
temperatures worldwide including four recordbreaking warm years 
this decade were caused by a buildup of greenhouse gases 
james hansen a national aeronautics and space administration 
climatologist told the panel the evidence is pretty strong that 
the greenhouse effect is here and the 1988 drought and heat wave 
were examples of what would happen more frequently in the future 
the frequency of droughts in the united states over the past 
century suggests that the drought of 1988 cannot be distinguished 
from the normal climate variability of the past century said tom 
karl of noaas climatic data center in asheville nc 
namias emphasized the summertime drought over much of the nation 
is different than the wintertime drought that has plagued the west 
coast since 1986 namias expects heavy rains this winter in 
washington state oregon and northern california but said so far 
they havent materialized

those who grew up with roy orbison never 
doubted the musical ability that would carry him to rock n roll 
fame 
i thought early on that roy was the one of us that really had 
the talent said charlie evans who played bass fiddle in a high 
school band with orbison the rest of us were just hangalongs 
roy would think and live and breathe music 
orbison whose piercing voice on such early 1960s hits as oh 
pretty woman and cryin made him a rock legend died of a 
heart attack late tuesday in hendersonville tenn he was 52 
orbison came with his family to this west texas oil town of 1200 
during the oil boom of the 1940s his father orvie lee worked in 
the permian basin oil fields but found time to teach his son to play 
the guitar at age 6 
some here can still remember the singersongwriter when he was a 
skinny 11yearold playing his guitar outside the drugstore for 
small change 
in high school orbison and some friends formed the wink 
westerners which played country and western music at school dances 
and bars and later had a radio and television show sponsored by a 
furniture store in nearby odessa 
evans recalled the groups first trip outside texas when they 
traveled to chicago as the campaign band for a wink resident who was 
running for a national lions club office 
that was the first time any of us had been to the big city 
he said we had never seen a subway 
the group changed its name to the teen kings after its five 
members graduated and played a newer kind of music rock n roll 
after a trip to nashville and a national tour they came back 
to wink and all of them were driving cadillacs said john paul 
pitts a former wink resident who lived one house away from orbison 
i used to come out of my house and see roy in the back seat of 
his car practicing the guitar because his house was so small 
said pitts who wore orbisons sport coat for his high school 
graduation because he didnt own one 
town officials last year renamed the street where the singer had 
lived roy orbison drive although the shotgun house his family 
occupied is no longer standing 
orbisons musical ambition was evinced in the verse beneath his 
senior picture in his 1954 high school yearbook to lead a western 
band is his after school wish and of course to marry a 
beautiful dish 
orbison last visited west texas for an oil aid concert in midland 
last year to benefit economically distressed oilfield workers 
i never thought that success changed him said bill beckham 
publisher of the wink bulletin and the winkler county news who 
attended high school with orbison wink was always home for roy 
even though he had not been there for many years

most new yorkers found the best view of the visit 
by mikhail gorbachev on television 
but being there and being part of history made a little 
difficulty worth the effort for some residents of the trafficchoked 
city 
the soviet leaders tour of manhattan on wednesday consisted 
mainly of a speeding 45car motorcade with flashing lights and 
screaming sirens punctuated by two stops during which gorbachev 
delighted crowds by emerging from his limousine 
the 75minute tour which followed gorbachevs speech to the 
united nations and lunch with president reagan and presidentelect 
bush will form some of the most lasting images of a trip cut short 
by a severe earthquake in the soviet south 
most were glad to see gorbachev visiting the city but for others 
it either did not live up to their expectations or made things worse 
during the hectic christmas shopping season 
that was it said joan swift as the limousines bearing 
gorbachev and his entourage sped off from the united nations where 
she had waited more than an hour on wednesday to just wave 
some sidewalk vendors found the visit good for business but 
santa clauses complained of being moved from such key locations as 
the door to the new york stock exchange to prepare for the gorbachev 
caravan 
gorby gridlock the traffic jams predicted for the motorcade 
was never as bad as the most dire predictions but that didnt 
soothe the tempers of those who did bring their cars into midtown 
and found evening rush hour worse than normal 
the visit to lower manhattan at the start of the afternoon rush 
hour left some motorists in their cars for more than an hour the 
brooklynbattery tunnel was also closed from 435 pm to 5 pm 
backing cars up several miles on both sides 
staten island ferry schedules were disrupted during the afternoon 
as the soviet party returned from the meeting on governors island 
and some buses couldnt run their normal routes with streets closed 
in times square police wouldnt let pedestrians through for 
about a halfhour before the motorcade passed 
i cant cross the street im just trapped said ishmael 
roberts who works in an office building in times square and wanted 
to catch a bus home 
gorbachevs motorcade also closed fifth avenue for about an hour 
drawing a bah humbug from a santasuited bell ringer for the 
volunteers of america 
it was bad for business said james robertson everything 
was blocked off it slowed down the donations 
gorbachevs day also included a speech at the united nations 
lunch with president reagan and presidentelect george bush on 
governors island and a stop at the world trade center 
while advocates for the homeless said the police had told the 
homeless to leave the un area a charge police deny officials 
couldnt stop some 1000 demonstrators from massing outside the un 
to remind gorbachev of problems ranging from the plight of soviet 
jews to unrest in soviet armenia fiftysix protesters were arrested 
but most of the thousands who lined gorbachevs motorcade route 
were friendly and the feeling of good will was not lost on the 
soviet leader 
were very pleased by the fact that thousands of new yorkers 
have come out to see us he said at the world trade center we 
saw their faces we saw their eyes their friendliness

the dollars finish was higher than the 123yen mark for the 
first time since nov 16 when it closed at 12354 yen

many traders who bought cheaper issues in spot trading and sold 
issues in futures trading to turn profits wednesday were mainly 
selling in spot trading today pushing prices lower said an analyst 
with nomura securities 
a dealer with a major securities firm said many institutional 
investors were either sitting on the sidelines or selling issues for 
profittaking after wednesdays big gain 
volume traded on the first section was estimated at a moderate 
900 million shares 
on the foreign exchange market traders said the dollars rise 
followed sharp gains overnight in overseas markets after soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev announced at the united nations that he 
would cut soviet troop strength by 500000 and reduce the number of 
its conventional armaments 
on wednesday the dollar closed at 12363 yen in new york and at 
1234012350 yen in london 
the market took the soviet move as a helping hand for the 
united states toward cutting its huge fiscal deficits by easing 
us defense obligations said a dealer with the bank of tokyo 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
there was little movement in tokyo after the market opened said 
minori takeuchi of chemical bank in tokyo 
although the dollar in new york sharply rose following news of 
a possible soviet arms reduction in europe players in tokyo dont 
believe the dollars uptrend will continue much longer she said 
the bank of japan reportedly intervened in the market to support 
the dollar before the close of tokyo trading buying dollars at 
around 12290 yen currency dealers said

council veteran 
incumbent ben stewart won his fifth term as mayor in an election 
wednesday in which 322 persons or 41 percent of the eastcentral 
georgia citys 778 voters went to the polls 
stewart defeated his brother bob stewart 168154 
both stewarts said they were glad the race between them had come 
to an end 
im relieved its over im sorry the situation developed in 
the first place said the 39yearold mayor 
thats the way it goes it was a close race said bob 
stewart 33 adding i didnt want it to happen im glad things 
are over 
the stewarts were the only candidates in the nonpartisan race 
during the past few months published reports said the rivalry 
between the stewarts started out as a feud over the 
multimilliondollar will of their father the late john ben stewart 
who served as mayor from 1967 to 1979 the father was killed in a 
automobile accident on dec 27 1987 
several months ago bob stewart said he filed a lawsuit against 
his brother concerning a partnership in a business venture 
it has nothing to do with the will nobodys contesting the 
will that i know of he said 
bob stewart said his brother who lost a bid for a state house 
seat told him he did not intend to seek reelection both were 
surprised to see each other when they showed up on the first day of 
qualifying for the 100amonth job 
i wanted to be the one to replace him bob said i didnt 
run a race against my brother he ran against me i announced 
first 
in 1980 bob stewart at age 25 was the youngest union point 
council member ever to be elected 
since he could not run for the mayors office and a council post 
bob stewart said his loss will mean devoting his energies into his 
insurance agency 
ben stewart who is in the finance business said his brother 
never asked him if he planned to run 
i qualified first and it was wellknown that i was running 
he said 
the sibling rivalry fueled much talk among the towns 1600 
residents 
a lot of people are friends of both of us and this has made it 
hard said bob stewart 
the contest was a very sad regrettable unfortunate 
situation ben stewart said

the leftist sandinista government has 
freed the last 10 opposition leaders incarcerated since an 
antigovernment rally was forcefully broken up five months ago by 
riot police 
two other leaders of the july 10 demonstration in nadaime 27 
miles south of the capital managua were released last month because 
of poor health 
the day after the protest the government expelled us 
ambassador richard melton and seven other american diplomats in 
managua it also closed the opposition newspaper la prensa and the 
official roman catholic radio station 
washington responded by expelling nicaraguan ambassador carlos 
tunnermann and seven other nicaraguan diplomats in washington 
the nicaraguan government alleged melton was using the us 
embassy to direct a conspiracy against the government and that 
the media were orchestrating the ambassadors plan 
the sandinista government and the usbacked rebels known as 
the contras agreed march 21 to suspend offensive operations but 
talks aimed at a permanent end to the 7year war are at an impasse 
one leader released wednesday carlos huembes said as he left 
government custody the only alternative in nicaragua is the civic 
fight he said imprisonment had not intimidated him 
a few family members and foreign correspondents were on hand when 
the prisoners were released progovernment reporters did not attend 
suspended jail sentences for huembes and roger guevara of the 
nicaraguan democratic coordinate agustin jarquin of the social 
christian party and miriam arguello of the nicaraguan conservative 
party were based on charges that included causing public harm 
inciting a disturbance and illegal assembly 
arguello and jarquin were released nov 15 
the other demonstrators released wednesday were given 18month 
sentences 
the judge issued the order of conditional freedom because they 
the opposition leaders dont have previous criminal records they 
have good conduct records and their reentry into society is not a 
threat 
however during the duration of their sentences they will not be 
allowed to leave the country and political activities in nicaragua 
will be limited 
defense attorneys appealed the sentence saying it was unclear 
and paid fines for their clients release 
guevara for example was forced to pay 406 for vehicle damage 
that occurred during the demonstration 
miriam arguello called the punishment political revenge and 
a judicial abberation

an arab teenager was 
fatally shot in the heart today in a clash with soldiers as 
palestinians marked with a general strike the first anniversary of 
their uprising against israeli rule 
meanwhile splits emerged among both palestinians and israelis 
over plo chairman yasser arafats statement recognizing the 
existence of israel 
yussef mohammed sbaith 17 died of a bullet wound in the heart 
after soldiers opened fire on stonethrowing youths in the west bank 
village of kafr rai according to officials at a hospital in nearby 
jenin 
the army said it was checking the reported fatality which would 
be the 320th palestinian death since the uprising began dec 8 
against israels 21year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
eleven israelis also have died 
palestinians responded to todays call for a twoday general 
strike by shutting down stores and other businesses throughout the 
occupied lands which are home to 15 million palestinians and were 
sized by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
the army imposed curfews on all eight palestinian refugee camps 
in the gaza strip confining more than 250000 people to their homes 
indefinitely 
residents of gaza citys shejayeh section said israeli troops 
also ordered a curfew there over loudspeakers and called on men 16 
to 35 to report to a neighborhood courtyard 
one resident said the move came after a firebomb was thrown at an 
israeli jeep one of dozens of israeli military vehicles seen on the 
otherwise deserted streets 
in the west bank cities of bethlehem and nablus troops ordered 
residents out of their houses to paint over fresh graffiti and 
forced teenagers to tear down outlawed palestinian flags 
many slogans mirrored differences over arafats statement and the 
recent declaration of independence in algeria by the plos 
parliamentinexile that implicitly recognized israel 
what do you want israel after recognition said one slogan 
in bethlehem signed by arafats mainstream plo faction fatah 
opposite views appeared in graffiti signed by the fundamentalist 
moslem group hamas or zeal and the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine a marxist plo faction 
no concessions not even an inch of palestine was scrawled 
on a wall in nablus 
yes to holy war against the enemy declared another painted 
in traditional islamic green on one bethlehem wall 
israelis also disagreed in their reaction to arafats latest 
statement issued in stockholm on wednesday that called for peace 
negotiations and accepted israels existence 
asked to clarify the statement arafat replied this was clear 
in resolutions adopted in the last session of our palestine national 
council where we said clearly there are two states in palestine the 
palestinian state and the jewish state israel is this now 
clear enough 
foreign minister shimon peres responded by laying down conditions 
for recognizing the plo 
he said the plo would have to drop conditions attached to 
accepting un resolution 242 stop terrorism including violent 
antiisraeli resistance in the uprising and accept israels right 
to live in peace 
the un resolution calls for israeli withdrawal from lands 
occupied in the 1967 middle east war and for the right of all states 
in the region to have secure borders 
peres however said he did not believe arafat met his conditions 
and referred to the plo leaders latest moves as an exercise in 
public relations 
prime minister yitzhak shamir rejected arafats statement 
totally i dont see and i dont think i ever will see any real 
change because they the plo were established in the name of 
destroying israel he said on israel television 
avi pazner a close adviser to shamir said arafat should disband 
the plo if he really recognizes israel because the organization was 
created to destroy the jewish state 
he should clear the way for moderate palestinians to emerge 
he said 
ran cohen a leader of the small leftwing citizens rights 
movement welcomed arafats statement saying i think rational 
politicians should bless the process and ask how we can advance it

secretary of state george p shultz met 
today with nato allies to try to persuade them to insist on further 
cutbacks in soviet troops in europe beyond the 50000 mikhail s 
gorbachev has offered to withdraw from east germany czechoslovakia 
and hungary 
in his farewell meeting with the 15 foreign ministers shultz 
hoped to keep the allies focused on the 2to1 manpower edge us 
officials say the warsaw pact still enjoys 
im not trying to suggest this decision should be sniffed at 
a senior aide to shultz said of the unilateral cutback offer 
gorbachev made wednesday in a un speech in new york 
but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity contrasted 
the soviet leaders decision to withdraw six tank divisions from the 
three east european countries with the 20 divisions stationed in 
east germany alone and the official said the 500000 troops 
gorbachev offered to demobilize are only a fraction of the 55 
millionman red army 
shultz called the proposal a welcome and significant step 
but gorbachevs appeal for certain steps soon by the west in 
return apparently will not be answered 
the reagan administration which has only 6 weeks left in 
office does not intend to bring home any of the 335000 us troops 
in western europe in response to the soviet leaders move us 
officials said 
despite the soviet manpower edge several american analysts have 
called for a partial us withdrawal one reason they suggest is 
to have the allies assume a larger share of the burden of defending 
western europe 
instead the united states and its allies are aiming at joint 
negotiations early next year with the warsaw pact on a mutual 
reduction in nonnuclear forces and tanks across the vast expanse of 
europe 
the reagan administration contends the sovietled alliance has a 
3to1 advantage in tanks over the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
today nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner opened the twoday 
meeting by calling the soviet decision to make unilateral troop cuts 
in eastern europe an encouraging development which we welcome 
but he said the steps announced reduce but clearly do 
not eliminate soviet superiority and do not establish a stable 
balance 
if carried out he said they would undoubtedly be an 
important step in the right direction and we will be looking forward 
to their implementation 
if this step means that the soviet union is coming to accept 
the reality that their conventional superiority constitutes the 
principal threat to stability and security in europe then we would 
find the announcement still more encouraging he said 
woerner said the allies were seeking binding and verifiable 
agreements which would eliminate the present conventional 
asymmetries 
us officials had said reporting on gorbachevs luncheon meeting 
wednesday in new york with president reagan and presidentelect bush 
was the lead item on shultzs nato agenda 
shultz in his final session with the western foreign ministers 
before retiring also scheduled a report on developments in eastern 
europe and steps taken by the soviet union on human rights 
in contrast to their cool reaction to gorbachevs proposal to 
restructure the soviet armed forces us officials were 
enthusiastic about the soviet leaders promise to institute legal 
reforms and take up every case in which the united states claims 
political prisoners are being detained 
disputing gorbachev shultz said there are still political 
prisoners in the soviet union but he said there have been a 
great many released 
these and other steps taken by the soviets are close to meeting 
all us demands before wrapping up a review in vienna of the 1975 
helsinki agreement 
in that 35nation accord the soviets pledged improvements in 
human rights in exchange for implicit western acceptance of their 
dominant position in eastern europe 
once the vienna review is concluded nato and the warsaw pact 
hope to open troop reduction talks us officials said it was still 
possible to begin the negotiations before the jan 20 windup of the 
reagan administration

a state supreme court decision allowing much 
of the proposition 103 insurance initiative to take effect but still 
blocking a 20 percent cut in auto insurance rates pending legal 
challenges was hailed by californias attorney general 
the courts action wednesday was the first step toward full 
implementation of proposition 103 said attorney general john van 
de kamp who is defending the measure 
the portions of the consumersponsored measure that the court 
allowed to take effect will force companies to base insurance rates 
primarily on a drivers record and experience and repeal an 
exemption from state antitrust laws for insurance companies among 
other things 
the court continued a stay on enforcing the rate rollback the 
most controversial plank of the initiative and agreed to hear 
insurers claims that the measure would confiscate their property by 
forcing them to operate at a loss 
harvey rosenfield chairman of voter revolt and author of the 
measure said he was disappointed the court did not allow the 
rollback but said he was excited some provisions would take effect 
one insurance industry official expressed disappointment that the 
court modified its stay on the entire initiative but said it was a 
positive sign that the court had blocked the rollback 
at first blush were pleased that the court will hear our 
arguments but we feel the briefing schedule is more relaxed than 
wed like said john kozero a spokesman for firemans fund 
insurance cos no date has been set for a hearing and we hoped 
for a speedy resolution to the case 
the court scheduled written arguments through jan 23 an 
indication that the case is likely to be heard in february a 
decision would be required within the following three months 
the court voted 61 to take the case dissenting justice stanley 
mosk indicated he thought the lawsuits should be dismissed as 
premature a position also taken by sponsors of the initiative 
including consumer advocate ralph nader 
the announcement did not state reasons for the partial lifting of 
the stay or give any other indication of the justices views of the 
lawsuits filed by insurance companies 
the stay was imposed two days after the nov 8 election in which 
proposition 103 was the only one of five insurancerelated 
initiatives to pass 
in wednesdays announcement the court left its stay in place for 
only two of the measures provisions 
one would roll back vehicle and property insurance rates 20 
percent below november 1987 levels and freeze them until november 
1989 unless an insurer could show a substantial threat of 
insolvency the other would take the first steps toward 
establishment of a nonprofit corporation to advocate the insterests 
of insurance consumers 
provisions that will take effect include a ban on cancellation or 
nonrenewal of auto policies except for failure to pay fraud or an 
increase in the risk 
the courts order appeared to support the position of van de kamp 
and private sponsors that a stay of all portions of the measure was 
excessive because most do not threaten the companies with any 
immediate measurable financial harm 
the insurers lawsuits did not attack all provisions of 
proposition 103 but argued that the entire initiative should be 
thrown out if the rate rollback and freeze are declared 
unconstitutional

secretary of state george shultz rejected a 
proposal from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to stop arming 
afghans and said anticommunist guerrillas were justified in trying 
to seize territory before the red army completes its withdrawal 
the fighting would continue said shultz because the people of 
afghanistan broadly speaking do not accept the fact that the 
puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that country 
gorbachev in a wideranging speech wednesday to the united 
nations general assembly called for a new years ceasefire in 
afghanistan challenged washington to stop arming the guerrillas 
and urged the warring parties to quit battling over terroritory 
the bell of every regional conflict tolls for all of us 
gorbachev said calling for superpower cooperation to end fighting 
in afghanistan angola and cambodia 
the red army invaded afghanistan in december 1979 last spring 
gorbachev agreed to withdraw the estimated 110000 soviet troops 
there by feb 15 he suspended the withdrawal last month on grounds 
the guerrillas were firing on departing soviet troops 
the soviets also introduced advanced jet fighters and scud 
ballistic missiles and began to use them against the guerrillas 
according to reagan administration officials 
gorbachev offered to end the dispute and remove outside forces 
from the afghan conflict 
i dont want to use this rostrum for recriminations against 
anyone he said 
shultz however brushed aside the two main points of gorbachevs 
afghan proposal that the superpowers stop arming the warring 
parties and that the combatants not attempt to gain any more 
territory 
we proposed to the soviet union quite some time ago a mutual 
cessation of supplies and they rejected that shultz told a news 
conference after gorbachev president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush left governors island following a lunch meeting 
besides said shultz the anticommunist guerrillas known as 
mujahedeen dont need a great deal of war supplies because they 
are capturing a lot from the sovietbacked afghan army 
it was unrealistic to expect the rebels not to seize territory as 
the soviets pull out because of anger stemming from the war he said 
prior to the soviet occupation in december 1979 said shultz 
afghanistan had a population of 155 million of whom 1 million have 
since been killed or wounded more than 3 million driven into 
pakistan 2 million into iran and 2 million displaced within the 
country

nato foreign ministers today called for 
substantial reductions in conventional forces in europe as part of 
their negotiating position at upcoming arms talks 
the nato position intended to cover western and soviet bloc 
forces was released one day after soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev said he would unilaterally cut the soviet armed forces by 
500000 troops including 50000 in the east bloc 
secretary of state george p shultz also met with nato members 
today to try to persuade them to insist on further cutbacks in 
soviet troops 
in a statement today the nato ministers said they will propose 
an overall limit on the total number of arms in europe 
this limit should be substantially lower than existing levels 
in the case of tanks close to half it said this would mean an 
overall limit of about 40000 tanks 
in the statement the allies also said no country should be 
allowed to have more than a fixed proportion such as 30 percent of 
total arms in europe such a formula it said would set a cap of no 
more than about 12000 tanks for any one country 
it also said nato negotiators would propose limits on forces 
stationed in other countries territory 
the statement said the allies position would apply to all of 
europe 
in order to avoid undue concentration of these weapon 
categories in certain areas of europe we shall propose appropriate 
sublimits it said 
the allies position will be offered at the conventional 
stability talks scheduled to get under way early next year in 
vienna austria 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany said the 
allies hoped to end preliminary discussions next month for the 
negotiations 
genscher told reporters a new chapter could be opened in the 
history of disarmament because of gorbachevs move made in a un 
speech wednesday but the ministers were preparing todays proposals 
before the gorbachev speech 
the ministers statement said the troop reductions are a 
positive contribution in correcting what the 16nation alliance 
contends is an enormous superiority of soviet bloc forces in europe 
a recent nato report said the warsaw pact maintained 31 million 
ground forces or personnel compared with 22 million for the nato 
countries 
they indicate the seriousness with which the conventional 
imbalances which we have long highlighted as a key problem of 
european security are now also addressed by the soviet government 
the ministers said 
in addition to reduction in arms the ministers said they will 
ask the warsaw pact countries to go along with stabilizing 
measures that will cover deployment movement and levels of 
readiness of conventional armed forces 
they also said they will demand a rigorous and reliable regime 
for monitoring and verification 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner opened the foreign 
ministers meeting by saying the unilateral troop cut in eastern 
europe was an encouraging development but will not eliminate 
soviet superiority

operation clean sweep the district of 
columbias drug enforcement program has not helped curb drug use in 
the nations capital but has created huge problems in the courts and 
prisons according to police chief maurice t turner jr 
i dont see it having any impact on the demand for drugs 
turner said wednesday arrests are not the answer 
we must reduce the demand side for the drug business he said 
in a washington post interview 
the program an expensive centerpiece of mayor marion barrys 
crackdown on drugs has produced more than 43000 arrests since 
august 1986 
previous attempts to eliminate the program were strongly 
criticized and blocked by the barry administration 
the city has recorded 336 homicides so far in 1988 most of them 
drugrelated the previous high for a year was 287 in 1969 
turner said the police department has increased its ability to 
arrest drug dealers but at the same time he said the number of 
drug users also has grown all we have is more arrests that 
have crowded court calendars in dc superior court and pushed 
prisons above their capacities he said 
operation clean sweep usually is staffed by officers working 
overtime the overtime bill in the operations first 18 months was 
6 million

might move the remains of his parents

mikhail s gorbachevs image flickered on the 
blackandwhite television screen a translators voice muffling the 
soviet presidents strenuous defense of new soviet laws on jewish 
emigration 
hes just repeating the same things weve heard already 
muttered manashir ifraimov one of thousands of soviet immigrants 
settled in the brighton beach section of brooklyn 
like other emigres in this vibrant community dubbed little 
odessa he paid casual but constant attention to the events across 
the east river on wednesday as gorbachev spoke to the united 
nations and toured manhattan during a visit shortened by an 
earthquake in the southern soviet union 
weve heard these words now he has to make them real 
ifraimov said 
ifraimov an economistturnedbutcher who emigrated two months 
ago from soviet azerbaijan turned from the tv to finish slicing a 
customers ham 
people are accustomed to a lot of talking but people dont 
always believe it ifraimov said they are used to living with 
promises they just want their kids to have a better life 
new yorks soviet immigrants differed in their degree of optimism 
about the visiting leaders reforms but many lauded glasnost 
gorbachevs policy of openness for enabling them and their 
families to leave or travel from the soviet union more freely than 
ever imagined 
i would not leave if i was there now said rimma melik owner 
of the popular kavkas restaurant who emigrated here in 1978 and has 
visited her family in the soviet union twice in recent years 
gorbachevs glasnost and perestroika his program of economic and 
social restructuring have played well even among stalwart critics 
who insist the reforms are little more than a publicity stunt 
people are not getting better housing and roads are falling 
apart said sophia perett executive director of the center for 
russian immigrants peoples main concern is to have food on the 
table and to get by every month for them nothing has changed 
still there has been a very real increase in tourist and exit 
visas she said the last large wave of emigration ended in 1979 
with detente 
last year some 1500 immigrants received tourist visas through 
the peoples travel club said leon kogan manager of the agencys 
brighton beach branch other travel agents reported similar 
increases a sign of the times under gorbachevs glasnost 
we expect the number to be higher this year he said 
groups of rabbis artists writers students and performers are 
streaming in and out of the soviet union singing the praises of 
gorbachevism as one new emigre book labels it 
mrs melik agreed that living conditions in the soviet union have 
not changed but she said gorbachev has reignited hope for the 
future a feeling she said means the difference between staying or 
leaving 
she said soviet scientists and professionals the kind gorbachev 
needs to reshape his country will decide to stay when conditions 
improve 
most important is that people love their motherland people who 
had to wait 10 to 20 years are now more free to show their work and 
they will make this country if they will be allowed it will be a 
great county she said 
emigrants give gorbachev credit more for what could happen than 
what has happened realizing much also depends on relations with the 
united states 
i support any contact even negative contact said ifraimov 
whose brother arrived in new york last week after waiting just two 
months for an exit visa 
when asked what he would say if gorbachev was standing right in 
front of his butcher counter ifraimov didnt hesitate a moment 
id say youre on the right course

the governor has rejected a request to 
reduce the prison sentence of a killer who left death row to become 
a model inmate and a nationally recognized prison journalist 
wilbert rideau who is serving a life sentence was originally 
sentenced to death for a 1961 bank robbery in which he kidnapped 
three employees shot and wounded two of them and killed the third 
by slitting her throat 
although rideau 47 has been praised by prison officials for his 
behavior behind bars his previous bids for a reduced sentence have 
been rejected because of strong opposition from calcasieu parish law 
enforcement officials and the victims 
gov buddy roemer cited the same reasons in issuing his decision 
wednesday 
given the horrible nature of this crime the fact that both 
surviving victims oppose clemency and the fact that calcasieu law 
enforcement officials oppose clemency i deny rideaus plea for a 
reduced sentence roemer said 
a reduced sentence would have made rideau eligible for parole 
rideau was arrested shortly after the robbery and murder and 
confessed in front of television cameras he spent 10 years on death 
row until the us supreme court struck down the states capital 
punishment law in 1972 
with his sentence commuted to life in prison he became the first 
black to gain a position on the prison magazine the angolite and 
is now editor 
rideau has said his journalism is proof of his rehabilitation 
he is one of the most visible inmates at the lousisiana state 
pentitentiary at angola frequently appearing on national television 
shows he and other editors have been singled out for national 
recognition by organizations ranging from private foundations to the 
american bar association

a jury ordered the death penalty for a man 
convicted of stabbing two women to death and wounding a married 
couple at an archaeological site 
in announcing the death penalty wednesday jury foreman david j 
roscoe said the panel believed arthur faulkner had a degree of 
mental illness but that was outweighed by the savagery of the 
crimes for which the jury had convicted faulkner on tuesday 
faulkner 32 was found guilty of murder attempted murder 
aggravated assault rape and other offenses in the april 1 stabbing 
deaths of the women and the wounding of a husband and wife 
when the death sentence was announced faulkner shrugged 
delores dorner mother of one of the victims said i prayed 
very hard for this day it will never bring her back but at least 
shell rest in peace now and ill have peace of mind 
faulkners courtappointed attorney robert a selig portrayed 
his client during the sentencing hearing as suffering from paranoia 
and schizophrenia disorders he said could have prompted faulkner to 
commit the murders 
gerald cooke a forensic psychologist testified that faulkner 
hears voices and had been psychotic for many years 
but dr timothy michaels a prosecution witness said faulkner 
does not meet the criteria for a paranoid schizophrenic and that he 
did not suffer from organic brain damage another defense assertion 
seligs plans to present an insanity defense for faulkner during 
the trial fell through when montgomery county common pleas judge 
samuel salus ruled the two psychiatric experts who had evaluated 
faulkner could not testify because they had not found him legally 
insane selig called no witnesses during the trial 
faulkner was convicted in the stabbing deaths of clarice dorner 
30 of elk grove village ill and annalise killoran 22 of lynn 
mass faulkner also was charged with attacking glenn sheehan 39 
who operated sjs industries the archaeological firm where 
faulkner and the victims worked and sheehans 31yearold pregnant 
wife anne jensen 
after the sentencing hearing district attorney michael marino 
called faulkner a brutal sadistic murderer who hates women the 
mans an absolute menace and the death penalty is entirely 
appropriate for him 
selig said he would appeal he said he would feel better if 
this had been a fair trial

supporters of african national 
congress leader nelson mandela today demanded his unconditional 
release saying his transfer to a house on a prison farm simply gave 
him a more luxurious cell 
the government has been under intense domestic and international 
pressure to release the 70yearold mandela who has been in prison 
since 1962 
the government is playing games mr mandela is still a 
prisoner confined to the premises of a jail said anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu 
let the government release him and all other political 
prisoners unconditionally then they will see the enormous influence 
for good for peace and reconciliation that he will be he said 
mandela was transferred wednesday night from the private 
constantiaberg clinic near cape town where he had recovered from 
tuberculosis the government said he was taken to a suburbanstyle 
house with a swimming pool and garden at the victor verster prison 
farm in paarl a scenic winegrowing town northeast of cape town 
the government says he can have unlimited access to his wife 
children and grandchildren 
mr mandela is not confined to the house and has free use of a 
wide range of facilities the prisons service said today 
but officials indicated wednesday that mandelas release is not 
imminent and restraints on him will be eased in stages so the 
government can assess the political impact of his possible freedom 
that is not freeing him unconditionally said helen joseph 
83 the first south african ever placed under house arrest for 
antiapartheid activities its scandalous to play cat and mouse 
like this hes not free hes just in a luxurious prison a more 
comfortable jail 
mandelas wife winnie in a statement released by attorney 
ismail ayob rejected the offer of unlimited visits and said she 
would continue the monthly 40minute visits until all political 
prisoners are given the same privileges there was no indication 
that other visitors such as the media would be allowed access to 
mandela 
mandela was convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the white minority government 
the outlawed african national congress is the largest guerrilla 
organization fighting the government and apartheid 
mandela has rejected the governments repeated offers to release 
him if he renounces violence or lives in a tribal homeland he has 
said the government should renounce violence end apartheid and 
legalize the anc 
in august mandela was diagnosed with tuberculosis and 
transferred to a hospital from cape towns pollsmoor prison later 
he was moved to the constantiaberg clinic a private hospital near 
pollsmoor and officials announced last month mandela would not 
return to pollsmoor upon recuperation 
mandelas transfer is one of a series of moves by the government 
in the past two weeks aimed at easing international pressure on 
south africa 
the government has commuted the controversial death sentences of 
six blacks known as the sharpeville six and freed two other 
prominent longserving black prisoners anc leader harry gwala and 
zeph mothopeng president of the rival panafricanist congress 
but the government has given no indication that it is willing to 
negotiate with freed black leaders on their demands for oneperson 
onevote democracy 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

a congressman who raised money from unions for 
other gop house candidates the governments top personnel officer 
and a washington labor lawyer are the top candidates for secretary 
of labor in the bush administration officials said 
both rep thomas ridge of pennsylvania and office of personnel 
management director constance horner have been conducting lowkey 
campaigns to get the job 
william j kilberg whose wife barbara is a member of 
presidentelect george bushs transition staff has told associates 
he is absolutely not interested because it would mean giving up 
a lucrative law practice but his name is still in the pot a 
transition official said wednesday 
all three of them have been mentioned frequently all three are 
still alive the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
ridges and horners names were mentioned to the aflcio earlier 
this week by bushs transition team according to one business 
lobbyist who said horner apparently was labeled as unacceptable to 
the labor leaders 
the labor federation endorsed democrat michael dukakis in the 
presidential election rex hardesty an aflcio spokesman said it 
would have no comment on any discussions concerning the republican 
presidentelects personnel actions until after they are announced 
also mentioned as a longshot candidate is frank p doyle senior 
vice president for general electric co in charge of the companys 
labor government and media relations 
doyle acknowledged in an interview that he has been approached 
about the job and is interested but said his political party 
affiliation is a major hurdle 
hes a democrat not just a registered democrat but a person who 
has raised political money for democratic candidates a sure 
disqualifier according to one senior republican official 
although they have been adversaries across the bargaining table 
for three decades labor leaders familiar with doyle view him as one 
of their more enlightened opponents and would have no problem 
with his nomination 
however several business leaders do many of them view doyle as 
too progressive citing ges willingness to accept congressional 
legislation mandating 60day advance notices of plant closings and 
layoffs and its support for a bill that would have made employers 
warn workers about potential health hazards on the job 
ridge 43 represents a heavily bluecollar district around erie 
pa and helped raise money from several unions including the 
building trades and the united food and commercial workers for 
other gop house candidates as an active chairman of the 
congressional republican labor council 
hes young and a total break from the past said one union 
official if george bush wants a bridge to labor ridge could 
build it hes also someone who knows capitol hill at a time when 
there are going to be a lot of labor initiatives legislatively 
horner who had worked in bushs 1980 campaign for president 
sought the labor post a year ago when president reagan gave it to 
ann mclaughlin her point position for the administration on drug 
testing of federal workers and opposing comparable worth efforts to 
raise womens pay engendered heavy opposition then from public 
employee unions 
however the leadership of the largest federal workers union 
the american federation of government employees representing some 
700000 employees has changed hands since then 
its new president john sturdivant a black whose white opponent 
was endorsed by jesse jackson says he has a good working 
relationship with horner and would not oppose her other union 
sources however say opposition to her remains intense among other 
highranking labor leaders 
kilberg 42 was the labor departments solicitor from 1973 to 
1977 and also was chief counsel for the federal mediation and 
conciliation service during the nixon administration 
he is now a partner in a washington law firm representing 
employers in dealings with government agencies and unions and 
congress and also is editorinchief of the employee relations law 
journal 
kilberg attended cornell university on a local scholarship from 
the international brotherhood of electrical workers and is 
considered by both labor and business leaders to have been a 
knowledgeable honest broker in the government posts he held 
kilberg is said to be reluctant to give up his practice he also 
is involved in complicated pension cases that he is reluctant to 
leave said one person close to him 
however kilberg and his wife are family friends of the bushes 
and both the presidentelect and his wife barbara showed up at a 
fundraising picnic for mrs kilberg when she ran for a seat in the 
virginia legislature

a federal commission will vote next week on 
whether to recommend a pay raise for the federal governments top 
officials including members of congress and judges but only if the 
officials are banned from accepting pay for speeches and other 
outside work 
the commissions recommendations will be sent to president reagan 
on dec 15 he can either raise or lower the figures reagans 
decision will take effect next month unless congress blocks the 
action 
the panel known as the commission on executive legislative and 
judicial salaries meets after every presidential election to 
recommend salary level of top officials 
a draft report being considered by the panel recommends a pay 
increase although it does not contain any figures but it says the 
raise should be granted only in conjunction with a ban on outside 
income known as honoaria 
members of congress who are now paid 89500 can receive 
honoraria for speeches and articles the panel endorsed an honoraria 
ban for the top 2498 federal officials including cabinet members 
and judges 
cabinet members are now paid 99500 while most judges receive 
89500 during two days of hearings last month the commission 
heard testimony that a number of federal judges have resigned and 
returned to practicing law because lawyers receive much greater pay 
two years ago another commission recommended that congressional 
pay be raised to 135000 a year cabinet members be paid 160000 
and most judges be paid 130000 but reagan reduced the 
recommendations to the current pay levels 
the draft report also endorsed a pay raise for the president who 
has received 200000 annually since 1969 but it sets no figure 
lloyd cutler chairman of the panel and other members have 
publicly endorsed the need for higher pay saying that inflation has 
far outstripped pay rates making it hard for the government to 
attract top talent 
on the average federal salaries will now only buy 65 percent of 
what they would in 1969 the draft report notes but salaries earned 
by average nonfederal workers will buy about 15 percent more than 
1969 
in other words the report noted highlevel government 
officials have seen the purchasing power of their salaries eroded by 
more than onethird while other wage earners have on average at 
least maintained their purchasing power 
no statistic could more clearly demonstrate how highlevel 
public service today imposes a financial penalty on those in public 
service and their families notwithstanding the privilege and 
satisfaction of answering the nations call it said

gov michael s dukakis using measures he had 
hoped to apply to the federal budget unveiled a package of spending 
cuts layoffs and increased tax enforcement to close a 
massachusetts budget deficit of at least 636 million 
but less than a month after losing the presidential election to 
vice president george bush and his read my lips pledge not to 
raise taxes dukakis gave his strongest hint yet that he might 
consider new levies if the package doesnt balance his 116 billion 
budget 
the democratic governor said he would wait until the end of this 
month to monitor spending and tax collections before deciding 
im not going to recommend increased taxes unless i think we 
must have them i want to make sure we do everything we can to meet 
these goals before we go down that road he said 
dukakis spoke to reporters at a statehouse news conference jammed 
with anxious legislators and government staffers to give his first 
detailed assessment of the states fiscal predicament since the nov 
8 election 
after months of warnings from legislators about the states 
budget dukakis estimated the budget deficit would be at least 636 
million in the fiscal year that ends june 30 he reached the 
forecast after trimming his revenue projections by 308 million as 
recommended by the revenue advisory board 
we have serious problems facing us dukakis said but he 
added that the state must make investments in the future if they 
are not going to be made in washington they have to be made to 
some extent right here in massachusetts 
among his proposals were eliminating 300 unspecified management 
positions reducing the states consultant budget by 15 million and 
adding millions of dollars in new fees 
in a message apparently intended for his liberal supporters 
dukakis insisted he would not retreat from the agenda he has 
followed since returning to office in 1983 
i want to make it very clear that were going to fight for the 
goals and values that have guided us for the past six years he 
said citing education employment environmental protection 
housing and health care 
to close the budget gap he said the state would draw 121 
million from its rainy day fund raise 90 million through 
steppedup tax collection efforts delay 84 million in college 
scholarship funds and save 100 million by cutting medicaid waste 
and squeezing executive agencies 
the plan also includes at least 165 million in forced spending 
cuts by the state bureaucracy 
dukakis defended his plan to tap the rainy day fund which 
bondrating agencies consistently cite as a reason for the states 
high credit rating the governor said the stabilization fund was 
created for situations similar to what the state is facing 
asked whether his presidential campaign had contributed to the 
problem or delayed his response to it dukakis noted that he cut or 
withheld 200 million before signing the budget in july and said tax 
collections were on target in the first four months of the fiscal 
year

the incoming bush administration needs to give 
cities more help in dealing with aids drug abuse homelessness and 
job training new york mayor edward i koch has told the nations 
urban leaders 
in a speech to 2000 delegates at the close of the annual 
national league of cities conference koch said the federal 
government must no longer slough off its responsibilities onto 
states and cities 
also wednesday presidentelect george bush sent a letter to the 
conference promising to act on its concerns i want to assure you 
that your needs are my needs bush said 
koch said the letter was an encouraging sign and he promised his 
cooperation 
our job is to make him a really great president until his 
fourth year said koch a democrat 
the mayor said he had asked for a meeting with bush after the 
inauguration and had invited the presidentelect and his wife 
barbara to visit gracie mansion the mayors official residence to 
discuss urban problems 
we need help and we need it desperately said koch 
he argued that cities by themselves cannot fight the national 
drug problem cure acquired immune deficiency syndrome or house the 
homeless and he said urban issues were discussed only superficially 
during the presidential campaign so urban leaders can only guess at 
bushs intentions 
i really cant read his lips i am not a lipreader he said 
drawing laughter and cheers from the audience of mayors and other 
city officials in reference to bushs read my lips pledge not to 
raise taxes 
new york city now has 55000 prisoners compared to 40000 in all 
federal prisons and spends close to half its 1 billion annual 
police budget on drug enforcement koch said he said 80 percent of 
those arrested for violent crimes in new york city are found to have 
drugs in their systems 
we cannot deal with it koch said i have doubled the 
number of jails and its not enough 
and while new york has earmarked 51 billion to build housing 
the federal government provides only a pittance to support 
elderly housing he said 
george read my lips homeless koch quipped

george bushs inauguration jan 20 will cost 
more than 20 million and feature a halfdozen free events in 
addition to balls and dinners at up to 1500 a ticket the 
presidential inaugural committee said today 
this inauguration is different because were going to try to 
have more free events than at any inauguration before said 
committee cochairman bobby holt 
the free events range from a childrens festival commemorating 
200 years of inaugurations to a white house welcome for the public 
on bushs first morning in residence there the most expensive event 
is the inaugural dinner jan 18 at union station at 1500 per 
person a ticket to one of eight official balls goes for 175 but 
30 will get you into a young american ball 
holt said the budget for official inaugural events sponsored by 
the presidential committee will be 20 million to 25 million the 
money is being raised as interestfree loans that will be repaid 
with proceeds from ticket sales and other inaugural marketing 
holt said loans of 100000 or more are being accepted but 
smaller inkind contributions are also welcome walter ganzi jr 
the committees finance chairman said about half the money needed 
has been raised 
both the presidential committee and a bipartisan congressional 
committee in charge of the oathtaking ceremony are leaning heavily 
on the bicentennial theme 
some of the trappings of bushs inauguration ceremony would look 
familiar to george washington 13star flags for example and red 
bunting and the first great seal which was the newborn nations 
emblem from 1782 to 1841 
but metal detectors and 140000plus spectators surely would have 
startled the first president 
bushs bicentennial inauguration ceremony combines the old and 
the new with the most dramatic change the introduction of security 
precautions for the first time 
the west front of the capitol the site of the jan 20 
oathtaking will be accessible only through four gates equipped 
with metal detectors all guests will be screened before the 
ceremony a prospect that strikes terror in the heart of a key 
organizer 
my worst nightmare is that 50000 people will show up at 1120 
am for a ceremony that starts at 1130 said michael ruehling 
executive director of the joint congressional committee on inaugural 
ceremonies 
hoping to attract early arrivals the congressional committee 
will open the gates at 9 am and has scheduled a musical interlude 
by the us marine band at 1030 am the only thing were not 
providing is popcorn ruehling said i dont know what else we 
can do but it does scare me 
the constitution stipulates that the oath of office must be taken 
at noon so latecomers will be out of luck 
bush will be sworn in against a backdrop of five flags two from 
1789 with stars representing the 13 original states two from 1889 
with 38 stars and one flag with the current 50 stars 
hell step onto the platform through an archway festooned with 
red bunting similar to the bunting draped over the door of federal 
hall in new york when washington was sworn in for his first term in 
1789 the plan is for bush to take the oath on the same 1767 bible 
that washington used and all inaugural materials will bear the 
first great seal 
as has become custom bushs inauguration ceremony will be more 
elaborate than the first one 200 years ago at federal hall 
washington simply bowed to his audience repeated the 35word oath 
of office and added i swear so help me god 
this year music will be provided by the us marine and army 
bands and the harlan ky boys choir the rev billy graham will 
deliver the invocation and the benediction chief justice william 
rehnquist will administer the oath of office to bush while justice 
sandra day oconnor will swear in the vice president the 
congressional committee said 
inaugural planners are working to make it a little extra 
special in light of the bicentennial ruehling said 
the expanded program is designed as a souvenir with four pages 
of inaugural history in addition to the schedule of events in 
addition for the first time the program will name the president 
and vice president instead of referring to them by their offices as 
has always been the case previously 
the bush inauguration marks only the second time the ceremony has 
been held on the capitols west front from his podium bush will 
have a panoramic view of the grassy mall the soaring washington 
monument and many grand buildings of the city 
president reagan was sworn in there in 1981 but most 
inaugurations have taken place on the east front which overlooks 
the asphalt capitol parking area as well as the landscaped capitol 
grounds 
the inauguration platform and stands under construction on the 
west front are costing 323000 to build taxpayers are paying for 
the inaugural preparations and also for an hourlong lunch for 200 
in the capitols statuary hall

west european leaders welcomed mikhail s 
gorbachevs pledge to unilaterally cut soviet conventional forces 
but some warned that even after such a move the soviets will remain 
militarily superior to nato 
chinas leaders also welcomed the soviet presidents pledge in a 
speech at the united nations in new york on wednesday to demobilize 
500000 troops 
gorbachev said that as part of the initiative to reduce the 
soviet army to about 5 million soldiers a major portion of soviet 
troops temporarily stationed in mongolia will return home 
this is a positive development foreign ministry spokesman li 
zhaoxing said in beijing 
china long has demanded the kremlin reduce its troop presence 
along their common border as a condition for normalizing relations 
after nearly 30 years of estrangement the soviet union stations 
nearly 50000 troops in mongolia and pulled out about 12000 
soldiers in 1987 
most east european news media reported without comment on 
gorbachevs promise including a pledge to remove 5000 tanks and 
50000 troops from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary 
but the czechoslovak communist daily rude pravo said the aim is 
to give conventional disarmament a vital shot in the arm 
the point is literally to force western partners to stop giving 
speeches about the need for disarmament about their concern 
about the buildup of troops and military technology in europe and 
to start acting said foreign editor milan jelinek 
state tv in communist poland carried without comment footage of 
gorbachev making the announcement 
in warsaw jacek czaputowicz cofounder of polands pacifist 
group peace and freedom said it could be the first step to 
withdrawing soviet troops from poland 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain called it a very 
positive step forward and just exactly what we wanted 
asked if she thought the west should respond with its own 
proposals mrs thatcher said according to the briefing i had 
it reduces their superiority in conventional weapons from about 
3to1 to 2to1 so it is a very very fundamental change that he 
is making 
in brussels nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said the move 
seems to be a step in the right direction but warned big 
imbalances would remain 
west german defense minister rupert scholz said gorbachev must 
follow up with actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and 
reduction of forces 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement of france told reporters 
that gorbachevs art is to make announcements before he is forced 
to 
it is a firm western position that leads the soviets to make 
gestures that are indispensible for a return to detente in europe 
said chevenement 
italian foreign minister giulio andreotti called the proposals 
very significant and said gorbachev was sending a clear 
signal to the new us administration that he seeks continuity in 
arms reductions 
but mikhail agursky of hebrew university in jerusalem said 
these changes are not aimed at the united states but at europe 
strategically europe is now more important to the russians 
spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez welcomed 
gorbachevs proposals but said the soviets know that in 
conventional arms negotiations they have to reduce much more than 
western allies 
finlands president mauno koivisto said wednesday was a day of 
joy 
in neutral sweden foreign minister sten andersson said it 
resembles all gorbachevs surprise initiatives it is bold it is 
interesting and it is promising and it should be taken seriously 
outside europe japanese prime minister noboru takeshita said it 
was a good thing 
argentine foreign minister dante caputo said gorbachevs speech 
reflected a sort of new philosophical approach in soviet foreign 
policy and i think this is very very important 
in washington key legislators said they were pleased by the 
promised cut but want action not words

the livein companion of an accused child killer 
testified today that she and the defendant knew before their 
adopted daughter lisa was born that the baby would probably be 
given to them 
joel steinberg 47 is charged with fatally beating the illegally 
adopted child she was removed unconscious from his apartment on 
nov 2 1987 and died of a brain injury three days later 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs battered former companion and the 
prosecutions chief witness testified at the trial today that the 
babys biological mother was a friend of hers and steinbergs 
we were kept aware of her health and progress ms nussbaum 
said 
michele launders 27 the mother has watched the trial daily 
from a frontrow seat steinberg a lawyer who has since been 
disbarred had told ms launders that her child would be placed with 
a middleclass catholic family in manhattan and she paid steinberg 
500 for filing fees 
ms nussbaum 46 testified she and steinberg began talking about 
adopting a child in 1980 
i had been trying to conceive and was unable to she said 
steinberg as a lawyer had done a number of adoptions and we 
talked about doing one for ourselves 
lisa was born may 14 1981 ms launders has said that she was in 
the babys presence only for seconds before the infant was taken 
away 
testimony resumed after a oneday break wednesday 
nussbaum testified tuesday that she and steinberg were told by a 
physician friend in october 1983 that his wife had abused lisa then 
2 ms nussbaum said lisas genital area was bruised when the girl 
returned from a stay with the physician and his wife 
the sex abuse allegation was first discovered in papers found by 
police when they searched steinbergs apartment after lisas death 
in the papers dr michael green accuses his wife shayna of 
sexually molesting the girl in the summer of 1983 when the child 
visited the greens long island home 
but assistant district attorney peter casolaro said out of the 
jurys hearing that the statement was created by mr green at 
steinbergs urging for the purpose of slandering his greens 
wife in a divorce 
a source said the prosecution investigated and found no basis to 
conclude mrs green had molested lisa the source said the greens 
told investigators that if hedda saw anything on the girl it was 
diaper rash 
green told police steinberg coerced him into accusing his 
wife of abusing lisa and that he was severely beaten by steinberg 
and ms nussbaum 
the source said green admitted in interviews with prosecutors 
that his statement was a ploy to use against his wife in their 
divorce 
the greens who ms nussbaum said joined her and steinberg in 
cocaine parties have since reconciled and live near harrisburg pa 
when asked by a reporter wednesday about ms nussbaums 
allegations green replied theyre unfounded he said a good 
percentage of her testimony was untrue 
ms nussbaum made the allegation of sexual abuse under 
crossexamination by steinbergs lawyer ira london

china said thursday it welcomed soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs decision to cut red army troops by nearly 10 
percent and pull back some troops from the chinese border in 
mongolia 
this is a positive development foreign ministry spokesman li 
zhaoxing told a news conference 
asked if it enhanced prospects for next years proposed 
chinesesoviet summit li said the soviet union indicated it now 
has the intention to clear away all the obstacles standing in the 
way of normalization of chinesesoviet relations we hope the soviet 
union will take further practical steps to eliminate all the 
obstacles once and for all as soon as possible 
gorbachev made the announcement wednesday in a speech to the 
united nations he said the soviet army estimated by western 
experts at 56 million soldiers would be cut by 500000 in the next 
two years and a major portion of soviet troops temporarily 
stationed in mongolia will return home 
troops also will be pulled out of eastern europe he said 
china long has demanded that the soviet union reduce its troop 
presence along their border as a condition for normalizing relations 
after nearly 30 years of estrangement 
the soviet union stations nearly 50000 troops in mongolia which 
has been a close ally since declaring independence from china and 
establishing a socialist government in 1921 the soviets pulled 
about 12000 soldiers out of mongolia in 1987 and china since has 
focused on other issues in its normalization talks with the soviets 
however li said foreign minister qian qichen told soviet 
officials on his visit to moscow last week that china hoped the 
soviets would pull all their troops from mongolia and reduce their 
border forces to a level commensurate with the normal standards of 
good neighborly relations 
li said the soviet side indicated that the process of 
withdrawal of troops from mongolia will be continued 
relations between china and the soviet union long at odds over 
ideological and strategic issues have warmed considerably in the 
past year both sides said during qians visit that the first 
chinesesoviet summit since 1959 could be held next year a specific 
date has not been set 
in addition to a soviet troop reduction along the border chinas 
longstanding conditions for normalizing relations are a soviet 
pullout from afghanistan and vietnams withdrawal from cambodia 
the soviets began withdrawing from afghanistan in may and have 
agreed to work for a settlement of the cambodia issue 
china maintains that vietnam could not continue its decadelong 
occupation of cambodia without soviet aid 
li did not respond directly when asked if a summit could be held 
while vietnamese troops remain in cambodia but said preparations 
for the meeting have already been started

a judge today sentenced three black 
leaders of the countrys largest antiapartheid group to prison 
terms of 10 to 12 years after a highly publicized threeyear treason 
trial 
i would rather err on the side of leniency judge kees van 
dijkhorst said as he sentenced patrick lekota 40 the publicity 
secretary for the united democratic front to 12 years for treason 
popo molefe 36 the fronts national secretary and moses 
chikane 40 transvaal province branch secretary each received 10 
years for treason 
a person convicted of treason can be sentenced to death in south 
africa 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu described the sentences as 
vicious the us embassy called the judgment regrettable because 
the defendants were men of good will working peacefully for a 
nonracial democratic south africa 
thomas manthata 48 a church field worker also was sentenced to 
six years in jail for treason 
supporters raised clenched fists in the courtroom and shouted 
viva then the audience and defendants sang god bless 
africa the anthem of the antiapartheid movement 
mohammed valli moosa the fronts acting national secretary said 
the sentences were extremely harsh when you take into account 
these are nonviolent people who were engaged in peaceful protest 
van dijkhorst ruled that the united democratic front was a 
revolutionary organization which collaborated with the outlawed 
african national congress to incite antigovernment violence in 1984 
tutu and the rev allan boesak were named as unindicted 
coconspirators with more than 900 other front supporters 
its a vicious sentence said tutu i myself will certainly 
be very very involved in ensuring that i leave no stone unturned in 
overturning that conviction and sentence 
boesak president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
said he had been involved in consumer boycotts just like the 
sentenced men 
if you allow this to happen that means that we will concede 
that everything we have been doing is criminal is illegal is 
wrong is treasonous boesak said 
human rights activist max coleman said the sentences were lighter 
than expected to fit a recent government policy of projecting a 
softer image but he said what would be legitimate protest in most 
countries is a crime here 
of seven other defendants convicted of terrorism six received 
suspended fiveyear prison terms and the other was sentenced to 
serve five years those with suspended sentences were banned for two 
years from talking to the press attending public meetings or 
participating in politics 
van dijkhorst said he was lenient because none have been found 
guilty of planning or executing direct violence 
defense lawyer george bizos had argued for suspended sentences 
noting most defendants had spent at least three years in prison 
the trial began in 1985 in delmas farm town and later shifted to 
pretoria eleven of the original 22 defendants were acquitted at 
various stages 
ambassadors from the united states britain france and west 
germany were among spectators packed into the courtroom 
several leading opponents of south africas system of racial 
segregation including novelist nadine gordimer testified for the 
defendants 
able to speak freely because restrictions on antigovernment 
statements do not apply in the courtroom the witnesses voiced 
support for the anc and refused to condemn its use of violence 
the sentences came the day after the government transferred anc 
leader nelson mandela to a comfortable home on a prison farm it was 
the first time since 1962 that he has been out of a cell except for 
hospital stays

liberal roman catholic archbishop raymond 
hunthausen said vatican officials have indicated he will regain full 
control of the seattle archdiocese 
hunthausen who returned tuesday from a week in rome said he was 
hoping for some kind of a statement within weeks that will 
officially end the vaticans direct assistance to the archdiocese 
but a conservative catholic group charged wednesday that 
violations of church practices are continuing and said it will not 
let up in its criticism 
i havent seen a great change here margaret hoffman 
director of the sons of st peter coalition said wednesday ive 
seen things happen currently that are not in line with church 
teaching i think we as laymen have a duty to report abuses for 
the health of the church 
hunthausens weeklong visit to rome was to fulfill the 
requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years 
the archbishop ran afoul of the vatican in 1983 over the granting 
of annulments and general absolution of sins intercommunion with 
protestants and opening of churches to meetings of homosexual 
catholics 
a vatican investigation resulted in the archbishop being stripped 
of much of his power although hunthausens full powers were 
restored in may 1987 on the recommendation of an apostolic 
commission appointed by rome the panel continued to assist in the 
operation of the seattle archdiocese 
most recently hunthausen has shared authority with coadjutor 
archbishop thomas j murphy who accompanied hunthausen to rome to 
present pope john paul ii and vatican officials an overview of 
changes made and planned in the ministry 
hunthausen said there would be no visible changes in the way he 
handles the archdioceses operations now that some changes and 
clarifications have been made or at least initiated 
an archdiocesan statement said vatican officials also were told 
hunthausens critics appear bent on undoing the fabric of unity 
that exists among sincere and conscientious believers within the 
body of christ in our judgment their criticism ought not to be 
given serious attention 
hunthausen said wednesday the small cadre of critics within 
the archdiocese are people with a different view of the church 
wed love to be able to find a way to minister to them he 
said

he sped through the city in his motorcade but the soviet leader got 
a more doleful dose of free speech from about 1000 demonstrators 
outside the united nations 
fiftysix people from the students struggle for soviet jewry were 
arrested after they crossed police barricades and sat in the street 
outside the un on wednesday to protest the treatment of jews in 
the soviet union they were taken away in vans charged with 
disorderly conduct and released 
other protesters included ukrainians armenians and supporters of 
dissidents in the baltic states where nationalism has been on the 
rise 
many speakers at the demonstration including city comptroller 
harrison goldin called on gorbachev to push for human rights as 
well as glasnost his policy of openness 
we hope that as gorbachev pursues glasnost he will be equally 
vigorous in implementing a fundamental human freedom the right to 
emigrate and freely practice ones religion said goldin for 
jews that is fundamental 
another speaker rabbi haskel lookstein said we appreciate 
the initial steps but theres much more to be done 
franklin smiles a rabbinical student was asked if he thought 
gorbachev who stepped directly from his limousine to the un 
building even heard the demonstrators message 
its more important that it reaches americans he said 
explaining that they can pressure us officials to pressure their 
soviet counterparts 
several hundred eastern european emigres demonstrated on the 
other side of the street a group of ukrainians many of them 
elderly waved ukrainian flags in favor of independence from the 
soviet union 
members of an estonian group waved their national flag and 
chanted one two three four open up the iron door estonia 
recently declared limited autonomy from the soviet union 
arunas degutis 30 editor of an opposition newspaper in 
lithuania was not particularly impressed with the turnout he said 
that 250000 people were at the last demonstration he attended in 
lithuania and that 10000 protesters can be mobilized there with 
two hours notice 
more than 100 armenianamericans protested gorbachevs handling 
of ethnic unrest in the neighboring republics of azerbaijan and 
armenia 
the extent to which glasnost will truly offer democracy has 
yet to be seen said an organizer dr ara caprielian talking 
about the past and getting something today are two different 
things 
groups of armenian and jewish protesters also gathered outside 
the soviet mission where gorbachev spent two nights they chanted 
sang and made speeches 
about 430 am today two people who tried to set up a banner 
near the mission were arrested when they ignored a police order to 
move said sgt ed burns a police spokesman they were given 
disorderly conduct tickets and released 
later six armenian clergymen hoping to see gorbachev were 
allowed through police barricades and into the mission the most 
prominent among them were identified by police as torkom manoogian 
archbishop of the eastern diocese of the armenian church in north 
america and archbishop vazken keshirshian primate of the armenian 
church in canada they left nearly an hour later saying they had 
not met with gorbachev

red cross workers fearful of food riots 
have held off distributing relief supplies to thousands of sudanese 
who lived for months on grass roots and leaves after fleeing civil 
war an official said thursday 
food flown to the area for the past five days is being stored to 
ensure adequate supply when workers begin handing it out said 
pierre pont the khartoum representative of the international 
committee of the red cross 
we couldnt start mass distribution until we had stockpiled 
enough food or else there would be riots said pont who flew 
with wednesdays hercules c130 flight to wau a governmentheld 
southern city surrounded by rebels 
pont said the only food distributed so far has gone to hospital 
patients children in an orphanage and other small vulnerable 
groups 
the rebels in the predominantly animist and christian south are 
fighting a 5yearold war for social reform and autonomy from the 
moslemdominated government in the north relief flights to the 
south began sunday after the rebels dropped their threat to shoot 
down the planes but recent rebel attacks on relief convoys have 
been reported 
beginning sunday the c130 carried 18 tons of food at a time 
from khartoum to wau 625 miles to the southwest and flights from 
kenya took food and medicine to rebelheld towns in the bush pont 
said 
another airlift organized by the united nations is using 
smaller planes to take food to aweil 45 miles northwest of wau 
wau is lacking in everything pont said in an interview it 
is a dramatic situation there but you dont see people dying in the 
streets any more 
before the current airlift he said the last relief shipment 
arrived six or seven months ago in wau whose population swelled to 
100000 from its normal 5000060000 because of people displaced 
over the summer 
they survived by eating roots leaves and grass said pont 
the old people and the children were the worst affected 
but he said all goes well with the airlift we are confident 
that eventually the displaced can be fed and slowly we can improve 
the nutrition status 
in wau as elsewhere most of the displaced people have returned 
to the countryside to harvest wild rice cole dodge khartoum 
representative of the un childrens relief organization unicef 
said the crop is good enough to produce stocks that will last until 
next years earlysummer rainy season 
the red cross has 10000 tons of relief supplies in sudan where 
relief workers estimate half a million of the 6 million southerners 
died this year from the war and the famine it induced un 
officials say conditions have deteriorated to such an extent that 
famine is sure to strike again with the rains in 1989 
the airlift is the first since sudans civil war began in early 
1983 that has its safety guaranteed by the government and the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army 
the rebels have shot down three civilian aircraft since 1986 
killing more than 70 people until now they had threatened to fire 
on any aircraft in the south that was not carrying supplies for 
rebelheld areas 
aweil normally home to 30000 people grew to 90000 over the 
summer when rains isolated it from the outside pont said it has 
received no relief help in more than a year and 8000 people are 
thought to have died there 
unlike wau a city with buildings aweil is a real african 
village with lots of african huts said pont who also flew there 
on wednesday its very pretty 
pont said aweils village market is functioning but the only 
food its merchants offer is roots and peanuts 
also thursday the un world food program announced that food 
aid worth 54 million will be sent to some 370000 nomadic 
shepherds in northeast sudan the romebased agency said the 
shepherds lost most of their animals during the 198385 drought and 
are now rebuilding their herds

will go ahead 
soviet officials said gorbachev cut short his new york visit and 
scrapped stops in cuba and britain because of an earthquake in 
soviet armenia that killed thousands of people gorbachev said there 
were extremely grave consequences devastation and great loss of 
life i urgently have to return to the soviet union

earthquake help gorbachev said i would like to thank them and 
thank the american people for those feelings and for their readiness 
to give assistance in this difficult hour 
reagan in his farewell telephone call expressed deep personal 
sorrow over the earthquake tragedy the president speaking from 
his secondfloor living quarters in the white house also told 
gorbachev their meeting on wednesday was very useful for both 
sides 
he expressed concern over the magnitude of the soviet loss if 
there is any way we can be of assistance either bilaterally or 
through the international community please let me know reagan 
said his comments were relayed to the press by white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
nancy reagan also spoke with raisa gorbachev expressing sorrow 
over the quake and saying she and the president hope to see the 
gorbachevs again either in california or the soviet union 
soviet officials said gorbachev was returning home to direct 
relief efforts after the quake in armenia that produced casualties 
numbering in the thousands that meant junking an elaborately 
planned day of sightseeing in new york as well as trips to cuba and 
england that had been on the schedule for later in the week 
british prime minister margaret thatcher standing outside 10 
downing street with the soviet ambassador to london endorsed 
gorbachevs decision to cut off his trip obviously his place is 
at home at this time mrs thatcher said 
at least one event planned for the soviet leader went on without 
him a soviet trade show opened with goods ranging from vodka to 
furs and to fruits on display viktor kamentsev a deputy soviet 
premier opened the show along with c william verity the us 
secretary of commerce 
gorbachev was making his hasty exit from new york while western 
leaders were trying to digest his announcement of a cut of 500000 
troops including withdrawal of 50000 from eastern europe 
reagan and bush both heartily embraced the announcement when it 
was made on wednesday 
secretary of state george p shultz met today with nato allies to 
try to persuade them to insist on further cutbacks in soviet troops 
in europe beyond those gorbachev has offered to withdraw from east 
germany czechoslovakia and hungary 
in his farewell meeting with the 15 foreign ministers shultz 
hoped to keep the allies focused on the 2to1 manpower edge us 
officials say the warsaw pact still enjoys 
gorbachevs early departure was an unexpected ending to the 
soviet leaders new york visit 
he melted diplomatic reserve at the united nations with a 
sweeping disarmament pledge met cordially for two hours with bush 
and reagan and even managed a quick motorcade tour of manhattan 
jumping from his limousine to greet startled new yorkers on the 
sidewalk 
the soviets said concern for his people rather than any 
political developments in his homeland caused gorbachev to cancel 
further sightseeing in new york today and subsequent stops in cuba 
and britain 
reagan bush and gorbachev all were in high spirits when they met 
for two hours on heavily guarded governors island in new york 
harbor when bush offered a welcoming handshake gorbachev seized it 
in a twohanded embrace 
after two hours of talks reagan summed up the mood read our 
smiles the outgoing president said 
gorbachev and his wife raisa then went on a 75minute motorcade 
tour of manhattan from wall street to times square with the soviet 
leader twice stopping to greet new yorkers on the streets as 
everyone in the city had anticipated his 45car motorcade left 
behind a snarl of traffic 
extending an olive branch to bush gorbachev said in his speech 
at the united nations that the new administration will find in us 
a partner who is ready without long pauses or backtracking to 
continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism openness and 
goodwill 
in a similar vein bush said he told gorbachev at a luncheon with 
reagan that he wanted to continue the progress thats been made 
but bush who will not take office until jan 20 said he would not 
rush to set up his own summit with gorbachev 
i enjoyed the meeting hope to see you soon bush said with a 
final handshake for gorbachev 
beset by economic problems at home gorbachev used his un 
address to announce a unilateral cutback in soviet troops 
artillery tanks and planes including a reduction of 50000 red 
army forces and 5000 tanks in eastern europe by 1991 overall he 
said the reductions would total 500000 troops or about 10 percent 
of the total in soviet territory and bordering nations 
gorbachev said money saved by scaling down military forces would 
be invested in the soviet civilian economy 
it is now quite clear that building up military power makes no 
country omnipotent gorbachev said whats more onesided 
reliance on military power ultimately weakens other components of 
national security 
gorbachev urged the united states and its allies to take 
certain steps in reply to the troop cutback but did not specify 
them 
reagan said i heartily approve of the soviet cutback but made 
no promise that the us would reciprocate in a speech after his 
return to washington reagan discussed gorbachevs move and said 
if it is carried out speedily and in full history will regard it 
as important significant 
reagan was expected to elaborate tonight at a nationally 
broadcast news conference from the white house

a conservative think tank weighed in thursday 
with 927 pages of recommendations for presidentelect bush on how to 
run the government including a freeze on government spending and 
dismissal of staff members who deviate from administration policies 
leaders of the heritage foundation said their third quadrennial 
mandate for leadership book contains more than 2000 
recommendations from 400 experts many veterans of the reaganbush 
administration 
heritage president edwin feulner jr told a news conference that 
based on the influence of the 1980 and 1984 books on ronald reagan 
we can confidently predict that the bush administration will 
pay close attention to these recommendations 
several top bush administration officials including vice 
presidentelect dan quayle have already been briefed on the 
recommendations and bush will get his own copy of the book friday 
feulner said 
the book recommends a hardernosed approach on holding down 
federal spending including subjecting all programs including social 
security to the grammrudman deficit ceiling law it urges bush to 
propose a freeze on spending and to base his budget blueprint on a 
freeze not on current services 
the president is required by law to submit a current services 
budget which sets forth what it would cost to maintain government 
services and programs in the next budget year taking inflation into 
account and before any proposals for cuts 
charles l heatherly a heritage vice president and coeditor of 
the book complained that the current services approach determines 
the whole way the debate is framed 
heatherly said bush should fire somebody anybody for not 
staying in line with official administration policies early in his 
presidency 
he said bush should also move quickly to figure out who his 
friends and enemies in congress are rewarding the friends and 
giving the enemies the cold shoulder 
it is essential that bush have at least a reliable core of 
onethirdplusone members of both the house and senate to sustain 
his vetos heatherly said 
the veto will be the only trump card he said 
the book repeats a host of heritage positions including letting 
workers opt out of social security in favor of private retirement 
accounts pressing ahead with president reagans star wars missile 
defense system and renewing military aid to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
this mandate is actually 166 pages shorter than the 1980 
tome which ran 1093 pages mandate for leadership ii in 
reagans midterm ran 565 pages

a sharply divided commission concluded today that 
ice on the wings of a military plane caused the crash that killed 
248 us soldiers returning home for christmas nearly three years 
ago 
however four of the nine panel members wrote a separate minority 
opinion saying the crash dec 12 1985 at gander newfoundland was 
probably caused by a fire that may have been started by an explosion 
aboard the plane 
the us national transportation safety board the us army and 
the us federal aviation administration participated in the probe 
but the ultimate responsibility for the report lies with the nine 
canadian board members 
the report by the canadian aviation safety board which was 
signed by five members including chairman kenneth j thorneycroft 
discounted terrorism and fire as causes of the disaster 
the minority opinion signed by four members said witnesses saw 
fire coming from the arrow air charter dc8 before it crashed 
shortly after takeoff 
the plane was taking the soldiers home to fort campbell ky they 
were returning from the middle east where they were on a 
peacekeeping mission 
all those aboard the plane including eight american crew 
members were killed in canadas worst air disaster 
members of the board often argued publicly during the 
investigation leading opposition politicians to call for a judicial 
review of the crash 
the boards report says the aircraft stalled at low altitude 
shortly afer takeoff and recovery was not possible 
the most probable cause of the stall was ice contamination 
on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing it said 
other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the no 4 
engine and inappropriate takeoff reference speeds may have 
compounded the effects of the contamination the report said 
it said the evidence did not support the occurrence of a 
preimpact fire or explosion either accidental or as a result of 
sabotage 
it also found that the crews december flight schedule was heavy 
and they may have been suffering from fatigue 
the minority opinion said ice contamination was not a factor in 
this accident it did not blame terrorism but said that security 
arrangements at the flights point of origin in cairo egypt were 
not ideal 
it said fire broke out on board while the aircraft was in 
flight possibly due to a detonation in a cargo compartment 
the minority opinion found members of the cockpit crew 
performed their duties without apparent fault it said there was 
no basis for supposing fatigue might have affected the crews 
performance

we can be of assistance either bilaterally or through the 
international community please let me know

people for those feelings and for their readiness to give 
assistance but did not say what if anything the soviets would 
ask for 
meanwhile the president of the american red cross said that 
50000 had already been sent to aid in the relief efforts as an 
immediate gift 
richard f schubert president of the organization said that 
members of the armenian community in los angeles had already offered 
to help 
donations schubert said in a statement should be sent to local 
chanters or to the american red cross international disaster 
relief po box 37243 washington dc 20013 and marked 
sovietarmenian earthquake 
we have agreed that just as soon as an assessment is made we 
will begin to supply their needs as we have the ability to do

in about 15 tons of blankets tents first aid kits

is a critical need for emergency shelter he explained

american medical association officials say they are 
going ahead with plans to establish training programs for a new type 
of hospital worker who would provide bedside care 
the decision came wednesday despite objections from some members 
of the associations 422member house of delegates the groups 
policymaking body 
called a registered care technologist or rct the new worker 
category also has been opposed by the nursing profession 
lucille joel president of the american nurses association told 
an ama committee monday that her organization would not cooperate 
ms joel and other nursing leaders have argued that rcts trained 
to provide bedside care such as emptying bedpans or delivering 
meals would only duplicate work already performed by nurses aides 
and licensed vocational nurses 
hospitals should instead hire more workers to stock cabinets and 
perform other tasks unrelated to patient care that have fallen upon 
nurses ms joel said 
but dr james sammons executive vice president of the ama said 
wednesday that just because the nurses association doesnt want to 
cooperate doesnt mean that nurses dont want to 
im sorry lucille said that because she now has driven the 
wedge even deeper sammons said at a news conference after the 
final session of the house of delegates semiannual meeting in dallas 
rct is not a nurse its not meant to be a nurse and its not 
meant to replace a nurse said ama trustee dr joseph painter a 
vice president of md anderson cancer center in houston 
an rct advisory committee made up of doctors nurses and hospital 
officials will convene in january painter said the first pilot 
program should begin by mid1989 
while the ama delegates agreed that they must investigate 
shortterm and longterm solutions to the national nursing shortage 
the new york delegation proposed dropping any reference to rcts 
basically we have a big problem with the inflammatory term of 
registered care technologist said a new york delegate dr 
richard eberle of syracuse 
in what appeared to be a close show of hands the house of 
delegates defeated new yorks proposal to drop the term rct the ama 
tallies votes only at the request of the speaker of the house of 
delegates

the seventh large python snake found 
slithering around the same neighborhood has officials puzzled but 
not panicked 
experts are not sure where the snakes have come from but say 
rodents are in far more danger than residents 
the latest python to be spotted in the 20block area was captured 
wednesday all seven snakes have been either fullgrown burmese 
pythons or reticulated pythons from southeast asia averaging 12 to 
15 feet in length and weighing up to 175 pounds said debbie parker 
of wildlife rescue and rehab inc a st petersburg facility that 
cares for injured or abandoned wild animals 
but because they are not aggressive and appear wellfed parker 
believes they may have been turned loose by their owner 
were talking about big big snakes as big around as my leg 
parker said if i lived in the area id be worried theyre big 
enough to eat a small child 
pythons are constrictor snakes and suffocate prey normally small 
mammals such as raccoons and opossums 
burmese pythons are unlikely to attack people and should flee 
when confronted by humans said patrick parisi president of the 
west coast herpetological society he said such a snake would have 
to be starving before it would attack a child for food 
but pythons have small sharp teeth that can inflict a painful 
bite he said they also have a natural fear of falling that could 
cause them to coil around anyone who attempts to pick them up 
reticulated pythons are the worlds largest snakes reaching 
lengths of up to 36 feet burmese pythons can grow to 24 feet 
parisi said both snakes can live up to 50 years in captivity 
parisi said its possible the pythons may be offspring of snakes 
that either escaped or were turned loose by the nowdefunct tarpon 
springs zoo which closed more than two decades ago development may 
be forcing the snakes out of woodlands he speculated 
all of the snakes have been taken to the wildlife rescue 
facility if they are not claimed within 10 days they can be 
donated to schools zoos or other educational facilities said 
vernon yates director of the center five of the snakes already 
have been donated to other institutions he said 
i dont think theres too many people in this world we have to 
tell to stay away from them said sheriffs office spokesman john 
bocchichio

here is the text of the comments of mikhail s 
gorbachev as spoken by his translator at john f kennedy 
international airport prior to his departure for the soviet union on 
thursday 
i would like to say that i have to cut short this visit and to 
return to the soviet union because late last night it was reported 
to me that the earthquake that struck the transcaucasian republics 
of the soviet union and particularly armenia was extremely severe 
and had extremely grave consequences devastation and grave loss of 
life i urgently have to return to the soviet union 
at present a government commission is already at work headed 
by the prime minister of the soviet union it is already in the 
disaster area urgent measures are being taken to help all those 
affected by this terrible tragedy and i have to be there in this 
effort 
this morning i had telephone conversations with president 
reagan and vice president bush both of them expressed profound 
condolences on behalf of the american people to those affected and 
to the government and people of the soviet union i thanked them for 
the expression of those feelings and let me say here again on 
behalf of myself of the soviet people and on behalf of those to 
whom those feelings of sympathy were expressed by the president and 
the vice president let me extend our deep gratitud and our profound 
appreciation 
the president and the vice president conveyed their willingness 
to extend assistance and appropriate help in this situation i would 
like to thank them and i would like to thank the american people 
for those feelings and for their readiness to give assistance in 
this difficult hour 
it has so happened that we had only one working day here in new 
york but i and my delegation believe that this was a very important 
day we were able to set out our views at the united nations on the 
world today and on the prospects of the worlds development we did 
that at the united nations an organization which we value very 
highly and whose role we believe will grow in the development of 
new international relations 
we also were able to have another of the useful exchanges at 
the united nations to talk to representatives of many countries 
and we feel that they understand what we said at the united nations 
yesterday i had the meeting with president reagan and vice 
president the presidentelect george bush and members of the 
current and future us administrations we and the american side 
share the view that this was a very important meeting which has 
confirmed the high level of sovietamerican relations which makes 
it possible to discuss very important questions affecting relations 
between our countries and problems of improving international 
relations 
this was a good meeting held in a very good atmosphere an open 
and trusting atmosphere we believe that it was characterized by a 
readiness to understand the positions of each other and yesterday 
when i was asked to describe in one word the essence and the main 
motive of that meeting i said that word was continuity 
so that meeting yesterday and the telephone conversations that 
we had today when we also briefly addressed our future cooperation 
make us confident make the soviet union and the united states 
confident that our relations will expand and improve on the basis 
of cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for each others 
interests and also taking into account responsibilities for our 
nations and for the world 
i think i would remiss in my duty if i went home without saying 
how much we are grateful to new yorkers for the hospitality and 
feelings of friendship that they have been expressing over these 
days so to all new yorkers our very warm gratitude we value that 
very much we believe that this may have been one of the most 
important things that happened on this day of our stay in america 
that shows increased and increasing respect and friendliness and 
willingness to cooperate on the part of the soviet people and the 
american people 
the road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead and we will 
i believe be building on what has been achieved if we act as we 
have been acting and also maybe add something new i think that 
would open up good prospects for our two peoples and will be 
extremely important for the world as well 
goodbye and thank you

exerciseconcious americans and residents of missouri and maryland 
among those most likely to be overweight a study of 21 states shows 
florida topped an overall ranking of how much people do to 
promote their health in the results released thursday 
new york topped the list of four metropolitan areas surveyed for 
overall health promotion followed by los angeles philadelphia and 
chicago 
the rankings are based on surveys commissioned by prevention 
magazine and carried out by pollsters louis harris and associates 
inc from 1983 through 1987 they are based on average scores for 
the five years and do not account for changes within the period 
researchers said 
only the 21 most populous states were analyzed because at least 
100 people in each state answered the survey questions the report 
said the states cover 78 percent of the nations population the 
study said 
the percentage of residents who exercised strenuously at least 
three times a week ranged from 42 percent in virginia and 39 percent 
in california to a low of 25 percent in new york state 
sixtyfive percent of missourians and 63 percent of maryland 
residents were reported to be overweight with a low of 48 percent 
among californians 
for overall health promotion each state and metro area was 
ranked by the extent to which residents followed healthpromoting 
behavior from a list of 21 practices the scores were weighted to 
emphasize practices with the most health impact 
items included on the list called a prevention index were 
not smoking wearing a seat belt following healthy dietary 
practices avoiding driving after drinking getting frequent 
exercise and an annual blood pressure test and taking steps to 
control stress

more than 4000 students and striking 
technical school teachers on thursday began a week of protests 
across greece with a march to press for increased government 
spending on education 
nothing nothing will stop us now the demonstrators shouted 
outside the offices of education minister george papandreou son of 
socialist premier andreas papandreou 
we have no professors books laboratories or lecture halls 
simply because government spending on education is so low said 
costas vassiliou a technical school student 
the younger papandreou refused to meet with the student leaders 
ministry officials said 
the protest was the first of several slated to take place before 
the governments 1989 budget is debated in parliament dec 15 
education spending 82 percent of total government outlay will 
rise by less than 1 percent next year according to the proposed 
budget 
inflation is running at 14 percent 
students and teachers claim a 15percent increase is needed to 
end chronic shortages of technical equipment books and teaching 
staff 
the increase neither keeps abreast of inflation nor takes into 
account our soaring tertiaryschool trained population said 
stelios klimopoulos who heads the union of technical school 
educators 
earlier this year george papandreou promised wideranging 
reforms in education and pledged his fathers government would raise 
the education allocation to 15 percent of the national budget 
greeces 17 staterun universities and technical colleges shut 
down on wednesday as professors staged a 24hour walkout to back 
their demands 
educators said they planned to repeat the strike next week unless 
the government pledges a major increase in education spending 
the educators said they want a 50percent salary hike and funds 
for updating books and expanding graduate research programs a 
university lecturer with six years experience currently earns 785 
monthly 
because of our teaching duties were obliged to give short 
shrift to research and because of lack of funds we dont have the 
equipment to conduct it said a lecturer at athens prestigious 
polytechnic univeristy 
the absence of graduate research opportunites is evidenced by the 
large number of students who flock to western universities to 
continue their studies 
more than 20000 greek students are working in graduate programs 
in the united states and the european economic community according 
to education ministry officials

afghan guerrillas and their pakistani 
backers reacted coolly thursday to soviet presdient mikhail s 
gorbachevs proposals for a ceasefire and arms cut in afghanistan 
a ceasefire in the presence of invading forces is meaningless 
in afghanistan said abdul rahim spokesman of the powerful 
jamiatiislami guerrilla group 
pakistans official news agency quoted the countrys us 
ambassador s shah nawaz as saying gorbachevs speech wednesday to 
the united nations was statesmanlike but that his afghan 
proposals were unrealistic 
the agency also reported that an afghan pilot landed his mig21 
jet in pakistan on thursday and surrendered a government official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the plane landed at miram 
shah in north west frontier province 10 miles from the afghan 
border 
the agency identified the pilot only as capt asadullah 
tass the official soviet news agency reported a clash between 
the afghan army and the insurgents saying at least 86 guerrillas 
were killed and 56 wounded the report which could not be 
confirmed did not give a date for the clash 
there was no immediate response from foreign minister sahabzada 
yaqub khan on gorbachevs proposals however a ministry official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said an end of hostilities was 
not practical because afghan guerrillas were determined to fight 
to victory 
gorbachev proposed a jan 1 ceasefire between sovietbacked 
afghan forces and the us and pakistansupported guerrillas with 
both sides holding their ground 
he called for a mutual arms freeze on the same date and for an 
international conference to restore peace in the wartorn country 
moscow agreed in a unmediated accord last spring to withdraw 
its troops from afghanistan by feb 15 1989 half of the troops 
pulled out under the schedule but the soviet union suspended the 
withdrawal last month but pledged to remove its troops on schedule 
soviet forces intervened in december 1979 and stayed on to help 
defend the marxist government against an increasingly ferocious 
insurgency 
there is no demarcated line of battle where the ceasefire 
could be enforced nawaz was quoted as saying by the agency 
associated press of pakistan 
he said gorbachevs proposal for an international conference on 
afghanistan was not new and was aimed at giving legitimacy to the 
kabul regime which seized power in 1978 
the guerrillas have gained large parts of eastern afghanistan 
since the soviet pullout began may 15 communist government forces 
still control most major cities while insurgents rule the 
countryside 
rahim whose party leader burhanuddin rabbani currently chairs 
the sevenparty guerrilla alliance said the guerrillas would keep 
fighting until all soviets have left the country and the kabul 
government falls

president reagan prepared thursday for his 
first news conference in six months likely his last formal meeting 
with reporters as the clock runs out on his eightyear presidency 
one day after his fifth meeting with kremlin leader mikhail 
gorbachev reagan was ready to deal with questions about the 
evolution of his views about the soviet union from calling it an 
evil empire to signing the first superpower treaty ever to 
abolish an entire class of nuclear weapons 
reagan said his summit with gorbachev in new york along with 
presidentelect bush had been a very useful meeting for both 
sides the soviet leader capped his trip by announcing a 
unilateral cutback of 500000 soviet forces a reduction of about 10 
percent 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater did not rule out the 
possibility of another news conference before reagan leaves office 
on jan 20 however first lady nancy reagan told reporters earlier 
this week be nice its his last one 
reagan before going to the oval office on thursday placed a 
farewell telephone call to gorbachev who abruptly cut short a new 
york visit and flew home because of a devastating earthquake that 
killed thousands of people in soviet armenia 
as related by fitzwater the president expressed americans 
deep personal sorrow and asked gorbachev if there is any way 
the united states could help gorbachev later publicly expressed 
gratitude for the us offer 
reagan told gorbachev he fully understood that you have no 
choice but to return to your own country and be with your people 
following the early morning earthquake i know i speak for all 
americans when i express my deep personal sorrow at the loss of life 
caused by this earthquake 
we understand that it was a very serious one the president 
said according to fitzwater if there is any way we can be of 
assistance either bilaterally or through the international 
community please let me know 
i want to tell you again how much both the vice president and i 
enjoyed meeting with you yesterday reagan said i think it was 
a very useful meeting for both sides i wish you much success in the 
future and a safe journey home godspeed 
mrs reagan also spoke with raisa gorbachev on the telephone 
expressing sorrow over the quake and saying that she and the 
president hope to see the gorbachevs again either in california or 
the soviet union

few news conferences only 45 fullscale meetings with the press 
four of them this year

presidentelect george bush called soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev today to express sympathy for the 
horrible disaster situation caused by a devastating earthquake 
in armenia 
nobody really knows the numbers of people killed but i had an 
opportunity to tell him how strongly barbara and i feel in human 
terms about that loss bush said 
gorbachev who held a summit luncheon in new york wednesday with 
bush and president reagan cut short his visit to return home to the 
soviet union to deal with the earthquake in armenia 
bush said he told gorbachev that he enjoyed the meeting but the 
two only discussed broad themes in their very pleasant 
15minute conversation conducted with the use of simultaneous 
translators 
while bush says he wants to build on the reagan administrations 
recent record of improved relations he has refused to make any 
foreign policy initiatives until he has his national security team 
in place 
bush said the two discussed the toll in human life in this 
horrible disaster situation though bush didnt specifically offer 
us aid to quake victims he said the american people will want 
to hold out their hands to those families who lost loved ones 
reagan telephoned gorbachev to offer american assistance 
gorbachev remarked that the death toll was so high in part 
because the quake occurred in the middle of the day when people were 
out and around according to bush there have been preliminary 
estimates reported of up to 50000 people killed in the quake 
bush whose voice is hoarse because he has a cold made his 
comments on the earthquake at a picturetaking session to unveil the 
inaugural license plate he attached the red white and blue plate 
with the number 1 on it to his black limousine 
the personalized commemorative license plates cost 50 and can 
be used on public roads until march 31 1989 if registered through 
the american bicentennial presidential inaugural 
in his address to the un general assembly wednesday gorbachev 
said that he looked forward to working with bush as he had with 
reagan 
as the three leaders parted in new york bush told gorbachev i 
enjoyed the meeting hope to see you soon 
during a brief exchange with reporters on his return to andrews 
air force base in suburban maryland bush suffering from a cold 
said he told gorbachev that we hadnt put together our full team 
and that im in the process of doing that 
bush named longtime associate james a baker as secretary of 
state the day after his election nov 8 and he has named former 
ford administration national security adviser brent scowcroft to 
serve in the same capacity but the vice president hasnt yet 
settled on a secretary of defense although there have been 
persistent reports the job will go to former sen john tower 
rtexas 
bush said that in his talks with gorbachev i also made clear 
that we needed some time and he understood that he didnt have any 
problem with that at all 
bush called the luncheon a good productive meeting and said 
he saw several positive aspects to gorbachevs speech to the general 
assembly the soviet leader among other things announced that he 
was reducing soviet ground force troop strength by 500000 from the 
current level of roughly 56 million 
there was no pressing on substantive details at the session 
bush said although he said weighty issues were discussed 
and now ive got to go back and get our full national security 
team together and set our strategy and establish our priorities 
he said as i said in the campaign have our secretary of state 
touch base with the allies make contact and have a lot of contact 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
and then down the line at an appropriate line a meeting 
between me and general secretary gorbachev can be discussed the 
vice president said but theres no pressure on that the main 
thing is to formulate our plan to move them forward so we have 
progress thats what i want 
secretary of state george shultz briefing reporters on the 
roughly twohour luncheon summit said there were general 
references to the desirability of having the level of contact the 
intensity of contacts at all levels maintained 
but shultz said theres no immediate plan for any meeting that 
came out of the session as i saw it although obviously there 
will be one at some appropriate moment 
bush said in advance of the summit that he was going there in his 
role as vice president and that he would mostly listen 
this stance produced one of the lighter moments during a 
picturetaking session as reagan gorbachev and bush and several 
aides sat at a long rectangular table 
when bush was asked to give his reaction to gorbachevs troop 
cutback announcement he replied that i support what the president 
says 
as people broke up in laughter gorbachev said through his 
interpreter one of the best answers of the year

an earthquake virtually destroyed several cities 
and killed thousands of people in armenia officials said today 
military surgeons and tons of medical supplies were rushed to the 
stricken region 
armenian journalists said a politburo commission led by premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov was receiving preliminary estimates that up to 
50000 people died in the quake which struck the southern region on 
wednesday 
soviet officials reported thousands of people were killed but 
provided no detailed casualty count 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said he had 
no information to back up the 50000 figure he said no official 
toll had been released 
in london george kurkjian a representative of the patriarch of 
the armenian apostolic church of south armenia quoted church 
sources in moscow as saying the death toll could reach 100000 
president mikhail s gorbachev cut short his visit to the united 
states to return to direct rescue efforts before leaving new york 
he said president reagan and presidentelect george bush offered 
condolences to those affected 
soviet officials set up a helicopter bridge to take victims 
from the mountainous republic of 33 million people to neighboring 
soviet georgia official soviet media said the earthquake wiped out 
villages and destroyed half of kirovakan a city of 170000 people 
the official soviet news agency tass also reported destruction in 
georgia and the azerbaijan republic in the northern caucasus tent 
cities for evacuees were set up throughout northwestern armenia 
which was hardest hit 
military surgeons are carrying out a series of difficult 
operations including on children in field conditions army gen 
vladimir arkhipov told tass the agency said a red cross plane 
brought relief supplies including 20000 blood transfusion kits to 
armenia 
the earthquake which struck at midmorning wiped out spitak a 
town of 16000 about 55 miles northwest of the armenian capital of 
yerevan the government newspaper izvestia said 
it said just one of the towns eight schools remained standing 
the us geological survey said the quake measured 69 on the 
richter scale 
state television showed film of crumbled buildings in spitak and 
kirovakan armenias thirdlargest city in one shot a man put his 
hands over his head in grief as he stood in the rubble of a 
collapsed building 
practically all apartment buildings of nine floors or higher 
are destroyed the official newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said 
there is significant damage in fivestory apartment buildings 
only individual onestory and twothree story homes of old 
construction remain whole 
komsomolskaya pravda reported from leninakan a city of 250000 
about 30 miles from the epicenter that preliminary reports 
indicated tens of thousands of people became victims of the 
earthquake 
tass reported that 2300 people were hospitalized in yerevan from 
leninakan kirovakan and spitak and more were expected 
nora milikyan an editor of the official armenian news agency 
armenpress said in a telephone interview from yerevan that the 
worst place was spitak 
the entire town was destroyed the hospitals and the schools 
and the factories all the houses were destroyed there is nothing 
left there she said 
asked for the telephone number of the police station in spitak 
deputy duty officer lyova oganisyan at the interior ministry in 
armenia said it wouldnt do any good because the station was 
destroyed 
gennady i gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman said in new 
york a small village has practically disappeared from the face of 
the earth he did not identify it or elaborate 
gerasimov later dismissed speculation that gorbachev was cutting 
short his visit to the united states in order to deal with political 
problems at home following wednesdays sudden resignation of army 
chief sergei akhromeyev 
there is national tragedy there in armenia and our leader 
must be there where people suffer this is the only reason for the 
return he told cbstvs this morning 
gorbachevs appearance in armenia could improve central 
government ties with the restive region which has been torn by 
violent ethnic strife between armenians who are mostly christian 
and predominantly moslem azerbaijanis 
the population of armenia has risen markedly in recent weeks as 
settlers flee the ethnic violence izvestia said about 180000 
refugees reportedly have fled across the border between the two 
republics the last three weeks foreign reporters had not been 
allowed into the region because of the unrest 
komsomolskaya pravda said today that soldiers pulled the bodies 
of more than 50 children from a school that collapsed in leninakan 
which is near the sovietturkish border several children were found 
alive 
at least four deaths from the collapse of 50 houses were reported 
wednesday in eastern turkey by that countrys state press 
a quake of 69 on the richter scale is capable of causing 
widespread damage the scale is a measure of ground motion as 
recorded on seismographs every increase of one number means a 
tenfold increase in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an 
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 65

the last gift presented to mikhail s gorbachev 
during his visit to new york was a soviet flag that went to the moon 
in 1971 with the apollo 15 mission 
the flag was handed to gorbachev by former astronaut james b 
irwin just before the soviet leader climbed the steps to his plane 
at kennedy airport on thursday 
irwin said he and his crewmates in the july 1971 moon flight 
david r scott and alfred worden had signed the flag which was one 
of a number of flags carried by the moonwalkers 
we carried it for you and for the people of the soviet union 
and we visited the moon in peace for all mankind irwin told 
gorbachev 
he also gave gorbachev a coffeetable book the home planet 
which contains photos from space and text by american and soviet 
space travelers 
i think youll find it inspirational reading material for your 
flight back home irwin said 
gorbachev shook his hand and tapped him on the shoulder 
irwin said he had tried to give the flag to gorbachev during a 
twoweek visit last month to the soviet union but it could not be 
arranged he was invited however to present the flag at a 
reception gorbachev planned for thursday night when gorbachev cut 
his visit short the soviets let irwin make the presentation at the

mikhail s gorbachevs offer to cut the red army 
by 10 percent and withdraw 50000 soviet troops from eastern europe 
has not fully eased western worries about a decisive kremlin edge in 
men tanks and artillery 
gorbachevs unilateral cuts and message of peace were likely to 
further enhance his soaring popularity in western europe and to 
rekindle calls in congress and nato member states for withdrawal of 
some of the 335000 us troops in europe 
but secretary of state george p shultz and other foreign 
ministers of the atlantic alliance quickly said gorbachevs 
statements confirmed their view that the soviets have enough 
nonnuclear armaments to mount a blitzkrieg offensive and tip the 
balance in opening days of an eastwest conflict 
the north atlantic treaty organization in a statement issued 
after gorbachevs un speech on wednesday said the soviet union 
itself possesses more tanks and artillery than all the other members 
of the warsaw pact and the nato alliance combined and they are 
concentrated in a manner which raises grave concerns about the 
strategy which they are intended to support 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said gorbachevs move 
seems to be a step in the right direction but warned big 
imbalances would remain 
spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez welcomed 
gorbachevs proposals but said the soviets know that in 
conventional arms negotiations they have to reduce much more than 
western allies 
west german defense minister rupert scholz said gorbachev must 
follow up with actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and 
reduction of forces 
nato which cannot afford to match the soviets soldier for 
soldier and tank for tank has a policy of deterring a conventional 
attack with the threat of nuclear weapons an approach that wags 
have summarized as fight like the devil for two weeks then blow 
up the world 
the nato nuclear deterrent and the perceived will to use it has 
faded however with the signing last december of a ussoviet 
treaty to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear weapons and 
continuing negotiations to sharply reduce longrange strategic arms 
the soviets have been tinkering with their doctrine as well 
declaring that they will maintain forces adequate only to fend off 
an attack not to launch one 
gorbachevs announcement of troop cuts in eastern europe and an 
overall reduction of 500000 men in an armed forces totaling 56 
million soldiers are the first concrete examples of the new kremlin 
policy the doctrine of reasonable sufficiency 
gorbachev also said the red army would shed 10000 tanks but 
those cuts are only small steps in bringing nato and warsaw pact 
forces into balance according to western figures 
nato says the warsaw pact has the following advantages 
ground forces in europe warsaw pact 31 million nato 22 
million 
tanks warsaw pact 51500 nato 16424 
armored fighting vehicles warsaw pact 22400 nato 4135 
other armored vehicles warsaw pact 71000 nato 35351 
combat aircraft warsaw pact 8250 nato 3977 
helicopters warsaw pact 3700 nato 2419 
artillery warsaw pact 43400 nato 14458 
antiaircraft systems warsaw pact 24400 nato 10309 
armored vehicle launched bridges warsaw pact 2550 nato 454 
nato in its statement proposed a limit of 40000 tanks for 
either side which gorbachevs cuts would approach 
the soviet union he said would remove six tank divisions from 
eastern europe out of a total of 15 tank divisions counted by the 
londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
such a step could help ease nato concerns about the offensive 
potential of the red army 
but the soviet president offered no specifics about easing the 
imbalance in other types of weapons moreover pulling 50000 soviet 
troops out of eastern europe would not come close to balancing 
ground forces 
according to the iiss annual report the soviet union has 380000 
troops stationed in east germany 65000 in hungary 80000 in 
czechoslovakia and 40000 in poland 
gorbachev said red army forces would be withdrawn from east 
germany czechoslovakia and hungary but he did not provide a 
breakdown 
so far the soviet union has not disclosed its troop and armament 
levels and those numbers will be at the center of debate when the 
two sides sit down to discuss conventional force cuts a step that 
us officials say will probably come early next year 
despite the continued imbalance president reagan 
presidentelect bush and shultz welcomed the soviet step which is 
part of a wider opening of the soviet union toward the west 
before even agreeing to resume conventional force negotiations 
which had been under way for 15 years in a different format the 
west demanded improvement in soviet human rights policies 
improvements that have been reflected in greater numbers of jews and 
armenians allowed to emigrate cessation of soviet jamming of 
western radio broadcasts and the release of many prisoners of 
conscience from prisons and camps

a former firefighter who says he was fired 
because he was too chubby has been offered a settlement in his 
discrimination complaint 
supervisor richard brook would not divulge the settlement 
approved this week by the board of bath in central michigan but he 
said clarence edward christy would not be reinstated and that the 
amount was less than had been requested 
i guess the board feels we did the best we could for the 
community under the circumstances that were there brooks said 
christy claimed he was discriminated against when he was fired in 
1985 on the grounds that his weight kept him from doing the job 
properly the 5foot6inch former smoker weighed 260 pounds when he 
was fired 
christy was seeking reinstatement back pay totaling 4000 and 
6000 for emotional and mental stress 
although christy had not seen the settlement he said wednesday 
that he would accept it 
theyve been messing around with this for three years and 
theres been a lot of heat toward me from the township i think i 
just better take what they offer and let the matter die down he

the sudden departure of mikhail s gorbachev 
eliminating a full day of big apple sightseeing produced sympathy 
sorrow and savings and some sighs of relief thursday from those 
who missed out on the historic visit 
the mood is very sad said elaine fink principal of the 
manhattan elementary school that had been scheduled to play host to 
raisa gorbachev in the afternoon the children are very down that 
a terrible tragedy killed thousands of people and that mrs 
gorbachev will not get to see a school in the united states 
her feelings were reflected at each planned stop by the 
gorbachevs on their final day in manhattan the soviet leader left 
new york a day early to rush home because of a massive earthquake 
that devastated soviet armenia 
in addition to the trip to ps 6 on the upper east side 
gorbachev and his wife had planned a short walk through central park 
before a visit to the metropolitan museum of art and had scheduled a 
morning stop at the javits convention center for a soviet trade show 
i guess ill just go do some christmas shopping and go home 
said john chrystal chief operating officer of bankers trust co of 
des moines iowa who had been invited by gorbachev to attend the 
trade event 
chrystals uncle roswell garst owned the iowa farm that nikita 
khrushchev visited in one of the high points of his 1959 american 
tour and the iowan had come to new york solely to see gorbachev 
he was not alone in feeling let down 
yes we are disappointed but who can argue with an 
earthquake asked a resigned parks commissioner henry stern who 
was to be gorbachevs host in the park we hope he can come back 
another time 
at the metropolitan museum of art the final tourist attraction 
on the gorbachev tour the mood was somber said john ross head of 
public relations 
i think the only thing we can say is to express sympathy for 
the earthquake victims said ross the leader of the soviet 
union is not someone who comes by every day and if he comes back 
we would be pleased if he came to see the museum 
while stern said little was done to prepare central park for the 
visit we cleaned up a bit but we do that every day ms fink 
said the students and teachers at ps 6 had a crash course on the 
soviet union to prepare for mrs gorbachev 
the kids were ready the excitement was at an incredible 
level she said now its a tremendous sadness over the tragedy 
its a lesson in disappointment for us all 
while there was sympathy and sorrow there were also savings for 
the new york city police officials were busy computing how much of 
the 1 million in overtime set aside for the trip would be saved by 
eliminating a days work 
the sighs of relief came from the transportation department 
which battled the gorbylock that paralyzed midtown manhattan on 
wednesday evening as gorbachevs motorcade wound through town 
were doing better now said joe obrien a spokesman for the 
department to a large degree we dont have to worry about 
traffic today theres just the regular traffic to worry about 
also left in the lurch by the change in plans was billionaire 
developer donald trump whose invitation to have gorbachev visit the 
opulent trump tower was rejected trump was among a group scheduled 
for dinner thursday night at the soviet mission instead the 
closest he came to the soviet leader was a glimpse of a gorby 
lookalike on tuesday 
trump unsurprisingly was undaunted 
donald said hes going to see him anyway next year in the 
soviet union said trump spokesman dan klores

nato urged moscow thursday to go beyond 
the positive contribution of a unilateral cutback of 50000 
troops in eastern europe by negotiating a lower ceiling of soviet 
forces on foreign soil 
taking a cue from us secretary of state george p shultz who 
briefed the 15 nato foreign ministers on mikhail s gorbachevs 
initiative the allies declined to match the soviet presidents move 
with a voluntary reduction of their own 
instead nato said it will propose to the ninenation warsaw pact 
limits on the forces each country in each alliance can deploy talks 
on cutting the forces are expected early next year 
no country should be able to dominate the continent by force of 
arms the nato statement said 
it suggested that no country should have more than a fixed figure 
such as 30 percent of all forces in europe and called for a 
limit of about 12000 tanks in any one country the soviets have 
20000 tanks in east germany alone nato officials say 
gorbachev speaking wednesday at the united nations in new york 
offered to cut forces over two years in east germany czechoslovakia 
and hungary 
the allies instead of reciprocating focused on the 21 manpower 
edge and 31 tank advantage they say the soviets hold over nato 
the soviet union itself possesses more tanks and artillery than 
all the other members of the warsaw pact and the nato alliance 
combined the statement said 
we hope that the new thinking in the soviet union will open the 
way for mutual agreement on realistic militarily significant and 
verifiable arrangements which enhance security at lower levels it 
said 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said we are 
proposing a dramatic change in the military situation in europe 
directed to very substantial reductions by about 50 percent to a 
balanced outcome 
he said natos aim was to concentrate on the key offensive 
systems which are tanks artillery and armored troop carriers 
the united states which has about 335000 troops in western 
europe also would be affected by the proposed limits 
roughly speaking nato is talking about cuts that would leave 
us around 95 percent of current levels and how that would be broken 
down among the relevant nations has not been figured out yet said 
a senior us official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity 
the start of a new series of conventional arms talks between the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact has been 
delayed by wrangling over human rights at a 35nation conference in 
vienna 
but steps taken by gorbachev to release political prisoners and 
permit us psychiatrists next month to examine soviet mental 
institutions have raised expectations the conventional stability 
talks can begin early next year 
we are trying to get done as soon as possible a us 
official said 
the nato declaration which took two years to prepare was 
revised at the last moment to refer to the reductions gorbachev 
announced wednesday 
it doesnt change the basic concept weve been working on a 
senior us official said 
for years the western allies have complained there is an 
asymmetry in favor of the warsaw pact by virtue of its 
commanding edge in tanks artillery and combat aircraft 
and yet everybody agrees that there is a change occurring in 
the soviet union that there is something different under 
gorbachev said the official who briefed the reporters under 
condition of anonymity 
in another development an internal nato dispute with france 
apparently was resolved the french who participate only in some 
nato decisions wanted 12 nonaligned european countries to be able 
to join in reviewing the decisions taken by the 16 nato allies and 
the seven warsaw pact members 
but the us official said an agreement was worked out last 
weekend that the review could be held in 1992 provided the nato 
nations have operational automony in the negotiations

the weekend the statement said

polyp and nearly two feet of his colon as well as the surrounding 
tissue 
since 1985 and up until last january reagan had a colonoscopy 
every six months to check for any recurrence of cancer each time

a liberal organization that concerns itself 
with the first amendment said thursday that the reagan 
administration turned a cold shoulder to the fundamental liberties 
guaranteed by our founders 
it said presidentelect bush is showing more sensitivity toward 
constitutional guarantees of freedom of spech and freedom of the 
press and separation of church and state 
people for the american way which describes itself as the 
nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization issued a 
report that it says shows 241 cases in which the administration 
trampled on freedom of speech and freedom of the press separation 
of church and state and other rights guaranteed by the constitition 
the group cited a 45000 federal grant to pat robertsons 
christian broadcasting network a white house aides saying that 
anyone directly around ronald reagan gets saved or gets out a 
40 percent increase in classified information the news blackout on 
the us invasion of grenada and the attempt to induce reporters 
for two newspapers not to report various intelligence activities 
the incidents weve cited in our report demonstrate a slow 
steady quiet usurpation of first amendment rights arthur j 
kropp president of the organization told a news conference 
it isnt as if ed meese and ronald reagan sat down eight years 
ago and said to themselves how can we sink free speech today 
kropp said 
but the reagan administration did come to town with a very 
specific political agenda and most important a seeming 
willingness to do whatever it takes to effect their agenda if that 
meant violating the principles or rights set forth in the first 
amendment then apparently they were willing to do just that 
john h buchanan chairman of the group said that while bush is 
part of that record he is encouraged that the presidenttobe is 
selecting people of reason not radicalism for his 
administration 
buchanan said bush should not repay whatever debts he owes the 
far right by selecting ideologues for the middle and lowerlevel 
positions in his administration and that he should choose as 
judges men and women of unquestioned legal ability and competence 
i am heartened that after eight years of an administraion that 
avoided manipulated and even attacked the news media the 
presidentelect is being accessible and open to the press 
buchanan said 
we urge the new president to adopt more reasonable policies on 
the classification of government documents to eliminate the 
reclassification of documents that are currently available to the 
people and to prohibit restrictions on unclassified information

from the days president george washington 
dispatched the first united states marshals to quell the whiskey 
rebellion the storied lawmen have been part of the countrys most 
colorful and most violent episodes 
they did the hanging for famous hanging judge isaac parker of 
fort smith ark after rounding up bank and train robbers hiding in 
the brush of indian territory smashed whiskey stills during 
prohibition and protected slaves freed after the civil war 
the nations oldest law enforcement organization the marshals 
began their bicentennial celebration thursday with the opening of an 
exhibit at the supreme court followed by a blacktie dinner at a 
nearby hotel 
organized by the marshals service with the help of the 
smithsonian insitution the exhibit displays artifacts from 
massacres and shootouts that have earned the men their place in the 
lore of the wild west and their immortalization by movie legends 
john wayne and henry fonda 
as the united states expanded across the continent us 
marshals and their deputies established the federal goverments 
authority over areas that had known little order and no goverment 
most of them were rough uncouth men according to an excerpt of 
the marshals official history by frederick s calhoun 
the brothers of deputy frank dalton one of many men killed in 
indian territory were also deputies before they turned to robbing 
banks 
they were the federal goverment at the local level calhoun 
said there was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy so when the 
citizens got mad they took it out on the federal marshals 
as a result as many as 100 marshals and their deputies died in 
indian territory between 1872 and 1896 their deadliest era calhoun 
said 
with the exception of indian territory the far most dangerous 
time to be a marshal was in the south after the civil war calhoun 
said if the ku klux klan didnt get you the moonshiners did 
at least 400 and as many as 700 marshals have died in the line of 
duty more than any other law enforcement agency but the exact 
number isnt known because of difficulties in determining whether 
members of posses had actually been deputized before their deaths 
said marshals service director stanley morris 
at almost every point in history when the federal government 
was involved in a significant event there were marshals 
participating said marshals service spokesman stephen boyle 
a marshal who fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a 
homestead in the oklahoma land run of 1889 at guthrie marshals 
guarded the first black student at the university of 
mississippioxford in the 1960s and marshals ringed the pentagon 
during the vietnam war protests of the early 1970s 
they arrested gangster al capone twice and took the census until 
1880 
as evidence of those events the marshals exhibit contains the 
arrest warrant for geronimo an 1870 ku klux klan robe and hood from 
a recruit in the klans birthpace of pulaski tenn a 1790 whiskey 
still from the whiskey rebellion era and one of the two machine 
guns from the st valentines day massacre in chicago the 
bloodiest of prohibition 
the exhibit which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2 
years also includes a jesse james vest and sidearm and original 
drawings by wyatt earp of four gunfights including one at the ok 
corral involving the legendary wild west marshal 
appointed by the president the 94 district us marshals are a 
part of the executive branch created by the first congress in the 
judiciary act of 1789 the same law that established the supreme 
court and the federal judicial system 
the marshals of the 1980s provide security in federal court and 
protect supreme court justices when they travel beyond washington 
they operate the witness protection program that gives new 
identities to those whose lives are jeopardized by testifying for 
the government and track down federal fugitives 
they also take custody of those accused of federal crimes and 
transport federal prisoners running the governments only scheduled 
airline service with two boeing 727s and smaller aircraft out of 
their oklahoma city hub morris said 
they are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs and 
other federal crimes and have managed horse ranches restaurants 
condominums a golf course and a greenhouse 
with just 3000 employees the service is smaller than the new 
york city police department morris said yet its ranks are 
stationed in every us judicial district from guam to the virgin 
islands

israelis on thursday reacted with various 
degrees of skepticism and coolness to the latest statements of 
moderation from plo chairman yasser arafat 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted by aides as dismissing 
arafats acceptance of israel as part of a campaign of deceit 
they said it was aimed at duping western countries particularly the 
united states 
foreign minister shimon peres head of the leftleaning labor 
party said on israels armed forces radio that the plo has 
learned to say one thing and do another 
peres suggested there may be room for a dialogue if the plo met 
three conditions recognition of israels right to live in peace a 
halt to terrorism inside and outside israel and unqualified 
acceptance of un resolutions that guarantee israels right to 
exist in secure borders 
the most welcoming comments came from leftists like ran cohen a 
parliament member of the citizens rights movement who urged the 
government to bless the process and ask how we can advance it 
but answering cohen in an israel radio debate hawkish former 
un ambassador binyamin netanyahu accused the plo of using 
declarations of peace as tactics of war 
most israelis did not see either the palestine national council 
declaration in november or arafats elaboration in sweden on 
wednesday as sincere or convincing recognition of israels 
legitimacy 
if ever a mountain gave birth to a mouse that was it said 
the jerusalem post a liberal englishlanguage daily the 
ambiguities have been compounded not removed 
arafats campaign of moderation has had an impact however 
repeated public statements of a willingness to talk peace and accept 
israel chip away at the skepticism and strengthen liberal arguments 
that the arabs genuinely seek peace 
one sign of change is the recent endorsement of israelplo talks 
by the peace now movement a grassroots antiwar organization that 
led the campaign for israels withdrawal from lebanon 
opinion polls have indicated the israeli public is more flexible 
than the politicians about negotiating with the plo a tel aviv 
university survey of 1180 israeli adults conducted at the start of 
the palestinian uprising found more than half ready for talks if the 
plo changed its policies and recognized israel 
israelis remain hard to convince 
one reason is they have the precedent of the late egyptian 
president anwar sadat who underlined his sincerity by coming to 
jerusalem to address israels parliament in november 1977 he melted 
public doubts even though israelis had voted a rightwing government 
into office only months before 
to many israelis arafats statements appeared directed more at 
winning the recognition of the united states than at starting 
negotiations with israel 
he cannot achieve his aims as long as he cannot convince the 
israeli public that he really wants peace said one official who 
demanded anonymity 
he has real difficulty changing israeli minds because they are 
less impressed by his words abroad than by the acts of terror in 
israel 
alon liel spokesman for peres foreign ministry said arafats 
stockholm comments were moderate but very much different from 
other plo leaders who showed no willingness to accept israel 
hardline palestinian views appeared in graffiti on walls in the 
occupied territories after arafats stockholm statement raising 
questions about the degree to which arafat controlled the plo 
no concessions not even an inch of palestine said a leftist 
slogan spraypainted on a wall in the west bank town of nablus 
yes to holy war against the enemy declared a moslem 
fundamentalist slogan on a wall in bethlehem

them to determine the kind of assistance most needed and in any way 
that we might be helpful state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said 
a few hours after making his telephone call to gorbachev reagan 
was asked whether he expected the united states to be providing 
assistance for earthquake relief to the soviets they havent 
asked for any yet he said 
this is an incredible disaster one that would tax the 
resources of any society including the soviet red cross said 
richard f schubert president of the american red cross in 
washington 
the international red cross in geneva switzerland is working 
with soviet officials to determine what supplies are most needed and 
which countries can fill those needs he said

medicines according to the american red cross which has already 
begin efforts to obtain supplies of those medicines

have had time to assess the damage and determine their needs red 
cross officials said 
we have agreed that just as soon as an assessment is made we 
will begin to supply their needs as we have the ability to do 
schubert said 
in the meantime a 50000 gift has been sent to allow local 
officials to purchase needed goods ms gautier said

be earmarked sovietarmenian earthquake 
donations can be mailed to local chapters or to the american red

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday its bringing more lawsuits than ever 
in the 1988 fiscal year that ended sept 30 the agency turned 
over 372 civil cases to the justice department compared with the 
previous record of 342 civil cases in the 1986 fiscal year there 
were 59 criminal cases in fiscal 1988 compared with 41 in both 1986 
and 1987 
however the agencys administrative orders totaled 3085 down 
slightly from 3194 in the previous year epa said it tried not to 
issue a large number of orders when new school asbestos regulations 
took effect at the start of the year but rather tried to make sure 
school boards understood them 
the agency said state environmental agencies referred 904 civil 
cases to their attorneys general and issued 9363 administrative 
orders both figures were said to be records but the old records 
were not given 
epa said it now had 17 firms on a blacklist of companies barred 
from contracts because of certain air or water pollution violations 
compared with three in january 1986 and had 450 judicial consent 
decrees in effect compared with 200 in 1984 
though the justice department is free to reject cases sent to it 
by epa epa spokeswoman robin woods said the department accepts 
virtually all of them

a judge thursday sentenced three 
black leaders of the countrys biggest antiapartheid group to what 
he called lenient jail terms of 10 and 12 years for treason 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu joined other activists in 
condemning as vicious sentencing at the close of a 
controversial threeyear trial in which the nationwide coalition 
united democratic front was declared a revolutionary organization 
tutu also accused the government of playing games by moving 
jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela to a house on 
a prison farm 
mr mandela is still a prisoner said tutu let the 
government release him and all other political prisoners 
unconditionally then they will see the enormous influence for good 
for peace and reconciliation that he will be 
britains foreign office echoed tutus call saying this would 
open the way for a genuine national dialogue in the context of the 
suspension of violence on all sides 
us ambassador edward perkins was among several diplomats at 
pretoria supreme court in a statement his embassy said the 
sentences were not as harsh as they might have been but 
regrettable because those convicted were men of good will working 
peacefully for a nonracial democracy 
patrick lekota 40 a spokesman for the front was sentenced to 
12 years 10year terms were given to its national secretary popo 
molefe 36 and moses chikane 40 the transvaal province branch 
secretary church field worker thomas manthata 48 was sentenced to 
six years jail also for treason 
seven other defendants were convicted of terrorism six received 
suspended sentences and were banned for two years from talking to 
the press or participating in politics the seventh is to serve five 
years in jail 
supporters in the courtroom raised clenched fists then joined the 
defendants in singing god bless africa anthem of the 
antiapartheid movement 
judge kees van dijkhorst ruled that the united democratic front 
collaborated with the outlawed african national congress to incite 
antigovernment violence in 1984 tutu and more than 900 other 
supporters of the front were named as unindicted coconspirators 
its a vicious sentence said tutu i myself will certainly 
be very very involved in ensuring that i leave no stone unturned in 
overturning that conviction and sentence 
van dijkhorst said the defendants could play a meaningful 
political role in south africa provided that by word and deed they 
forswear the violent option 
i would rather err on the side of leniency said the judge 
because none have been found guilty of planning or executing 
direct violence 
treason and terrorism convictions can draw the death sentence 
defense lawyer george bizos argued for suspended sentences 
noting most defendants had spent three years in prison 
when men differ fundamentally to the government of the country 
the courts must be particularly careful that their punishment is not 
so harsh against those who have seen fit to try to right things that 
they think are wrong he said 
the sentencing came a day after the government transferred 
mandela from a clinic to a house at a prison farm in the scenic 
winegrowing town of paarl northeast of cape town 
it was the first time since 1962 that the 70yearold prisoner 
has lived outside a cell except for hospital stays mandela has 
just recovered from tuberculosis 
mr mandela is not confined to the house and has free use of a 
wide range of facilities the prisons service said thursday 
visits by his immediate family will be unlimited 
mandelas wife winnie is expected to visit her husband over the 
weekend but lawyer ismail ayob said she does not intend taking 
more than the 40minute monthly visits that she had been allowed 
in the past until all political prisoners are given the same 
privileges

canadas aviation safety board blamed iced wings 
for the air disaster that killed 248 us troops three years ago 
but a minority report concluded a fire possibly ignited by 
explosions caused the crash 
the review of the dec 12 1985 crash at gander newfoundland 
published thursday has been plagued by disputes and limited 
evidence 
four of eight board members signed the minority report concluding 
the cause was an inflight fire that may have resulted from 
detonations of undetermined origin 
board chairman kenneth j thorneycroft broke a tie to vote with 
the four other members for a report that found no evidence of 
sabotage a fire or explosion before impact of the arrow air charter 
dc8 
oftenpublic board disputes during the inquiry have led 
opposition politicians to call for a judicial review of the accident 
canadas worst air disaster killed all 256 aboard eight 
american crew members and the soldiers heading home for christmas to 
fort campbell ky from peacekeeping duties in the middle east 
the board report concludes the aircraft stalled at low altitude 
100 seconds after takeoff and recovery was impossible 
the most probable cause of the stall was determined to be ice 
contamination on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing 
it says other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the 
no 4 engine and inappropriate takeoff reference speeds may have 
compounded the effects of the contamination 
the minority opinion found ice contamination was not a factor 
in this accident while it did not conclude terrorism was 
involved it said security arrangements at the flights point of 
origin in cairo egypt were not ideal 
fire broke out on board while the aircraft was in flight 
possibly due to a detonation in a cargo compartment says the 
minority opinion 
the boards report concludes the balance of evidence did not 
support the occurrence of a preimpact fire or explosion either 
accidental or as a result of sabotage 
thorneycroft defended what he told reporters was a fair and 
balanced report produced despite many difficultiesm including 
witnesses caught only a glimpse of the plane as it crashed in 
limited early morning light 
the voice recorder did not capture any conversations or sounds 
in the cockpit and the recorder provided only limited information 
there was little left of the plane 
the board recommended a national safety campaign to ensure all 
pilots are aware of the potential consequences of taking off with 
even minor amounts of ice on the wing 
other suggestions were 
requiring all canadian users of dc8 aircraft to establish 
detailed procedures for detecting ice before takeoff 
a transportation department review of procedures to check 
cockpit voice recorders and possibly similar action in the united 
states 
a change in us federal aviation regulations on flight periods 
and rest provisions for crews 
the boards report found the crews december flight schedule was 
heavy enough to have high potential to produce fatigue but the 
minority opinion said members of the cockpit crew performed their 
duties without apparent fault 
thorneycroft a former deputy commander of the north american 
aerospace defense command in colorado springs colo said there was 
no pressure at all from american authorities to discount 
sabotage as a possible cause 
dc8 manufacturer mcdonnell douglas took part in the 
investigation as well as pratt and whitney which made the engine 
the us army and the us national transportation safety board

france has decided to drop its visa requirement for 
visitors from seven european countries that are not members of the 
european economic community the foreign ministry announced thursday 
government officials have said recently they may also rescind the 
visa requirement for us passport holders but there has been no 
announcement 
citizens of austria sweden norway finland iceland cyprus and 
malta will again be welcome in france without visas as they were 
before emergency measures put in place in september 1986 during a 
wave of terrorist bombings in paris 
this decision was taken in recognition of the reinforcement of 
cooperation in europe on security and the fight against terrorism 
and drug trafficking said a foreign ministry spokesman 
france began demanding visas from people carrying passports of 
all nations except the 11 other members of the eec plus 
switzerland the decision was contested by officials from other 
european countries especially sweden and austria 
other countries affected by the 1986 decision include algeria 
morocco tunisia and other african nations with traditionally close 
ties to france french officials have said they wanted to avoid any 
appearance of a racial criterion with predominantly white countries 
being the only ones exempt from the visa requirement

if federal bureacrats have their way 3 tons of 
edible roasted beef will be destroyed because it might be too chewy 
to live up to the choice grade given by a meat processor 
there are no provisions in us department of agriculture rules 
to let the meat go to a charity even in the spirit of the holiday 
season according to government attorneys 
in a civil lawsuit filed tuesday under the name us v 7007 
pounds of cooked roast beef the usda seeks the forfeiture of the 
504 roasts prepared at max bauer meat packers a wholesale 
distributor supplying other south florida distributors and markets 
inspectors examined the 15 to 18pound roasts last summer and 
found them marked usda choice when they actually should have been 
left ungraded the lawsuit says choice beef sells for 50 to 70 
cents more per pound than ungraded beef 
its just a little more chewy larry dyal a fort lauderdale 
meat distributor said wednesday youd have to be a gourmet to 
tell the difference 
but the usda inspectors found the difference in lab tests and 
ordered the beef some of which had been distributed detained in 
freezers 
the only thing we know is that someone came in inspected it 
and put dont touch on it said bill quirch with e amp g trading 
co in miami 
mike pasano attorney for max bauer dismissed the federal beef 
as a bunch of government nonsense 
weve asked for it back politely he said 
pasano said what his company would do with the meat if it was 
returned depends on the beefs condition quite honestly we have 
concerns and weve expressed them to the federal government that 
theyve held onto it for such a long time 
hell make a formal request for the beef in future filings with 
us district judge leonore nesbitt 
if the usda prevails there are no provisions in the law to let 
the meat be donated to feed the hungry said us attorney dexter 
lehtenin 
some official will go out to the dump and watch it be buried 
said emil thrasher a deputy usda director 
but the prospect of destroying good food astounds harry 
somerville one of the brothers of the good shepherd who operate 
camillus house a downtown miami mission for the homeless 
holy hannah yes he said when asked if his organization 
could put the beef to use were it ever offered you could feed a 
lot of hungry people with that

their top salesman was missing but soviet 
entrepreneurs went ahead thursday with the opening of an 
unprecedented trade show intended to usher in a new era of 
sovietamerican commerce 
as fashion models showed off the latest trends from moscow to the 
beat of american pop music soviet executives showed off their 
wares including furs tractors vodka books toys cars guns and 
caviar 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev had been scheduled to open the 
trade fair which is a showcase for his policy of perestroika or 
economic restructuring but his appearance was scrubbed when he 
decided to return to moscow early because of a catastrophic 
earthquake in armenia 
in his place deputy premier vladimir m kamentsev cut the ribbon 
along with us commerce secretary c william veity 
kamentsev hastily delivered a speech calling for the lowering of 
trade barriers between the united states and the soviet union then 
rushed from the hall to catch a plane to moscow 
verity congratulating the soviets for gorbachevs 
electrifying united nations speech on wednesday also hailed the 
improvement in trade between the two nations 
we believe this is an important step in building longterm 
mutually beneficial nonstrategic trade between the united states 
and the soviet union he said 
the soviets spent an estimated 2 million on the trade show at 
the jacob k javits convention center one measure of the 
importance the soviet union places on increased trade with the 
united states 
you really only do this to someone you want to impress said 
david wolstenholme whose american marketing company spent more than 
a year putting together the show which runs through dec 20 and is 
open to the public 
the soviets want to increase exports to the united states to 
raise their reserves of hard currency which they need to purchase 
goods from the united states and other western nations 
but as kamentsev suggested and the trade show reveals us trade 
barriers make it extremely difficult for soviet enterprises to sell 
their goods in this country 
for instance vil rayevskiy the salesman at a booth offering 
baikal hunting rifles said the soviets have had some success 
selling the guns to european countries but not to the united states 
the main problem and the main obstacle is your very high duty 
for our consumer goods he said 
according to rayevskiy the united states imposes a 60 percent 
duty on the guns whereas gun manufacturers from some countries 
those with mostfavorednation status pay only 10 percent 
how can we compete with them he asked reduce our price to 
zero 
asked why he bothered to come to the show rayevskiy said we 
hope these goods will be interesting to american people and maybe 
there will be some changes in this law 
other soviet enterprises have had more success smoky harrison 
an american spokesman for sovietmade belarus tractors said the 
company has been doubling its sales annually since 1985 and expects 
to sell more than 2000 tractors in the united states this year 
its a basic tractor a basic tool harrison said 
perestroika also has been profitable for us companies that 
operate in the soviet union perhaps the most successful has been 
pepsicola which signed a multimilliondollar agreement thursday to 
expand its trade with the soviet union 
other americans such as jim hickman and peter buckle of los 
angeles have entered joint ventures with soviet enterprises without 
expecting large profits immediately 
hickman and buckle are working with the symbol cooperative in 
moscow to market souvenir tshirts and sweatshirts some examples at 
the trade fair included a sweatshirt bearing the logo of moscow 
state university and one that says summit 89 in russian and 
gorbachevbush in english 
the two said the russian sweatshirts were not up to the quality 
demanded by the us market and high tariffs made them too 
expensive to sell profitably in this country 
still hickman said the longterm soviet market justifies 
their investment 
were in on the cutting edge of perestroika which gives one a 
lot of opportunities as well as being an exciting time added 
buckle

mikhail s gorbachevs hurried return to his 
earthquakestricken nation avoids the specter of pictures of the 
soviet president on a lighthearted sightseeing tour while thousands 
of his countrymen lay dead 
i have to be there he said thursday as he left the united 
states to fly directly home bypassing scheduled visits to cuba and 
great britain 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze underlined the point 
saying despite the fact that all necessary measures are being 
taken to overcome the extremely grave consequences of this disaster 
mikhail gorbachev believes that when the people are suffering he 
has to be there 
gorbachev himself said the earthquake was extremely severe and 
had extremely grave consequences devastation and great loss of 
life so i urgently have to return 
although such decisions are reached in secrecy it was apparent 
the remainder of gorbachevs highly publicized new york stay 
including the opening of a soviet trade show a stroll through 
central park and a museum tour would have contrasted sharply with 
the stark pictures of disaster at home 
and gorbachev whose nationally televised chats with constituents 
have set a new modern style for a soviet leader could hardly 
ignore the situation to do so would have been reminiscent of 
president reagans hesitation in 1983 to return to washington from a 
california vacation after the soviet shootdown of a korean air lines 
passenger jet 
gorbachevs decision also demonstrated his ability to respond 
quickly to events in a country he often complains is bound by its 
own bureaucracy 
barely four hours before the presidents decision was announced 
at a surprise latenight news conference wednesday chief foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov had dismissed any suggestion 
gorbachev might cut short his stay in new york 
although the spokesman acknowledged the situation in the 
earthquakeravaged caucasus was serious and a small village has 
practically disappeared from the face of the earth he told 
reporters that relief efforts were being handled routinely by 
mobilization of the armed forces and physicians he noted it was a 
natural disaster and gave no indication any presidential action was 
necessary or even under consideration 
gorbachev at the time was attending a starstudded reception at 
the united nations at the end of a day marked by his announcement of 
a dramatic military force reduction earlier in the day he had bid 
a friendly farewell to reagan his fourtime summit partner urged 
presidentelect bush not to delay the strengthening of ussoviet 
ties and toured new york for the first time 
a short time later as other members of his entourage were going 
to bed gorbachev instructed his foreign minister to round up 
reporters for the announcement of his imminent return home 
the caucasus calamity took on an added dimension because it 
struck a region that for months has been the scene of ethnic strife 
between armenians and azerbaijanis and more recent nationalist 
demonstrations in shevardnadzes native georgia 
the unrest which has exploded into fatal rioting in several 
azerbaijani cities and sparked massive demonstrations and general 
strikes in armenia has prompted authorities to deploy troops and 
tanks in the streets in some areas tens of thousands of refugees 
have fled their homes in fear 
but despite the military presence gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness also has been evident in the region 
authorities have tolerated dissent and criticism they once would 
have crushed with brutal force

hutton said the couples exams are scheduled to begin around 115 
pm est and conclude around 5 pm est they are slated to travel 
from the maryland hospital to their weekend retreat at camp david 
md afterward 
huttons statement also included a plug for the importance of 
such routine examinations 
the first lady continues to emphasize the importance of 
mammography breast xray for early detection of cancer of the 
breast the mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for 
early detection of a malignancy both the president and the first 
lady have remained completely asymptomatic with no clinical 
suggestion of recurrance hutton said 
the president faces a wider battery of exams than his wife 
huttons statement said reagan will have a colonoscopy a chest 
xray a cat scan a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function 
evaluation 
the first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing 
the surgery a modified radical mastectomy 
physicans involved in the evaluation will include hutton and a 
colleague in the white house medical unit dr martin bacon dr 
bruce lloyd a cardiologist dr thomas walsh a specialist in

in private practice in st paul minn and drs robert and david 
utz of the mayo clinic the statement said 
the elder beahrs is an old friend and associate of mrs reagans 
stepfather the late dr loyal davis of chicago 
in the presidents initial cancer surgery doctors removed the 
twoinch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon as well as 
the surrounding tissue 
since 1985 and up until last january reagan has undergone a 
colonoscopy every six months to check for any recurrence of cancer 
in that procedure a long flexible instrument that uses fiberoptic 
technology is inserted in the large intestine to allow doctors to 
see inside the bowel 
each time doctors found polyps or small fleshy growths and 
removed them in each procedure the polyps were found to be 
noncancerous 
the growths generally cause no serious symptoms but if left 
alone can grow into cancerous lesions such as the one removed in 
1985 
no polyps were found in reagans last colonoscopy conducted last 
january and he did not have such a checkup at the usual sixmonth 
point over the summer 
in january 1987 reagan underwent successful prostate surgery to 
relieve what a spokesman called a mild recurring discomfort 
apparently due to an enlarged prostate gland

white house memorabilia are piling up at ronald reagans alma mater 
tiny eureka college 
about a dozen boxes of assorted trinkets have come in the past 
few weeks and school officials have been notified to expect many 
more presidential odds and ends before reagan leaves office in 
january 
its interesting and exciting and may be just the tip of the 
iceberg said lynn beer director of college relations he knows 
we have a display of his memorabilia so he sends anything he feels 
is suitable 
for now the boxes are piling up in a small storeroom adjacent to 
the office of george hearne school president most are wrapped in 
old washington post newspapers and appear in no particular order 
hearne said reagan had notified the school about three months ago 
that the materials were available and hearne said the school was 
interested 
a small library could be created from the books reagan has 
shipped personal messages of good will abound in autographed books 
by authors such as richard nixon jimmy carter ted kennedy henry 
kissinger ferdinand marcos and even sam donaldson 
one box contains small gifts reagan regularly gave white house 
visitors including a commemorative jar of jelly beans and a 
paperweight made from a piece of cork taken from the oval office 
floor a note says the cork supported six presidents from 193469 
before the floor was replaced 
other items included an inaugural book set and a belt buckle with 
a rodeo cowboy that proclaims the buckaroo stops here 
two of the more unusual items were a pair of cowboy boots 
emblazoned with the presidential seal and a plexiglasenclosed 
wheaties box bearing a photo of the 1988 super bowl champion

armenian communities throughout the united states scrambled to 
collect donations and medical supplies thursday to rush to soviet 
armenia in the wake of an earthquake believed to have killed tens of 
thousands 
international phone lines were flooded by armenian immigrants 
trying to reach relatives and obtain news beyond the sketchy reports 
that up to 50000 people have died and whole villages were wiped out 
by wednesdays temblor 
we cant reach armenia said suren bursalyan editor of the 
armenian biweekly paros in california all of the phone lines are 
shot our only information is american television its really hard 
we would like to know the extent of damage 
in southern california home to the nations largest armenian 
community the western prelacy of the armenian apostolic church 
announced that eight days of mourning would begin friday and that 
area armenian churches would hold special requiem services friday 
and sunday 
at least 250000 armenians the largest concentration outside of 
soviet armenia live in southern california mostly in hollywood and 
glendale 
archbishop datev sarkissian said he like bursalyan had been 
unable to uncover any information to pass on to parishioners 
yesterday i was trying to get in touch with armenia and the 
operator was overrun by the telephone calls he said 
local armenians are in a state of shock they are in a state of 
grief and great pain the archbishop said but a great relief 
operation is being organized by the community to help rebuild the 
cities 
california gov george deukmejian himself of armenian descent 
said as californians we are all too familiar with devastating 
earthquakes although the details are still incomplete we can all 
envision the effect of a reported 69 richter scale earthquake 
centered near cities with populations approaching 1 million each 
a quake of 69 is capable of causing widespread damage in 
addition to armenia the temblor caused extensive damage in georgia 
and the azerbaijan republic in the northern caucasus 
a soviet exchange student attending college in maine did get 
through to her parents she said that the quake while devastating 
had spared her family which lives in the georgian capital of 
tbilisi 
i talked with my parents and i asked is it true or not and 
they answered that it was a very hard earthquake said tamara 
sulukhyia an exchange student at bowdoin college 
hundreds of people telephoned the offices of asbarez a 
glendalebased newspaper catering to the armenian community the 
phones started ringing at 6 oclock this morning said abraham 
boghigian the papers editor right now for us here in los 
angeles obtaining information is very hard 
boghigian said that an affiliated paper in montreal had 
established phone contact with government offices in armenia and 
the sketchy information obtained only listing deaths in the tens 
of thousands would be passed along to readers 
meanwhile archbishop torkom manoogian primate of the eastern 
diocese of the armenian church in america said at a news conference 
at new yorks armenian cathedral that the devastation is heavier 
than we can imagine 
the immediate needs are shelter medical supplies clothing and 
blood he said 
manoogian and a delegation of armenian prelates from around the 
world held the news conference after a onehour meeting with soviet 
officials at the ussr mission to the united nations 
we are asking all people of good will and compassion to 
assist financially manoogian said 
the church is coordinating with other relief agencies such as the 
red cross and the world council of churches to ship doctors nurses 
and supplies to armenia but he had no immediate details to announce 
the boston university school of medicine set up a phone bank to 
coordinate relief locally along with the zoryan institute and other 
armenian organizations there are some 95000 armenians in 
massachusetts

presidentelect bush may be making his first 
serious misstep by prolonging speculation over whether former sen 
john tower will be appointed defense secretary rep les aspin said 
thursday 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
was referring to reports circulating since bushs election last 
month that tower former chairman of the senate armed services 
committee will be named to head the pentagon 
there have been reports that bush and his advisers want to name 
as many as five top pentagon officials at one time including tower 
if tower is named defense secretary he will come into office 
in a weakened condition said aspin speaking in la jolla calif 
at a board meeting of science applications international a copy of 
his speech was released in washington 
for one thing with all that twisting in the wind questions 
will be raised about how much confidence the president has in him 
aspin said 
if what we read is correct tower wont have much of a hand in 
picking the other top figures in the department of defense aspin 
said that means that when he goes into a huddle with his 
officials their playbooks will be full of end runs 
in sum if nominated tower could well enter office already 
wounded he said 
if bush goes ahead with the tower appointment he will need to 
back the former texas senator strongly aspin said 
to recover with john tower mr bush is going to have to make 
it clear his secretary has his emphatic support aspin said 
perceptions on this point are everything 
one of the biggest problems of the bush administration will be 
dealing with the budget particularly pentagon projections that 
large defense spending increases will be needed to pay for programs 
begun earlier aspin said 
in spite of campaign promises to the contrary my guess is that 
zero real growth only enough to offset inflation is the very 
best that the pentagon can hope for he said 
tower also has been the subject of rumors about his personal 
life particuarly following his 1987 divorce from his second wife 
lilla 
the divorce was granted after a legal battle in which she alleged 
tower had committed marital misconduct during their 10year 
marriage towers deposition responding to the charges was sealed by 
agreement of both parties

soviet authorities rushed military surgeons and 
tons of medical supplies thursday into armenia rocked by an 
earthquake that officials said virtually destroyed several cities 
and killed tens of thousands of people 
armenian journalists said a politburo commission led by premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50000 
people died in the wednesday earthquake which measured 69 on the 
richter scale soviet officials reported thousands of people were 
killed but provided no death toll 
president mikhail s gorbachev cut short his trip to the united 
states and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort in 
southern republic which has a population of 33 million 
urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected by 
this terrible tragedy and i have to be there in this effort said 
gorbachev who planned to fly to yerevan after arriving in moscow 
he canceled planned trips to cuba and britain 
president reagan offered emergency humanitarian aid cuban 
president fidel castro pledged to sent construction workers and 
britain dispatched london firefighters to join the rescue effort 
soviet tv showed a clock on a building in the city of leninakan 
on the turkish border near the epicenter of the earthquake stopped 
at 1141 the instant the disaster struck 
the earthquake destroyed twothirds of leninakan armenias 
secondlargest city with a population of 250000 people a tv 
correspondent said 
spitak a town of 16000 about 45 miles away was practically 
erased from the face of the earth the correspondent said 
tass said half the buildings in kirovakan a city of 150000 had 
crumbled 
a special meeting of representatives of all 15 soviet republics 
was called in yerevan the armenian capital on friday to discuss 
disaster relief 
soviet authorities dispatched doctors engineers and food and 
medical supplies to the area and a helicopter bridge was set up 
to ferry the injured northward to hospitals in neighboring soviet 
georgia the tass news agency reported 
tass said 2300 people were hospitalized in yerevan with injuries 
from the quake and that 200 had been hospitalized across the border 
in georgia it did not say how many of the injured were treated 
elsewhere 
for a second night thursday millions of soviet tv viewers saw 
soldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles of 
concrete rubble either by hand or with cranes the disaster 
coverage by the staterun media was unprecedented in its speed and 
scope 
ryzhkov head of an earthquake commission told soviet television 
the main task before authorities is to search the rubble for the 
injured and dead 
he then turned directly toward the camera and made an unusual 
appeal to factory and business officials nationwide not to wait to 
be asked but to start immediately sending heavy cranes helicopters 
and other equipment to the stricken area 
friday and saturday were declared days of mourning in armenia 
soviet tv and the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported from 
leninakan that preliminary estimates were that tens of thousands of 
people were killed 
foreign minister spokesman vadim perfiliev said authorities were 
having difficulty calculating a death toll because communications 
with the region were severed 
he said the foreign ministry was reviewing requests by foreign 
reporters to visit the disaster area but that none had been 
approved 
komsomolskaya pravda said soldiers were working under spotlights 
in the wreckage of a leninakan school it said two sergeants pulled 
the bodies of more than 50 children from the ruins and that only a 
few children had been found alive in the collapsed building 
blood donations were being collected throughout the soviet union 
for quake victims tons of blankets field kitchens tents and 
medicine were pouring into the region tass said 
soldiers were setting up tent cities to house evacuees in the 
devastated regions and restoring electricity and water supplies 
army gen vladimir arkhipov told tass bonfires burned in the 
shattered cities to warm the homeless in the december chill 
the newspaper izvestia reported the population of armenia has 
risen markedly in recent weeks as settlers fled violent ethnic 
strife between armenians who are mostly christian and 
predominantly moslem azerbaijanis 
about 180000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border 
between the two republics in the last three weeks 
the last earthquake in the soviet union with a death toll in the 
thousands was an oct 5 1948 temblor in ashkhabad the capital of 
turkmenia the soviet press acting under gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness recently gave the death toll for the 
ashkhabad quake as 110000 
a quake of 69 on the richter scale is capable of causing 
widespread damage the scale is a measure of ground motion as 
recorded on seismographs every increase of one number means a 
tenfold increase in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an 
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 65

the national institutes of health researcher 
who lost all but three of 130 mice that had been genetically altered 
to carry aids said thursday he hopes their apparently accidental 
death will lead to less drastic guidelines for isolating such 
animals 
maybe thats the silver lining said dr malcolm martin a 
top virologist at the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases 
citing the growing importance of animals in aids research martin 
said the accident underscores the difficulty researchers have with 
acquiring the large numbers of animals they need while at the same 
time operating under strict guidelines to keep the animals from 
escaping 
martin who headed the team that developed the unique strain of 
mice at the laboratory in nearby bethesda md said he got a 
telephone call at 5 am monday telling him most of the mice were 
dead 
by wednesday martin and his assistant concluded that it was a 
freakishly simple accident power was turned off in the building for 
several hours over the weekend for maintance work 
as a result the 30footlong glass and steel tube where the mice 
were housed under tight security lost ventilation and overheated 
the accident came just a few days before martin and his team were 
preparing to begin preliminary experiments on the mice to see how 
various drugs might act in their bodies 
it will take at least four or five months to replenish the mice 
herd from the three survivors martin said 
the elaborate structure designed to keep the aids mice in 
martins view amounted to overkill and made it almost impossible to 
breed the large numbers of mice that would be needed for really 
significant research 
a good number to keep in mind is that it took 500000 
monkees to test and certify the salk and sabin polio vaccines 
said martin if were going to be serious about aids research 
weve got to turn more and more to animals systems 
he said fellow researchers in california are running into the 
same difficulties with breeding the necessary numbers of mice that 
have been altered to duplicate the human immune system a new 
development with tremendous implications for aids research since 
such mice could be injected with the aids virus and then subjected 
to various drug and vaccine testing 
while martins mice carry the genetic marker for the aids virus 
in each cell of their bodies they do not have human immune system 
characteristics like the california mice and thus in some ways are 
not as pure an animal model for aids research as the california 
mice

a task force of local and federal officials is 
being created to help solve the record number of drugrelated 
killings in the nations capital us attorney jay b stephens said 
thursday 
the escalating violence level in this city attributable in 
large part to narcotics trafficking threatens the safety of the 
people stephens said 
so far in 1988 337 people have been slain in washington far 
surpassing the previous oneyear record of 287 killings set in 1969 
police estimate 60 percent of the killings are drugrelated and 
blame the influx of crack a potent highly addictive cocaine 
derivative for many of those slayings 
stephens said he has assigned five senior prosecutors and five 
investigators to probe drugrelated killings prosecutors will 
decide on a casebycase basis whether to seek the death penalty 
which congress approved in the recently enacted drug bill he added 
the district of columbia criminal code does not have a death 
penalty and all cases involving deaths and drugs would be 
prosecuted in federal court stephens office is responsible for 
prosecuting all serious criminal cases in this city of 625000 
district police chief maurice t turner hailed the agreement as 
long overdue the joint effort of homicide detectives and 
seniorlevel prosecutors will help close cases 
stephens said he decided on the plan after investigators told him 
that a variety of organized crime groups are making inroads in the 
citys drug trade 
turner who previously has said that many of the slayings result 
from young entrepreneurs fighting for turf acknowledged the 
importance of the gangs and added that individual dealers may be 
starting to work together 
the police chief also renewed his support for operation clean 
sweep an antidrug program that has produced more than 44000 
arrests since it began in 1986 but at the same time he said drug 
treatment prevention and education programs are needed to solve the 
citys drug epidemic

federal aviation administration and city emergency traffic and fire 
departments were represented at the command center at police 
headquarters 
simonetti thanked all the participants for their cooperation 
we couldnt do it alone he said 
the last flurry of calls that came into the command center 
involved reports of rubbernecking and cars stopped along the 
motorcades route to the airport 
simonetti said motorists apparently slowed down or pulled over to 
the side to catch one last glimpse of gorbachev before he returned 
to the soviet union extra highway patrols were dispatched to keep 
traffic moving 
im glad its all over said jack mulligan of the faa we 
were all scared that something was going to happen 
simonetti said there no major security problems came up during 
the abbreviated visit even though gorbachev caught police by 
surprise when he made two unscheduled stops in midtown manhattan on 
wednesday as he toured the city in his motorcade 
he said there had been 15 bomb threats all unfounded called 
into the 911 emergency number during gorbechevs stay three were 
believed to be directed toward the soviet leader two of them at 
the united nations and one at a location that was not disclosed 
another concern of the command center traffic went as smoothly 
as could be expected according to gregory perrin of the city 
department of transportation 
he said there were periods of gridlock when streets were closed 
for the motorcade but residents appeared to take it in stride 
they did very well in terms of traffic new yorkers proved to 
be road scholars perrin said

says the political prisoners their families and other supporters 
of the mujahedeen or peoples holy warriers have been killed

ouster from the united nations and its replacement with the 
mujahedeen and to ask the general assembly to condemn the current 
regime 
ms shojaei was certain their efforts will help in the long run 
its got to do something maybe not in the short time 
she said but its going to make the situation worse for

nikolai bukharin the russian revolutionary leader 
whose liberal economic blueprints foreshadowed the mikhail s 
gorbachev era probably lost his mind after realizing josef stalin 
was determined to destroy him his widow says 
in what is billed as her first interview with western television 
anna larina bukharin has described to the british broadcasting corp 
the last heartrending days before her husband was arrested tried 
on trumpedup charges and shot in 1938 
he wrote stalin endless letters proving his innocence by 
then he was psychologically unbalanced and i cant say he was by 
this time a person in full command of his mind mrs bukharin said 
in the interview aired wednesday night 
so much had landed on him and on top of it all he had a 
young wife and son who was virtually newborn only 10 months old 
and all of this together had a terrible effect on him she said 
bukharin was a close friend and adviser of vladimir lenin 
founder of the soviet state who died in 1924 stalin became dictator 
in 1929 and bukharin clashed with him over economic policy 
stalin believed in forced collectivization to modernize russia a 
feudal country where 80 percent of the population was agrarian 
bukharin favored a mix of smallscale capitalism and nationalization 
of major industries 
in 1938 bukharin and other senior officials were arrested on 
charges of spying sabotage and plotting to murder lenin they were 
convicted at a show trial and executed the same year buharin was 49 
at the time 
fifty years later on july 9 bukharin and 15 other veteran 
bolsheviks were posthumously rehabilitated and readmitted to the 
communist party in a move indicative of gorbachevs drive to 
exorcize the stalinist ghost from soviet society 
mrs bukharin who is in her mid70s and other soviets recently 
interviewed for the film of bukharin painted a picture of a colossus 
of russian communism and a man of great charm and popular appeal who 
at first could not believe stalin was bent on having him disgraced 
and murdered 
dmitri volkogonov of the institute of military history in moscow 
told how bukharin at one point telephoned stalin and addressing 
him by his nickname said koba do you really believe that i am 
an enemy 
stalin replied nikolai calm down well get to the bottom of 
things and everything will be ok 
during the interview in her moscow apartment mrs bukharin was 
asked why bukharin returned to moscow from paris in 1936 when he was 
in such danger 
speaking in russian through an interpreter she replied 
nikolai didnt have an inkling no 
stalins agricultural policies caused catastrophic famine which 
deeply affected bukharin said his widow 
he used to go to the crimea and see the starving children with 
swollen tummies he used to come to my father and relate it all and 
he even burst out crying it was a terrible episode he was most 
upset by it she said 
but he wept in silence in his own home said professor alec 
nove a glasgow university soviet expert noting in the film that 
there is no record of bukharin ever making his misgivings public 
he was a loyal member of the party and stalin played on 
that nove said with world war ii looming was this the time to 
rock the boat i think bukharin kept silent not only because the 
secret police were hovering on the doorstep but because he felt it 
his duty to keep silent 
bukharin died at age 49 and the location of his grave is 
unknown mrs bukharin spent more than 20 years in exile and prison 
camps separated from her son 
professor anthony kempwelch of nottingham university said the 
past closely relates to the present in the similarities between 
bukharin and gorbachev the soviet president and party leader 
gorbachev is the first intellectual in the politburo since 
bukharin he told the bbc 
that is why the similarities between bukharin and gorbachev are 
most compelling he said 
they have the same supporters both appeal quite directly to an 
educated intelligentsia and to the population at large that wishes 
to be active in advancing itself economically whether peasants or 
workers in order to assist the economy as a whole

following is the text of a statement 
issued thursday by foreign ministers of the 16nation north atlantic 
treaty organization concerning a joint position on reducing 
conventional arms in europe 
1 in their statement conventional arms control the way 
ahead the heads of state and government participating in the 
meeting of the north atlantic council in march 1988 emphasized that 
the imbalance in conventional forces remains at the core of europes 
security concerns we shall be presenting specific proposals at the 
negotiating table to redress this imbalance 
2 we look forward to the early commencement of the two 
negotiations we have proposed one on conventional stability between 
the 23 members of the two military alliances in europe and one on 
confidence and securitybuilding measures among all 35 signatories 
of the helsinki final act 
3 in these negotiations we will be guided by 
the conviction that the existing military confrontation is the 
result not the cause of the painful division of europe 
the principle of the indivisible security of all our nations we 
shall reject calls for partial security arrangements or proposals 
aimed at separate agreements 
the hope that the new thinking in the soviet union will open the 
way for mutual agreement on realistic militarily significant and 
verifiable arrangements which enhance security at lower levels 
4 the major threat to stability in europe comes from those 
weapons systems which are capable of mounting largescale offensive 
operations and of seizing and holding territory these are above all 
main battle tanks artillery and armored troop carriers it is in 
these very systems that the east has such a massive preponderance 
indeed the soviet union itself possesses more tanks and artillery 
than all the other members of the warsaw pact and the alliance 
combined and they are concentrated in a manner which raises grave 
concerns about the strategy which they are intended to support as 
well as their role in maintaining the division of europe 
5 the reductions announced by the soviet union are a positive 
contribution to correcting this situation they indicate the 
seriousness with which the conventional imbalances which we have 
long highlighted as a key problem of european security are now also 
addressed by the soviet government we also welcome the declared 
readiness of the soviet union to adjust their force posture the 
important thing is now to build on these hopeful devlopments at the 
negotiating table in order to correct the large asymmetries that 
will still remain and to secure a balance at lower levels of forces 
for this it will be necessary to deal with the location 
nationality and the state of readiness of forces as well as their 
numbers our proposals will address these issues in the following 
specific ways 
we shall propose an overall limit on the total holdings of 
armaments in europe this limit should be substantially lower than 
existing levels in the case of tanks close to a half this would 
mean an overall limit of about 40000 tanks 
more

stronger hurricanes spawned by global warming 
could cost us insurance companies an extra halfbillion dollars a 
year in wind and hail damage claims an insurance company executive 
said thursday in a discussion of the greenhouse effect 
you dont have to wait until 2030 or 2040 to get a sizable 
increase in claims donald friedman of the travelers insurance co 
said at a conference sponsored by the climate institute 
most hurricane damage is from ocean water surging inland driven 
by the storm and friedman presented no estimate of claims increase 
there 
the institute is a nonprofit group trying to call attention to 
the warming of the earth predicted by many scientists to result from 
the accumulation of heattrapping gases in the atmosphere 
friedman a meteorologist and head of natural hazards research at 
travelers studied 117 years worth of records that estimated the 
tracks of the 240 hurricanes known to have come ashore in that 
period 
using a computer model that assumed the peak surface temperature 
of the caribbean would rise at 09 degrees fahrenheit per decade 
friedman concluded that the hurricane season could begin almost two 
weeks earlier and last almost two weeks longer 
almost all hurricanes happen between june and november mostly in 
august and september the higher ocean temperature would make 
augustseptember storms stronger he said 
damage depends on the strength of a storm and where it hits he 
said but on the average you could get about a 30 percent greater 
damage production potential he said 
what now happens on june 1 could happen on may 20 and what 
happens in the middle of november could happen in early december 
he said 
currently property insurers pay about 1 billion to 15 billion 
a year in wind and hail damage claims from hurricanes with large 
variations from year to year this figure could increase by 30 
percent he said 
in a conference session on tuesday james hansen a climatologist 
with the national aeronautics and space administration quoted one 
estimate that peak hurricane wind speeds could reach 220225 mph 
compared with about 175 mph at present

in our concept of stability no country should be able to 
dominate the continent by force of arms we shall therefore also 
propose that no country should be entitled to possess more than a 
fixed proportion such as 30 percent of the total holdings in 
europe of the 23 participants in each equipment category in the 
case of tanks this would result in an entitlement of no more than 
about 12000 tanks for any one country 
limiting numbers and nationality of forces would not by itself 
affect the stationing of forces on other countries territory 
stationed forces particularly those in active combat units are 
especially relevant to surprise attack we shall propose limits on 
such forces 
our proposal will apply to the whole of europe in order to 
avoid undue concentration of these weapon categories in certain 
areas of europe we shall propose appropriate sublimits 
6 to buttress the resulting reductions in force levels in the 
whole of europe we shall propose stabilizing measures these could 
include measures of transparency notifications and constraint 
applied to the deployment movement and levels of readiness of 
conventional armed forces which include conventional armaments and 
equipment 
7 finally we shall require a rigorous and reliable regime for 
monitoring and verification this would include the periodic 
exchange of detailed data about forces and deployments and the 
right to conduct onsite inspections 
8 greater transparency is an essential requirement for real 
stability therefore within the framework of the csce process the 
negotiations on confidence and securitybuilding measures form an 
essential complement to those on conventional stability we are 
encouraged thus far by the successful implementation of the 
stockholm document and we consider that the momentum must be 
maintained 
9 in order to create transparency of military organization we 
plan to introduce a proposal for a wideranging comprehensive 
annual exchange of information concerning military organization 
manpower and equipment as well as major weapon deployment programs 
to evaluate this information we will propose modalities for the 
establishment of a random evaluation system 
10 in addition in order to build on the success of the 
stockholm document and to create greater transparency of military 
activities we will propose measures in areas such as 
more detailed information with regard to the notification of 
military exercises 
improvements in the arrangements for observing military 
activities 
greater openness and predictability about military activities 
a strengthening of the regime for ensuring compliance and 
verification 
11 finally we shall propose additional measures designed to 
improve contacts and communications between participating states in 
the military field to enhance access for military staffs and media 
representatives and to increase mutual understanding of military 
capabilities behavior and force postures we will also propose 
modalities for an organized exchange of views on military doctrine 
tied to actual force structures capabilities and dispositions in 
europe

12 we will pursue these distinct negotiations within the 
framework of the csce conference on security and cooperation in 
europe process because we believe that a secure peace cannot be 
achieved without steady progress on all aspects of the confrontation 
which has divided europe for more than four decades moreover 
redressing the disparity in conventional forces in europe would 
remove an obstacle to the achievement of the better political 
relationship between all states of europe to which we aspire 
conventional arms control must therefore be seen as part of a 
dynamic process which addresses the military political and human 
aspects of this division 
13 the implementation of our present proposals andof those we 
are making for further csbms confidence and security building 
measures will involve a quantum improvement in european security 
we will wish to agree and implement them as soon as possible in the 
light of their implementation we would then be willing to 
contemplate further steps to enhance stability and security in 
europe for example 
further reductions or limitations of conventional armaments and 
equipment 
the restructuring of armed forces to enhance defensive 
capabilities and further reduce offensive capabilities 
our vision remains that of a continent where military forces only 
exist to prevent war and to ensure selfdefense not for the purpose 
of initiating aggression or for political or military intimidation

light trucks multipurpose vehicles and vans 
would be required to have head restraints like those now used on 
cars under a regulation proposed thursday by the national highway 
traffic safety administration 
head restraints designed to prevent neck injury from whiplash 
during collisions have been required on the front seats of 
passenger cars since 1969 
nhtsa opened a public comment period on the proposal which would 
go into effect sept 1 1991 if adopted the restraints are already 
available for some models of light trucks and vans although they 
are not required by federal regulation 
more and more motorists are using light trucks and vans as 
substitutes for passenger cars said diane steed nhtsa 
administrator studies show head restraints are effective in 
reducing whiplash injuries to frontseat occupants in automobiles 
she said the use of head restraints in light trucks and vans 
could prevent up to 6300 injuries a year 
the restraints are adjustable extensions to the back of the seats 
that keep a passengers head from snapping slightly backward in the 
event of a collision 
nhtsa estimated rearimpact accidents which tend to cause 
whiplash are responsible for 51000 injuries a year to occupants of 
light trucks and vans 
the proposed rule would require the restraints on vehicles with a 
gross weight of 10000 pounds or less 
us manufacturers of light trucks and other vehicles that would 
come under the proposed regulation sold 39 million vehicles this 
year through november up 35 million from the corresponding period 
in 1987 
nhtsa estimated the regulation would on average add 2920 to the 
cost of a vehicle 20 for the head restraint and 920 in extra 
fuel to move the additional seven pounds of weight 
approximately 3 million vehicles would be affected by the 
proposed regulation for a total cost of 876 million per year 
nhtsa said 
general motors corp has installed such restraints on some of its 
models the company said from its washington office 
gm safety liaison dick humphrey was unable to say whether the 
company supported opposed or was neutral on the issue 
we will comment on it to nhtsa and give it our best shot 
he said 
a spokeswoman for ford motor co barbara mansfield said in 
washington the company would have no comment until it had seen the 
proposed rule ford models having captains chairs seats in 
vans which swivel have the head restraints as standard equipment

woodward is an assistant managing editor and investigative 
reporter for the washington post

more than 50 young jews with torches and israeli 
flags marched thursday to the temple mount to demand free jewish 
access and removal of the dome of the rock one of islams holiest 
shrines 
some day it will be blown up and well throw out all the 
arabs said 17yearold shlomo boxer a demonstrator who carried 
an uzi machine gun on his shoulder this is a holy place for jews 
and it belongs to us 
the temple mount which moslems call the noble enclosure is 
sacred to both jews and moslems jews pray regularly at the western 
wall or wailing wall it is believed to be the last remnant of 
the second temple destroyed by the romans 2000 years ago 
the demonstrators members of a rightwing group called the 
temple mount faithful protested a law requiring israelis to gain 
police permission before praying on the mount where the dome of the 
rock shrine sits near the al aqsa mosque moslems believe the 
prophet mohammed ascended to heaven at the dome of the rock 
the law is intended to prevent religious friction between jews 
and moslems in this city that israel captured in the 1967 middle 
east war and later declared its capital 
the arabs can carry palestinian flags inside but jews cant go 
in and pray when we want said danny cohen 17 referring to 
antiisraeli protests that sometimes take place on the temple mount 
the arabs shouldnt make the rules 
gershon solomon founder of the group led the flagwaving 
procession protesters wore tshirts emblazoned with nationalistic 
slogans and chanted israel is not for arabs 
police would not allow the group to enter until the demonstrators 
put aside the flags and agreed to wear their tshirts inside out an 
officer at the scene who would not give his name said police 
feared the flags and shirts would create disturbances among arab 
worshipers 
solomon later told cheering supporters through a bull horn that 
the government should completely open the temple mount to jews he 
told reporters the dome of the rock built in the seventh century 
should be dismantled and moved to a more suitable place 
this is the heart of the jewish people he said 
police barred reporters from the site and would not allow in more 
than 10 demonstrators at once they said there were no disturbances 
soldiers and police in riot gear watched as protesters danced in 
circles and lit torches for hanukkah the jewish festival of lights 
i want to show im not afraid to be in my country said haim 
arbel 17 of tel aviv all of this land belongs to us

residents of the old city also said people shouted allahu 
akbar or god is great a traditional rallying cry of moslems

purpose and identity among the 15 million palestinians of the 
occupied lands

burned tires in sporadic acts of defiance thursday about 20 
palestinian youths were seen lobbing rocks from a barricaded alley

are firebombs perhaps even less

george bush and michael dukakis put on a 
blizzard of lastminute campaign spending for a combined total of 
338 million in the final days of their presidential contest 
financial disclosure forms showed thursday 
dukakis outspent his republican rival by more than 2 million in 
the last 2 weeks but he ultimately failed to stop bushs march to 
victory 
their financial reports filed with the federal election 
commission covered the period from oct 20 to nov 28 including 
bills that were paid off after the nov 8 election 
dukakis who won only 10 states and the district of columbia 
poured out 18 million for his last stand much of it going into a 
tv campaign that featured the democratic governor of massachusetts 
talking to the camera in an intimate manner designed to make him 
seem less rigid 
in the preceding month dukakis had spent 104 million 
the price tag for bushs final push came to 158 million as he 
put on his own barrage of commercials and zigzagged across the 
country campaigning in battleground states 
dukakis showed 425 million in net spending for the entire 
campaign bushs 453 million 
the net expenditures reflect actual spending on the campaign not 
including such reimbursable costs as payment for charter plane seats 
used by the traveling press corps 
dukakis campaign treasurer robert farmer said thursday the 
democrats have no reason to feel badly about spending so much money 
and not winning more states 
we have nothing to be ashamed of he said it was a very 
negative campaign and we probably werent prepared for that and we 
could have responded earlier 
still farmer said dukakis ran close in several states he did 
not win and made a far better showing than democratic nominee 
walter mondale who won only his home state of minnesota and the 
district of columbia four years ago 
we are very proud he said in a telephone interview 
farmer noted that in addition to the spending by the dukakis 
campaign itself the democratic national committee raised a record 
68 million for the election he said this created a level playing 
field for the first time with the traditionally better heeled 
republican national committee 
the 380000 people who gave money to the dnc demonstrated there 
was a lot of commitment to the democratic party and to michael 
dukakis farmer said 
each candidate received 46 million from the federal treasury to 
pay for their campaigns the money comes from the voluntary 1 
checkoff on individual income tax returns 
both campaigns showed receipts and expenditures in excess of that 
amount due to differing accounting practices 
bush borrowed startup money from the separate fund that is used 
to pay for legal and accounting compliance with federal election 
law in dukakis case it reflected his compliance fund reimbursing 
his campaign committee for such legal and accounting expenses said 
accountant mary wong 
dukakis still had bills of 17 million with 4 million 
available in the bank to pay them off and another 4 million in 
receivables 
bush had 807155 in cash on hand with bills of 764597 and 
911667 owed to the campaign

police investigating the nations worstknown 
serial murder case reaped bushels of new clues as thousands of 
people called in tips during a nationwide television show on the 
green river killings 
at least two callers claimed to be the person who has killed at 
least 40 young women in the northwest since 1982 but police were 
unsure whether either call was authentic 
more than 16000 calls were logged wednesday and phones 
continued ringing thursday in response to the show about the green 
river and other serialmurder cases while investigators began 
placing the crime tips in order of priority 
what were considered to be 1500 good tips had been logged by 
noon thursday said king countys green river task force spokesman 
dan nolan he said he didnt know exactly how many calls had come in 
by then 
by midnight wednesday 1100 interesting tips had been culled 
from a total of 16540 calls nolan said he didnt know how many 
pertained specifically to green river 
if we dont solve a couple of murders out of this ill just be 
astounded said bob evans commander of the countys green river 
task force 
an estimated 50 million people in the united states and canada 
watched wednesday nights twohour show which producers called the 
most ambitious manhunt tv project ever undertaken it was 
syndicated to tv stations in 150 metropolitan markets by lexington 
broadcasting of new york 
police have made no arrests since finding the first victims in 
the green river south of seattle the murderer is blamed for killing 
40 women most linked to prostitution and street life another eight 
missing women are listed as potential victims 
montgomery denied that the movie was a lastditch effort to solve 
the murder case before further staff cuts are forced in the county 
task force already pared to 13 from a onetime high of 40 people 
but he said authorities hope the movie approach one which has 
probably never been tried before will give investigators the 
crucial clue a reward of 100000 has been offered for information 
leading to the killers arrest 
the response has been absolutely incredible said lou gorfain 
of new screen concepts of new york executive producer of manhunt 
a chance to end the nightmare 
there werent surprisingly that many crank calls 
seventy law enforcement officers from across the country trained 
to evaluate the informations usefulness staffed 50 telephone lines 
during the show some will remain as long as calls come in 
regularly montgomery said 
included was an investigator from san diego where 38 women have 
been killed since 1985 in a case sharing several similarities with 
the green river case no definite link however has been 
established between the two 
two men claimed to be the green river killer in calls to the 
television studio in seattle and to a tv station in san diego evans 
said 
the california call was taunting saying yes i did it and 
youll never catch me evans said adding that it probably was a 
crank 
the seattle caller was an adult male very calm voice claiming 
to be the killer and agreeing to mail us some photographs and maps 
to lead us to other bodies evans said 
calls couldnt be traced because of the nationwide tollfree 
number that was used and because crime stoppers guarantees 
anonymity to its tipsters evans said 
the tv special was sponsored by crime stoppers an organization 
founded 12 years ago to help police through radio and television 
broadcasts depicting unsolved crimes 
with all the leads that came in for the crimes it proves the 
crime stoppers format works said dan fine publicity chairman for 
seattleking county crime stoppers i think it touched a lot of 
peoples hearts people were riveted to their tv sets 
the program was especially difficult for families of victims to 
watch 
i felt exactly like i did the day they came to my house and 
told me said suzanne villamin whose 25yearold daughters 
remains were found in 1984 it feels like something inside just 
died sometimes i wish i would die so i can be with my daughter 
every time i saw my daughters picture on the wall in the 
television program it became very hard said marilyn harrison 
whose missing daughter kase ann lee is a suspected green river 
victim but i felt it was necessary for me to watch 
if theres a chance to find the monster maybe this is the only 
thing that will do it

the state supreme court turned down an 
appeal thursday from 10term democratic rep bill chappell seeking 
to throw out votes from a county that cost him the election 
in a unanimous opinion the court ruled flagler county election 
officials substantially complied with a deadline for reporting 
election results but chappell still has not conceded 
chappell will read the opinion before deciding whether to appeal 
said press secretary kay thomas 
republican craig james a deland attorney and political newcomer 
defeated chappell by 791 votes in final certified results of the 
recounted nov 8 election 
chappell asked the florida court to invalidate the flagler county 
votes claiming county election officials didnt submit returns to 
state officials within a sevenday deadline of the election 
had the court agreed chappell would have won by 229 votes 
the justices said flagler election officials substantially 
complied with the deadline by telephoning the results before the 
deadline they noted the results were then transmitted by facsimile 
machine one day later 
justice parker lee mcdonald writing for the court said to throw 
out the flagler results would deny voters in that county their 
constitutional rights 
there has been substantial and perhaps complete compliance 
he wrote chappell has presented no compelling reason for 
disenfranchising the 11000 residents of flagler county who cast 
their ballots on nov 8 
chappell had been hampered during the campaign by persistent 
reports that he was part of a probe into contract mismanagement by 
the pentagon no charges have been filed 
meanwhile gov bob martinezs general counsel peter dunbar 
said he has no plans to recommend sanctions against flagler 
elections supervisor etta peterson 
after an investigation earlier this year into illegal wiretapping 
in her office mrs peterson entered a deferredprosecution 
agreement with the state attorneys office that said she will not be 
prosecuted if she doesnt break any laws 
she was accused of taping telephone conversations in the summer 
of 1987 of a man she thought might run against her as part of the 
agreement she wrote the man an apology

presidentelect bush promised black republican 
loyalists thursday that they will be pleased with his 
appointments over the long run but he refused to be specific about 
naming blacks to his cabinet they said 
we have great hopes said joshua smith one of 60 black 
republicans who met with bush and vice presidentelect dan quayle 
for about 40 minutes to discuss jobs and policy issues important to 
blacks 
we have confidence he is going to follow through on his 
promise 
smith of rockville md said the blacks expressed their concern 
that bush has yet to name a black to one a highlevel job 
obviously that concern did come up smith said his 
response was that we will over the term be pleased he did not make 
any specific commitments as to numbers and individuals 
the session between bush and his gop supporters was friendly and 
without rancor members of the group said 
arthur fletcher a businessman from washington and a former 
official in the nixon and ford administrations said one of the 
tragedies of the moment right now is that the bush people would 
have to look all over the place to find qualified black 
republicans for good jobs 
the gop he said needs to lure more blacks into the fold 
bush told the blacks that he meant what he said about wanting 
to be a president for all the people and he promised to carry out 
his campaign pledge to speak out against the remaining vestiges of 
prejudice and bigotry and whatever 
bush told the group about his telephone call to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev earlier in the day in which he offered 
condolences for the horrible disaster situation caused by an 
earthquake in soviet armenia 
the very good meeting between bush president reagan and 
gorbachev in new york on wednesday was marred only by the 
earthquake bush said the disaster put a cloud and a damper on 
the visit at the end he said gorbachev cut short his trip to the 
united states to return to the soviet union 
reagan and other us officials offered us aid if needed and 
bush said the american people will want to hold out their hands to 
those families who lost loved ones 
nobody really knows the numbers of people killed but i had an 
opportunity to tell him how strongly barbara and i feel in human 
terms about that loss bush said 
the blacks gave bush a standing ovation as he entered the room 
where they had been engaged in a questionandanswer session with 
vice presidentelect dan quayle also attending the meeting was lee 
atwater whom bush has recommended as the next chairman of the 
republican national committee 
spokeswoman sheila tate said bush would be soliciting the 
advice from black leaders on people to serve in all levels of 
government on friday the vice president will meet with benjamin 
hooks head of the naacp 
in advance of thursdays meeting les range a black businessman 
from jackson miss said he was disappointed no blacks had been 
tapped so far 
i want to make sure there are blacks in the cabinet range 
said but the way things are shaping up theres not much left 
bush has made almost a dozen highlevel appointments including 
nine that have cabinet status among those selected are one woman 
carla hills named as the us trade representative and one 
hispanic holdover education secretary lauro cavazos 
if no blacks are placed at the head of cabinet agencies range 
said he will urge bush to name them to subcabinetlevel jobs 
bush he said is sensitive to the needs of minorities 
several blacks have been mentioned for visible jobs in the new 
administration for instance dr louis w sullivan president of 
the morehouse school of medicine in atlanta is under consideration 
for secretary of health and human services 
sullivan said he has told bush transition aides that he was 
interested in the no 1 job at that department but not in the second 
job 
robert woodson a black businessman from north carolina is also 
in the running for secretary of housing and urban development but 
the leading prospect seems to be rep jack kemp rny 
alan keyes a former state department official who ran 
unsuccessfully for the us senate in maryland this year was 
thought to have a shot at becoming un ambassador instead that 
position was given to thomas pickering a career diplomat who has 
served as ambassador in el salvador israel nigeria and jordan 
pickering played a minor role in the irancontra affair while he 
was in el salvador he testified before congress that he had 
assisted in arranging a secret donation of more than 1 million to 
the nicaraguan contras at the time the united states was prohiited 
from aiding the rebels 
tate dismissed questions about pickerings role all of the 
questions that have been raised have been reviewed there is 
nothing remotely illegal she said 
bush his voice hoarse because of a cold made his comments on 
the armenian earthquake at a picturetaking session for the 
unveiling of the inaugural license plate he attached the red white 
and blue plate with the no 1 on it to his black limousine

the first lady wanted reagan to see the house before the deal 
was closed mrs crispen said in response to a reporters question

accompanied by a motorcade consisting of more than a dozen vehicles 
including a van containing secret service agents armed with

the reagans decided last march to lease rather than buy the 
25 million estate it is located in the luxurious bel air district 
and is owned by wall management services a group of about 20 
friends of the reagans who bought it with them in mind 
the threeyear agreement gives the reagans the option to renew 
the lease or purchase the property the estate includes 1 acres of 
ground and a secluded house with 6500 feet of living space and a 
pool 
wall management bought the estate on aug 21 1986 from a 
90yearold woman who the investors said would lease it back from 
them until the reagans were ready for it

attorney general dick thornburgh on thursday 
characterized as deplorable the greek justice ministers 
explanation for freeing a suspected terrorist in a 1982 attack on a 
rome synagogue 
thornburgh met in athens with greek justice minister vasos rotis 
to express the us governments deep concern over the decision to 
free abdel osama zomar the justice department said in a statement 
released in washington 
zomar a 27yearold palestinian was expelled to libya after 
serving a sentence in greece for smuggling arms he is suspected of 
membership in the abu nidal terrorist group and allegedly helped 
organize the attack on romes main synagogue 
the italian government had sought zomars extradition from greece 
to prosecute him for the attack which killed a 2yearold child and 
injured 37 other people 
rotis had justified his freeing of zomar by calling his attack on 
the synagogue an act of freedom according to the justice 
department statement 
i told the minister that this explanation was deplorable 
thornburgh said 
on wednesday the justice department filed additional documents 
with the greek supreme court as part of an effort to extradite 
another suspected palestinian terrorist mohammed rashid 
rashid has been accused in the united states with the 1982 
bombing of a pan american world airways airliner that killed a 
15yearold boy and wounded 15 others 
rashid was arrested last may in athens on other charges 
the justice department statement quoted thornburgh as saying 
rotis told him only that freeing zomar would not serve as precedent 
for the us extradition request for rashid

some of atlantas homeless have found themselves 
in a catch22 because two shelters including the citys largest 
wont admit them without photo identification such as a drivers 
license 
drivers licenses carry home addresses something homeless 
people dont have 
jay coppock director of the 350bed salvation army shelter 
estimated that between 20 and 25 people who lack identification are 
turned away each night 
the salvation army shelter and the 25bed gospel light rescue 
mission admit homeless people with a state or international drivers 
license a passport an employee photo id or some stateissued 
identification 
salvation army officials said military discharge papers or a 
birth certificate with an embossed seal and a social security card 
are also acceptable 
coppock said his shelter requires the photo identification to 
prevent homeless people from using multiple ids to escape the 7 
nightly fee for staying at the shelter more than one night the 
first night is free 
he added that identification is crucial in finding housing and 
work 
people come back time and time again and expect a handout 
coppock said our job is to get these people back into society and 
to make them contributing individuals 
gospel light spokesman roger clark said homeless people without 
identification are allowed to eat but cannot spend the night at the 
shelter 
advocates for the homeless are outraged 
the practice doesnt go on in any other city in america that i 
know of said mitch snyder a national advocate for the homeless 
in washington dc this is what goes on in south africa why 
not demand that people have an apartment before they come into 
shelters 
it does no good to teach somebody a lesson if theyre going to 
be dead on the streets next week said keith summa project 
director of the national coalition for the homeless 
if all the shelters went to this we would be in a mess said 
jim beaty executive director of atlantas task force for the 
homeless we assume places like the salvation army have good 
reasons for asking for id although we do not want anyone to remain 
cold and hungry because they dont have a photo id 
coppock said there are exceptions to the identification policy 
which has been in effect for years if someone has gotten mugged 
and has no id or is dropped off by the police or referred through 
another agency and we can verify it we will work with them he 
said 
in freezing temperatures he added we pretty much let in as 
many people as we can 
jd coleman spokesman for the state department of public 
safety said a state photo id can be obtained for 450 plus a 
reasonable form of id

trapped in the ruins of a destroyed hospital about 9500 people 
were killed in that quake 
in that disaster people were being removed from the debris a 
week after the earthquake said londong fire brigade officer paul 
quick 
the swiss disaster relief corps offered to send rescue experts 
and search dogs to help locate earthquake victims a spokesman said 
the government agency had not received a reply by thursday 
afternoon the spokesman said on condition of anonymity he said 
turkey which suffered less damage from the quake than the soviet 
union declined a similar offer 
in havana cuban president fidel castro offered to send a 
contingent of construction workers to help rebuild areas devastated 
by the temblor 
castro made the offer in a message to gorbachev who was to have 
begun a threeday visit to cuba on friday but cut short his trip in 
new york to return home to deal with the crisis 
president reagan told gorbachev before the soviet leader returned 
to moscow if there is any way we can be of assistance either 
bilaterally or through the international community please let me 
know 
later reagan was asked whether he expected the united states to 
be providing assistance they havent asked for any yet he 
replied 
the united states will be providing antibiotics and other 
medicines said richard f schubert president of the american red 
cross in washington 
soviet officials have airlifted in about 15 tons of blankets 
tents first aid kits schubert said armenia at this point in 
the year is pretty cold and so there is a critical need for 
emergency shelter 
the red cross has activated a tollfree number for people to call 
to offer assistance the number is 18004539000

a federal court thursday barred the agriculture 
department from randomly testing 755 employees for illegal drug use 
without a reasonable articulable suspicion of an individuals 
onthejob impairment 
the preliminary injunction issued by us district judge thomas 
flannery blocks usda from forcing the employees to submit to random 
testing of their urine to spot illegal drug use under president 
reagans initiative for a drugfree workplace 
the action came in response to lawsuits by two employees unions 
representing 750 animal disease and plant inspectors and five 
computer operators and drivers at usdas food and nutrition service 
flannery ruled that the government could not justify the 
intrusive search of the employees noting that the number of 
drugrelated incidents in the past five years is infinitesimal 
when compared to the number of employees at usda 
while the court acknowledges that random drug testing might 
deter drug use the fundamental values of individual liberty and 
privacy embodied in the fourth amendment cannot be sacrificed for 
the sake of mere effficiency flannery said 
the governments interest in assuring a drugfree workplace 
fails to offset the increased intrusion into the legitimate 
expectations of privacy of the employees subject to the proposed 
testing flannery said 
but the judge ruled that the reagan administration could require 
employees suspected of drug abuse on the job to undergo testing 
such testing could only be conducted following a reasonable 
articulable and individualized suspicion that a specific employee 
may be under the influence of illegal drugs flannery said 
last summer another federal judge in washington cited the same 
fourth amendment considerations in enjoining the justice department 
from randomly testing many of its employees 
that case like several others involving random drug testing of 
government workers is on appeal 
a federal appeals court last month indicated it might rule in 
favor of random drug testing of government workers whose jobs 
directly affect the safety of others notably pilots air traffic 
controllers and civilian guards at munitions depots 
those cases are still being reviewed by the appeals court here 
the supreme court meanwhile is reviewing drug testing of us 
custom service employees and railroad crews involved in accidents 
but flannery said neither safety nor security was a justification 
for testing the usda employees in the program at issue 
flannery also rejected arguments that drugtesting was necessary 
to protect the integrity of the plant and animal disease inspection 
program the inspectors who check plants and animals at border 
checkpoints are administrative employees not law enforcement 
officers 
they do not carry weapons and are not authorized to make 
arrests flannery said 
the three drivers at the food and nutrition service do not have 
special licenses to operate shuttle buses and the two computer 
operators deal with records of the foodstamp program flannery 
noted 
the court notes initially that the sensitive computer 
information at issue here does not relate to our national security 
while in no way denigrating the importance of the war against 
poverty the information at issue here is of a different and less 
compelling degree entirely 
flannerys ruling was made on lawsuits by the national treasury 
employees union and the national association of agricultural 
employees the decision was released as usda employees at the us 
forest service filed suit to challenge random drug testing 
usda officials could not be reached to comment on the decision

former white house aide lyn nofziger told 
president reagan he wouldnt accept a presidential pardon for 
ethicslaw convictions because he wants to be vindicated in the 
courts his lawyer said thursday 
at the same time white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that first lady nancy reagan was given to understand that 
another former reagan aide michael k deaver had discussed a 
pardon with someone in the white house 
deaver however said he never had discussed a pardon for his 
three perjury convictions with the president the first lady or any 
government official 
nofziger wrote a letter to the president a number of weeks 
ago to state his refusal to accept any pardon that might be 
contemplated before reagan leaves office next month said defense 
attorney e lawrence barcella 
he happens to be an honorable guy who strongly believes in his 
innocence and consequently felt that his vindication should come 
through the courts and not through the president barcella said 
it was something purely on his own initiative barcella said 
of nofzigers letter 
nofziger 63 is free on bond while appealing a 90day sentence 
and 30000 fine he received earlier this year for three felony 
ethicslaw convictions 
he was found guilty of lobbying former reagan administration 
colleagues on behalf of private clients after he resigned in early 
1981 as white house political director he was convicted of 
violating the oneyear ban on lobbying by former officials after 
leaving office 
reagan repeatedly has ruled out a pretrial pardon for former 
white house aide oliver north who is one of four people under 
indictment in the irancontra affair the president last week said 
even considering such a pardon would leave them under a shadow of 
guilt for the rest of their lives i think the law has got to take 
its course 
nofziger who likened his offense to running a stop sign has 
repeatedly professed his innocence and criticized the ethics in 
government act for not imposing lobbying restrictions on former 
members of congress as well as officials of cabinet agencies 
a federal appeals court that heard arguments on the case nov 22 
appeared receptive to arguments by nofzigers attorneys that the 
conviction should be overturned because prosecutors didnt prove a 
willful violation of the law 
members of the threejudge panel questioned whether the statute 
provided a clear warning to former officials of what would 
constitute illegal lobbying 
barcella said nofziger wrote reagan before the appellate panel 
heard arguments in the case 
deaver the former deputy white house chief of staff said in 
response to a reporters question i have never discussed a pardon 
with the reagans either or them and i dont have any intention 
to 
deaver was given a suspended threeyear sentence fined 100000 
and ordered to perform 1500 hours of community service for lying to 
congress and a grand jury investigating his lobbying business for 
possible ethicslaw violations he is appealing the three felony 
convictions 
deaver also denied raising the pardon issue in discussions or a 
letter to anyone in government i never wrote anybody a letter 
about a pardon 
deaver refused to further discuss the issue of a pardon

commission entered its order allowing a 147 percent projected rate

government affairs said in a telephone interview that his company 
had cooperated with the fbi investigation and that ward had been 
retained to help reach a settlement

bought and he added that united gas has had several owners since 
the settlement was reached and could not comment on the indictments 
we had no knowledge of any illegal activity at the time the 
lawsuit was settled mpampl spokesman jim moore said he would not say 
whether any public service commissioner ever told the utility its 
rate increase wouldnt be approved unless it settled the lawsuit 
against united gas pipeline

andrei sakharov wrapping up his first visit to the 
united states thursday said mikhail gorbachevs speech to the 
united nations should strengthen the general secretarys position in 
the soviet union 
however the 67yearold physicist and nobel peace laureate 
warned that gorbachevs political restructuring known as perestroika 
cannot yet be called irreversible 
sakharov also called for an international effort to aid victims 
of the massive earthquake that hit soviet armenia on wednesday tens 
of thousands of people are believed dead 
with his stepdaughter as an interpreter the dissident said the 
united states has vast experience with disaster relief and expressed 
hope that soviet authorities would allow international volunteers 
into the stricken areas 
since arriving in the united states nov 4 sakharov has visited 
with relatives undergone medical testing promoted a new 
international organization and met with president reagan in 
washington 
he boarded a 640 pm flight from logan international airport 
for paris where he plans to attend a celebration of the 40th 
anniversary of the united nations universal declaration of human 
rights he said he may meet in paris with polish solidarity leader 
lech walesa 
in his wellreceived speech to the united nations wednesday 
gorbachev offered to cut the red army by 10 percent and withdraw 
50000 soviet troops from eastern europe 
sakharov said i believe that gorbachev has taken a very 
important initiative and that this will broaden international 
support for him and therefore strengthen his position in the soviet 
union 
however sakharov repeated a sentiment often voiced during his 
trip that gorbachevs plan of political and economic restructuring 
faces some serious obstacles 
i believe that the process of perestroika is now in a very 
critical phase he said there are a whole spectrum of serious 
problems the economic restructuring is especially complex my 
country is in a stage of searching for solutions and this period 
could last a long time 
sakharov who won the 1975 nobel peace prize for his human rights 
activities was exiled to the closed industrial city of gorky in 
january 1980 for his criticism of the soviet military intervention 
in afghanistan he was released in december 1986 
he received a visa to visit the united states as a member of the 
soviet delegation to the international foundation for the survival 
and development of humanity a nonprofit organization that plans to 
sponsor research on global problems such as hunger arms control 
pollution and energy conservation 
sakharov came to the united states without his wife yelena 
bonner who remained in moscow he spent much of his time visiting 
her daughter and soninlaw in the boston suburb of newton

where i was born and i want to live there he said

the founder of a fundamentalist 
christian college said thursday he will appeal the states decision 
to bar his school from granting masters degrees in science as 
motivated by an anticreationist bias 
dr henry morris president of the private san diegobased 
institute for creation research said the college has granted 
graduate degrees in science for seven years and never had a problem 
with state education authorities 
he said he will file an appeal with the council on private 
postsecondary institutions the 15member state panel reviewing the 
decision next month 
at that point morris said we will decide whether to take 
it to the courts or not 
california schools superintendent bill honig announced wednesday 
that the state education departments licensing agency ordered the 
institute to stop offering masters degrees in science declaring 
that the classes offer students religious dogma instead of 
scientific theory 
a report of the agencys decision which received little 
attention when it was made last week was carried in thursdays 
editions of the new york times 
since 1981 12 students have obtained master of science degrees 
at the college and about 30 to 40 are currently pursuing 
similar graduate studies morris said we are a very small 
operation he added 
everybodys agreed that they have the right to teach the course 
they agree to that and we agree to that they say they want to 
issue a degree in science but they say creationism is science we 
dont honig said 
the question here is whether we let them call it science or 
not he added i assume it the curriculum is good creationism 
but can you say that a person there has a degree in physics or 
geology 
when you believe the world is 6000 years old its pretty 
tough to get a degree in geology 
in a related development thursday the policy and planning 
committee of the state board of education postponed action on 
proposed antidogmatism guidelines for science teaching 
the guidelines make a distinction between theory and belief and 
fact and they get into definitions as they relate to the teaching 
of the origins of life said susan lange a spokeswoman for honig 
the goal of the guidelines she added is to ensure that dogma 
is not presented as fact or scientific evidence the board is 
expected to consider the issue again next month 
at issue in the degree dispute honig and morris said is the 
philosophical gap between those who accept the biblical version of 
the divine creation of the earth and those who contend that life 
evolved over millions of years 
the states decision stemmed from an inspection of the college in 
august by a state panel of five scientists who decided after 
consulting with honig that religious theory was being taught not 
science 
honig has the authority to affirm or reject the decision of the 
council on private postseconday institutions on morris appeal if 
rejected morris can appeal to an administrative law judge then 
appeal through the court system 
state rejection of the masters of science degree means that 
graduates cannot claim in applications for jobs financial 
assistance or other colleges that they have completed a science 
curriculum 
it also means that the course would not satisfy state 
professional credentialing requirements for example for a 
teachers credential honig said 
major colleges and universities in california are accredited 
through recognized national or regional academicstandards groups 
smaller schools such as technical or business colleges require 
approval from the state school superintendent to grant degrees 
in 1986 the legislature and governor tightened the states 
credentialing laws requiring numerous small schools including the 
institute for creation research to apply to the state for permission 
to grant degrees

president reagan said thursday night the 
hardest part of his job has been to send young americans into 
combat and the thing he enjoyed the most was the economic 
recovery 
i think there have been many tough things the president said 
when asked at what may have been his final news conference to 
describe what had made him feel good and what had made him feel 
badly 
i dont think theres anything tougher than to have to order 
these magnificent young men and women in our military today into 
danger to order them to go someplace where their lives are 
threatened and their lives are taken he said thats got to be 
something that any president would hesitate on and have to say was 
the greatest burden 
in response to another question asked later in the 33minute 
nationally broadcast news conference reagan added that the taking 
and holding of americans as hostages in lebanon was one of the 
heaviest burdens he has borne 
it is again one of those things that you go to bed with 
every night he said when asked about prospects for winning the 
release of nine americans held by proiranian elements in lebanon 
during reagans presidency more than 200 us military personnel 
were killed during a bombing of a marine barracks in beirut 
lebanon 19 servicemen were killed when several thousand troops were 
sent into combat during the invasion of grenada and 37 crewmen 
aboard the uss stark were killed when their ship was struck by 
missiles fired by an iraqi fighter while it was patrolling the 
persian gulf 
when asked what he most enjoyed about the presidency reagan 
replied that there are a number of things to miss 
but reagan said let me simply say one i enjoyed the most is the 
economic recovery 
when i came here for almost half a century the debate on the 
capitol hill in the congress had always been between more big 
spending programs more power for the federal government more 
intervention in private affairs by the federal government as 
against those who were preaching less he said 
we were in a disastrous situation when we came here reagan 
said

questions on ussoviet relations dominated 
president reagans nationally broadcast news conference on thursday 
and he voiced both admiration and respect for soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev a day after their final meeting as leaders 
reagans first complimentary mention of his soviet counterpart 
came in his opening statement as he characterized gorbachevs hasty 
return home prompted by the devastating earthquake in armenia as 
a sad final note to what has been an otherwise successful and i 
use the next words advisedly happy and historic visit to the 
united states 
the president also mentioned that he had given gorbachev an 
inscribed photo of the walk they had taken together in geneva in 
1985 reagan said he and his wife nancy were delighted the 
gorbachevs had invited them to moscow and that he hoped the 
gorbachevs could come visit them in california 
reminded of his earlier stern criticism of soviet leaders and the 
soviet system reagan said there were differences in recent soviet 
leaders but i must say i have never met with one of those 
leaders that was comparable to this man or had the approach that he 
has 
still reagan added he knows that i feel that well we put 
it this way as ive said my philosophy is trust everybody but 
cut the cards 
asked if he trusted gorbachev fully reagan said 
he hasnt shown me any reason yet that i shouldnt but again 
as ive said thats why i kept referring to doveryai no 
proveryai trust but verify and he knows that 
asked to assess gorbachevs longterm chances for political 
survival reagan said well i realize and i think we all should 
that he is battling a bureaucracy because whether its a russian 
bureaucracy or one of our own the first rule of bureaucracy is 
protect the bureaucracy 
and it would mean some great changes for some of the 
nomenklatura as they call their bureaucracy there if he 
institutes the reforms that hes talking about 
but on the plus side for him its very evident that the 
people of the soviet union are on his side reagan continued 
and i have to believe that the nomenklatura is going to have to 
think twice with regard to how far they would go in trying to block 
him when the man in the street over there wants the things that have 
been seen

his 6yearold illegally adopted daughter suggested thursday that 
his clients livein companion was jealous of his relationship with 
the girl 
hedda nussbaum who lived with defendant joel steinberg for 12 
years could have had a motive to hurt the little girl steinbergs 
attorney ira london implied 
last week wabctv quoted a psychiatric report that stated that 
ms nussbaum who has testified that steinberg frequently beat her 
had feelings of rivalry with lisa steinberg 
ms nussbaum the key prosecution witness at steinbergs murder 
trial denied she was jealous of lisa but admitted that steinberg 
often would take the child out on social occasions and leave her 
home 
i wished that i could go too ms nussbaum told london 
during her third day of crossexamination i was not happy that i 
could not go 
during a break in the questioning ms nussbaums lawyer barry 
scheck said londons trying to show she didnt care about the 
child its just not true so its not happening 
did it become more frequent in 1987 that joel took lisa and 
left you at home london asked ms nussbaum 
in 86 and 87 she answered and offered a reason at that 
time joel did not want me to be showing myself to new people who 
didnt know me because i didnt look too terrific

death he denies that he hit the girl ms nussbaum has testified

injuries three days later 
the death of the little girl in an affluent welleducated 
household steinberg was an attorney now disbarred and ms 
nussbaum was a childrens book editor shocked the city and led to 
a reexamination of responsibilities of neighbors teachers and 
social workers to recognize and report suspected child abuse 
steinberg obtained lisa shortly after her birth from an unwed 
long island teenager telling the mother the baby would be placed 
with a catholic family in manhattan the mother michelle launders 
paid steinberg 500 for filing fees 
ms launders 27 has watched the sevenweek trial daily from a 
frontrow seat she said she was angry that ms nussbaum had not 
prepared her home for the baby after ms nussbaum testified she and

president reagan on thursday used what was 
probably his last formal news conference to straighten out one of 
the most familiar quotations from his first the quotation he said 
is actually a misquotation 
the president was asked if after his warm meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in new york on wednesday he still 
believes the soviets would lie cheat and steal to achieve their 
political goals 
do you think he has really change to what extent has he 
changed and how have you changed was the question 
i know so many of you quoted this in that first press 
conference of mine said reagan but none of you ever thought to 
give the complete answer 
i said in their own words this was their philosophy and it 
was in writing that there was no crime all of these things were not 
a crime if they advanced the cause of socialism reagan added 
now i didnt make that up thats what they said i think 
theres been a change that was four leaders back before this one 
well hes right 
in his news conference of jan 29 1981 reagan was asked what he 
saw as the soviets long term intentions 
i dont have to think of an answer as to what i think their 
intentions are they have repeated it the thennew president 
replied i know of no leader of the soviet union since the 
revolution that has not more than once repeated in the various 
communist congresses they hold their determination that their goal 
must be the promotion of world revolution 
now as long as they do that and as long as they at the same 
time have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they 
recognize is what will further their cause meaning they reserve 
unto themselves the right to commit any crime to lie to cheat in 
order to attain that and that is moral not immoral and we operate 
on a different set of standards i think when you do business with 
them even at a detente you keep that in mind

the third woman identified thursday 
among five murdered bodies found in southeastern massachusetts was a 
drug addict with ties to a seedy section of this fishing port the 
victims mother said 
as the search for more bodies continued investigators identified 
debra medeiros 30 of fall river as the first of five female bodies 
found at wooded roadsides between july and december in the towns of 
dartmouth and freetown 
investigators believe she was strangled said thomas gibney a 
spokesman for bristol county district attorney ronald pina she was 
reported missing by her family in fall river on may 27 her 
partially clad body was found july 3 
investigators have yet to establish the identities of two of the 
victims the three identified to date all had ties to the weld 
square district known for the availability of drugs and 
prostitutes in this city of 98000 people 
gibney said authorities still have suspects not in custody and 
were leaning toward the notion that the killer is from the new 
bedford area not a traveling murderer who might be responsible for 
killings in other parts of the country 
gibney also said investigators were checking reports that a man 
claiming to be the highway killer assaulted a 22yearold woman in a 
pickup truck in rhode island thursday morning 
the woman reportedly told police that she escaped from the truck 
at 130 am on interstate 95 in warwick ri 
medeiros mother olivia said her daughter who lived at home 
all her life was a drug addict gibney also said medeiros had been 
addicted to drugs fall river police lt brian lynch said only that 
she was known to police 
mrs medeiros said she last saw her daughter in may when she left 
to visit her boyfriend in new bedford the couple was to go on a 
cruise when several days later she said she got a call from the 
boyfriend asking where debra was 
mrs medeiros said the boyfriend russell oliveira told her that 
they had had a fight on the night of may 27 oliveira has an 
unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for comment 
thursday 
gibney would not comment on the details of medeiros 
disappearance but according to mrs medeiros oliveira is not a 
suspect 
medeiros body was discovered in a wooded area off route 140 in 
freetown gibney attributed the fivemonth delay in identifying her 
to the early emphasis on a list of six missing persons from new 
bedford 
two of those missing persons have turned out to have been among 
the bodies found by police 
using dental records authorities identified one of the victims 
wednesday as nancy paiva 36 of new bedford her body was 
discovered july 30 along interstate 195 in the town of dartmouth 
paiva left two daughters aged 14 and 17 gibney said she had no 
record of arrest for prostitution but was known to have a drug 
problem the other identified victim is dawn mendes 25 who was 
reported missing in september 
investigators suspect one person may be responsible for the 
deaths because the bodies were found in a 6 to 8mile radius in 
dense woods within 25 feet of interstate 195 and route 140 
a state police dog from connecticut knwon for an ability to find 
bodies returned to his home state thursday gibney said a trained 
police dog from massachusetts continued hunting along route 140 
outside new bedford 
dr douglas ubelaker a forensic anthropologist with the 
smithsonian institution in washington is scheduled to arrive monday 
to examine the remains of the three unidentified bodies which are 
largely decomposed

tons of medical supplies thursday into armenia rocked by an 
earthquake that officials said devastated several cities and killed 
tens of thousands of people 
armenian journalists said a politburo commission led by premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50000 
people died in the wednesday earthquake which measured 69 on the 
richter scale soviet officials reported thousands of people were 
killed but provided no death toll 
president mikhail s gorbachev cut short his trip to the united 
states and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort in 
southern republic which has a population of 33 million 
urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected by 
this terrible tragedy and i have to be there in this effort 
gorbachev said before leaving new york he canceled trips to cuba 
and britain 
the soviet news agency tass announced gorbachevs arrival in 
moscow early friday it did not say whether he would stay or fly 
immediately to yerevan the capital of the small soviet republic in 
the caucasus mountains 
president reagan offered emergency humanitarian aid cuban 
president fidel castro pledged to send construction workers and 
britain dispatched london firefighters to join the rescue effort 
the epicenter of the quake was 25 miles northeast of leninaken 
on the turkish border the us geological survey said the initial 
shock was followed four minutes later by an aftershock measuring 58 
on the richter scale 
soviet tv showed a clock on a building in leninakan armenias 
secondlargest city stopped at 1141 am 241 am est the 
instant the disaster struck 
the earthquake destroyed twothirds of leninakan which has a 
population of 250000 a tv correspondent said 
spitak a town of 16000 about 45 miles away was practically 
erased from the face of the earth the correspondent said 
hundreds of thousands were left homeless in the region he said 
tass said half the buildings in kirovakan a city of 150000 had 
crumbled 
a special meeting of representatives of all 15 soviet republics 
was called in yerevan on friday to discuss disaster relief

medical supplies to the area and a helicopter bridge was set up 
to ferry the injured northward to hospitals in neighboring soviet 
georgia the tass news agency reported 
tass said 2300 people were hospitalized in yerevan with injuries 
from the quake and that 200 were hospitalized across the border in 
georgia it did not say how many of the injured were treated 
elsewhere 
for a second night thursday millions of soviet tv viewers saw 
soldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles of 
concrete rubble by hand or with cranes the disaster coverage by 
the staterun media was unprecedented in its speed and scope 
ryzhkov head of an earthquake commission told soviet television 
the main task before authorities is to search for the injured and 
dead 
he then turned directly toward the camera and made an unusual 
appeal to factory and business officials nationwide not to wait to 
be asked but to start immediately sending heavy cranes helicopters 
and other equipment 
friday and saturday were declared days of mourning in armenia 
tass quoted nikolai shebalin a laboratory director at the soviet 
institute of earth science as saying more earthquakes were likely 
in the region but they should be weaker less powerful aftershocks 
normally follow a strong earthquake 
soviet tv and the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported from 
leninakan that preliminary estimates were that tens of thousands of 
people were killed 
foreign minister spokesman vadim perfiliev said authorities were 
having difficulty calculating a death toll because communications 
with the region were severed 
he said the foreign ministry was reviewing requests by foreign 
reporters to visit the disaster area but that none had been 
approved 
komsomolskaya pravda said soldiers were working under spotlights 
in the wreckage of a leninakan school it said two sergeants pulled 
the bodies of more than 50 children from the ruins and that only a 
few children had been found alive in the collapsed building 
blood donations were being collected throughout the soviet union 
for quake victims tons of blankets field kitchens tents and 
medicine were pouring into the region tass said 
soldiers were setting up tent cities to house evacuees in the 
devastated regions and restoring electricity and water supplies 
army gen vladimir arkhipov told tass bonfires burned in the 
shattered cities to warm the homeless in the december chill 
the newspaper izvestia reported the population of armenia has 
swelled in recent weeks as settlers fled violent ethnic strife 
between armenians who are mostly christian and predominantly 
moslem azerbaijanis 
about 180000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border 
between the two republics in the last three weeks 
the last earthquake in the soviet union with a death toll in the 
thousands was on oct 5 1948 in ashkhabad the capital of 
turkmenia the soviet press acting under gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness recently gave the death toll for the 
ashkhabad quake as 110000 
a quake of 69 on the richter scale is capable of causing 
widespread damage the scale is a measure of ground motion as 
recorded on seismographs every increase of one number means a 
tenfold increase in magnitude

two unemployed aerospace workers described by 
acquaintances as oddballs misfits have been charged with 
attempted extortion in computerized death threats to prominent 
antelope valley residents 
roman stephan makuch 27 and richard mathew faroni 26 who were 
arrested in las vegas on thanksgiving day were being returned 
thursday to the community of lancaster said deputy district 
attorney steve cooley 
although the two are suspected of sending 265 computerproduced 
threats they were charged with only 10 specific acts to simplify 
the case cooley said 
cooley said the recipients were all substantial people 
including a former lancaster city manager bank vice presidents and 
professionals in the antelope valley the rapidly expanding suburbs 
60 miles north of downtown la on the southern rim of the mojave 
desert 
cooley said many of the letters were nearly identical but that 
the text of each was customized to include personal information 
about the recipient 
the letters attached to the complaint began with an obscenity 
and a threat of death the writers then demanded specific amounts of 
cash as high as 600000 with instructions for its delivery they 
went on to give gruesome details of how victims would be killed and 
threatened harm to their children spouses and relatives 
these victims did not take it as a joke said cooley some 
fled the antelope valley and stayed in hotels while others installed 
security systems after recieving the letters on nov 2 and nov 3 
he said 
there were two people hospitalized as the result of their fear 
and concern he said 
no one paid any money and all recipients who did not discard the 
letters as junk mail contacted authorities 
cooley said it appeared that the letter writers had researched 
their targets including in some letters specific information about 
the recipients business relationships and homes one letter 
referred to the satellite dish on a residents house and threatened 
to fertilize your fruit trees with your decaying body 
we can put toxic chemicals in your toothpaste or glue laced 
with poison cyanide on envelopes and stamps that you lick the 
letters said many contained the phrase the organization has 
watched this area over a year and we know what you can pay 
makuch and faroni waived extradition from las vegas cooley said 
a search of their apartment and a nearby storage facility turned up 
a computer printers and computer discs a handgun and several cb 
radios 
the letters had told some recipients to bring a cb radio to las 
vegas and tune in a specific channel for instructions on where to 
deliver money 
the prosecutor said the men were unemployed but both had 
previously worked on an assembly line at rockwell internationals 
palmdale plant on the b1b bomber project 
he said acquaintances who spoke to local news media about them 
said they could be characterized as being a couple of oddballs 
misfits 
cooley said other people may be involved and the investigation 
was continuing 
both men were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion 
attempted extortion and sending threatening letters for extortion 
purposes if convicted they could draw maximum sentences of six 
years in prison

finance minister kiichi miyazawa implicated in a 
stock scandal that has damaged the governing party resigned friday 
to help clear opposition to passage of tax reform bills in 
parliament 
miyazawa said an aides involvement in buying unlisted shares of 
a real estate company had led him to make inaccurate statements 
to lawmakers he said he was resigning to take responsibility and 
hoped the move would speed passage of the tax legislation 
personally i hope the tax reform bills will be passed soon 
and it doesnt matter what happens to me he said during an 
interview on national television 
miyazawa told reporters prime minister noboru takeshita approved 
of his resignation japans kyodo news service quoting unidentified 
sources said takeshita will temporarily serve as finance minister 
until a replacement is found for miyazawa 
opposition parties had demanded that miyazawa resign to take 
responsibility for repeatedly giving conflicting accounts about his 
role in the stock trading controversy they refused to resume 
parliamentary debate on the tax reform package until he did so 
miyazawa a twoterm finance minister and veteran politician 
changed accounts of his involvement in the stock deals at least 
three times in his statements to parliamentary committees 
investigating the scandal 
the controversy involves purchases of real estate stocks of 
recruit cosmos co by dozens of leaders of the governing liberal 
democratic party including miyazawa takeshita and former foreign 
minister shintaro abe japans top three politicians 
political analysts have said miyazawas resignation probably 
would pave the way for passage of the tax reform package during the 
current session of the diet or parliament which ends on dec 29 
miyazawa has been considered a candidate for prime minister 
in september when his involvement in the controversy was first 
made known he told a news conference that he took no part in the 
dealings and had no knowledge about the unlisted shares of the real 
estate company 
later an investigation by the japan communist party showed that 
miyazawa bought 10000 unlisted shares of recruit cosmos in 
september 1986 and earned more than 164000 in profits by selling 
them immediately after the company went public a month later 
after that happened he told the committee that his former aide 
bought shares from his business associate without his knowledge 
it was disclosed in a parliamentary investigation last month that 
the aide tsuneo hattori bought shares directly from recruit inc 
the real estate firms parent company 
miyazawa told a news conference last week that he would give up 
his cabinet position and his seat in parliament which he has held 
since 1959 if he was obliged to change his testimony again he also 
hinted that he was willing to resign if it would help secure passage 
of the tax reform package 
debate on the tax legislation has been stalled since last week 
when opposition parties singled out miyazawa and demanded that the 
finance minister submit material evidence to prove the accuracy of 
his earlier statements 
miyazawa however refused to do so saying he had lost all 
evidence such as stock transaction records and receipts 
the legislation japans first major overhaul of its tax system 
since the end of the world war ii has been a top priority for the 
liberal democratic party for a decade 
successive administrations have failed to enact the reform due to 
public and opposition party resistance former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone under whom miyazawa also served as finance 
minister staked his political career on tax reform and lost 
the new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax 
scales and introduces a 3 percent sales tax 
the governing party which commands a majority in both houses of 
parliament forced the tax bill through the lower house last month 
the legislation has been debated in the upper house since then 
the liberal democrats could enact the tax laws despite opposition 
resistance but this would violate japanese political tradition 
which values consensus and could cost the party votes in the next 
election said masumi ishikawa political commentator for the 
masscirculation daily asahi shimbun 
a survey by another leading daily the mainichi shimbun showed 
friday that public support for the takeshita administration has 
dropped to 18 percent from last decembers 30 percent the 
thirdlowest rating for a prime minister since world war ii

mikhail s gorbachev returned home thursday from 
a tragedyshortened but triumphant visit expressing hopes that it 
would open up good prospects for our two peoples and the world 
the soviet leader cut short his visit by a day to oversee relief 
efforts for victims of an earthquake that reportedly killed tens of 
thousands of people in the southern soviet republic of armenia he 
also canceled planned visits to cuba and great britain 
but during his 45hour stay gorbachev dazzled world leaders with 
a dramatic arms reduction proposal and captured the hearts of new 
yorkers who gathered in droves along manhattan streets to 
jubilantly cheer the soviet leader 
the warm feelings were not lost on gorbachev who said the 
hospitality he experienced showed an increasing friendliness and 
willingness to cooperate on the part of the soviet people and the 
american people 
we believe that this may have been one of the most important 
things that happened on this day of our stay in america gorbachev 
said before leaving kennedy airport his plane departed at about 
1230 pm est 
gorbachev explained his abrupt departure at an airport news 
conference saying the quake which registered 69 on the richter 
scale had extremely grave consequences devastation and grave 
loss of life 
armenian church officials in new york who are in contact with 
people in the devastated area said the death toll might be as high 
as 70000 
though he had only one working day in new york gorbachev 
said i and my delegation believe that this was a very important 
day 
the highlights of the visit were gorbachevs dramatic 
announcement before the united nations general assembly that he 
planned a major reduction in soviet troop strength over the next 
three years and his superpower luncheon with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush 
gorbachev the first soviet chief to visit new york in 28 years 
said his speech and a nighttime reception at the un gave him the 
opportunity to set out our views on the world today and on 
the prospects of the worlds development 
in his address gorbachev announced that within two years he 
would reduce the soviet military machine by 500000 troops and 
10000 tanks 
he also called for a jan 1 ceasefire in afghanistan proposed a 
100year moratorium on third world debt and promised to prohibit 
political and religious persecution in his country 
gorbachev called his visit on governors island with reagan and 
bush a good meeting held in an open and trusting atmosphere 
he said the one word he would use to characterize the meeting was 
continuity and said all parties walked away confident that our 
relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation on 
the basis of mutual respect for each others interests 
the road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead and we will 
i believe be building on what has been achieved if we act as we 
have been acting and also maybe add something new the soviet 
leader said 
i think that would open up good prospects for our two peoples 
and will be extremely important for the world as well 
gorbachev arrived on tuesday afternoon and had been scheduled to 
stay until friday morning 
all of his scheduled stops on thursday including the first 
soviet trade show in the united states central park and the 
metropolitan museum were canceled when news of the severity of the 
earthquake reached gorbachev late wednesday 
gorbachevs wife raisa had been scheduled to visit children at 
an upper east side grade school and might have done some shopping 
the early departure saved the city money in police overtime and 
saved motorists a repeat of the traffic gorbylock that developed 
during the soviet leaders 45car motorcade tour late wednesday 
cabbies buses unsuspecting motorists and even pedestrians were 
stopped for as much as an hour while gorbachev and his wife toured 
the city from the canyons of wall street to the glitter of times 
square 
the soviet leader and his wife got out of his limousine outside a 
broadway theater and later at bloomingdales to greet people 
facetoface 
their tour also included a dazzling twilight view of the city 
from the top of the 110story world trade center 
i think i would be remiss in my duty if i went home without 
saying how much we are grateful to new yorkers gorbachev said 
thursday for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they 
have been expressing over these days so to all new yorkers our 
very warm gratitude we value that very much

a mans role in helping police arrest a 
woman charged in a series of california boardinghouse murders led 
him to an emotional reunion thursday with a son he hadnt seen in 
more than three decades 
this is the moment ive been waiting for for the last 32 
years charles willgues sr 59 said after embracing charles jr 
at detroit metropolitan airport id always hoped but i was about 
to give it up you know the record by frank sinatra for once in my 
life thats what im experiencing right now 
two of willgues daughters didnt come to the airport to avoid 
publicity he was to meet with them later 
im just going to take this daybyday said 35yearold 
charles willgues jr of taylor 
willgues children hadnt seen their father since he left 
michigan more than three decades ago they say they might not have 
found him if he hadnt helped police find a california murder 
suspect 
willgues sr met dorothea puente in a los angeles bar last month 
five days after she fled her sacramento boarding house following the 
discovery of seven bodies on the property he tipped off authorities 
and she was arrested 
a television reporter trying to locate willgues after puentes 
arrest visited his old apartment where there was a letter from 
willgues youngest daughter debbie sculley she had traced her 
father to california but didnt know he had recently moved 
the reporter passed the letter on to willgues and taylor police 
helped him get in touch with his family leading to thursday nights 
reunion 
im a little bit excited and a little bit confused the 
younger willgues said before the plane arrived i mean i havent 
seen my father in 33 years i never really even knew him 
the son who drives a tractortrailer for a detroit trucking 
company said he and his sister wrote the letter found by the 
reporter 
we said this is soandso your longlost son and daughter 
and wed like to get together sometime he said if the puente 
case had never come about we might have never gotten together 
the elder willgues 34yearold daughter linda said earlier 
thursday she was waiting for a private moment with her dad 
im not going she said of the airport trip its just too 
public 
a woman who identified herself in a telephone interview only as 
willgues first wife said she was not anxious to see him again 
he left when the kids were babies she said i dont know 
why the kids are so anxious to see him i guess its mostly 
curiosity

the federal grand jury that charged 
defrocked ptl founder jim bakker with bilking millions of dollars 
from his followers has not completed its investigation a source 
familiar with the probe said wednesday 
all i can say is they havent finished their business said a 
federal law enforcement officer who requested anonymity 
the 23member grand jurys term does not end until next month 
and the secondfloor room in the federal courthouse in downtown 
charlotte is still reserved for the grand jury next week according 
to the us district courts office 
a newspaper reported wednesday that prosecutors and highlevel 
us department of justice officials were debating whether to seek 
indictments accusing bakker and some of his former associates with 
tax violations 
the charlotte observer quoted a source close to the investigation 
as saying theres no indictment here concerning taxes seems to 
me that would be the big one 
bakker and richard dortch a former senior executive vice 
president at ptl are accused of diverting more than 4 million of 
ptl money to their own benefit and of conspiring to defraud the 
public in raising millions of dollars to suport lavish and 
extravagant lifestyles 
the 24count indictment issued monday charges them with mail 
fraud wire fraud and conspiracy if convicted of all the charges 
bakker 48 and dortch 57 each could be sentenced to 120 years in 
prison and fined 6 million 
federal prosecutors have refused comment on the investigation 
since it began 17 months ago 
us attorney tom ashcrafts office in charlotte was referring 
all phone calls to the us department of justices public affairs 
office in washington dc 
justice department spokesman john russell said he could not 
comment on the investigation 
bakkers attorney jim toms did not return phone calls to his 
office wednesday earlier he said he didnt anticipate any more 
charges against his client and said bakker would plead innocent 
i think at this point theyve produced what they intend to 
produce toms said tuesday 
but dortchs attorney bill diehl said he was surprised his 
client was not indicted on tax charges 
we expected tax indictments along with what we got indicted 
for he said tuesday 
bakker has declined to give interviews since his indictment 
his wife tammy faye who was not indicted refused to talk with 
reporters when she drove off the grounds of the ministrys offices 
in this town just south of charlotte wednesday morning 
also wednesday the newest member of bakkers defense team 
criminal law specialist bob davis had his clients first court 
appearance moved back to jan 9 from dec 15 
dortch is still scheduled to appear in court next week along 
with david taggart bakers former personal aide at ptl and his 
brother james taggart ptls former interior decorator the 
taggarts were charged in the indictment with tax evasion and 
impeding the irs in collecting taxes for allegedly diverting about 
11 million in ptl money to pay personal expenses

a threejudge panel of a federal appeals court 
on wednesday upheld a lower court decision to vacate the 1977 
convictions of former gov marvin mandel and five others in a 
political corruption case 
us attorney breckinridge l willcox said he plans to ask the 
us solicitor general for permission to seek a review of the ruling 
by the full 4th circuit court of appeals 
mandel was charged in 1975 with helping irvin kovens w dale 
hess harry w rodgers iii william a rogers and ernest cory sr 
get extra racing days for marlboro race track which they secretly 
owned while he was governor he also was accused of accepting 
350000 in gifts and financial help in a divorce settlement 
in a 21 decision the appeals court panel upheld a nov 12 
1987 decision by us district judge frederic n smalkin that set 
aside the mail fraud convictions of mandel and the others the 
judges agreed with smalkins ruling that the jury at mandels trial 
was allowed to consider a theory of mail fraud law that has since 
been overturned by the us supreme court 
in june 1987 the supreme court ruled that federal mail fraud 
statutes cannot be used to prosecute public officials for defrauding 
citizens of their intangible rights to honest government 
three of the four judges that have recently looked at this case 
have concluded that gov mandel and the other defendants had been 
unjustly convicted for conduct that was not criminal said 
mandels attorney arnold weiner 
willcox contended that the ruling should not be applied to a case 
that was decided 10 years earlier 
mandels conduct then and now is a crime said willcox 
the request for a fullcourt review of the panels ruling will be 
based on a dissenting opinion filed by judge kk hall willcox said 
hall wrote that although their trial included an erroneous jury 
instruction the proceedings were replete with evidence of bribery 
and manipulation their mandel and the others actions were and are 
patently illegal 
mandel was indicted on the mail fraud charges halfway through his 
second fouryear term he remained in office until the day he was 
sentenced and won a reversal on appeal allowing him to resume as 
governor for the last days of his term which expired in 1979 
another appellate review reinstated the conviction and mandel 
served 14 months at a federal prison camp the appellate decision 
stood until smalkins 1987 ruling setting aside the convictions

one hospitals solution to the runaway use of 
caesarean sections could eliminate 450000 needless operations and 
save more than 1 billion a year if adopted nationally according to 
a study published today 
however some experts question whether the program developed at 
mount sinai medical center in chicago could easily be copied at 
other hospitals because doctors are too afraid of malpractice suits 
to follow the proposed rules 
doctors at mount sinai reduced the caesarean rate to half the 
nationwide level by instituting five guidelines for performing them 
according to the report in todays new england journal of medicine 
use of forceps deliveries also fell 
to a large extent there has been a more handsoff attitude 
toward taking care of our patients said dr stephen a myers 
director of maternalfetal medicine

three decades of rock n rollers and 
country stars paid tribute to roy orbison remembering the 
blackclad balladeer as an angelvoiced original who pioneered the 
early days of rock 
roy didnt copy anybody but it cannot be said that a lot of 
people didnt borrow from orbison and theyll tell you that from 
the beatles to bruce springsteen veteran recording artist carl 
perkins said wednesday 
he was and always will be one of the greats of rock n roll 
said former beatle paul mccartney 
orbison who rose to fame with early 1960s hits like oh pretty

the charts with a group of rock legends died of a heart attack

a sports medicine expert says ailments such as 
black heel bikini bottom joggers nipples and toxic 
sock syndrome bother athletes and fitness fans more often than 
broken bones or strained muscles 
skin injuries such as these are among the most common of locker 
room complaints says medical professor rodney s w basler whose 
list of athletic ailments also includes runners rump and 
surfers nodules 
the skin bears the brunt of the punishment from exercise and 
develops injuries in unexpected ways basler said wednesday in an 
interview at the annual meeting of the american academy of 
dermatology 
the percentage of people in fitness conditioning or good 
athletic programs who develop some types of skin problems is quite 
large i wouldnt be surprised if threequarters or fourfifths of 
everybody in a fitness program has some type of skin injury said 
basler an assistant professor at the university of nebraska medical 
center and a fitness medicine expert

now this is a record collection 
jerry lee lewis original sun records singles the rolling 
stones first album autographed by mick keith charlie bill and 
brian a beatles licorice disc signed by paul mccartney 
but bob george curator of this musical menagerie speaks with 
obvious pride about another lp calypso is like so by robert 
mitchum on this record mitchum does something he does not do in 
war and remembrance he performs mama looka boo boo with a 
psuedocaribbean lilt 
can you believe this we just got it in the mail the other 
day said george who with a little help from his friends is 
trying to locate every record made since 1950 for the burgeoning 
archive of contemporary music 
we forbid ourselves to refuse records the stuff the pmrc 
parents music resource center would try to get out of libraries 
bring it in said george who estimates the collection begun in 
late 1985 now numbers almost 250000 sound recordings 
that attitude explains why the butthole surfers a punk group 
sit beside count basie and how the beatles classic sgt peppers 
lonely hearts club band shares space with telly kojak savalas 
creepy youve lost that loving feeling 
the eclectic archive is the brainchild of george and david 
wheeler who initially hoped to create a collection of rock n roll 
but soon expanded their vision to include any and all types of 
popular music 
george producer of the breakthrough laurie anderson record o 
superman brought his musicbusiness ties and a 25000record 
collection wheelers contributions were 10000 records and a 
masters degree in library science 
the idea and the albums soon found a home above the blarney 
castle bar in downtown manhattan up two rickety flights of stairs 
in a cramped loft now filled with records from acid rock to zydeco 
47000 in all 
the rest of the collection is somewhat farflung as george a 
37yearold youngstown ohio native explains in the excited voice 
he affects when discussing the collection 
we have one location in chicago one location in my parents 
basement theres about 30000 in boston 100000 in upstate new 
york and depending on whether these two a pair of archive 
employees give us their records two other locations he said 
they also have a lot of support every major record company 
currently ships the archive free copies of their new releases and 
the nonprofit organizations board of advisers includes musicians 
nile rodgers paul simon lou reed and todd rundgren 
they have a real vision of where they want to go reed said 
shortly after the project first started theyre in it for the 
long haul 
the singer of walk on the wild side proved prophetic george 
now talks about a day five years down the road when the archive will 
be partlibrary partmuseum open to the public and available for 
researchers 
its like archaeology youre digging said thomas cvikota 
who is handling archive fundraising youre going down into the 
tomb into the ruins and finding the essence of the culture 
while 250000 sound recordings sounds like an incredible 
collection the archive falls well short of the library of congress 
17 million records dating back to 1888 but george feels that his 
system will soon make his assembly the final word in contemporary 
record research 
it might be arrogant but we think we really have usurped the 
function of the library of congress in terms of keeping track of 
this material he said we certainly have a better handson 
approach 
that approach allowed the group to help director martin scorcese 
find the right music for the last temptation of christ george 
was able to hook him up with a moroccan vocalist who did the wailing 
at lazarus tomb in the film 
scorcese has since joined the board of advisers a testament to 
the archives digging ability and its growing fame 
the search is already under way to find expanded quarters in 
manhattan once thats accomplished george and company plan to 
close down and take eight months to a year just cataloging records 
and preparing for the grand reopening 
once all thats finished there remains at least one more problem 
we read once that once a year you have to give every record a 
quarterturn because plastic precipitates down said george 
breaking into a loud laugh i can imagine someone saying it now 
ok today your job at the archive is

a 257foot ship named le mistral has 
brought legal casino gambling to texas simply by sailing past an 
unpaved mexican fishing village just south of the border 
le mistral passengers take a six to eighthour trip to nowhere 
no one disembarks and most never see their destination the tiny 
village of el mezquital 30 miles south of the mouth of the rio 
grande 
the passby satisfies a state law requiring gambling ships 
operating from texas to call on a foreign port le mistrals casino 
cannot open until the ship reaches international waters 12 miles 
offshore 
the trips are a bold venture for islander cruises ltd based in 
a strip shopping center recently renamed bon voyage plaza 10 miles 
north of the border at port isabel when it comes to the texas 
market casino cruise lines are in uncharted waters 
no ones operated one not at all said templeton fowlkes a 
mississippi attorney with the task of guiding islander through its 
startup period we still dont know how many days they 
consumers want and which days 
an ambitious schedule of nine cruises per week was scaled back to 
six at least until the weather warms up and the sea calms down le 
mistral made its maiden voyage nov 18 after being postponed twice 
by choppy seas that operators feared would make passengers ill 
the 3995 day cruises and 4995 evening trips feature 
allyoucaneat buffets lounges with live entertainment and a 
strolling magician 
but the big draw is a casino with 125 slot machines blackjack 
craps roulette poker and a soontobeadded book for betting on 
sporting events 
le mistrals captain clears mexican customs either by radio or 
with the mexican officials who often come along for the trips 
fowlkes said the ship is required to stay clear of el mezquital to 
avoid disturbing the small fishing boats and passes a mile or more 
offshore from the village before turning around on return us 
customs also is cleared by radio 
fowlkes said the cruise offers people a chance to try out a 
casino without traveling all the way to las vegas nev or atlantic 
city nj 
no single bet can exceed 200 you dont find the las vegas 
people here fowlkes said you dont find the highrollers 
one firstnight passenger won 1000 less than 15 minutes after 
the ship pulled away from the dock according to islander 
but brownsville resident melissa dennany said she lost 200 
playing blackjack and craps in the ships casino while celebrating 
her 30th birthday her first gambling experience was fun she said 
but too expensive to become a habit 
i learned on that trip how addictive gambling can be ms 
dennany said 
the ship holds 850 people but the company considers 500 a full 
passenger load each trip is crewed by 120 of islanders 300 
employees 
fowlkes is a partner in an ocean springs miss law firm that is 
a 21 percent shareholder of islander other interests in the cruise 
include ship owner burton securities of athens greece miamibased 
om consultants managing the entertainment and casino harborage 
ltd of dallas handling food and beverages and norwich 
connbased norse enterprises which operates the ship 
islander officials declined to predict the corporations annual 
income 
depending how the market develops islander may bring in larger 
vessels next year for five and sevenday cruises to points further 
south in mexico company officials said 
when that ship pulled up at the dock we hit the turning point 
of some real progress in port isabel and south padre island said 
bob goodman president of the local chamber of commerce noting that 
some businesses already are linking sales increases to the new 
tourist attraction 
the port isabelsan benito navigation district spent 162000 
upgrading its port facilities prior to le mistrals arrival from 
greece 
promoters are counting on the cruises to boost the tourism 
industry that already brings an estimated 25 million visitors a 
year to south padre island 
islander has begun an aggressive newspaper billboard and 
national magazine advertising campaign said betty wells whose port 
isabelbased wells media associates inc provides promotions for the 
company 
meanwhile corpus christi to the north also is trying to 
attract a cruise ship and galveston officials have said they want a 
floating offshore casino 
state sen chet brooks and rep james hury plan to introduce a 
bill in the 1989 legislature to allow a gambling ship to operate 
without calling on a foreign port 
area residents eagerness for an economic boost apparently 
dampened any opposition to a gambling operation 
ms wells said i think a lot of that has to do with the fact 
that south texas really needs a shot in the arm right now

the first black lawman to become a texas ranger 
says he is happy to be a role model but looks forward to the day 
when he gets attention not because of his race but because of cases 
he solves 
lee roy young jr after roughly three months on the job is 
taking special training and investigating cases from murder to 
kidnapping 
the 15year veteran of the texas department of public safety said 
he wants to be viewed as another person here working and the only 
time id be brought out in the limelight is when im working on 
something thats a large investigation or something where theres a 
lot of people involved 
of course i would much rather it the publicity just fade 
away he said 
the lawman 41 is stationed in the dallas suburb of garland he 
received his badge in early september 
young got a lot of attention when his promotion to ranger was 
announced in july the texas department of public safety has been 
accused by the national association for the advancement of colored 
people of passing over black officers for promotion and 
discriminating against them in other ways 
young is the first black to become a ranger in the 165year 
history of the force which now numbers 94 men 
he said he hasnt personally encountered discrimination and he 
hasnt seen others discriminated against 
i dont see it he said of course i havent really been 
looking for it 
if he becomes a role model thats ok with him 
theres always that possibility that someone will see me and 
say if he was succussful in his chosen field then i can go forth 
and do the same in mine he said 
you set your sights on something and you work toward obtaining 
that goal and dont let anything else get in your way 
young dreamed of being a ranger as a child in south texas and 
said the reality has pretty much lived up to the dream 
youre trying to find or to obtain something unknown or thats 
not easily found or disclosed so its that challenge in itself that 
i find most exciting he said 
as a ranger young said he has been involved in investigations of 
kidnapping murder narcotics forgery missing persons and fugitive 
cases 
rangers are charged with four duties protecting life and 
property by enforcing state criminal statutes suppressing riots and

before becoming a ranger young was a criminal intelligence 
investigator in san antonio 
lately hes been attending training sessions on such subjects as 
bloodstain interpretation and making composite drawings of suspects 
you never stop learning he said

the first story of a fivepart christmas series 
on modern theologians gods 20th century giants is about karl 
barth 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
while the crowd in the lecture hall awaited the appearance of 
renowned theologian karl barth someone scrawled on the blackboard 
behind the podium god is other people 
the rumpled bespectacled barth ambled onto the stage and paused 
staring at the words with a twinkle in his eyes he picked up the 
chalk and added a comma making the sentence read 
god is other people 
that total otherness of god beyond any human calculation or 
ingenious devising launched the thunderbolt flung by the great 
swiss scholar into the arena of 20th century theology 
only god speaks well of god barth declared contending that 
any human attempts to conceive or define him is to reduce divinity 
to human dimensions choices and control a false idol 
let god be god he said 
barth pronounced bart is regarded by many as the centurys 
preeminent christian thinker boldly original penetrating 
thorough trenchantly gripping a master in his field 
he is one in an extraordinary line of theological titans who 
crossed the worlds stage this century and changed the landscape of 
religious thought 
among them were barths swiss compatriot emil bruner the german 
martyr to nazism dietrich bonhoeffer the roman catholic 
incarnationalist karl rahner the demythologizing rudolf 
bultmann judaisms relationist martin buber the existentialist 
paul tillich and christian realist reinhold niebuhr 
these modern religious giants all are dead and as the century 
draws to a close its almost as though some special dispensation 
has ended but their work both emulated and criticized permeates 
the religious world 
to barth the remoteness of a wholly other god constituted 
his stern no to a sindarkened world 
trying to know anything about god through reasoning nature 
sentiments or philosophical arguments is vain and benighted barth 
said reflecting humanitys original revolt by trying itself to be 
as god 
it is the attempted replacement of divine work by human 
manufacture barth said an effort to divinize man and to 
humanize god with romantic formulations so as to wipe out the 
distance between them 
god is not to be sought out in his inscrutable loftiness 
however barth said god took the initiative to turn that 
overshadowing no into a ringing yes through the work of 
christ and the word of god 
and so he said his inevitable no is always enclosed in 
his primary yes to man 
barth called christ both gods man and mans god and 
said 
in the midst of his people god lets one become man espousing 
totally the cause of this man attesting identity with him thus 
enacting community with man and exalting man to community with 
him 
barth who died in 1968 at age 82 belonged to the swiss reformed 
church but his powerful freethinking scholarship carried weight 
not only throughout protestantism but also in catholicism with 
whose thinkers he maintained a running dialogue 
in the scholarly world barths approach became known as 
neoorthodox or barthian a term he deplored he called his 
work evangelical theology it is firmly steadily rooted in 
scripture 
the biblical witnesses are better informed than are the 
theologians he said for this reason theology must agree to let 
them look over its shoulder and correct its notebooks 
for all his immense erudition and analytical skills the 
pipesmoking barth had a kindly cheerful disposition and whimsical 
selfeffacing wit seeming to take himself much less seriously than 
did some of his colleagues 
the theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian 
at all he said sulky faces morose thoughts and boring ways 
are intolerable in this science 
he had a zest for history literature music and detective 
stories once fretting about whether he would be understood in some 
1962 lectures in the united states he remarked my english is 
criminal because i learned it by reading detective stories 
tender and gruff modest but assured he rode horseback sang 
loudly like a lion as a son put it preached regularly to 
penitentiary prisoners and began his days listening to mozart 
it may be that when the angels go about their task of praising 
god they play only bach he said i am sure however that when 
they are together en famille they play mozart and then too our 
dear lord listens with a special pleasure 
besides barths driving theological work through a score of 
books including his 12volume church dogmatics and in lectures 
around the world he led efforts for christian unity and to forge 
church resistance to the nazis 
the church would do better to become a tiny remnant and flee to 
the catacombs than to make peace with this terrible doctrine in any 
way he said of nazism 
barth then teaching in bonn germany helped to form the 
confessing church a minority wing opposing hitlers policies and 
to organize the 1934 meeting that issued the famed barmen 
declaration blasting attempts to subordinate the church to 
hitlerism 
shortly thereafter barth was expelled for refusing to take an 
oath of allegiance to hitler or begin classes with the customary 
heil hitler 
he hurled his blunt no to human presumptions about 
understanding god at a time when christian liberals believed 
scientific progress and education would gradually help achieve 
paradise on earth a notion shattered by the horrors of war and 
totalitarianism 
the final root and basis of all human disorder is the dreadful 
godless ridiculous idea that humanity is the atlas to hold up the 
vault of heaven barth told the 1948 founding assembly of the 
world council of churches 
nevertheless he said god is no lonely god selfsufficient 
and selfcontained 
rather he freely chooses through christ to be the god of 
man barth said he exists neither next to man nor merely above 
him but rather with him by him and most of all for him 
a god who confronted man simply as exalted distant and 
strange that is a divinity without humanity could be only the god 
of bad news instead of the good news he would be the 
god of a scornful judging deadly no 
however barth said the content of gods word is his free 
undeserved yes to the whole human race in spite of all human 
unreasonableness and corruption 
jesus exposes the gulf which separates god and man and by 
exposing it bridges it barth said leaving humanity swamped by 
grace 
barth rejected biblical literalism contending the bible was not 
verbally infallible since everything human including language is 
limited and faulty 
yet he saw scripture as the medium elected by god as the most 
suitable within mans restricted sights for extending gods word 
to humanity 
in a conversation with barth fellow swiss theologian emil bruner 
once raised the point that some of the bible seemed profane 
nonsense its all profane barth retorted the bible was 
written by very profane men but and this is the distinction they 
were profane men in conversation with god

the second installment in a fivepart christmas 
series on great modern theologians gods 20th century giants 
concerns paul tillich a boundary man with an appeal to 
intellectuals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as a young frontline army chaplain in world war i paul tillich 
was so seared by the carnage and bursting shells around him that he 
suffered psychological turmoil for months but he found solace in 
visiting art museums and meditating on great religious paintings 
they have a power to stabilize and power to transform he 
wrote later 
staring at botticellis madonna or other masterworks he 
sensed that divine reality could be revealed through art forms 
expressing the holy through formtranscendence 
that intuition animated the approach of this towering existential 
theologian and philosopher who as he put it labored on the 
boundaries between church and society between faith and culture 
insisting on their interaction 
modern culture has lost its ultimate reference its center of 
meaning its spiritual substance he said leaving a secularized 
void of emptiness anxiety and pointlessness 
a man of natural dignity and gentle warmth tillichs 
unconventional interpretations often shocked the orthodox but they 
radiated an unfettered candor and dominating commitment 
i was thinking about infinity from the age of 8 he said 
he couched religious concepts in fresh often startling 
terminology to prick contemporary minds he called faith ultimate 
concern saying it demands the courage to be in the face of 
threatened nonbeing death he termed christ the new 
being whose incarnation expresses the paradox of god 
accepting a world which rejects him 
tillich called biblical accounts of supernatural occurrences 
symbols but said something happens through them which has 
effects and consequences 
he said christ was the bearer of a new eon who participates 
in human suffering and death overcoming the estrangement between 
man and god through acceptance of the unacceptable 
the saving power of the new being in jesus as the christ he 
said is dependent on mans participation in it 
he said its renewing power often strikes when we are in great 
pain and restlessness or in our indifference our weakness our 
hostility and our lack of direction and composure 
it strikes when we walk through the dark valley of a 
meaningless and empty life at that moment a wave of light 
breaks into our darkness and it is as though a voice were saying 
you are accepted accepted by that which is greater than you 
dont try to analyze or define it he said simply accept the 
fact that you are accepted in that moment grace conquers sin 
and reconciliation bridges the gulf of estrangement and nothing is 
demanded but acceptance to accept oneself as accepted in 
spite of being unacceptable 
tillich as a boundary man standing between a heritage 
imbued with the sacred and an age cut off from it saw himself as a 
mediator working to close a rupture he considered a threat to 
western civilization 
religion is the substance of culture and culture the form of 
religion he said there is no life where there is no 
otherness 
he died in 1965 at age 79 scorned by traditionalists but 
enduringly esteemed by others for his powerful reformulation of 
christian concepts 
he tackled the centurys most salient tension between 
religion and secularization wrote mark kline taylor a princeton 
theologian in a l987 book paul tillich 
he exerted a formative influence pointing theologians toward 
renewed christian hope along a journey where risks of the void 
attend each step they take taylor wrote 
using his inventive often arresting religious lexicon tillich 
said god was not a being or even the highest being alongside 
other beings 
when applied to god superlatives become diminuitives he 
said he termed god beingitself or ground of being the 
dynamic power of being in everything and above everything that 
energizes and gives cohesion to all authentic endeavor 
however he says people have become estranged from the ultimate 
power of being submerged in anxiety loneliness and guilt 
disillusioned by always collapsing idolatries of nationalism 
technology possessions sex or success 
he described sin as separation separation from others from 
ones self and from the ground of ones being 
we not only suffer because of the selfdestructive 
consequences of our separation but also know why we suffer 
tillich said we know that we are estranged from something to 
which we really belong 
we feel that something radical total and unconditional is 
demanded of us but we rebel against it try to escape its urgency 
and will not accept its promise 
this awareness of our separation from the rest of life is most 
acute when we are surrounded by it in noises and talk he said 
such as the intense loneliness that can descend in a crowded room 
we realize then much more than in moments of solitude how 
strange we are to each other how estranged life is from life he 
said 
yet we cannot escape the ground of our being but are 
bound to it for all eternity just as we are bound to ourselves and 
to all other life we always remain in the power of that from which 
we are estranged 
that fact brings us to the ultimate depth of sin separated and 
yet bound estranged and yet belonging destroyed and yet preserved 
that state which is called despair the sickness unto death 
tillich reared in germany as the son of a lutheran minister and 
ordained himself initially taught at german universities but his 
early criticisms of hitler led to his expulsion in 1933 along with 
many jewish professors including the great martin buber 
tillich once observed he was the first nonjewish academician 
to be so honored emigrating to the united states he became a 
citizen and taught for 32 years at new yorks union theological 
seminary harvard and the university of chicago 
in his gravelly accented voice he engaged students in searching 
dialogues relishing afterhours bull sessions 
his threevolume systematic theology and numerous other books 
interweave disciplines of history psychology political science 
art and philosophy he gained a wide audience among government and 
academic leaders believers and nonbelievers 
f forrester church a unitarian universalist minister terms 
tillich an apostle to the intellectuals adding in a 1987 
anthology the essential tillich 
we need a tillich to guide us through the perils of our age 
tillich said it was blasphemous and ridiculous to try to 
prove existence of an infinite god utterly beyond finite human 
categories 
yet he said humans realize their limited finitude and by that 
very fact transcend it in awareness of some potential infinity 
he says that realization is an existential pointer to god god 
is the answer to the question implied in mans finitude he said 
yet anxiety and doubt remain divine reality would not be that 
at all if people could verify it he said without conquered 
doubt there is no faith faith must overcome something it must 
leap over the ordinary processes 
faith is the courage that conquers doubt not by removing it 
but by taking it as an element into itself

out of friendship for one of the leaders martin buber was 
marching in a street procession as the marchers passed a cafe he 
locked gazes with a musician hed dined with the day before 
the musician apparently saw me alone and waved to me buber 
recounted straightway it seemed to me as though i were taken out 
of the procession and the presence of my marching friends and set 
there confronting the musician 
i forgot that i was walking along with the same step i felt 
that i was standing over there by the man who had called out to me 
and without a word with a smile of understanding was answering 
him 
by the time buber again became conscious of the procession around 
him the cafe was far behind 
the incident that minor transporting moment with the musician 
reflects the pervasive thesis of a man regarded as one of the 20th 
centurys greatest philosophers 
buber maintained that human wholeness its vitalizing reality 
exists only in between separate persons other creatures nature 
and god a connecting mutuality recognized only in genuine 
encounter 
all real living is meeting he said real living exists only 
in honest open giveandtake between separate selves an interflow 
that surpasses both and augments each 
through unaffected personal engagement in the encounter 
participants are lifted out of themselves he said the extended 
lines of relations meet in the eternal thou the center in 
the consummate reality of god 
in every genuinely open contact we are stirred by the breath 
of a thou that is of eternal life he said if you hallow this 
life you meet the living god 
bubers ideas spawned a widespread relational theology 
throughout christianity and also in judaism sometimes in simplified 
popular versions 
buber a jew whose christian wife converted to judaism was an 
influential figure in the expanding concourse between these linked 
traditions 
in his book about christianjewish ties two types of faith 
buber said from my youth onwards i have found in jesus my great 
brother 
that christianity has regarded and does regard him as god and 
savior has always appeared to me a fact of the highest importance 
which for his sake and my own i must endeavor to understand 
my own fraternally open relationship to him has grown ever 
stronger and clearer 
a short stocky man with a flowing white beard and disarming 
smile buber was born in austria and taught at universities in 
germany until silenced by the nazis in 1934 
emigrating to israel he taught at the hebrew university in 
jerusalem lectured widely and wrote many books including a german 
translation of the bible and his bestselling i and thou 
an hasidic scholar and independentminded zionist he advocated 
arabjewish cooperation and was criticized by some fellow jews for 
it his death in 1965 at age 87 prompted an unprecedented tribute a 
delegation of arab students placed a wreath on his grave 
for his relational theology buber coined an almost poetic 
terminology to distinguish between iit relations which reduce 
people and things to utilitarian objects and ithou relations 
which enhance and authenticate the being of both partners 
buber saw modern humanity as trapped in a selfinsulating i 
of individualism that hardens into the world of it 
in an atmosphere of depersonalizing forces and mechanized 
systems people adjust themselves to the apparatus as if mere 
cogs in it he said debasing mans power to enter into relation 
the sickness of our age is like that of no other age under 
the tyranny of the exuberantly growing it he said the 
quasibiological and quasihistorical thoughts of today have 
worked together to establish a more tenacious and oppressive 
fatalism than has ever before existed 
this is the exalted melancholy of our age that every thou in 
our world must become an it he said 
yet at times a person shuddering at the alienation between the 
i and the world comes to reflect that something is to be done 
buber said 
as when in the grave nighthour you lie racked by waking dream 
bulwarks have fallen away and the abyss is screaming and note 
amid your torment there is life if i could only get through to 
it 
buber sees earthly existence as a duality in which people 
necessarily objectify their surroundings as its so as to make 
for orderly arrangements bounded measured and codified 
this structuring is needed for functioning of institutions 
sciences and societies and is not itself evil but can be degrading 
if it is the predominating attitude he said adding 
without it man cannot live but he who lives with it alone is 
not a man 
to truly live requires a continual turning to relations he 
said a repeated crossing the threshold between a functional 
environment of things binding people most of the time and the holy 
place of dialogue connections and mutuality 
he said mere greetings can reflect the different dispositions 
such as the virtually impersonal hello how are you and the 
direct bodyrelated greeting of african kaffirs i see you 
the fuller reality the revealing by two people of the thou to 
one another can be seen especially in good marriages he said 
he who lives with a woman and brings her life to present 
realization in his is able to look in the thou of her eyes into a 
beam of the eternal thou he said 
buber says this enlarging connecting quality can be realized not 
only between persons but with all nature for example a cat or 
tree can be viewed merely as of a certain type dimension 
conformation and color but none of these is the whole being of 
the cat or tree he said 
if alert to the simple magic of life in nature there is a 
reciprocity of the being itself he said you say thou to the 
tree and give yourself to it and it says thou to you and gives 
itself to you something lights up and approaches us from the 
source of being 
buber attributes this innate reality of all created being to the 
primal the origin and says it shows up in primitive peoples 
intercourse with nature and in a young childs personification of 
toys animals and objects 
it is the instinct to make everything into thou to give 
relation to the universe he said 
an overshadowing peril to humanity is to sink into selfabsorbed 
individualism sundered from connected being buber said 
individualism neither shares in nor obtains any reality the 
more a man humanity is mastered by individuality the deeper does 
the i sink into the unreality of a hidden subterranean 
canceled existence 
he said people need to confirm one another in their 
individual being by means of genuine meeting it is from one man 
to another that the heavenly bread is passed

this fourth story of a fivepart christmas series 
on great modern theologians gods 20th century giants is about 
karl rahner and rudolf bultmann 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a reader once sent renowned roman catholic scholar karl rahner a 
cartoon depicting him as a brainy theological atomic physicist 
expounding from a desk high above others 
below him busy multipliers carve up his ideas handing the 
pieces down to popularizing simplifiers off to the side a 
puzzled jesus says i dont understand 
smiling about the cartoon in a 1979 interview rahner said it 
captures to a large extent the lot of theologians in modern 
times because their work is often regarded as unintelligible 
nonsense 
one should not get up on his high horse and decide that 
specific questions have been settled for another or for oneself 
he said especially today in our skeptical and relativistic age 
a modest unpretentious streak marked this 20th century 
theological giant who scaled the intellectual heights of faith and 
with a common touch rendered them in terms of ordinary life 
he said our limited humanity cant imagine the unconditional 
immeasurable god but he is already present in human existence 
silent and hidden it is a knowledge we cannot grasp but 
whereby we are grasped 
rahner is often called an incarnationalist or 
anthropocentrist who saw divine promptings in the human grain 
he wanted to focus more keenly on this internal presence rather 
than try to to drum into somebody an authoritative doctrine that 
is external 
rahner worked to bridge the gap between theological complexities 
and contemporary thought 
he also wrote gently of the gracebestowing significance of 
everyday living such as working playing laughing sleeping 
life bears a supernatural element that can be suppressed and also 
can be realized and experienced existentially from within he 
said to him that simple intimate indefinable mysticism of 
everyday life is the essence of christianity 
rahner called christ the revealing selfcommunication of 
god the mystery of god sharing himself with us 
this is a quiet unobtrusive process at work daily he said 
yet it is the great sign that god himself has directly intervened 
in the world 
rahner originated a new religious category anonymous 
christianity saying it embraced buddhists various other 
nonchristians and even athiests who are conscientious upright and 
caring 
some kind of faith in god is basically there whether they know 
it or not he said they are a part of a christianity that does 
not call itself christianity pagans who have received grace 
but who are not aware of it 
rahner tangled often with vatican authorities who at times 
castigated and even silenced him but they never shifted him from 
his humanizing tack 
ecclesiastical dignitaries tend to embrace elaborate dogmas 
on which modern man is quite incapable of basing his faith he 
commented 
despite his conflicts with officialdom rahner emerged as an 
influential adviser at the reforming second vatican council of 
196265 
his last book unity of the churches an actual possibility 
which he wrote with fellow german catholic theologian heinrich 
fries jolted churchdom it declared that all main branches of 
christianity protestant eastern orthodox and roman catholic 
sufficiently agreed on basic concepts to unite in one church 
this unity is a matter of life or death for christiandom at a 
time when faith in god and christ are most seriously threatened 
wrote rahner and fries 
they proposed that traditions of each denomination be continued 
within a unified church recognizing the popes leadership but 
without binding authority making churchwide decisions in inclusive 
councils and sharing pulpits and holy communion 
rahner a jesuit priest was a friend of another theological 
titan rudolf bultmann a fellow german lutheran and 
groundbreaking thinker who modified the contours of contemporary 
theology 
he like rahner sought to link theology and modern thought but 
in a more radical way 
theology will never be the same because of bultmann never 
ever said american methodist scholar shubert m ogden 
bultmann the most controversial of the centurys theological 
stars was attacked in many countries as a heretic for his 
demythologizing of the bible 
the bibles prescientific view of a universe with heaven above 
hell below and earth between traversed by angels and demons was 
incredible to modern man he maintained he said it should be 
replaced with an updated worldview that preserved the profound 
meanings inside the obsolete framework 
he said stripping away the antiquated trappings of the new 
testament would clarify the basic message so it could be heard that 
message he said is the power of gods word which encounters man 
in the proclamation of jesus christ 
christ is god breaking in bultmann said 
he regarded jesus as a historical figure and his crucifixion as 
factual much however about the life of jesus his miracles the 
resurrection and his ascent into heaven were myths the early 
christians used to explain how jesus reconciled humanity to god 
bultmann said 
to bultmann myths were not fairy tales but covers for deep 
realities the resurrection he said shows death is not a sinking 
into nothing but that the same god who is always coming to us 
also meets us in our death 
bultmann 91 when he died in 1976 remained a powerful influence 
on protestant and catholic biblical studies although his views were 
spurned by literalists his existential approach somewhat resembled 
that of rahner who nevertheless adhered more thoroughly to 
classical interpretations 
rahner died in 1984 at the age of 80 
we are living in the midst of a transitional period of great 
scope and depth that threatens faith but holds eventual promise 
for it rahner said humanity he said is fashioning an utterly new 
environnment in which technology replaces nature itself 
while nature once seemed mysterious we no longer live in 
nature we transform it he said in wide areas we do not face a 
nature that god has made but one that we have made 
like nature the manstructured environment remains finally 
uncontrollable and more dangerous its future shrouded in 
mist he said instead of mystery arising from nature it now is 
welling up out of man himself 
while religious elements in man temporarily have been 
pushed into the background rahner said man has only to make 
himself at home again in his new environment as he once was in 
nature and his religious awareness will arise again to a degree 
and extent hardly imaginable today 
as in such an atmosphere bultmann noted that often when first 
listening to a symphony the basic melody eludes the listener 
because you are deafened by the fullness of detail and a 
veritable sea of sounds and impressions 
but in a while he said as with one magicial stroke a single 
unified world emerges from the confused welter of sound and it 
becomes clear that the fundamental tone was there all the time 
so it is in discerning the mighty note of god in the 
temporary confusion bultmann said it is always the same old 
theme endlessly proceeding in ever new ways always more 
tempestuous always more powerful

the final installment of a fivepart christmas 
series on great modern theologians gods 20th century giants 
concerns reinhold niebuhr and dietrich bonhoeffer 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
before a roomful of notables gathered to honor him an elderly 
reinhold niebuhr ticked off various trends that he saw as making a 
mess of the world he paused grinned and said but i like it 
he relished the struggles for good in this clamorous world and 
for a halfcentury stayed wholeheartedly in their midst striving 
for sense and reason 
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh he frequently 
said quoting a psalm about gods laughter at humanitys blustering 
presumptions of absolute solutions 
the whole drama of human history is under the scrutiny of a 
divine judge who laughs at human pretensions without being hostile 
to human aspirations he said 
upholding what he termed christian realism niebuhr is 
generally regarded as the centurys premier american theologian 
no one else could speak with such authority to christian jew 
and nonbeliever wrote historian richard fox in a 1987 biography 
he was assuredly an american phenomenon 
often quoted by presidents and statesmen he was both incisive 
thinker and working dynamo a media commentator social critic 
political organizer prolific author and seminary professor 
at new yorks union theological seminary he customarily reserved 
thursday nights for at home conversations with students nimbly 
dissecting their questions striding the room and trailing cigarette 
smoke 
niebuhr sought to establish relevance and working 
applicability of faith to the world he disdained sanctimony and 
cant in both religion and politics 
after accusing president richard nixon of court piety in the 
white house and madness in expanding the vietnam war niebuhr 
said god told us to love our enemies not to like them 
while niebuhr said inherent sin was the one church doctrine 
thoroughly verified by history he also insisted doggedly on the 
undetermined possibilities of the good and the obligations to 
realize them in this world always recognizing there will be 
some corruption as well as deficiency of virtue and truth in 
every achievement 
he saw christ as the final perfection of man impossible 
possiblity citadel of hope and moral beauty the 
redemptive force 
christ is the symbol of ultimate reality who reveals that 
selfsacrificial love though crushed by history rises above it 
niebuhr said 
humanitys existence is never fulfilled he said this is the 
final enigma for which there is no answer except by faith and 
hope 
this was the prodding christian realism that niebuhr injected 
into the political sphere he himself abandoned early socialism and 
pacifism as unreal idealisms and saw prospects in this world as 
always fragmentary a matter of compromises and tradeoffs for 
partial relative good 
often he said there are no clearcut right decisions only 
ambiguous alternatives and the hope that good outweighs evil for 
instance nuclear deterrence leaves both superpowers clinging to 
nuclear weapons for security yet standing in terror of them 
a sorry predicament he said but imposed by circumstances 
he saw reality as shot through with irony ambiguity contradiction 
and paradox 
the biblical interpretation of the human situation is ironic 
rather than tragic or pathetic he said since people are free to 
do good but in their predatory selfinterest do not 
niebuhr helped pull americans from early isolationist attitudes 
toward hitler and urged opening us shores to european jews he was 
among the first christian theologians to oppose attempts to convert 
jews 
in the prelude to world war ii he brought to union theological 
seminary a brilliant young lutheran scholar dietrich bonhoeffer 
whom he had met in europe 
in 1930s germany bonhoeffer had been a marked man to gestapo 
eyes having early assailed hitlers antijewish doctrines 
brought to america for safety in 1939 he remained only a short 
time telling niebuhr he had to share the trials of this time with 
my people he returned worked with the resistance ran an 
underground seminary and joined the abortive plot by german officers 
to assassinate hitler 
confined in a series of concentration camps he was hanged april 
9 1945 at age 39 shortly before the camp was liberated by 
american troops 
a christian realist of niebuhrs stripe bonhoeffers widely 
read writings such as the cost of discipleship and letters 
and papers from prison have made him another of the centurys 
theological giants 
like niebuhr he said christians should not withdraw into 
otherworldliness but plunge into the secular world struggling and 
suffering as christ did to work some good 
he said this world come of age with all its technical 
advances seems to round itself off without god feeling 
increasingly able to deal with its questions without recourse to 
conventional religion 
he called for a religionless christianity stripped of its 
concentration on private piety and otherworldliness and lived in 
deeds of service to participate in the suffering of god in 
christ 
it should not be faith that flees the world but the one that 
endures the world he said 
he said god was not on the borders of life but at its center 
we should find god in what we do know not in what we dont 
those who evade the earth do not find god they find a world 
beyond to be sure but one that is not gods world that world 
which is dawning in this world 
in a similar vein niebuhr said 
the new world must be built by resolute men who when hope is 
dead will hope by faith who will neither seek premature escape from 
the guilt of history nor yet call the evil which taints all their 
achievements good 
concerning latterday forms of escapism niebuhr said 
insecurities of our age strongly tempt this generation not to 
utopianism of yesterday but to flight into any kind of storm cellar 
of religious security tied to otherworldliness irresponsible to 
the present world 
he denounced americas consumer culture and 
moralsounding political deceptions its religious smugness 
and easy answers 
he assailed the 1963 supreme court decision outlawing school 
prayer saying it suppressed free exercise of religion and 
imposed a secular philosophy that is itself a religion 
he saw will to power as the essence of politics restrained 
only by the checksandbalances of the us constitution 
mans capacity for justice makes democracy possible he said 
but mans inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary 
beginning as a lutheranreformed pastor in detroit where his 
prolabor tangles with the auto industry drew national attention he 
shifted to union seminary his base for 32 years after retirement 
he served on various study commissions and still poured out a 
torrent of books and articles he died in 1971 shortly at 78 
the human story is too grand and too awful to be told without 
reverence for the mystery and the majesty that transcends all human 
knowledge he said 
only humble men who recognize the mystery and the majesty are 
able to face both the beauty and terror of life without exulting 
over its beauty or becoming crushed by its terror

on a sultry day last summer a lifelong con 
died behind bars revealing a terrible secret hidden for a decade 
he had gotten away with murder 
finally made public was a confession the inmate had shared with 
his attorney 10 years earlier a confession to a killing for which 
another man the victims husband had served 13 years in prison 
his words true or false have resurrected an old crime and 
raised new questions about whether justice was denied a young man in 
a nebraska courtroom more than three decades ago 
this is a tale of two men and a tragedy the 1955 murder of 
nancy parker her husband darrel confessed but quickly recanted 
and later claimed the confession had been coerced twentythree 
years later and nearly a decade after parker was freed death row 
inmate wesley peery confessed on the condition his statement be 
released only after he died 
peerys death in july broke the seal of confidentiality and 
although some still insist parker is guilty he hopes to clear his 
name he has appealed to the nebraska board of pardons which meets 
dec 15 a day after the 33rd anniversary of the crime 
the threemember panel which has been given a sealed transcript 
of peerys confession will decide whether to pardon parker reject 
his request or hold a hearing with witnesses next year 
the confession was among two years of taped and written 
interviews peery gave in hopes a book would be written about his 
exploits in the interviews he boasted of killing 12 people over 
four decades 
lawyers for peery and parker are convinced an innocent man was 
sentenced to life in prison in 1956 
its a horrible miscarriage of justice said attorney stanley 
cohen who represented peery and taped the interviews from 1978 to 
1980 its hard to imagine what somebody was going through 
spending 13 yearsplus in prison and another 18 years after being 
released not being able to show he was wrongly convicted of a 
murder 
but others discount peerys confession and maintain justice 
prevailed 
he did it theres no question in the world about it said 
eugene masters retired head of detectives who questioned parker 
they come up with this fairy tale and wait till the mans dead 
parker 57 released in 1969 after an appeals court said his 
rights had been violated has remarried and is now parks supervisor 
in moline ill other than expressing relief parker refused comment 
when contacted by telephone 
but his lawyer richard bruckner said parker had told him he 
knew or hoped all the time hed be cleared of this he said 
all i want is a piece of paper a complete pardon finally clearing 
my name 
sure he has bitterness bruckner added but he says what 
good is that going to do he has to go on with his life 
darrel parkers experiences with the criminal justice system 
began dec 14 1955 when he came home for lunch and found the 
partially clad body of nancy ellen his wife of little more than a 
year on their bed 
the 22yearold woman had been strangled her hands were bound 
and shed been gagged with her husbands handkerchiefs evidence 
showed she had been raped 
peery a coworker of parkers who had a criminal record was 
questioned because his ford had been parked nearby that morning but 
peery said he often drove through the area taking his mother to 
work peery passed a polygraph test masters said 
parker in iowa for his wifes funeral was summoned to help with 
the investigation he was not told he was a suspect bruckner said 
when he returned to lincoln he was hooked up to a lie detector and 
questioned by john reid a noted chicago criminologist and polygraph 
expert 
parker later testified he had no lawyer and gave no permission to 
be questioned this all happened before the supreme courts miranda 
decision which gave suspects the right to attorneys and a warning 
they can remain silent 
parker testified he feared reid who sat kneetoknee with him 
grasped parker by the chin stroked his head as if i were some 
kind of animal and threatened hed fry if he didnt produce 
his wifes missing watch it never was found 
parker said reid accused his wife of refusing me relations 
and suggested she was probably running around with another man 
parker insisted his marriage was sound 
parker testified that in several hours of questioning he 
repeatedly denied killing his wife but masters says parker knew 
all the details he said he hit her in the left eye which was 
true he said he knocked the lamp off the table which was true 
there were 13 things in the confession that no one in the world but 
he could know about 
bruckner however said reid took details from investigators and 
fed them to parker until he parroted them reid just kept working 
on him the words in the confession were john reids not his he 
said 
reid is dead but fred inbau professor emeritus at northwestern 
law school who assisted him insists talk of a forced confession is 
a lot of nonsense 
but in 1969 an appeals court said the confessions were coerced 
and involuntary and reids activities clearly went beyond 
approved standards it ordered parker be given a new trial or 
freed he was on parole until 1975

until his parole parker was imprisoned at the nebraska state 
penitentiary where peery eventually wound up on a rape conviction 
later reversed 
bruckner said peery taunted parker saying darrel if your 
folks could put up money for my bond i can lead you to the guy who 
killed your wife i can tell you where the suitcases belonging to 
mrs parker are darrel didnt even know suitcases were missing 
peery had been in and out of prison since his teen years on 
charges including robbery and burglary in 1976 he was sentenced to 
death for fatally shooting a woman in a coin shop 
he was king when he had a gun said cohen who defended him 
in that case he had no conscience 
while appealing the murder conviction peery said he hoped a book 
could be written that would provide income for his relatives after 
his death and cohen began taping interviews with his client 
having heard rumors about peerys possible involvement in the 
parker murder the attorneys asked him he took credit for it 
right away cohen said 
according to cohen peery drew a blueprint of the parker house 
with correctly placed furniture and recounted birthmarks on mrs 
parkers chest he also provided one critical detail of the crime 
that had never been publicized that the attacker had ejaculated on 
the womans thigh 
peery also said hed taken mrs parkers watch and eventually 
fenced it 
peery confessed to other murders cohen said and in some sketchy 
checking of a few they turn out to be exactly what he says 
when he talked about the murders he would smirk and smile and 
display a sense of pride added toney redman cohens partner and 
a distant cousin of parker its kind of like a little kid 
bringing out his cub scout awards 
the attorneys became convinced peery was the killer but they had 
sworn to withhold the information that was our agreement with 
him cohen said even though he was a murderer that doesnt 
mean my word isnt any good 
but masters now asks why on earth if a couple of attorneys had 
this story would they wait till the mans dead 
after peerys death at age 56 the attorneys talked with 
bruckner who has represented parker 24 years 
bruckner said hed always had a fantasy that he would run down 
as they strapped peery in the electric chair and say clear 
yourself with god and tell me you did it 
today he has an inkandpaper transcript

some younger pupils stifled yawns and 
fidgeted as the strains of camille saintsaens second piano 
concerto in g minor played by the school orchestra filled the 
assembly hall 
thus began another day at rugby for 730 youngsters of the latest 
generation to have minds refined and upper lips stiffened by that 
durable and distinctively british institution the public school 
piles of schoolbooks lay in a misty rain around the doorway of 
the temple speech room the hall is a place for concerts speeches 
and other important events so the distraction of books is not 
permitted inside 
traditions die hard if at all at this 421yearold school in 
the english midlands where the game of rugby was invented and 
thomas arnold that great victorian and rugby headmaster set his 
1857 novel tom browns schooldays arnolds tale of courageous 
young tom pitted against the evil bully flashman embodied the 
physical bravery selfreliance school loyalty patriotism and 
muscular christianity that built the british empire 
those ideals still are preached at rugby eton harrow and other 
public schools as britains feepaying private schools are 
paradoxically known even as a more egalitarian age forces change on 
the system 
morning chapel is obligatory at rugby nearly all pupils study 
latin and on thursday afternoons they must train as military 
cadets or do community work in the town of rugby 
shrouded in legend beloved and reviled public schools have 
weathered the leveling forces of socialism advance of women 
postwar revolution in education permissiveness drugs and recession 
they now enjoy a revival as the breeding ground of the british 
elite educating the sons and increasingly the daughters of the 
wealthy for fees of 7000 pounds 13000 or more a year 
public schools always have been praised for the best and blamed 
for the worst of british life 
after the duke of wellingdon defeated napoleon at waterloo in 
1815 perhaps the most famous quote about public schools was 
attributed to him the battle of waterloo was won the playing 
fields of eton the iron duke also has been quoted as saying he 
never said it 
novelist henry fielding on the other hand described public 
schools as the nurseries of all vice and immorality 
defenders see them as incubators of genius and say the 
institutions must be elitist to do their job to them the schools 
embody the finest british characteristics modesty individualism 
gallantry and honesty 
detractors savage them as perpetuators of class division 
snobbery sexual perversion cruelty and sexism public schools it 
is claimed turn englishmen into homosexuals or soviet agents or 
both and make them adolescents for life 
neil kinnock leader of the socialist labor party says public 
schools are the very cement in the wall that divides british 
society 
moreover the schools are accused of focusing so heavily on the 
classics and humanities that britain is afflicted by a debilitating 
antiscience mentality 
its a closed society like an army barracks a prison or a 
monastery protective cosseted and also unbelievably harsh says 
writer william boyd a graduate of rugged gordonstoun in scotland 
his play good and bad at games portrays the fine line between 
horrors and glories in public school life 
if you fit in you can enjoy levels of acclaim fame celebrity 
at the age of 17 18 that you cannot reproduce in your adult life 
boyd 36 said in an interview but if youre unpopular at these 
schools its nightmarish 
from banking politics and the professions to the military the 
diplomatic corps and civil service public school graduates retain a 
disproportionate influence 
although only 7 percent of british children are educated by the 
2500 feepaying schools they capture nearly half the places at 
oxford and cambridge each year 
only a fraction go to very top schools like eton or rugby their 
graduates however include robert walpole winston churchill and 18 
other prime ministers such eminent foreigners as king hussein of 
jordan and jawaharlal nehru the first prime minister of independent 
india noted lawyers writers philosophers scientists and 
sportsmen and more than half prime minister margaret thatchers 
cabinet 
mrs thatcher a grocers daughter went to one of the 
statesubsidized grammar schools which lost their subsidies in 
1976 and became either private or entirely statefinanced 
many public schools approached bankruptcy in the 1960s and 1970s 
beset by hostile labor governments student revolts high taxes and 
intense rivalry from the grammar schools 
two decades later they flourish with waiting lists longer than 
ever they rallied by rewriting curriculums with the stress on 
examination results subsidizing poorer students and making more 
room for nonboarders 
they ended such harsh traditions as initiation rites beatings 
and fagging 13yearolds acting as servants to the 
18yearolds flogging was stopped two years ago 
girls are admitted to the sixth form equivalent to 12th grade 
and dormitories have been divided into private rooms some masters 
even call students by their first names 
isolation from parents the opposite sex and social inferiors is 
gone and today new money predominates sixty percent of parents 
with children at public schools did not attend them 
socially the schools are as exclusive as ever but in every 
other way they are much more in touch with the currents of 
contemporary life john rae former headmaster at londons elite 
westminster school wrote in the times 
at rugby a montage of victorian gothic tudor and modernistic 
school buildings surround the close a rectangular sports field 
a carved stone commemorates the first game of rugby in 1823 when 
william webb ellis with a fine disregard for the rules of 
football as played in his time first took the ball and ran with 
it 
at lunch in michell house one of 15 boarding houses 60 pupils 
grouped by age stood stiffly as grace was mumbled quickly then sat 
down to a meal of sausages green beans and potatoes and gravy 
its the cooks day off a senior boy told a visitor in 
apology 
rugby boys wear tweed jackets and dark trousers eton still 
insists on tails and starched collars but its archrival harrow 
settles for tails on sundays and formal occasions only winchester 
requires academic gowns in classes 
classes are limited to 15 boys at rugby and about 80 percent of 
the graduates will attend universities more than five times the 
average of 15 percent for all british graduates of lower schools 
eighteen modern languages are offered including chinese and 
russian 
in 1859 rugby challenged the landed gentrys distaste for 
technical education by pioneering science instruction half the 
seniors now study science and six of the 17 science teachers have 
doctorates 
the school employs a fulltime public relations officer and 
publishes a glossy promotional brochure 
foreigners and nonboarders each make up 10 percent of rugbys 
pupils and 20 percent of students are helped by an annual aid fund 
of 400000 pounds 750000 under weeklong exchanges with state 
schools students learn how the other half lives by sharing each 
others classrooms and homes

joe was a fabulous swimmer no one i ever knew looked as 
graceful as he did in the water he just had a hard time on land 
nick eaton whose brother joe died on a san francisco 
sidewalk last week after a sad life of alcholism and failed 
opportunity

joseph emerson eaton jr born to wealth and 
privilege in boston met death as a homeless alcoholic tossed 
unconscious from a fast food restaurant to die alone on a cold 
sidewalk in san franciscos tenderloin 
eaton was an unlikely member of the citys legion of street 
people and family riches couldnt overcome his love of vodka or the 
despair he felt after losing his lover to aids a year ago 
his crumpled lifeless body became as invisible to dozens of 
passersby in those chilly hours of early saturday morning as the 
hundreds of other huddled forms that line the citys streets and 
crowd into doorways 
advocates for the homeless have seized upon eatons death at age 
38 as a symbol of the homeless crisis and public callousness 
if he had been a middleclass person at a restaurant anywhere 
else in town and passed out theyd have called for an ambulance or 
the cops if he was drunk said the minister who discovered eatons 
body they wouldnt just throw him out onto the sidewalk and let 
him lay there and die 
eatons lonely death has raised questions about societys 
responsibility for the homeless but his life was a story of sadness 
and failed opportunity 
a prep school graduate and the grandson of a boston banker 
family members said eatons troubles began when he started drinking 
at 13 
after years of battling alcohol eatons final tailspin began as 
he was mourning the death of the man who had inspired him to forsake 
the bottle 
it ended when he collapsed over a bacon cheeseburger at a carls 
jr restaurant around midnight dec 2 he died after a security 
guard thinking eaton was drunk dragged him outside into the 
48degree cold and left him in a misshapen pile 
almost five hours later the rev thomas flower an eastern 
orthodox monk who feeds hundreds of homeless people from his van 
recognized eaton and discovered he was dead the exact cause of 
death will not be known for at least a week pending results of 
toxicology tests 
in an ironic twist to an already tragic story the guard was 
himself homeless before he was hired by the restaurant 3 years ago 
eaton grew up the son of privilege in duxbury mass a 
welltodo suburb of boston his late grandfather charles freedom 
eaton jr cofounded investors bank amp trust co his father joseph 
sr is a retired business executive 
but eatons alcoholism systematically destroyed whatever 
stability his familys wealth provided according to friends and 
family 
he was an alcoholic said eatons older brother nick a 
contractor in new hampshire he was also a person who was gay and 
i think that it took him a long time to come to grips with that and 
to start feeling really good about himself 
although nick disputes it some friends say joes homosexuality 
was a source of family tension 
the family had limitations on how much they could accept joe 
because of his homosexuality said one friend stephen irvine 43 
of san francisco 
the family repeatedly paid eatons enrollment fees at some of the 
nations most expensive alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs 
but eaton repeatedly fell off the wagon 
irvine who last saw eaton almost a year ago on the eve of his 
beginning yet another treatment program said his friend didnt 
struggle with his drinking problem but went right head first into 
it 
when friends would intervene with his drinking it was as 
though hed get just clearheaded enough to recognize his despair 
and plunge out said irvine vodka he really liked vodka 
eatons sponsor in alcoholics anonymous for six years said 
eatons problems were not with his family but with himself 
sobriety is for people that want it said skip b who 
withheld his last name in compliance with aa tradition im really 
sorry it ended this way but i cant say im surprised 
i like joe as a person skip said later lapsing into present 
tense hes a nice guy and i somehow felt that under all that 
booze there was somebody trying to get out i just figured that 
someday maybe hed get it 
although irvine and some of eatons acquaintances on the streets 
accuse family members of using their wallets to say what their 
hearts could not others portray a man trapped in selfdestruction 
refusing to take responsibility for his life 
eaton never went to college and worked as a chef and a florist 
when he was sober after some years in denver he came to san 
francisco in 1981 the next year he was arrested on drug charges 
eatons life turned around when he met phillip coleman through 
aa they became lovers and lived together for five years until 
colemans death of aids in november 1987 eaton stayed clean and 
sober 
irvine said eaton just adored and lived through coleman but 
after his lovers death eaton had no real desire to go on all 
the life hed known was dead i think he was a passive suicide 
eaton who knew he had aidsrelated complex spent a lot of time 
drinking alone in the apartment the couple had shared according to 
skip 
he lost his job as a florists driver finally in late january 
nick flew out packed eatons belongings and enrolled him in a 
7000 onemonth program at st marys hospital in minneapolis 
when eaton returned to san francisco he lived with skip 
rentfree for several months but quickly returned to sporadic heavy 
drinking 
he asked his family if he could move back east nick agreed and 
was readying a cabin on his property 
but family members had agreed with joe after the minneapolis 
treatment that if he came home he should be sober and if he 
started drinking again he had to bear responsibility 
he felt very strongly about that said nick emphasizing that 
his brother had not requested any assistance this time i think he 
was trying to prove himself he was making an effort not that 
night i guess to pull it together 
i think he was having one last fling

eaton lost his home with skip after passing out during a binge 
and starting a minor fire with a lit cigarette the landlord ordered 
him out and skip who said he doesnt give up on people had to 
comply 
on nov 13 the day skip turned him out eaton landed in an 
intensive care unit in a coma with a bloodalcohol level experts 
said could have killed him 
the last i heard from him was friday hours before his death 
when he called to see if his welfare check had arrived said skip 
that same day he called nick to ask if the family would pay for 
one more treatment program nick promised they would 
compared to many of the citys thousands of homeless eaton had a 
short life on the streets yet his death has refocused attention on 
the problem and the inadequacy of support programs 
these are our people said rev cecil williams pastor of 
glide memorial united methodist church and a frequent spokesman for 
the citys underpriviliged weve got to make sure our people 
dont need to go through serious misery from year to year before 
something is done 
john crew a lawyer with the american civil liberties union said 
eatons death is another tragic example of how this society has 
not dealt with the fundamental social and health issues of 
homelessness 
a spokesman for the restaurant that put eaton on the street said 
the eatery had no choice 
if somebody is obviously passed out drunk were not going to 
have people sleeping in our restaurant no one is said carls jr 
spokesman paul mitchell he said the same thing takes place one 
two or three times a night 
the eaton family plans no legal action against the restaurant or 
the guard who ejected joe as the man who discovered eatons body 
said at an informal street memorial service tuesday the time for 
anger is past 
it is time for reconciliation said flower the best 
memorial for joseph eaton is reconciliation 
one of the mourners was barry tompkins who used to be homeless 
he said it is easy to become anonymous living on the streets 
people just walk by he said i dont think anybody knew he 
was wealthy nobody really cared you sort of lose your identity 
when you live like this you can get caught said tompkins 
its not easy to break out youve got to have dreams youve got 
to have something to pull yourself out

mikhail gorbachevs peacemaking efforts got a mixed reaction in 
the financial markets strengthening the dollar depressing gold and 
causing shrugs of indifference among stock and bond traders who 
dismissed the soviet leaders remarks as old news 
gorbachev told the united nations on wednesday the soviet union 
would cut troop strength by half a million and reduce the number of 
conventional arms speculation on tuesday that he would make an 
announcement along those lines already had pushed up stock and bond 
prices 
but in the currency markets traders reacted enthusiastically to 
gorbachevs speech and bid the dollar higher against major 
currencies 
they reasoned that reduced soviet military spending would give 
george bushs incoming administration a greater chance of cutting 
this countrys staggering budget deficit which many economists 
consider a longterm threat to the dollars value and the economy in 
general 
all of a sudden when the gorby stuff came out people said gee 
maybe bush will have flexibility to do some budget cutting said 
james hohorst director of foreign exchange at manufacturers hanover 
trust co in new york this is leading to a reassessment of the 
dollar 
prospects of a peaceful world apparently were too much for the 
gold market however and traders dumped bullion aggressively gold 
historically has been considered a safehaven investment during 
times of international tension prices dropped by as much as 4 an 
ounce in new york to the 42250 level 
in the bond market prices retreated largely because of traders 
taking profits from the rally on tuesday when speculation about 
gorbachevs peace speech incited the biggest rally in three months 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond lost point or 
about 375 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to price and often indicates broader interest rate trends 
rose to 897 percent from 892 percent late tuesday 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average which shot up 
more than 25 points tuesday in a spillover from the bond market 
rally added 427 points to close at 215363 reflecting a muted 
reaction to gorbachevs speech

the united states spent more than 2 billion to 
hold down the dollars value in foreignexchange trading during 
august and september but it started to support the currency the 
following month a federal reserve report shows 
the latest quarterly foreignexchange report issued wednesday by 
the federal reserve bank of new york said the fed and the treasury 
department sold 2136 billion for the equivalent west german marks 
several times between aug 5 and sept 26 
on oct 31 both agencies sold 200 million in japanese yen to buy 
dollars the report said 
sam y cross an executive vice president of the new york fed 
said the operations were designed to maintain market stability and 
generally were coordinated among the central banks of the 
socalled group of seven nations besides the united states the g7 
includes japan britain west germany france italy and canada 
the g7 has agreed to work together to stabilize the currency 
markets and reinforced those efforts at a special meeting in late 
september 
some of them intervention operations occurred at the same 
time but other times the us government acted alone after 
notifying its major trading partners cross told a news briefing 
wednesday 
currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of 
central banks in the open markets the feds policy however is to 
comment only well after the fact 
cross declined to specify the exact amount of the foreign banks 
intervention during the augustoctober period saying it was up to 
them to do so 
the dollarselling operations by the fed and the treasury came as 
the us currency was reaching its peak for the year especially 
against the mark where it traded at a high of 19230 marks on aug 
22 the dollar also was close to the 135yen level during that time 
still the dollar ended the augustoctober period 55 percent 
lower in value against the yen and 5 percent lower against the mark 
compared with the beginning of the period as sentiment toward the 
currency changed course according to the new york fed lately it 
has been trading in the markets at around 175 marks and 122 yen 
the dollars strength had come amid signs of an improving us 
trade deficit a growing economy and rising interest rates 
particularly in the early weeks of the feds latest reporting period 
on aug 9 the fed signaled its desire to cool down the economy 
and prevent inflation from accelerating by raising its discount 
rate or the interest charged on loans to member banks 
the heaviest intervention occurred between aug 5 and aug 23 
when the government bought 1806 billion worth of marks the fed 
report said the government also bought 230 million of marks 
between sept 14 and sept 22 and 100 million of marks on sept 
26 it said 
the oct 30 purchase of 200 million with yen was the only effort 
during the period to support the dollar the report said 
in the previous threemonth period from may to june us 
intervention totaled 293 billion solely through the sale of marks 
to resist upward pressure on the dollar 
cross said sentiment toward the dollar had turned decidedly 
bearish in october after central banks overseas started raising 
their interest rates and as the us economy was showing signs of 
slowing down falling oil prices also helped bring interest rates 
down in the united states 
the dollar reached its highest point of the decade in february 
1985 it declined slightly until september 1985 when g7 leaders 
agreed to lower its value to help narrow the us trade gap and 
stave off protectionist sentiment in congress 
the dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before 
rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988 it is now trading in a 
fairly narrow range

a top drexel burnham lambert inc trader has 
decided to cooperate in the governments criminal fraud probe of the 
wall street giant and its highyield bond financier michael milken 
but the impact of the defection is unclear and milken remains 
determined to prove his innocence in court 
sources familiar with the drexel case said wednesday that defense 
lawyers had expected the plea bargain by cary maultasch a trader 
who had been under especially heavy pressure by federal prosecutors 
to capitulate because he had been threatened with numerous 
indictments 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified also 
said milken was adamant about exonerating himself of any wrongdoing 
contradicting press accounts that suggested he had wavered and even 
entered into preliminary discussions with prosecutors about a 
possible guilty plea 
the defense was further said to believe maultaschs disclosures 
would not substantially damage drexel or milken who have been under 
intense investigation for more than two years but have maintained 
they are innocent 
news of the maultasch defection coincided with rampant 
speculation that a decisive turning point was near in the protracted 
legal travails of drexel one of the nations leading investment 
firms and a pioneer in the market for highyield highrisk 
securities commonly called junk bonds 
contrary to milkens position drexel has expressed interest in 
reaching a settlement with the government over asyet unfiled 
criminal securities fraud charges although any settlement would 
almost certainly involve a guilty plea and a heavy fine possibly in 
the hundreds of millions of dollars 
negotiations have taken place but one source said both sides 
remained substantially far apart as of wednesday 
it was unclear what new evidence could be provided by maultasch 
who struck a deal tuesday with the manhattan us attorneys office 
and the securities and exchange commission for his cooperation in 
exchange it is expected that he will not face prosecution on any 
serious charges 
sec aides and bruce baird the assistant us attorney for 
securities and commodities fraud would not comment on the maultasch 
development in accordance with their policy of official silence on 
pending investigations 
aubrey harwell a maultasch attorney was out of his office and 
did not return telephone calls for comment drexel spokesman steven 
anreder declined to comment 
drexel milken maultasch and two other senior aides at the firm 
were accused by the sec in a civil complaint filed three months ago 
of conspiring with nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky to 
commit a litany of frauds ranging from insider trading to stock 
manipulation 
a manhattan federal grand jury has been expected to indict the 
defendants on criminal charges that would likely include 
racketeering which carries enormous penalties 
some sources said that indictment was nearly filed last week but 
prosecutors delayed it perhaps as a pressure tactic to extract 
guilty pleas from the defendants 
an underlying problem facing prosecutors has been their one key 
witness boesky an admitted doublecrosser and liar who settled the 
biggest insider trading case in history by paying the sec a record 
100 million fine in 1986 
without additional witnesses to corroborate boeskys claims the 
governments case faces serious attack by the drexelmilken defense 
team comprised of some of the bestpaid legal talent in the country 
on its surface the maultasch defection was seen by some 
attorneys as possibly bolstering the governments case and 
encouraging others threatened with indictment to come forth to 
cooperate 
but others questioned why the government waited so long to strike 
a deal with maultasch suggesting it was largely a pressure device 
that was deliberately leaked to the press to amplify its effect 
federal prosecutors also have been seeking cooperation for the 
drexel investigation from partners in a much smaller firm princeton 
newport partners who were indicted on tax fraud and racketeering 
charges in august 
lawyers for the princeton newport defendants announced wednesday 
that the partnership had been dissolved blaming the move on the 
uncertainties raised by what they called prosecutor threats to file 
additional charges 
baird declined to comment on their accusation

a fullsize luxury ford sedan had the 
lowest insurance rates while two flashy sports coupes by general 
motors corp had the highest on allstate insurance cos annual list 
fords ltd crown victoria costs 35 percent to 50 percent less to 
insure than the standard rate while chevys camaro irocz28 and the 
pontiac firebird transam are being charged 100 percent to 140 
percent higher than standard rate levels for collision and 
comprehensive coverages allstate said 
the cars are among the automobiles on allstates list of 
insurance rates for 1987 and 1988 models of 119 foreign and domestic 
cars 
one of the things that we have found is that americanmade cars 
seem to be getting better treatment than foreign cars allstate 
vice president mike lamonica said wednesday attributing the 
difference to the cost of repair and parts and to theft records 
fortythree of the 49 cars being charged 10 percent to 40 percent 
less than standard rates were domestic models 
allstate rated the porsche 944 model and chryslers conquest as 
the secondmost expensive to insure charging drivers of those cars 
insurance rates 60 percent to 100 percent higher than standard rates 
the 1988 rating guide is based on the companys own loss 
experience for the collision and comprehensive portions of its auto 
policies the northbrookbased insurer said 
the cost of insuring a particular model is generally based on its 
price when new lamonica said 
but the loss experience or the amount allstate has paid out 
in claims for that model over time affects the insurance rate he 
said 
in its survey allstate assigned each car a standard rate based 
on the cars price when new and a hypothetical suburban chicago 
residence for the driver 
the standard annual rate for the ltd crown victoria had been 
550 but was reduced to 360 based on claims filed with allstate 
for that model lamonica said 
the transam initially was given a standard rate of 550 but that 
rose to 1296 based on allstates claim record for the car he said 
pontiac spokesman bill oneill blamed the transams high 
insurance costs on the cars theft rate and its popularity with 
younger mostly male drivers 
the firebird series especially the transam has among the 
highest theft rates in the country he said in a telephone 
interview 
it is a performanceoriented machine this is prime pickings 
for people who like to steal automobiles oneill said 
but he said the sports cars theft rate has dropped by about 50 
percent since last year when the automaker began equipping each car 
with a special ignition key without the key the car wont start 
for three minutes about the time it takes to steal a car 
susan kane a spokeswoman for chevrolet said all 1989 camaros 
would also be equipped with the pass key to help eliminate 
theft problems and possibly to lower insurance rates for the sports 
car 
in releasing its survey allstate denied claims by critics who 
say insurance companies arent doing enough to keep their prices 
down 
those critics are ignoring the fact that our research into 
repairability has led to our drive for stronger bumpers and cars 
that are easier and cheaper to repair said ray kiefer president 
of allstates personal property and casualty unit we share that 
information with auto manufacturers 
lamonica said allstate planned to give its rate results to 
manufacturers to encourage them to make better designs and to 
give customers an opportunity save insurance dollars

reflecting a rebound in consumer spending 
americans took out 356 billion more in consumer debt than they 
paid off in october the government has reported 
the federal reserve said wednesday that the october increase 
followed a tiny 2 million rise in debt during september the 
smallest change in six years consumer credit fell by 81 million in 
october 1982 at the bottom of the last recession 
the october advance which translated into credit growth at an 
annual rate of 65 percent was still down from the 875 percent 
annual rate of growth recorded over the first nine months of the 
year 
still analysts said they believed consumer spending was 
strengthening after a period of sluggishness they noted that retail 
sales shot up 09 percent in october the biggest gain in seven 
months 
the latest numbers suggest that consumers are a little more 
optimistic about buying said michael evans head of a washington 
consulting firm i think they are not fighting higher prices as 
much as they had in the past 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall economic 
activity newfound strength in the consumer sector has prompted some 
analysts to boost their projections for growth in the current 
octoberdecember quarter 
the 2 million advance for september represented a sharp revision 
from the original report a month ago that had put the rise in 
consumer debt at 188 billion fed officials said new data showing 
weaker activity in car sales accounted for much of the change 
the october increase was the strongest since a 532 billion rise 
in august 
auto loans rose by 132 billion in october after falling by 779 
million in september the poor showing in september was blamed on an 
absence of sales incentive programs that have boosted demand at the 
end of previous model years 
the category that includes credit card debt rose by 217 
billion up from a 11 billion september increase 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate edged up 
by 178 million in october they had declined by 158 million in 
september 
loans for mobile homes fell for the second straight month 
declining by 101 million after a drop of 169 million in september 
the various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally 
adjusted 65688 billion in october total consumer debt was 82 
percent higher than a year earlier

continued efforts by government regulators to 
close or rescue failed institutions brought an increase in savings 
and loan industry capital in october for the third consecutive 
month the government has reported 
the federal home loan bank board said wednesday that capital 
representing the difference between loans and other assets and 
savers deposits and other liabilities edged up by 507 million in 
october following advances of 247 billion september and 611 
bilion in august 
through the first 10 months of the year sampl capital has risen by 
294 billion compared with a loss of 307 billion in the same 
period of 1987 
the bank board began increasing the pace of sampl rescues in 
midaugust rescues in effect wipe out the red ink of the failed 
institutions by transferring it to the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp the agency that insures deposits up to 100000 
the agency has dealt with more than 150 troubled institutions so 
far this year 
meanwhile deposits increased by 390 million in october 
representing the first net increase in deposits since april 
the october net increase in deposits represented a sharp contrast 
to net withdrawals of 2 billion in september a year earlier there 
was a much larger deposit increase of 617 billion when investors 
sought a safe haven for their money after the october 1987 stock 
market crash 
the assets of federally insured sampls made up primarily of loans 
grew at an annual rate of 95 percent in october down from an 11 
percent growth rate in september 
abouth threefourths of the asset growth in october reflected a 
78 billion increase in mortgage holdings including purchases of 
mortgagebacked securities this followed a september increase of 
47 billion

those shares together with the shares already owned by farley 
represent about 563 percent of pepperells common shares farley 
said 
farleys offer is contingent on getting pepperells poison 
pill shareholder rights plan overturned in court the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta has scheduled a hearing on the 
matter for the week of jan 9 
farley chairman william farley said today he is confident of a 
successful conclusion to his bid for pepperell which is based in 
west point ga and whose products include gold toe socks 
on monday pepperell said it was offering early retirement to 
more than 800 employees on wednesday the company said it had 
notified about 400 employees of its cluett peabody amp co plant in 
troy ny that it may shut down that operation 
farley contrasted those cutbacks with its own announcement that 
it has created 9000 jobs at fruit of the loom since it acquired the 
company in 1985 
our emphasis at fruit of the loom is on job creation the 
company said today we believe pepperell and fruit of the loom 
would make a great team and that working together we would be 
better able to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive 
industry and create more jobs 
pepperell officials have disputed farleys stated intentions 
underscoring a statement by farley in a securities and exchange 
commission filing that he might consider selling some pepperell 
divisions if he succeeds in acquiring the company

from vodka to rifles to tractors to furs the 
fruits of the soviet economy were displayed today in an 
unprecedented trade show left somewhat less glittering by the 
absence of its chief sponsor mikhail s gorbachev 
the soviet leader who was to open the exhibit decided instead 
to cut short his new york visit and fly back to moscow today because 
of an earthquake that devastated three southern soviet republics 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said at a news conference 
late wednesday 
viktor kamentsev a deputy soviet premier opened the show along 
with c william verity the us secretary of commerce 
kamentsev urged a lowering of trade barriers between the united 
states and the soviet union and said his country was eager to 
increase its exports here he then rushed from the hall to catch a 
plane to moscow 
verity congratulating the soviets for gorbachevs 
electrifying united nations speech also hailed the improvement 
in trade between the two nations 
we believe this is an important step in building longterm 
mutually beneficial nonstrategic trade between the united states 
and the soviet union verity said 
despite gorbachevs noshow soviet sponsors hope the show an 
outgrowth of his policy of perestroika or restructuring will mark 
a major turning point in trade relations between the worlds two 
largest economies the show is scheduled to end dec 20 
by air and by sea the soviets have shipped hundreds of tons of 
products to the jacob k javits convention center in hopes of luring 
us dollars 
i think the soviets are saying that they are looking at the 
americans as a mostfavorednation trading partner said david 
wolstenholme whose american marketing firm has spent more than a 
year putting together the show you really only do this to someone 
you want to impress 
but some us trade experts say the soviet union is likely to 
remain among the most minor of american trading partners in part 
because the soviets lack the products that americans want and the 
money to buy what americans have 
i do not believe that significant sales will result said val 
zabijaka an economist on the soviet desk at the us commerce 
department i may be proven wrong 
by wolstenholmes reckoning the soviets are spending more than 
2 million to prove the nay sayers wrong including 700000 in 
advertising for the show 
we consider it to be very important said bagrat aroutiounov 
the soviet director of overseas exhibitions he said the event is 
the first pure commercial trade show ever mounted by the soviet 
union in this country 
previous trade shows had primarily political aims aroutiounov 
said and were intended to show off the advantages of a 
statecontrolled economy this years show has a single thoroughly 
capitalist goal profit 
furthermore aroutiounov said this will be the first time that a 
soviet trade fair has been financed by the participants 
cooperatives foreign trade organizations and enterprises and not 
the government 
the show officially titled the soviet export goods exhibition 
initially was scheduled to begin dec 14 but was hastily 
rescheduled to dec 8 to coincide with gorbachevs visit to new york 
fortyeight participants will display approximately 4500 
products including tractors toys computer programs jewelry 
cars bicycles vodka and hunting rifles the soviet house of 
fashion design will present fabulous russian furs as well as 
jackets and suits inspired by the soviet military uniform 
in addition some us companies have rented booths to show off 
the benefits of their business ties with the soviet union the 
soviets are looking not only for buyers wolstenholme said but for 
american companies willing to take part in joint business ventures 
i think mr gorbachev himself said that the only limit is the 
creativity of the american businessman he said 
but other observers see tougher barriers to improvements in 
ussoviet trade one limit is the soviet shortage of hard currency 
since the ruble cannot be converted into western currencies the 
soviets must pay for american goods and services with gold or 
western currency given the soviets trade imbalance with the west 
the policy has builtin limitations 
some have speculated that soviet economists would propose plans 
at the fair for making the ruble convertible aroutiounov said he 
expected the process would take two or three years maybe longer 
but us officials scoff at such suggestions you probably 
believe in santa claus too zabijaka said in reference to the 
soviet proposals 
according to commerce department figures the soviet union 
exported 500 million worth of products to the united states last 
year and imported 15 billion worth of american goods including 
900 million worth of grain 
that represents a sharp drop from the peak year of 
sovietamerican trade 1979 when the soviets imported 36 billion 
in us goods and exported 900 million to the us 
those levels dropped sharply when the us imposed a limited 
grain embargo in the wake of the soviet invasion of afghanistan and 
sharply reduced purchases of soviet goods

grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher 
today on the chicago board of trade on rumors later denied that 
the devastating earthquake in soviet armenia had damaged two nuclear 
power plants 
the rumors of nuclear involvement have now largely been 
discounted and the market is coming back to realize that although 
the loss of life is tragic the possibility of agricultural damage 
is pretty remote said richard feltes director of commodities 
research with refco inc a large chicagobased futures brokerage 
house 
soybean futures also were supported by reports that the south 
american soybean belt had received less rain overnight than traders 
had expected analysts said 
wheat futures got an additional boost from the agriculture 
departments announcement late wednesday that it had targeted china 
for 1 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
in early trading wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 427 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 4 cents higher with december at 260 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 4 cents higher with march at 214 a bushel soybeans 
were 8 cents to 11 cents higher with january at 779 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 15 cent to 40 cent lower with december at 
7140 cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent to 38 cent lower 
with january at 8205 cents a pound hogs were unchanged to 25 cent 
lower with december at 4087 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
47 cent lower to 18 cent higher with february at 4257 cents a 
pound

barry minkow was portrayed as a big 
spender by a prosecutor who said the onetime carpetcleaning king 
was motivated to defraud investors of millions of dollars not by 
threats but by his desire to live the good life 
assistant us attorney james asperger during his rebuttal 
arguments wednesday portrayed minkow as someone who committed fraud 
for his own personal gain 
he loved the high life he was motivated not by threats he was 
motivated by his own personal desires said asperger barry 
minkow was doing it for himself 
minkow on trial on fraud charges has testified that he bilked 
investors out of millions of dollars but did so only because 
mobsters had taken over his zzzz best carpetcleaning company and 
were threatening his life 
the jury was scheduled to receive instructions today beginning 
deliberations afterward 
minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities creditcard and 
mail fraud the government contends major banks and securities firms 
lost millions of dollars along with individual investors as a result 
of minkows alleged scheme 
during his closing arguments earlier wednesday minkows attorney 
accused the government of engineering a massive coverup of its 
failure to short circuit the 15 million zzzz best stock fraud 
attorney david kenner said the fbi improperly dropped a probe of 
minkows possible mob victimization in 1986 before his company hit 
wall street 
i think the government made a mistake said kenner they 
didnt do anything 
minkow who launched his carpetcleaning business at 16 in his 
parents garage became familiar to millions of californians through 
his television ads and talk show appearances 
but he admitted during the fourmonth trial that his business was 
86 percent fraud he had told investors that zzzz best was 
making a fortune restoring fire and water damaged buildings when no 
such jobs existed

the high court on thursday temporarily blocked 
general electric co plc and siemens ag from proceeding with their 
joint 17 billionpound or 31 billion bid for the british 
electronics company plessey co plc 
the court granted the injunction on the grounds that the 
gecsiemens bid violates the competition rules in the treaty of 
rome the founding charter of the european community plessey said 
the court injunction will remain in force until monday when a 
full hearing will take place in the high court 
gec which has no ties with the similarly named american company 
had no immediate comment said spokesman peter gillibrand neither 
did siemens spokesman rod tucker said 
plessey sai opportunity 
to let fmha know how they want to handle their debt under the new 
law if a farmer does not respond within the 45day period after 
receiving the notice the agency can begin collection proceedings 
including foreclosure and forced liquidation 
oneill said another point of misunderstanding is the manner in 
which local fmha offices have been carrying some of the borrowers on 
agency books for example he said some offices may not be 
including those whose overdue accounts have been accelerated or 
put into the foreclosure or forcedsale pipeline 
the 1987 law also changed the definition of a borrower to include 
anyone who owes fmha money so all those pastdue loans in 
acceleration and even those where the borrower is no longer 
farming are included in the list of delinquencies 
anytime you start playing with numbers its difficult at

agriculture secretary richard e lyng to acknowledge the vital 
contribution of farm families to the growth and strength of this 
great nation

bicentennial farms 
mizell said wednesday that a total of about 700 farms is expected 
to be located families wishing to submit applications may contact 
state and local usda and extension offices for more information

barrelmaker john tuttle survived a shipwreck off the coast of maine 
and found his way to dover conn to claim 15 acres granted him by 
charles i then king of england 
his decendant hugh tuttle and hughs three children still own

tw services inc recommended again thursday that 
its stockholders reject a 114 billion takeover offer by coniston 
partners calling the bid for the food services company too low 
tw services also urged shareholders to withdraw any shares 
already tendered in the bid which coniston has amended to 29 a 
share in cash for the 81 percent of the company it does not already 
own 
the tender offer is scheduled to expire tuesday 
in a letter to coniston tw services chairman frank l salizzoni 
called the offer illusory because it is conditioned on support from 
tws management for a merger agreement and on the withdrawal of tw 
services poison pill antitakeover defense 
your offer continues to be merely an invitation to enter into 
merger negotiations with you salizzoni said you are already 
aware of the boards lack of interest in entering into 
negotiations 
salizzoni said the board concluded the offer was too low 
keith r gollust a coniston partner responded if frank 
salizzoni or the board of directors really believes the offer is 
illusory then we challenge them to redeem the posion pill we are in 
a position to drop all the other conditions and purchase the 
shares 
coniston a new yorkbased investment firm that already owns 
about 93 million of tw services 486 million shares launched a 
tender offer for 1575 million shares in late october 
coniston announced nov 29 that nearly 302 million shares had 
been tendered which would give it almost 82 percent of tw services 
outstanding shares coniston said it would later acquire the 
remaining shares in a merger for 29 a share 
the twostep plan was designed to circumvent a delaware 
antitakeover law that restricts hostile bidders from building a 
stake in a company incorporated in that state 
under tw services poison pill defense plan purchases in 
excess of 20 percent would trigger a provision allowing stockholders 
to buy shares at half price making a takeover prohibitively 
expensive coniston is seeking to have the plan overturned in 
delaware chancery court

in 1982 the medianpriced existing home required 
a monthly payment of 702 in october 1988 the medianpriced home 
required only 588 a month to carry 
this is a story about the impact of interest rates and it is 
only beginning the 1982 house cost 67800 the 1988 house cost 
88100 that is the lowerpriced house cost 114 more to carry 
than the higherpriced one 
the explanation for this otherwise strange situation lies in the 
interest rates that prevailed in the two periods in 1982 the 
average interest rate was 1538 percent in october of this year it 
was 941 percent 
interest rates power housing markets consider this additional 
statistic in 1982 when home prices were lower monthly payments 
took 359 percent of median family income in october 1988 the 
percentage was only 222 
the significance of such figures compiled by the national 
association of realtors on the basis of 20 percent downpayments is 
becoming increasingly important now the reason being that home 
mortgage rates are rising 
its bad news for a lot of people 
while the immediate emphasis is likely to be on the growing 
difficulty of families to find affordable homes the impact is more 
widespread sellers may have to wait longer for a sale agents may 
face reduced income and possibly lose jobs builders conceivably 
could have to lay off workers 
no wonder therefore that the key forecasting tool of the entire 
housing industry is the level and direction of interest rates 
john tuccillo nar chief economist believes the higher trend of 
rates will last through the winter theyll continue higher for 
about five months he says and this will cause a further decline 
in affordability conditions 
the potential homebuyer who wont be hurt and might even be 
aided by these conditions is the allcash buyer while such people 
are rare they do exist most of them probably are those who have 
just sold another home 
for such people the possibility exists that interest rates will 
drive down prices they already have to a slight degree or at 
least place buyers in a stronger negotiating position 
worst hurt by rising rates are firsttime buyers 
tradeup buyers those who have owned and now wish to move up to 
a more expensive house at least have sufficient money for 
downpayments and closing costs firsttimers might have to count 
every nickel 
for firsttimers the temptation might be to postpone buying in 
the hope of lower interest rates next spring its a risk that could 
prove correct it could also boomerang since lower interest rates 
at any time of the year generally push up prices and in the spring 
this impact is intensified 
based on october prices and rates the nar offers this rough 
affordability guide for those planning to buy 
for buyers with income of 20000 the mortgage amount that can 
be handled is 50000 on a home price of 62500 
income 30000 mortgage 75000 home price 93800 
income 40000 mortgage 100000 home price 125000 
income 50000 mortgage 125000 home price 156300 
income 60000 mortgage 150000 home price 187500 
income 70000 mortgage 175000 home price 218000 
of course all this could change radically 
if interest rates rise prices might fall but in all probability 
they might not fall enough to offset the higher carrying charges if 
rates fall prices might rise but most likely not enough to offset 
the better rates 
watch interest rates theyre the key to the housing market

miller brewing co is going after younger 
drinkers with a pair of television commercials for its lite beer 
that parody traditional consumer product ads including rival bud 
lights ads with spuds mackenzie 
in one of the ads that debut sunday night a clay monkey 
elephant and lion dance with a lite beer in hand while an announcer 
says three out of four party animals preferred the taste of 
miller lite 
bud light which has enjoyed doubledigit sales growth recently 
has heralded spuds as the original party animal in its ads 
lite remains the clear leader in the lite beer category but 
miller executives hope the new ads will prove more appealing to 
drinkers ages 21 to 25 who may not relate to the exsports stars in 
lites longrunning tastes great less filling campaign 
miller says it has no intention of dropping the allstar campaign 
that lite has used for 15 years 
the ads will run concurrently as companion campaigns said 
spokesman bob bertini 
in addition to the party animals the new 30second ads use 
animation and offer irreverent parodies of wellworn ad techniques 
im not a beer drinker the smoothtalking celebrity 
spokesman says in one of the new ads but i play one on tv 
we are taking the position as a leader in the category that we 
have to stand out and take risks bertini said in a telephone 
interview from milwaukee we think viewers will respond to it 
he said the ads will be placed principally on latenight 
television shows that tend to attract young adults 
lite sold 192 million barrels in 1987 placing second only to 
budweiser the overall bestselling beer at an estimated 501 
million barrels according to the trade publication impact 
but lites sales were flat in 1987 for the first time in more 
than a decade while bud light sales jumped 212 percent to 8 
million barrels impact said 
bertini said lite sales are up this year but that its sales to 
the 2125 age category have not increased 
these young adults may not recognize the retired celebrities in 
the regular lite campaign but they should like the irreverence of 
the new ads he said 
in the first commercial a voice announces the new miller lite 
commercial backed with research

research and development spending by industry 
government universities and nonprofit organizations will increase 
46 percent next year but inflation will account for most of the 
rise a magazine predicted thursday 
research amp development magazine projected in its january issue 
that 1308 billion will spent on research next year compared to an 
estimated 125 billion for 1988 
we expect that research and develepment spending will be flat 
in constant dollars in 1989 said timothy kelly the magazines 
publisher 
the magazine attributed the leveling off to slow corporate 
growth a business climate focusing on shortterm profits a wave of 
mergers and acquisitions and expectations of smaller government 
outlays because of needs to reduce the deficit 
the 1988 spending level is about 7 billion lower than expected 
because of cuts in government and private financing the magazine 
said the government accounts for about half of the nations 
research spending

wheat futures prices closed substantially higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade on talk that china was set to 
bid for 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
analysts said 
soybean and oat futures also closed higher while corn was 
narrowly mixed 
the agriculture department announced late wednesday that it had 
targeted the chinese for 1 million metric tons of wheat under the 
export enhancement program and the trade talk is that they are 
bidding for wheat right now said ted mao a grain specialist with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
grain and soybean futures had opened sharply higher on fears that 
wednesdays devastating earthquake in soviet armenia had damaged two 
nuclear power plants in the area but those gains were quickly pared 
the markets managed to weed out what appears to be the truth 
which is that the reactors are operating without any difficulty 
mao said 
at the close wheat was 5 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 429 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 256 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 4 cents higher with december at 203 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents higher with january at

the 1988 christmas shopping season is off to a 
modestly good start although retailers in some parts of the country 
report warmer weather has put a damper on their holiday spirits 
were doing fine right on target miraed smith a 
spokeswoman at bloomingdales flagship store in manhattan said 
thursday 
frank deluca vice president of ij fox a boston furrier said 
his company has had steady if not spectacular sales increases 
since thanksgiving 
it looks solid and thats fine by me he said everybody 
likes growth but a nice steady growth to me is better than wild 
swings and rollercoaster rides 
at marshall fields the chicagobased department store at 
lunchtime especially in the downtown store you see so many people 
with big boxes and bags that its difficult to weave your way 
through the aisles said spokeswoman hillary rosenfeld 
fields expected to meet or exceed its target of a seasonal sales 
increase in the high single digits ms rosenfeld said adding 
each days sales definitely play right into that plan at least 
reaching that goal 
securities analysts who track the industry said the first two 
weeks of the season have been good and they are optimistic 
retailers will have moderately strong increases from the dismal 
performance of christmas 1987 
so far it looks positive but the proof of the pudding is the 
last 10 days when most shoppers are expected to make their 
purchases said monroe greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp 
co 
for most retailers christmas sales are slightly above plan 
said walter loeb an analyst with morgan stanley amp co inc 
loeb said the occurrence of hanukkah at the beginning of december 
this year shifted some shopping to the early part of the month 
but that sales of christmas gifts also were proceeding well 
the rest of the year will be quite good loeb predicted 
retailers across the country have gone into this christmas season 
with caution and lowered expectations because of a retail sales 
slump that is nearly two years old holiday sales last year were 
disappointing and many retailers slashed prices to bring customers 
into the stores 
this christmas there are sale signs up in many stores but 
they are not as widespread as they were a year ago greenstein said 
the analysts said sales will get a boost this season since 
calendar shifts have created two more shopping days than there were 
in 1987 
the fact that christmas falls on sunday this year is another help 
it gives you that major saturday on christmas eve which is 
going to be gangbusters said tom mccracken vice president for 
sales at crowley milner amp co which operates 10 department stores 
in michigan 
sales have slowed in areas such as the northeast because of 
unseasonably warm weather said jeffrey feiner an analyst with 
merrill lynch amp co 
consumers dont feel in the mood to shop for christmas when its 
warm and in texas where temperatures also have been high 
retailers are disappointed by lowerthanexpected sales 
the thanksgiving weekend was not very good for us said scott 
glass president and chief operating officer for scarbroughs 
department stores in austin we expected the big christmas rush 
but we did not get it 
dallasbased neiman marcus stores also have seen some slow days 
spokeswoman pat zajac said 
we went gangbusters on thanksgiving weekend and we had a good 
first week but we saw a slight slowing trend last weekend ms 
zajac said it now seems to be picking up again so we think it 
looks good for us 
however the texas retailers said an early trend toward more 
expensive items seems to be holding firm fine jewelry home 
decorator items and other upscale gifts are doing well 
at bloomingdales 129 cashmere sweaters are big sellers and so 
are 300 separates by designer donna karan ms smith said but 25 
watches and 40 bathrobes are also popular she said 
at the nations largest discount retailer k mart corp 
seasonal items such as decorations and apparel are selling well 
but there is no one hot item said vice president for marketing 
michael wellman 
k marts sales across the country slightly exceeded expectations 
in the first week after thanksgiving but were off the mark somewhat 
this week wellman said 
if you put the two together were about on track with our 
expected 6 percent increase he said 
this is not a christmas that will go down in the history books 
but we didnt expect it to be wellman said 
at crowley milner in michigan things at this time have been 
soft for us weve had some good days and weve had some soft 
days said mccracken the vice president for sales but we feel 
good we think its going to be there he said

their top salesman was missing but soviet 
entrepreneurs went ahead thursday with the opening of an 
unprecedented trade show intended to usher in a new era of 
sovietamerican commerce 
as fashion models showed off the latest trends from moscow to the 
beat of american pop music soviet executives showed off their 
wares including furs tractors vodka books toys cars guns and 
caviar 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev had been scheduled to open the 
trade fair which is a showcase for his policy of perestroika or 
economic restructuring but his appearance was scrubbed when he 
decided to return to moscow early because of a catastrophic 
earthquake in armenia 
in his place deputy premier vladimir m kamentsev cut the ribbon 
along with us commerce secretary c william verity 
kamentsev hastily delivered a speech calling for the lowering of 
trade barriers between the united states and the soviet union then 
rushed from the hall to catch a plane to moscow 
verity congratulating the soviets for gorbachevs 
electrifying united nations speech on wednesday also hailed the 
improvement in trade between the two nations 
we believe this is an important step in building longterm 
mutually beneficial nonstrategic trade between the united states 
and the soviet union he said 
the soviets spent an estimated 2 million on the trade show at 
the jacob k javits convention center one measure of the 
importance the soviet union places on increased trade with the 
united states 
you really only do this to someone you want to impress said 
david wolstenholme whose american marketing company spent more than 
a year putting together the show which runs through dec 20 and is 
open to the public 
the soviets want to increase exports to the united states to 
raise their reserves of hard currency which they need to purchase 
goods from the united states and other western nations 
but as kamentsev suggested and the trade show reveals us trade 
barriers make it extremely difficult for soviet enterprises to sell 
their goods in this country 
for instance vil rayevskiy the salesman at a booth offering 
baikal hunting rifles said the soviets have had some success 
selling the guns to european countries but not to the united states 
the main problem and the main obstacle is your very high duty 
for our consumer goods he said 
according to rayevskiy the united states imposes a 60 percent 
duty on the guns whereas gun manufacturers from some countries 
those with mostfavorednation status pay only 10 percent 
how can we compete with them he asked reduce our price to 
zero 
asked why he bothered to come to the show rayevskiy said we 
hope these goods will be interesting to american people and maybe 
there will be some changes in this law 
other soviet enterprises have had more success smoky harrison 
an american spokesman for sovietmade belarus tractors said the 
company has been doubling its sales annually since 1985 and expects 
to sell more than 2000 tractors in the united states this year 
its a basic tractor a basic tool harrison said 
perestroika also has been profitable for us companies that 
operate in the soviet union perhaps the most successful has been 
pepsicola which signed a multimilliondollar agreement thursday to 
expand its trade with the soviet union 
other americans such as jim hickman and peter buckle of los 
angeles have entered joint ventures with soviet enterprises without 
expecting large profits immediately 
hickman and buckle are working with the symbol cooperative in 
moscow to market souvenir tshirts and sweatshirts some examples at 
the trade fair included a sweatshirt bearing the logo of moscow 
state university and one that says summit 89 in russian and 
gorbachevbush in english 
the two said the russian sweatshirts were not up to the quality 
demanded by the us market and high tariffs made them too 
expensive to sell profitably in this country 
still hickman said the longterm soviet market justifies 
their investment 
were in on the cutting edge of perestroika which gives one a 
lot of opportunities as well as being an exciting time added 
buckle

the american association of retired persons 
presented a special recognition award thursday to the associated 
press honoring the news cooperatives 1987 series of stories on the 
nations guardianship system 
horace b deets executive director of aarp said the citation 
recognizes those in the private sector who have made outstanding 
contributions to enhance the quality of life for older people 
william ahearn managing editor of the ap accepted the award on 
behalf of the reporters and editors who produced the sixpart 
national series on the guardianship system and more than 300 other 
stories that examined guardianship in all 50 states and the district 
of columbia 
the aps yearlong study found that in many states the elderly 
are often placed under guardianship with few of the due process 
rights guaranteed even criminals the investigation also found 
courts that placed people under guardianship often failed to monitor 
abuse of the elderly and misappropriation of their money 
since publication of the articles at least 20 states have passed 
or introduced legislation to reform their guardisanship systems 
three bills are now before congress proposing federal standards for 
guardiahsip 
aarp also honored the puget sound power and light co the 
travelers companies and oregon health decisions inc 
aarp cited the puget sound company for its efforts to train 
staffers to meet the needs of older people the travelers was cited

for parttime or temporary work at the company oregon health was 
cited for providing a forum wherein citizens health policy makers 
and health providers can seek solutions to healthcare policy 
questions 
deets said these organizations are an inspiration to others in 
the private sector to participate in similar community activties

bankers will reap more that 700 million in fees 
for their participation in historys largest deal according to 
government documents filed in the wake of the 2453 billion buyout 
of rjr nabisco inc 
company directors meanwhile said kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
cos vow to retain some of the companys food operations and 
preserve the benefits of terminated employees tilted the scales 
against the management group led by chief executive f ross johnson 
in the buyout battle 
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission 
suggest investment and commercial bankers would get as much as 
71188 million in fees for arranging financing for kohlbergs 109 
cashandsecurities offer for each share of rjr stock 
drexel burnham lambert inc would take home the lions share of 
the fees getting an estimated 22688 million merrill lynch amp co 
would receive 10938 million while morgan stanley amp co and 
wasserstein perella amp co would get 25 million each 
in addition a syndicate of four banks bankers trust co chase 
manhattan bank citibank and manufacturers hanover trust co would 
split 325 million for lining up 145 billion in bank loans 
drexel could also end up with 4 percent of rjr nabisco while 
merrill lynch would get 2 percent 
although the dollar amounts are huge the percentages are low for 
leveraged buyouts 
of course we dont have much to compare it with william 
curt hunter a researcher at the federal reserve bank of atlanta who 
has studied fees paid investment bankers said thursday 
the previous record fee for a leveraged buyout was the 49 
million paid in the 1986 61 billion sale of beatrice cos also 
bought by kohlberg 
according to the filing the fees break down this way 
a 15 percent commitment fee and 05 percent funding fee to 
drexel burnham for a 35 billion bridge loan merrill lynch 
receives the same fees for a 15 billion bridge loan 
drexel burnham and merrill lynch each will receive another 362 
percent when they replace the 15 billion bridge loans with junk 
bonds 
drexel burnham gets another 387 percent for the remaining 15 
billion in junk bonds 
the four investment bankers get 25 million each for other 
services including advice and financing 
although these dollars seem excessive theyre probably not if 
you look at the risk hunter said 
theres a lot of risk involved and also underwriting the junk 
bonds he said theres a real question if the market can absorb 
this amount of financing 
also in the filing kohlberg disclosed 10year business 
projections made by rjr management and provided during the 
negotiations 
profits for the nations 19th largest industrial company are 
expected to jump from 14 billion in 1988 to 46 billion by 1998 
with tobacco continuing to provide most of the profit the filing 
said 
by 1998 sales of the companys tobacco products including 
winston salem and camel cigarettes are projected to go from 61 
billion a year to 157 billion a year with operating income from 
tobacco climbing from 19 billion to 55 billion 
food sales oreo cookies ritz crackers planters peanuts del 
monte vegetables and others could go from 99 billion to 185 
billion with operational income rising from 11 billion to 24 
billion 
kohlberg has said it may sell as much as 6 billion worth of the 
food business especially in areas that may raise antitrust 
questions because of kkrs beatrice holdings 
however rjrs board said in a separate sec filing that it 
accepted kohlbergs offer in part because it contemplated 
retention of substantial portions of the companys food business 
while the revised management groups proposal contemplated the sale 
of all the companys food businesses 
another plus for kohlberg was its willingness to provide for 
the preservation of benefits for employees whose employment would be 
terminated as a result of the business divestitures while 
representatives of the management group were unwilling to provide 
for the preservations of such benefits 
the board opened the bidding to allcomers after johnsons 
original 75ashare offer on oct 20 and extended the auction to 
seek higher offers including taking postdeadline offers from both 
sides 
the filing said a final decision was made nov 30 to declare 
kohlberg the winner because the risk that further negotiation with 
either the management group or kkr could result in the withdrawal of 
either party from the bidding process which could have adversely 
affected the boards special committees ability to achieve the 
highest and best offer for the company 
while the sec filings reveal some of the details of the offer 
there is no indication yet about the future of some of the 
executives who were involved johnsons bid 
kohlberg partner henry kravis visiting rj reynolds tobacco 
co in winstonsalem nc earlier this week repeated his plans

alaska is poised to become a major player 
in developing a national energy policy during the administration of 
presidentelect george bush gov steve cowper said thursday 
we ought to be in a position where were driving american oil 
and gas policy cowper said at a news conference we produce 
more than anybody else in the country 
cowper returned late wednesday from a threeday meeting of the 
interstate oil compact commission in suburban kansas city kan 
cowper the commission chairman predicted the 52yearold 
organization will become more influential in directing national 
energy policy 
the democratic governor said he met privately wednesday with 
texas oilman robert mosbacher a longtime bush associate selected by 
the republican presidentelect to be commerce secretary in his 
administration 
cowper said they discussed opening alaskas arctic national 
wildlife refuge for oil and gas development the export of alaska 
natural gas and the states seafood industry 
he was favorably inclined toward our positions on all the 
matters i discussed with him and i think that this administration 
will reflect those same views cowper said i felt very good 
about mr mosbacher and i think well have a very close relationship 
with the department of commerce 
cowper declined to discuss details of his talk with mosbacher 
because hes facing his confirmation hearings and things have a 
way of slipping out and being misinterpreted 
he noted that alaskas natural resources commissioner judith m 
brady was elected a vice chairwoman of the commission and he will 
take over as chairman of the national governors association energy 
subcommittee in february 
having those two positions here in alaska at the same time is 
going to put us in a very unusual position to affect national oil 
and gas policy and thats going to be good for all of us cowper 
said 
the commmission has not yet agreed on which direction the 
nations oil and gas policy should take cowper said the group 
represents 29 states including oil producers and consumers and 
will further discuss policy issues at its june meeting 
our main goal believe it or not is going to be to convince 
the country why america needs an active and viable oil and gas 
industry the governor said at the moment the oil industry is 
on a serious decline particularly the independents 
cowper said he would like to see a limit on oil imports combined 
with tax credits and incentives to stimulate domestic production 
that may lead to an entitlement program to determine who gets cheap 
foreign crude and who gets the more expensive domestic crude he 
said 
cowper said he does not expect congress to adopt an oilimport 
fee

copper for spot delivery on new yorks commodity exchange soared 
to a recordhigh 16475 a pound thursday reflecting renewed 
concerns about dwindling supplies lagging production and surging 
demand for the metal 
on other markets energy futures slipped pulling preciousmetals 
futures lower livestock and meat prices dipped grains and soybeans 
moved higher and stockindex futures retreated 
coppers gains extended the rally launched wednesday by reports 
of an explosion at one of the worlds largest copper mines in 
bouganville papua new guinea 
the blast was ruled sabotage and the mines owner has shut down 
operations there until the government provides security said bette 
raptopoulos metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york 
the bouganville explosion refocused the markets attention on the 
extremely tight availability of physical copper a key factor in the 
dramatic rise in coppers price from around 1 a pound in august 
copper inventories registered with the comex and the london metal 
exchange have declined by 50 percent in the last four months and 
global stocks have fallen to the equivalent of 29 weeks worth of 
consumption an alltime low 
but world demand for copper which is used heavily in the 
construction and manufacturing industries keeps rising analysts 
said mining and refining companies are trying to produce more but 
those attempts frequently lead to problems ms raptopoulos said 
everyones pushing to produce at maximum capacity pressing too 
hard overloading capacity and they have periodic breakdowns she 
said 
and in peru the worlds sixthlargest copper producer last year 
a miners strike is nearing the end of its second month 
a dearth of deliveries against the december comex contract 
indicates no easing in the supply tightness said bernard savaiko 
metals analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
either no one has it to deliver or if they do theyre 
withholding it and waiting for higher prices he said 
copper settled unchanged to 62 cents higher with most active 
contract for delivery in march at 140 a pound a new high for 
that contract the spot december contract finished at 16325 down 
slightly from the days record high 
energy futures prices fell sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
in the crudeoil market a technical selloff occurred after 
traders tried and failed twice to bid the january contract up to 16 
a barrel said peter beutel energy market analyst with elders 
futures inc in new york 
meanwhile prices of gasoline and heatingoil futures tumbled in 
a continuing reaction to tuesdays american petroleum institute 
report which showed steep increases in us stocks of both fuels 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 30 cents 
lower with january at 1544 a barrel heating oil was 81 cent to 
111 cents lower with january at 4808 cents a gallon unleaded

february at 42670 a troy ounce silver was 12 cents to 2 cents 
lower with march at 6263 a troy ounce 
frozen porkbelly ftures fell sharply for the third straight day 
on the chicago mercantile exchange reflecting concerns about slack 
demand for pork products and high hogslaughter numbers this week 
said thomas morgan president of sterling research corp of 
arlington heights ill 
weak demand for beef contributed to a slide in cattle futures 
morgan said 
live cattle settled 52 cent to 87 cent lower with december at 
7087 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 35 cent lower 
with january at 8192 cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent to 63 
cent lower with december at 4047 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 20 cent to 92 cent lower with february at 4202 cents a pound 
wheat futures posted substantial gains on the chicago board of 
trade on talk that china was set to bid for 400000 metric tons of 
us wheat at subsidized prices analysts said

damaged two nuclear power plants but those gains were quickly pared

toyota unveiled a new luxury auto 
nameplate thursday rolling out two new models designed to lure 
yuppies graduating from economy imports and compete with topdrawer 
european sports sedans 
the cars introduce the lexus line which will be a division of 
toyota motor sales usa inc the american arm of japans toyota 
motor corp 
in the manner of hondas acura toyota will try to establish a 
separate upscale identity for lexus in part through design price 
and advertising and in part by selling them through a separate 
dealer network 
the cars to go on sale in september 1989 are 
the lexus ls 400 a 4door luxury sports sedan with toyotas 
first 40liter v8 engine and such hightech features as antilock 
brakes and a tractioncontrol system said to help drivers maintain 
control in a wide variety of road conditions the car which 
resembles the new mercedesbenz cars with which it is intended to 
compete will cost between 30000 and 35000 the company said 
the lexus es 250 a fourdoor executive sedan with a 
25liter v6 engine and fivespeed manual or fourspeed automatic 
transmission that shares many components with toyotas vista a car 
sold only in japan closer in price and style to the successful 
acura the car will sell for 20000 to 25000 
the cars introduced to the press at the art center college of 
design against a backdrop of modern sculptures and the rugged san 
gabriel mountains will be shown to the public in january at auto 
shows in detroit and los angeles 
the lexus line in the works since 1983 mirrors hondas strategy 
of capturing the high end of the market with acura and precedes 
nissans similar infinity nameplate onto the market 
the lexus strategy is twofold said jc jim perkins the 
american marketing man who is senior vice president at lexus 
on one end of the market the company wants to retain baby 
boomers who have long driven toyotas and other japanese imports but 
who now earn enough to defect to luxury carmakers the college 
kids of the 70s who bought corollas and trucks are moving into the 
luxury market perkins noted we want to be there to meet their 
needs 
at the top end of the market the ls 400 will compete with 
mercedes bmw and the other european companies 
the company hopes to sell 16000 lexus 1989 models from september 
through the end of the year a total of 75000 in the first year on 
the market and up to 150000 a year within a few years perkins 
said they will be sold initially by about 250 dealers about 60 of 
the first 100 dealers signed up so far also handle toyotas 
the cars designer kunihiro uchida said the cars are toyotas 
first to be made especially for the us market uchida who like 
many top us car designers studied at the arts center said his 
team did much of their work on the car in southern california so 
they could immerse themselves in the american car culture

four years after going private in a 250 
million leveraged buyout papercraft corp the nations largest 
maker of artificial christmas trees is pushing aside its founding 
family 
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission say 
founder joseph m katz 75 who retired as chairman in 1983 and his 
son marshall p katz 48 the current chairman will be paid 15 
million to terminate their employment contracts two years early 
the two will resign from the board of directors after selling 
135000 of their 300000 shares of papercraft stock to robert b 
goergen a turnaround specialist who succeeded marshall katz as 
chief executive in august the pittsburgh press reported thursday 
their remaining shares will leave them with a 143 percent stake 
in the company 
goergen thursday confirmed the report and said he will succeed 
marshall katz as chairman after the stock sale 
the newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying the shakeup 
reflects dissatisfaction with the companys finances 
earnings have not met the projections made at the time of the 
lbo goergen said 
the company has been hurt by a shift in consumer preference from 
hard needles to soft needles on artificial christmas trees the 
leveraged buyout was founded on the incorrect assumption that sales 
and operating earnings would grow substantially 
the 43yearold pittsburgh company told the sec earlier this year 
that it was not generating enough cash to pay interest on 98 
million in bonds issued to its shareholders as part of the buyout 
the first interest payment is due in 1991

attorneys for walmart stores inc asked 
an appeals court thursday to overturn a lower courts ruling that 
the company pay as much as 1 million a day because its billionaire 
chairman sam walton did not show up for a deposition 
the 2nd court of appeals has not yet ruled on the case a court 
official said 
the sanctions resulted from a personal injury lawsuit filed by 
andrew carrizales against walmart and manager jerry rand 
carrizales claims that while shopping at the companys sulphur 
springs store in 1986 he slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on 
the floor 
carrizales says he suffered mental anguish and serious and 
disabling injuries to his arms legs and back the fort worth 
startelegram reported 
wallace craig carrizales attorney said walmart was ordered to 
produce walton who is also walmarts chief executive officer for 
a videotaped deposition in bentonville ark at the companys main 
offices on aug 8 
however waltons attorney petitioned a district judge in benton 
county in arkansas to overrule the order of 352nd district judge 
john street and requested the deposition be overseen by an arkansas 
court 
craig said he had no objections to conducting the deposition at 
the walmart offices but said he did not believe the testimony 
would be admissible if it were taken by an arkansas court reporter 
he also said the case is not under the jurisdiction of arkansas 
courts 
i wanted to take his deposition where i was supposed to and he 
refused craig said 
street later ordered walmart to have walton at the fort worth 
court on nov 28 for a deposition or pay carrizales for each day he 
didnt show up 
walton has shown an arrogant disregard for the authority of 
this court the judges ruling said as chairman of the board of 
walmart stores inc walton owed the duties of obedience and loyal 
behavior to the corporation to appear for the deposition 
street also ordered walmarts pleadings in the case stricken 
thereby knocking out the companys defenses in the suit craig said 
walmart was ordered by street to pay the plaintiff 10000 for 
the first day he did not appear 20000 for the second 40000 for 
the third 80000 for the fourth 160000 for the fifth 320000 
for the sixth 640000 for the seventh 128 million for the 
eighth and 1 million a day for each day afterward 
the appeals court stayed that order before walton was scheduled 
to appear in fort worth walmart attorney vic anderson said and 
thursdays appellate hearing was scheduled 
anderson said texas law states that anyone who is not a party in 
a lawsuit is able to provide a deposition in that case where they 
live anderson declined to comment on the legal aspects of the suit 
craig said the personal injury suit is scheduled to go to trial 
monday

the city of sausalito known for its 
waterfront charm and posh hillside homes will become americas 
first cholesterolfree city the mayor pledged thursday 
at a crowded news conference where a table groaning with fresh 
fruits and vegetables was prominently displayed mayor robin sweeney 
admitted cholesterolfree was an impossible goal but a more than 
worthy ploy in the battle against the chief suspect in americas no 
1 killer heart disease 
this was done in the spirit of trying to get get the publics 
attention getting their awareness up if it gets a few laughs 
along the way thats all right said the mayor adding that the 
phrase cholesterolfree should not be taken literally 
the sausalito city council passed a proclamation this week to 
fight fatty deposits in the blood calling on restaurants in the 
city across the golden gate bridge from san francisco to do their 
part 
gary w doring manager of the spinnaker restaurant where the 
news conference was staged said his menu will include low or 
nocholesterol items on the menu including fresh fruit plates 
broiled chicken margarine in lieu of butter and alternatives to 
fried and sauteed foods 
excessive deposits of cholesterol on the walls of blood vessels 
have been implicated in atherosclerosis or hardening of the 
arteries which can result in blood clots heart attacks and strokes 
its pretty hard to eat a diet thats totally free of 
cholesterol said cardiologist and university of california 
professor dr james r adams a member of the cholesterolfighting 
committee 
what wed like to do he declared is keep the amount of 
fat that you eat less than 30 percent of the diet the average 
american probably eats 35 to 40 percent of his calories in fat 
were trying to get people aware of what their cholesterol 
levels are and their fat intake is so they can get their 
cholesterol down and prevent heart disease people need to be aware 
of what they are putting in their bodies 
ironically several of the civic leaders at the news conference 
confided that they had total cholesterol levels in some cases far 
higher than the recommended maximum 200 milligrams two men said 
they had 300 readings and one said his was 269 the doctor said his 
cholesterol level was a healthful 190 
the citys cholesterolfree campaign was aimed at lowering the 
publics ldl or bad cholesterol levels a cholesterol known as 
hdl or good cholesterol has been shown to carry away fat 
deposits from artery walls 
cholesterol screening tests usually measure a persons overall 
cholesterol levels

us attorney rudolph giuliani firmly denied on 
thursday that the racketeering indictment of five top officials of 
princetonnewport partners pushed the firm into liquidation 
the us government doesnt have any responsibility for 
creating a business or destroying a business giuliani said in 
reply to reporters questions about a published report 
the wall street journal in reporting on the firms liquidation 
announcment quoted officials and lawyers as blaming the demise of 
the investment partnership on the indictment 
last august five princetonnewport partners and a former drexel 
burnham lambert inc trader were charged with a racketeering scheme 
that allegedly engaged in generating phony tax losses through bogus 
securities trading 
it was the first time officials of a securities firm were charged 
with violating federal racketeering laws 
neither drexel nor princetonnewport was charged with criminal 
activity 
the government has succeeded in destroying princetonnewport 
said defense attorney paul r grand according to the journals 
thursday editions 
giuliani called grands charge ridiculous and 
irresponsible 
thats their problem to deal with i dont accept the premise 
that we destoyed the business said giuliani 
a week after the indictment was handed up prosecutors as 
required by federal rules informed the judge they planned a 
superseding indictment that might include additional defendants or 
additional charges 
but the government has twice pushed back the planned date for 
bringing a superseding indictment 
postponing that decision repeatedly for several months created 
too much uncertainty for the business grand told the journal 
on monday most of the investors gave notice they were pulling 
out a substantial part of the 200 million total investment another 
defense lawyer diana parker told the journal 
but giuliani countered we cant determine the effect that an 
indictment is going to have in the marketplace any more than we 
cant predict the effect of an indictment on an election

the washington state supreme court agreed 
thursday to hear new arguments in a civil case in which the state is 
accused of fraud and negligence by holders of defaulted washington 
public power supply system bonds 
the high court provided no details in its brief order and did 
not set a date for arguments in the classaction suit hoffer vs 
washington 
last may justices voted 54 in ruling the state must defend 
itself against the charges brought by representatives of the 
approximately 40000 holders of 225 billion in bonds for wppss 
nuclear power plants nos 4 and 5 
in a separate development thursday the securities and exchange 
commission said the owner of a securities firm that helped 
underwrite the illfated wppss bonds has been barred from the 
securities business for life 
sec administrative law judge max o regensteiner barred donald t 
sheldon 49 owner of two nowdefunct firms that were based in new 
york city donald sheldon amp co inc and donald sheldon government 
securities inc 
wppss defaulted on the bonds in 1983 after the state supreme 
court ruled that washington utilities lacked the authority to 
contract with wppss for construction of the plants a total of 88 
northwest utilities participated in construction of the plants 
which were terminated when partially complete in january 1982 
the bondholders led by arthur hoffer of new york allege that 
the state auditor negligently performed or failed to perform his 
duty to audit the supply system and to examine bond resolutions that 
investors depend upon 
the suit also contends that the auditor certification of the 
bonds contained fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations and that 
the states participation in the decision to terminate the plants 
constituted interference with the contractual relations between the 
supply system and bondholders 
in the majority opinion written in may justice barbara durham 
wrote that bondholders should be allowed the opportunity to 
present evidence concerning the certificates objective and the 
effect it would produce on the ordinary reader 
however she conceded that the auditors certificate and letter 
did not include an explicit assurance of the supply systems 
financial health 
wppss no 4 was built at the hanford nuclear reservation in 
eastern washington while no 5 was built at satsop west of 
olympia the plants were each less than 25 percent complete when 
they were abandoned because the electricity they would have produced 
was no longer needed and because of cost overruns and other 
problems

the us dollar remained weaker against the japanese 
yen friday following finance minister kiichi miyazawas resignation 
while share prices rebounded slightly on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar which opened at 12220 yen was changing hands at 
12233 yen at midday down 069 yen from thursdays close of 12302 
yen it moved in a range of 12210 yen to 12245 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 29192point 
loser thursday edged up 1076 points or 004 percent to finish 
the morning session at 2976966 
the dollar began trading sharply lower in tokyo following an 
overnight plunge in new york where it closed at 12228 yen down 
140 yen 
the dollars fall in new york was attributed to dealers 
disappointment about a still unclear us reaction to soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs pledge at the united nations to unilaterally 
reduce soviet troops and cut the number of soviet conventional 
weapons 
in tokyo anticipation of miyazawas resignation friday left many 
currency dealers waiting on the sidelines said mitsuhiko kinugasa 
of daiwa bank 
many traders speculate that the resignation of miyazawa who 
has opposed a weaker dollar would damage current international 
monetary coordination said kinugasa that gave the market 
strong bearish sentiments toward the dollar today 
miyazawa who had hinted at his resignation earlier formally 
announced he was stepping down to help clear opposition to tax 
reform legislation under discussion in parliament 
the announcement of miyazawas resignation came just as the stock 
market ended its morning session 
share prices rose slightly but were mixed many investors were 
inclined to sit on the sidelines following thursdays sharp fall

finance minister kiichi miyazawa implicated in a 
stock trading scandal that has damaged the governing party resigned 
friday to help clear opposition to passage of tax reform bills in 
parliament 
miyazawa said an aides involvement in buying unlisted shares of 
a real estate company had led him to make inaccurate statements 
to lawmakers he said he was resigning to take responsibility and 
hoped the move would speed passage of the tax legislation 
personally i hope the tax reform bills will be passed soon 
and it doesnt matter what happens to me he said during an 
interview on national television 
miyazawa told reporters prime minister noboru takeshita approved 
of his resignation japans kyodo news service quoting unidentified 
sources said takeshita will temporarily serve as finance minister 
until a replacement is found for miyazawa 
opposition parties have demanded that miyazawa resign to take 
responsibility for repeatedly giving conflicting accounts about his 
role in the stock trading scandal refusing to resume parliamentary 
debate on the tax reform package until he does so 
the twoterm finance minister and veteran politician changed 
accounts of his involvement in the stock deals at least three times 
in his statements to parliamentary committees investigating the 
scandal 
the recruit scandal involves questionable purchases of stocks of 
recruit cosmos co by dozens of influential politicians including 
miyazawa takeshita and former foreign minister shintaro abe 
japans top three politicians 
political analysts have said miyazawas resignation would 
probably pave the way for passage of the tax reform package during 
the current parliamentary session which ends on dec 29 
miyazawa who has been considered a candidate for prime minister 
told a news conference in september when his involvement in the 
scandal was first revealed that he took no part in the scandal and 
had no knowledge about the controversial unlisted shares of the real 
estate company 
later an investigation by the japanese communist party revealed 
that miyazawa had bought 10000 unlisted shares of recruit cosmos in 
september 1986 and earned more than 20 million japanese yen or 
around 164000 in profits by selling them immediately after the 
company went public a month later 
miyazawa then told the committee that his former aide bought 
shares from his business associate without his knowledge 
it was disclosed in a parliamentary investigation last month that 
the aide tsuneo hattori bought shares directly from recruit inc 
the real estate firms parent company 
miyazawa told a news conference last week that he would give up 
his cabinet position and his seat in parliament which he has held 
since 1959 if he was obliged to change his testimony again he also 
hinted that he was willing to resign if it would help secure passage 
of the tax reform package 
debate on the tax legislation has been stalled since last week 
when opposition parties singled out miyazawa and demanded that the 
finance minister submit material evidence to prove the accuracy of 
his earlier statements 
miyazawa however refused to do so saying he had lost all 
evidence such as stock transaction records and receipts 
the legislation japans first major overhaul of its tax system 
since the end of world war ii has been a top priority for the 
liberal democratic party for a decade 
successive administrations have failed to enact the reform due to 
public and opposition party resistance former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone under whom miyazawa also served as finance 
minister staked his political career on tax reform and lost 
the new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax 
scales and introduces a 3 percent sales tax 
the governing party which commands a majority in both houses of 
parliament forced the tax bill through the lower house last month 
the legislation has been debated in the upper house since then 
the liberal democrats could enact the tax laws despite opposition 
resistance but this would violate japanese political tradition 
which values consensus and could cost the party votes in the next 
election said masumi ishikawa political commentator for the 
masscirculation daily asahi shimbun 
a survey by another leading daily the mainichi shimbun showed 
friday that public support for the takeshita administration has 
dropped to 18 percent from last decembers 30 percent the 
thirdlowest rating for a prime minister since world war ii
