opposition leaders demanded thursday that 
government troops stop arresting prodemocracy buddhist monks and 
students after military ruler gen saw maung pledged to hold 
elections as soon as peace is restored 
the capital was quiet for the third day since troops ruthlessly 
suppressed protests against the military coup that saw maung led 
sunday 
saw maung who became prime minister wednesday is the third new 
leader in two months of chaos and bloodshed like the two 
government heads before him he is closely associated with ne win 
who seized power in 1962 
ne win resigned in late july after widespread protests against 
26 years of authoritarian rule that plunged resourcerich burma 
into poverty his successor sein lwin lasted for 17 days of 
massive street protests the next ruler president maung maung was 
a civilian but was seen as close to the military 
the united states said thursday it was cutting off all aid to 
burma except humanitarian assistance rudi boone a state 
department spokesman in washington said he believed us aid to 
burma totaled 123 million but he did not know how much of the 
aid is humanitarian 
a letter sent to saw maung on thursday from opposition leaders 
aung gyi tin oo and aung san suu kyi urged the government not 
to arrest people including the monks students artists etc in 
connection with the recent unrest and also to release those already 
under detention 
since the coup security forces have broken up protest centers 
manned mostly by monks and students in at least 95 towns they have 
reported only eight arrests in those sweeps the government also 
said security forces arrested 100 people in rangoon they were 
described as looters 
the opposition figures also urged saw maung who was armed 
forces commander before the coup to end his ban on newspapers and 
announce a list of casualties in shooting 
the government has acknowledged security forces killed at least 
146 people since the coup but a western diplomat put the figure as 
high as 400 including many unarmed prodemocracy demonstrators 
opposition leaders did not reply to saw maungs letter received 
wednesday in which he said the army does not intend to hold onto 
power for long and asked for help to prepare for what would be the 
first multiparty elections since 1960 
the army has no intention to retain the duties of state power 
for a long time in addition to its existing onerous duties we had 
to step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating general 
conditions in the country said the letter saw maungs first 
contact with the opposition leadership 
we promise you that free and fair general elections will be 
held as soon as peace and tranquillity is restored in the country 
the letter added that political parties will be allowed to use 
government radio and television for their campaigns but saw maung 
did not set a date for the promised elections 
maung maung a civilian who was briefly president before being 
ousted in sundays coup bowed to massive street protests and 
agreed to end oneparty rule and hold multiparty elections as soon 
as early october 
but the opposition rejected that formula and instead continued 
street demonstrations demanding an interim government be formed to 
conduct the balloting 
in rangoon more roadside shops were open thursday than the 
previous day but large markets remained closed 
the doors of government offices were open but no one was 
working most public employees have been on prodemocracy strikes 
since aug 8 and the government has set an oct 3 deadline for them 
to return to work 
sketchy reports received from mandalay the secondlargest city 
and other towns indicated security forces and protesters fought 
this week though not as fierce as in the capital 
state radio said security forces arrested eight people wednesday 
night in a sweep of the protest center at mandalay university and 
killed two other people in separate incidents in the city mandalay 
is about 350 miles north of rangoon 
also wednesday night a group of people sent about 50 water 
buffaloes after soldiers on the mandalay golf course and attacked 
the troops with catapults and metal darts the radio said the 
attackers escaped but five buffaloes were reported killed 
a diplomat said a few us embassy officials in rangoon would be 
evacuated to bangkok in the next few days more than 100 dependents 
of staff members were evacuated earlier 
the embassy remains open this is as a precaution said ross 
petzing spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok 
japan expressed concern thursday about political developments in 
burma and said it would wait to decide whether to recognize the new 
military government tokyo is the largest foreign aid donor to 
rangoon although official assistance has dropped recently 
burma once the worlds largest rice exporter last year joined 
40 other countries officially designated by the united nations as 
least developed nation 
officials said the soviet union and the european economic 
community protested the recent bloodshed the united states earlier 
said it might withdraw aid in light of the military coup and 
bloodshed

a new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter 
the skyline of atlanta previously dismissed as sterile and 
nondescript 
even homegrown architect john portman whose glass towers and 
soaring atriums for years defined atlanta and who in the past 
criticized postmodern architecture as a step backward has given a 
nod to the style in his latest project a 60story office building 
planned for downtown atlanta 
much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the 
capital of the new south started last fall with the opening of the 
50story ibm building officially called one atlantic center it is 
a slender postmodern tower of stone with tall arched entryways 
and gothic finials dramatically crowned by a 100foothigh 
eightsided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern 
rushhour traffic on interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as 
drivers gaze its way at night the lights in its crown command 
attention from all over town architecture writers have used words 
like gracious truly wonderful serene imposing 
and glamorous to describe the tower 
it certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world 
said roy cooper vice president for economic development with the 
atlanta chamber of commerce its just beautiful everybodys 
just staggered by it 
the tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in 
modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of 
the citys tallest buildings 
its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going 
up in atlanta and the design of the proposed promenade skyscraper 
complex was altered to complement the rosecolored ibm tower 
new york architect john burgee whose firm designed the ibm 
building with design consultant philip johnson wont take credit 
for transforming atlantas skyline but he said the citys image 
as defined by the way it looks is undergoing a change 
atlanta has been looking for its identity burgee said in a 
telephone interview from his new york office its an historical 
city but its architecture and image is not strictly historical 
you think of atlanta and you think of gone with the wind now 
there is an attempt to come up with a visual image 
we all know peachtree street but you dont think of its 
buildings he said like in new york the empire state 
building chicago the sears building san francisco the 
transamerica building atlanta doesnt have that its moving 
toward that very definitely 
burgee and johnson also are behind one ninety one peachtree 
tower a postmodern skyscraper planned for downtown atlanta 
another planned project grouped in the son of ibm building 
spurt is the promenade in the treelined historic midtown section 
a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by 
atampt and the atlantabased landmarks group 
when unveiled last year it was designed with an exterior of 
glittering green glass but when promenade officials saw the 
excitement over the nearby ibm tower its architects thompson 
ventulett amp stainback redrew the plans to use rose glass above 
rosetoned stone and topped with a gray steel spire 
the most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by 
portman whose imprint is already deeply felt in atlanta primarily 
through the peachtree center and the towering cylindrical westin 
peachtree plaza hotel 
portmans new building is slated to begin construction next year 
and at 60 stories will eclipse one atlantic as the southeasts 
tallest building unveiling the design in may portman said it was 
respectful of the past but like this city is audacious and bold 
and forwardlooking the beginning of postpostmodern 
architecture 
dale durfee a professor of architecture at georgia tech said 
completion of the ibm tower signaled the acceleration of a change 
in the look of the city that began a decade ago 
atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla he said with no 
development of architectural significance 
burgee echoed that appraisal saying it was pretty 
nondescript it might be anyplace if they took you to atlanta 
blindfolded and took off the blindfold you wouldnt have a clue 
where you are 
durfee said that 10 years ago atlanta was groping to form an 
identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going 
up 
today however companies want sophistication in their office 
buildings durfee said and corporate sponsorship of building 
projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing 
some say that all the building activity simply makes good 
business sense 
sure theres competitive prestige good architecture is good 
business said truman hartshorn chairman of the geography 
department at georgia state university and a specialist in urban 
affairs 
a goodlooking building he said is easier to sell to the 
financing people as well as the tenants 
hartshorn said he expects the new projects in atlanta will bring 
special recognition 
i think its going to open some eyes he said we have 
prestige with our cultural buildings but i dont know that our 
office buildings are that distinctive nationally 
these arent just ultra postmodern theyre classic theyre 
different

state employees wont be dialing for 
dollars any longer after their attempts to cash in on a 1000 
radio callin contest brought the capitols telephone system to a 
crashing halt 
i guess the economy is so bad in texas that everybody is 
trying to get money carl stringfellow state director of 
telecommunications said tuesday but you shouldnt be using 
state phones to be calling on to radio contests 
officials reset the phone system to prevent any calls to the 
exchange set aside for radio callin contests after service was 
disrupted several times stringfellow said 
we thought we had just had an equipment failure he said 
but the second time it went down one of our employees suggested 
it was at the same time as one of the radio contests 
officials discovered the phone failure occurred within a minute 
of the start of a contest by a local radio station offering a 
1000 prize 
the capitol phone system has about 14000 lines and its usual 
capacity is about 2000 calls at any time but the radio contest 
bumped the phone traffic up to 8000 calls stringfellow said

italys top mafia investigator has withdrawn his 
resignation alleviating a crisis in the countrys war on organized 
crime 
giovanni falcone an investigating magistrate in the sicilian 
capital of palermo had charged when he offered his resignation 
july 30 that mafia investigations were obstructed 
he also said his methods differ radically from those of his 
superior antonino meli who was appointed chief investigating 
magistrate of the antimafia judicial pool in february 
falcone asked for a transfer and the other members of the pool 
then announced their resignations 
a former colleague of falcone charged in july that meli was 
weakening the pool by assigning its judges nonmafia cases and 
sending mafia cases to investigators outside the pool 
falcone told judicial officials wednesday that he was staying on 
in conformance with the ruling last week by the superior 
council of magistrates the national judicial watchdog that 
appointed meli 
the council praising the pools work found that meli did not 
divert cases and called on falcone not to quit 
magistrates in the pool especially falcone have been credited 
for some of the countrys biggest successes against organized 
crime including the maxi antimafia trial that ended in 
december with 338 convictions 
us authorities say falcone provided critical help in 
investigations such as the one leading to the new york trial of 
suspects in the case of the pizza connection which discovered 
that pizza parlors in the united states were used as fronts for 
heroin dealing

heavily armed police sealed off a 
12block area wednesday night after hearing sporadic gunfire in a 
riotscarred neighborhood where a white woman allegedly shot a 
black man to death 24 hours earlier 
an emergency zone was expanded late wednesday night in the cedar 
grove section soon after police rerouted traffic off a busy 
thoroughfare where blacks were throwing rocks bottles and bricks 
at passing cars 
no injuries or serious damages were reported wednesday night 
and there were no arrests immediately reported in louisianas 
thirdlargest city 
the white woman was accused of murder in tuesday nights 
shooting and six blacks were arrested during the rioting that 
followed police said 
mayor john hussey said the strategy wednesday night was to wait 
out troublemakers scores of police cars a busload of camouflaged 
special response team officers and canine units were stationed at a 
command post nearby 
the shooting that we have is sporadic said hussey its 
still very much in a local area the idea is to seal off the area 
if you seal it off dont let any cars through then theres 
nothing for them to throw at 
though the atmosphere was tense police chief charles gruber 
said it was nothing like what the city faced after the earlier 
rioting 
wednesday nights violence occurred hours after black leaders 
called for cedar grove residents to stay calm and guard against a 
recurrence of the burning and looting late tuesday night and early 
wednesday 
were sitting on a powder keg said state rep alphonse 
jackson who called for a biracial anticrime committee 
people want protection said jackson who is black i call 
on citizens to restore law and order 
his plea followed a meeting of city officials and black leaders 
to discuss the rioting that persisted nearly five hours until 3 
am wednesday and which officials said was related both to drugs 
and racial problems 
stores were looted and burned and rioters threw rocks and 
bottles at whites there were reports of racial slurs and chants of 
hot biscuit the restaurant where a white teenager killed a 
black teenager on aug 4 an incident that set off racial tension 
in this northwestern louisiana city of 250000 the states 
thirdlargest after new orleans and baton rouge 
hussey and gruber acknowledged at a news conference that the 
sparks for the riots were the two shootings but both said there 
were deeper causes 
weve got problems in our economy weve got problems in our 
racism weve got many other problems said hussey adding that 
drinking and a soured drug deal preceded tuesdays shooting 
the rev e edward jones pastor of galilee baptist church 
appeared with hussey and gruber jones said he and other black 
leaders believe the chief deserves credit for ordering officers to 
pull out of the riot area so the crowd could disperse without 
bloodshed 
we are asking our young people to remain at home as much as 
possible to dig in to their books and not to look for any 
excitement said jones president of the national baptist 
convention of america inc the nations secondlargest black 
baptist organization 
on tuesday night police cordoned off a sevenblock area and 
warned motorists to keep out 
the crowd reached 1000 people at its peak said gruber but 
other police estimates said the total was 300 to 500 most of the 
time 
the police chief said his car took a brick through the 
windshield and gunfire through the back passenger door but he was 
not hurt 
a ktbstv news car was burned and a new fire department pumper 
was attacked with bats and bricks 
no serious injuries were reported attributed in part to 
grubers decision to let the disturbance run its course throughout 
the incident police radios crackled with orders to maintain 
positions and hold fire 
if gruber had moved into the area we would have had a large 
number of people hurt so i commend him for it said jackson 
we chose to let it cool off gruber said we felt our 
presence would do nothing but accelerate it 
six people were arrested five on charges ranging from inciting 
to riot to resisting arrest and two of those and one other person 
on on charges of possession of stolen goods 
the outbreak was triggered by the shooting of a black man 
identified as william david mckinney 20 who lived in the cedar 
grove neighborhood where the rioting took place he was described 
by a witness as a bystander caught in gunfire when a drug deal went 
bad 
a white teenager tamala c vergo 17 of greenwood was booked 
on a charge of seconddegree murder said police cpl et rushing 
a second woman was questioned but not charged 
a man who identified himself only as a cousin of mckinneys 
named charles said mckinney was shot at random after a woman 
trying to buy cocaine from a group of men was robbed when they ran 
with her purse she took out her frustration on mckinney he 
said 
the man talked to reporters after being interviewed by 
detectives 
officers said people in a convenience store tried to detain the 
woman until police came but a crowd of blacks gathered outside and 
began throwing bricks at the business and all passing motorists who 
were white 
a witness anthony johnson said that after police took the 
women away the crowd doused the store with lighter fluid set it 
afire and went on a rampage the building containing the store and 
a liquor shop was burned to the ground 
patients and workers at eden gardens nursing center across the 
street watched the burning and looting 
some of the guys had so much stuff in their bags they couldnt 
walk said betty truett a nurse 
looting and fires also were reported in other stores in the area 
about 200 police were called in gruber said including state 
troopers sheriffs deputies and officers from nearby bossier city 
in the aug 4 shooting five white men were arrested and one 
admitted the shooting saying he was defending himself he is being 
held on 250000 bond on seconddegree murder charges charges 
against three of the others were dropped in return for their 
cooperation 
the shooting enraged shreveports black community but calm 
prevailed when black ministers exhorted congregations to let police 
handle the investigation

when the autumn equinox bids farewell to 
summer today millions of scorched americans likely will be glad to 
see it go 
it was a bummer summer in the words of one headline writer a 
season that saw millions of dollars lost in dying crops rivers and 
reservoirs dry up and air conditioning bills go through the roof 
according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration only the dust bowl of the 1930s raised the nations 
average temperature to higher levels than this summer 
some communities may take pride in setting records for greatest 
average heat or most 90 degree days or least rain 
but that doesnt mean many want to see a return of the 
recordsetting misery anytime soon 
the agriculture department estimates that heat coupled with 
extraordinary dryness cut grain production by 31 percent 
threatening many farmers with financial disaster 
and the us geological survey noted that low water levels 
curtailed irrigation and river traffic and raised pollution levels 
in some areas 
wildfires swept large areas discouraging tourists scorching 
homes and forests 
and even something as simple as keeping cool had a significant 
impact with the cost of running air conditioners pushing the 
national electric bill up to 144 billion some 746 million more 
than it would have been in normal summer weather 
national statistics though obscure the impact of the hot dry 
season which differed in degree and response from town to town 
but which was bad news nearly everywhere 
from minneapolis to baltimore to cheyenne the summer of 1988 was 
the hottest in local climate records going back nearly 40 years 
and by that same standard the drought played to record levels 
in peoria and pittsburgh billings mont and asheville nc 
abnormally hot weather during much of juneaugust in the great 
basin southern intermountain region northern halves of the 
rockies and great plains and midwest sent seasonal temperatures 
averaging more than 4 degrees fahrenheit above normal the 
federal climate analysis center said 
the summers greatest heat focused on the region from central 
montana and northern utah eastward to lower michigan with hundreds 
of record highs and many cities setting records for consecutive 
days of 90 degrees or more 
it was the warmest summer in the last 58 years in the east north 
central states and the third warmest in the west north central 
region and the mountain states 
drought meanwhile struck in the spring and persisted through 
much of the summer in the northern great plains and the 
mississippi ohio and tennessee valleys by midjuly about 45 
percent of the 48 contiguous states were experiencing severe or 
extreme drought 
increased thunderstorm activity in the eastern portion of the 
drought area eased the problem somewhat in late july and august 
but even so several cities set records for dryness 
climate experts compile local records in 30year chunks and use 
the period from 19511980 as a standard for comparison for current 
trends they define summer as june july and august 
on that basis at least seven cities recorded their driest 
summer they include asheville nc 539 inches of precipitation 
peoria ill 304 inches sheridan wyo 091 inches havre 
mont 020 inches pittsburgh 614 inches rockford ill 481 
inches and billings mont 059 inches 
for peoria for example that represented only 27 percent of 
normal rainfall for the season 
even more cities set records for the highest average summer 
temperature since 1951 ranging from 867 in tucson ariz to 684 
in cheyenne wyo 
average temperatures are derived from daily highs and lows and 
the readings climbed as much as 6 degrees fahrenheit above normal 
sheridan wyo for example was 63 degrees above normal 
while at billings mont the average was high by 58 degrees 
others among the communities setting record high average 
temperatures for this summer were newark nj 777 salt lake 
city 775 baltimore 772 sioux falls sd 761 dayton ohio 
756 minneapolis 756 huron sd 752 waterloo iowa 750 
billings mont 747 
also rapid city sd 747 dubuque iowa 743 fargo nd 
738 milwaukee 738 williston nd 730 lander wyo 729 
sheridan wyo 729 akron ohio 727 casper wyo 720 reno 
nev 716 and green bay wis 712 
as if to prove there are exceptions to every rule some 
communities had cool and wet summers 
albuquerque nm for example recorded 681 inches of rainfall 
this summer a record at 208 percent of normal for the period 
summer rainfall totaled more than 47 inches at homestead air 
force base in florida although there are no historical records for 
comparison 
such places as pensacola and west palm beach however topped 30 
inches which was more than 150 percent of normal 
and meacham ore managed an average summer temperature of only 
563 degrees 36 degrees below normal

more americans have high school diplomas and 
college degrees than ever before reflecting a continuing emphasis 
on education in society a new census bureau study shows 
the entire postsecond world war era has been characterized by 
an expansion of educational opportunities and structures in the 
country census demographer robert kominski commented 
his new study of educational attainment found that as of march 
1987 more than threequarters of people aged 25 and over have 
completed high school and nearly one in five has finished at least 
four years of college 
both shares have been increasing gradually over the years said 
kominski 
in the 1960s the civil rights movement added another level of 
opportunity and the expansion of college grant and aid programs in 
the 60s and 70s allowed this to continue he said 
kominski added that changes in the age breakdown of the 
population have also had an impact on education averages as the 
less educated elderly are replaced by younger people who have spent 
more time in school 
for example people in their teens with 80 percent to 90 
percent completing high school are replacing older folks who were 
raised at a time when completion of six to eight years of schooling 
was a major accomplishment he explained 
does this mean that americans today are smarter than in the past 
not necessarily kominski said we all like to think that 
we were raised in the generation which produced the best and the 
brightest 
the study found that overall 756 percent of americans have 
completed high school and 199 percent had finished four years of 
college that was up from 747 percent and 194 percent a year 
earlier and 686 percent and 170 percent in 1980 
by comparison in 1940 only 245 percent of americans aged 25 
and older had completed high school and 46 percent were college 
graduates 
the 1987 report also noted that males were slightly more likely 
to have finished high school than women 760 percent to 753 
percent a change from the early 1970s when women led in this 
category 
the shift is largely attributed to increasing share of black men 
pursuing their educations kominski said 
in 1971 he pointed out the last time women led men in overall 
share of high school graduates young black women aged 25 to 29 led 
men 607 percent to 541 percent in high school graduates last 
year among young blacks 848 percent of males and 821 percent of 
women had finished high school 
other findings for the population aged 25 and over included 
whites had 770 percent high school graduates and 205 percent 
who finished four years of college the figures for blacks were 
634 percent and 107 percent other races mostly asians had 784 
percent high school grads and 334 percent who finished college 
hispanics recorded 509 percent who finished high school and 
86 percent with college degrees 
the west has the highest educational levels at 806 percent 
high school and 228 percent with college degrees figures for 
other regions were 765 percent and 222 percent in the east 774 
percent and 176 percent in the midwest and 708 percent and 183 
percent in the south 
in metropolitan areas 776 percent had finished high school 
and 221 percent college compared to 687 percent and 126 percent 
in rural regions 
the highest rate of high school graduates was for people aged 
25 to 34 with 865 percent that slipped to 859 percent in the 35 
to 44 group 776 percent for those aged 45 to 54 and 678 percent 
for people aged 55 to 64 americans aged 65 to 74 included 569 
percent high school graduates and over age 75 the rate was 420 
percent 
those finishing college totaled 239 percent in the 25 to 34 
age group then peaked at 265 percent among people aged 35 to 44 
after that the rate declined to 195 percent for those aged 45 to 
54 149 percent for the 55 to 64 group 106 percent for those 65 
to 74 and over 75 it was 89 percent

nightclubs and nudity are banned on this 
island where tradition holds that st john wrote the new 
testaments book of revelation in a cave overlooking the aegean sea 
under a special government decree patmos has a unique status 
among greeces 200 or so inhabited islands as a holy island 
still dominated by its 900yearold byzantine monastery 
we prefer our visitors to be pilgrims rather than ordinary 
tourists and we would like them to respect our tradition abbot 
isidoros who heads the 30member community at the monastery of st 
john the theologian said in an interview 
but plans for an airport coupled with widespread publicity for 
the monasterys 900th anniversary celebrations are expected to 
bring mass tourism to patmos in the coming years 
the tranquillity of patmos a rocky outcrop in the dodecanese 
group of islands with around 2000 residents attracts wealthy 
greeks and foreigners who have restored scores of traditional 
mansions clustered beneath the monasterys gray fortresslike walls 
many have given donations to the monastery to help maintain its 
library of rare manuscripts and early books along with a 
collection of priceless icons portraits of saints painted in gold 
and bright colors 
patmos is still a place apart with a unique atmosphere 
unlike other islands a conscious effort has been made to protect 
it said maria king constantinides a boston antiques dealer with 
a family home there 
signs in greek french german or english scattered around the 
islands beaches point out that nudity is not allowed one disco 
operates on a remote bay but the narrow alleys around the 
monastery fall silent by 10 pm even in summer 
people sometimes go topless on the beaches but on the 
whole the rules are respected said christos kyrozis the 
islands doctor and also its mayor 
the development project planned by greeces state tourist 
organization eot together with the monastery and town authorities 
calls for construction of an airport zoning for new hotels and 
bungalows and improved harbor facilities 
past experience shows that once an island gets an airport 
mass tourism is very difficult to avoid said eleni bonou who 
heads the project but an airport is essential because it serves 
the islanders first 
more than 30000 visitors come to patmos every year but 
twothirds of them arrive aboard cruise ships that steam away

after expressing a mood that the house wont 
tolerate any illegal narcotics use lawmakers may be ready to 
toughen antidrug legislation by voting to revoke drug users 
drivers licenses 
as the house returns to its comprehensive antidrug bill today 
lawmakers face two opposing amendments that could affect any 
convicted drug offenders right to drive 
rep bill mccollum rfla proposes withholding part of a 
states federal highway money unless the state requires suspension 
or revocation of drivers licenses of anyone convicted of a 
drugrelated crime 
a substitute amendment by rep glen m anderson dcalif 
provides an incentive approach instead of penalties states would 
receive transportation department grants for imposing the license 
penalties the grants would pay part of the license enforcement 
program 
the overall antidrug bill would add some 2 billion to the 
nations 39 billion effort against illegal drugs while the house 
expects to approve the legislation thursday or friday the senate 
still must consider its own drug bill 
a conference will almost certainly be needed to iron out 
differences but lawmakers appear eager to pass a popular 
gettoughondrugs bill so close to the election 
the house bill as originally written authorizes money and 
innovative programs for drug law enforcement rehabilitation 
treatment and education each time the house has amended the 
measure during the past two weeks its civil administrative or 
criminal penalties have toughened 
under mccollums drivers license plan states would have to 
impose suspensions of at least six months for a first conviction 
and at least one year for repeat convictions within a fiveyear 
period 
five percent of a states highway money would be withheld the 
first year if there was no compliance and 10 percent would be held 
back for every subsequent year of noncompliance 
the penalty for states would begin oct 1 1991 individuals 
penalized would have to have been convicted after the drug measure 
became law 
the anderson alternative would require the same sixmonth and 
oneyear penalties as required under the mccollum plan 
the incentive program would offer states additional money 
totaling 25 million in the 1989 fiscal year 50 million in 1990 
and 50 million in 1991 
andersons proposal also would apply to those convicted after 
the drug bill became law 
over the past two weeks the house has inserted a number of 
amendments to the drug bill that reflect an attitude of zero 
tolerance toward any drug use and a feeling that harsh penalties 
are needed for those who deal in drugs or merely possess them 
liberal lawmakers have complained that the house has ignored the 
constitutional safeguards that protect civil liberties such as due 
process of law 
amendments already approved would 
permit the federal death penalty for anyone who intentionally 
kills a person during the course of committing a drug felony 
deny many federal benefits including assistance to veterans 
and student loans to anyone convicted of two or more drugrelated 
offenses 
allow introduction of evidence in federal criminal cases that 
was obtained through a search that violated constitutional 
protections but undertaken in good faith 
create civil penalties of up to 10000 per violation for 
possession of small personal use amounts of marijuana cocaine 
and other drugs 
the house also approved a requirement for a system that would 
allow gun dealers to identify convicted felons attempting to buy 
handguns this amendment replaced language for a sevenday waiting 
period for handgun purchases

the soviet unions grain harvest this year will be 
smaller than the relatively good harvests of the two previous years 
because of drought in the countrys breadbasket izvestia reported 
the soviet government newspaper gave no figures but said the 
harvest was just drawing to a close and it was clear it would fall 
short of the 231 million tons harvested in each of the past two 
years 
a significant shortfall in the grain harvest would be a blow to 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to improve food 
supplies to consumers and reform agriculture it also would require 
the soviet union to use more of its scare foreign currency to buy 
grain instead of machinery and equipment to modernize the economy 
the summer drought has inflicted an appreciable blow on the 
principle grainaries of the country the volga region the urals 
western siberia and northern kazakhstan izvestia said in the 
report wednesday 
it said experts of the governments giant agroindustrial 
complex had determined the grain procurements as a whole around 
the country will be somewhat lower than the level of the two 
previous years 
izvestia said that although it was reporting bad news it was a 
sign of progress in soviet society that the news about such a 
sensitive area of soviet life could be reported at all 
last years harvest was considered by western observers to be 
good because the growing season was unusually damp and cool 
figures for 1986 and 1987 were well above the average for 
19811985 of about 2035 million tons but well below official 
targets which western observers consider unrealistic 
the 1986 target was 255 million tons and soviet officials are 
trying to boost that to 275 million tons over several years time 
western experts say the soviet union uses about 240255 million 
tons of grain a year and must import what it cannot produce 
gorbachev is trying to reform soviet agriculture by giving 
families and small brigades of farm workers more responsibility and 
greater security on the huge state and collective farms 
the soviet leader hopes to encourage farmers to work harder by 
offering them a chance to earn more money and live better

the planes dropped bombs the kurdish 
survivor said they did not produce a big noise a yellowish 
cloud was created and there was a smell of rotten parsley or 
onions there were no wounds people would breathe the smoke then 
fall down and blood would come from their mouths 
the speaker one of 200 kurdish refugees interviewed in turkey 
earlier this month by two members of the staff of the senate 
foreign relations committee identified himself as a member of the 
kurdish insurgent forces fighting iraqs government 
the staff investigators peter w galbraith and christopher van 
hollen jr called the refugee accounts describing attacks on more 
than 30 villages persuasive and said the symptoms they reported 
are classically associated with mustard gas poisoning 
while acknowledging that some of the witnesses obviously were 
biased against iraq the two staff members concluded to dismiss 
the eyewitness accounts would require one to believe that 65000 
kurdish refugees confined to five disparate locations were able to 
organize a conspiracy in 15 days to defame iraq and that these 
refugees were able to keep their conspiracy a secret not only from 
us but from the world press 
kurds a nomadic moslem people have fought unsuccessfully for 
years to gain autonomy for their region within iraq kurdistan also 
extends into parts of iran and turkey 
citing the interviews and other evidence galbraith and van 
hollen concluded that overwhelming evidence exists that iraq 
subjected kurdish villages to three days of poison gas attacks last 
month 
in a report to foreign relations chairman claiborne pell 
dri they conclude that the attacks were part of a deliberate 
policy by iraq to depopulate the kurdish regions of the country 
we find no question that iraqs policy in kurdistan has the 
characteristics of genocide the staff investigators said 
the house foreign affairs committee prompted by earlier reports 
of iraqi attacks against the kurds is debating legislation to 
impose economic sanctions on the baghdad government the senate 
already has approved sanctions legislation against iraq 
iraq earlier accused of using mustard gas against attacking 
iranian soldiers has denied it employed chemical weapons against 
the kurds or anyone else 
the foreign relations staff report uses dozens of eyewitness 
accounts of the alleged chemical attacks against the kurds to paint 
a graphic narrative 
as described by the villagers the bombs that fell on the 
morning of august 25 did not produce a loud explosion the report 
said 
only a weak sound could be heard and then a yellowish cloud 
spread out from the center of the explosion and became a thin mist 
the air became mixed with a mixture of smells bad garlic 
rotten onions and bad apples 
those who were very close to the bombs died instantly the 
report said those who did not die instantly found it difficult 
to breathe and began to vomit the gas stung the eyes skin and 
lungs of the villagers exposed to it many suffered temporary 
blindness 
after the bombs exploded many villagers ran and submerged 
their faces in nearby streams to escape the spreading gas many of 
those who made it to the streams survived those who could not run 
from the growing smell mostly the very old and the very young 
died 
the survivors who saw the dead reported that blood could be 
seen trickling out of the mouths of some of the bodies the 
report said a yellowish fluid could also be seen oozing out of 
the noses and mouths of some of the dead some said the bodies 
appeared frozen many of the dead bodies turned blackish blue 
most of the villagers quickly abandoned the contaminated 
areas leaving the bodies unburied in the sun the report said 
in some cases they later returned to the poisoned villages to 
bury the bodies 
in every village where chemical bombs were dropped the 
livestock mostly donkeys and goats died the report said 
birds are also reported to have fallen out of the sky bees in 
the area are also said to have been killed by the gas 
galbraith and von hollen say the chemical attacks on kurdish 
villages continued on aug 26 and aug 27 and they concluded that 
no area in the northeastern reaches of iraqi kurdistan was safe 
from chemical attack 
thousands of kurds fled across the border into turkey but on 
aug 28 the iraqi army blocked a road parallel to the border 
trapping kurdish villagers inside iraq the report said 
an iraqi kurd who managed to cross the road said whatever 
they saw they shot children women young and old the report 
said 
it said that by sept 5 the iraqi army had set up camps along 
the border slowing the flow of refugees to a trickle 
in at least one village where kurds remained the village of 
baze survivors report iraqi forces opened fire with machine guns 
on everyone in the village and then used bulldozers to push the 
bodies into mass graves the report stated

policy of apartheid on wednesday but also expressed a desire to 
visit that country 
the pope returned monday from a 10day trip to zimbabwe 
botswana lesotho swaziland and mozambique he also made a brief 
unscheduled stop in south africa 
apartheid remains in clear conflict with human dignity from 
the christian point of view said john paul because all human 
beings enjoy the same dignity that cannot be weakened by belonging 
to a race 
surmounting discrimination in this field is an integral part 
of the program for liberation and selfdetermination of the african 
people he told a general audience 
the pontiff whose plane stopped in south africa because of 
stormy weather and mechanical difficulties at the airport in 
lesotho also said he believes that in the future he will be able 
to visit the faithful in such countries as south africa angola 
namibia sao tome and principe 
some antiapartheid leaders in south africa said the pope did 
not speak out strongly enough against that nation during his 
southern africa trip south africas system of apartheid gives the 
nations white minority control of the government and denies the 26 
million blacks a vote in national affairs

residents of jefferson tried to go about 
business as usual wednesday despite a fiery reminder that their 
small town on the edge of the white mountains remains under siege 
by an arsonist 
at 1010 tuesday night volunteer firefighters rushed to a 
burning unoccupied log cabin the 20th suspicious fire in the town 
of 900 since early may but the first since aug 23 
its gone on so long now that people are making the effort to 
live each day as it comes and live their normal lives said 
state sen charles bond a jefferson resident 
people had been trying to relax and hope that it is over 
bond said theres a feeling of disappointment im sure 
the fire extensively damaged the interior of the cabin which is 
about 10 miles from the center of town 
most residents have tired of talking about their ordeal and 
shrug off questions from reporters but a phone call to the general 
store wednesday morning revealed that residents were talking among 
themselves about the latest fire 
except for several cases of smoke inhalation there have been no 
injuries in the house and brush fires but several families have 
been left homeless and townspeople are fearful and angry many 
with weapons ready have taken to keeping watch over their homes 
all night 
the jefferson firemens association has raised 5000 for a 
reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction 
firefighters only hope it isnt a neighbor or a good friend 
state fire marshal william toland said he has received calls 
from current and former firefighting authorities throughout new 
england with the names of known arsonists and the possibility that 
one might be living in the jefferson area 
it takes time to check them all out he said 
the investigation has progressed he said declining to say more 
charles king a national arson expert who spent 23 years with 
the new york city fire department and has investigated 10000 
fires expects the fires to continue until they catch him if 
hes not scared off by now its kind of a try and catch me 
thing he said 
when you have multiple fires and have no leads the person 
who is setting the fires has to continue setting them for you to 
catch them 
new hampshire authorities have just got to get lucky they 
have a monster he said 
bond and king point to the surrounding wilderness and sparse 
population as impediments to catching the arsonist with match in 
hand 
there is no realistic way to patrol the area bond said of the 
towns 100 square miles 
there are so many areas where they can do what they do and 
just melt into the woods king said how can you patrol the 
area around jefferson 
in new york city the population is more dense and there are 
more sources of information king said in the city theres 
always that little old lady who sits up all night and sees 
everything

president reagan a sharp critic of the united 
nations during much of his administration is being pictured by his 
aides as one of the world bodys stoutest champions as he prepares 
to say his un farewells 
reagan will make what is expected to be his final appearance 
before the international forum in a visit monday and tuesday for 
the opening of the annual general assembly session in new york 
aides say he will deliver a major speech that may outline new 
proposals designed to deal with world trouble spots 
it will be his sixth speech to a regular un session or his 
seventh counting a 1982 appearance at a special session on 
disarmament 
it has been heralded with unaccustomed hoopla a press briefing 
on tuesday by assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgeway and 
another one on wednesday by reagans national security adviser 
colin l powell 
well its an important twoday event and we know youd like 
to have as many briefings as possible white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater explained 
powell told reporters that reagans involvement in general 
assembly activities has been unprecedented for an american 
president 
as a result of the presidents involvement i think it is fair 
to say that our relations with the united nations are excellent 
better than they have been for a long time the national security 
adviser said 
in his previous appearances however reagan often had 
criticized the un calling for reforms in its budgetary and 
hiring practices 
on sept 13 the white house announced that reagan would release 
188 million that the united states had withheld from the un 
because of us misgivings about the way the organization was run 
the president also said he would seek full funding for the next 
fiscal year 
powell said these payments have begun 
the national security adviser also said however that more than 
just budget reform is involved in the presidents new warmth toward 
the international organization 
the united nations has started to play a more important role 
around the world in helping to deal with regional conflicts he 
said they are really doing what we always hoped they would do 
powell said the presidents address monday would be a major 
foreign policy speech broad in scope it will be forward 
looking even as it reflects on past accomplishments 
we have a couple of new initiatives under consideration to 
help deal with some of the regional conflict issues around the 
world he added 
he also said he expects that the issue of chemical warfare will 
come up in some of reagans discussions with foreign leaders and 
that the issue might also be covered in the speech 
on monday night reagan will be host at a reception for heads of 
state and other dignitaries 
it will be sort of a farewell to un members powell said 
his criticism has produced results he said and he is 
acknowledging that there have been results hes essentially taking 
a snapshot in what he has done last week and the speech of where 
the un is now and where the un can go in the future

at age 70 news commentator paul harvey is about 
to become a museum piece but he isnt letting that interfere with 
his three daily radio shows his newspaper column or his speaking 
tours 
tomorrows the most exciting day in world to me harvey said 
recently and he has plenty of tomorrows planned new directions 
for his syndicated television program a new second home and studio 
in phoenix and adding a helicopter rating to his aviation licenses 
on saturday he is to be inducted into chicagos museum of 
broadcast communications 
i wont retire until i find something thats more fun to do 
harvey said gesturing around his officestudio decorated with 
civic awards keys to cities and cartoons 
harvey got his start at 15 with radio station kvoo in his native 
tulsa okla his name was paul h aurandt back then and it 
remained so through stints in kansas st louis and kalamazoo 
mich he changed it on taking his first chicago job in 1944 
now when he says good morning americans this is paul 
harvey he speaks to an estimated 22 million listeners on 1348 
radio stations but harvey tries to concentrate on one person 
im usually talking to my wifes sister harvey said she 
seems to epitomize grassroots america to me i keep asking myself 
would aunt betty really care would aunt betty really understand 
a lot of stories get rewritten or discarded because of that 
harvey shrugs off such adjectives as cornball and criticism 
of his format in which ominous headlines are often juxtaposed with 
cute animal stories and harveys comments 
hard cold facts have to be made palatable with some leavening 
but you cant use too much of that leavening no one wants to 
listen to just good news after all its been tried and it 
doesnt work 
he also does his own commercials delivering them in the same 
tone of voice as the news itself the practice is a harvey 
trademark and he defends it saying i use the products myself 
and i can vouch for them 
interviewer and pulitzer prizewinning author studs terkel who 
has been on chicago radio since 1945 says he understands harveys 
popularity but does not necessarily approve of the reasons 
at a certain point in the new deal and a certain point in the 
war paul said the usual expected things terkel said paul 
was offering pretty simplistic views and they caught on like a 
house afire i guess they were what some people wanted to hear 
hes a nice guy a very honest guy and a very fairminded 
guy said terkel i like him very much personally but i dont 
have much in common with his views in some ways hes confined his 
mind to the 12th century and its not the 12th century anymore 
he sees things in blacks and whites and the world is more complex 
than he realizes 
harveys family he and wife lynne have been married 47 years 
has sometimes influenced his broadcasts as when he reversed 
himself on the vietnam war he signaled the shift in a broadcast 
that opened i love you mr president but youre wrong 
i changed my mind about vietnam after a painful period of 
several months of soulsearching and discussions often around our 
own dinner table he said my son paul jr was exempt but he 
felt so strongly about the war that he chose to announce himself as 
a conscientious objector anyway 
it was the cold war that brought harvey to national prominence 
working as an abc radio commentator in 1951 he was arrested on 
orders of the atomic energy commission for scaling a fence and 
surreptitiously entering argonne national laboratory west of 
chicago 
harvey said it was investigative journalism and proved that 
security was lax at the aecs nuclear facilities the aec called it 
breaking and entering 
no indictment was filed but harry truman had me picking 
barbed wire out of my britches for about a decade harvey 
recalled 
having supported such political opposites as sens joseph 
mccarthy and william fulbright harvey says he once considered 
himself a conservative but can no longer define himself politically 
basically i believe in big people as opposed to big 
government to the extent that a sardine society will allow he 
said

the political season got into full swing this 
week but it was starkly clear that the center cannot hold 
three years after outstripping prime minister margaret thatcher 
in opinion polls and promising to break the mold of british 
politics the two center parties have been shunted to the sidelines 
britain once again appears to be a twoparty state the 
governing conservatives who are to meet oct 1114 and the 
opposition labor party whose convention is oct 27 
the social democratic party led david owen who is often rated 
the most formidable politician in britain after mrs thatcher 
ended its fourday convention tuesday just barely alive 
the newlyformed social and liberal democratic party is not in 
much better condition before its meeting sept 2429 in the seaside 
resort of blackpool 
the party a merger of social democrats and liberals once 
looked like it could turn british politics into a threeway race 
the alliance polled 225 percent of the vote in the last general 
election in june 1987 
today the two parties are fighting their political battles 
separately and cant reach even double digits in popular support 
recent polls show only 9 percent support for the social and liberal 
democrats and 4 percent for the social democrats 
the former political allies have become victims of unkind jokes 
and public indifference most analysts believe their main 
significance lies in their capacity to snatch just enough votes 
from labor to ensure mrs thatcher an unprecedented fourth 
consecutive term in the next election 
the social democratic party has only three members in 
parliament except for owen a national figure with a big following 
in his district of plymouth the legislators may well lose their 
seats in the next elections 
perhaps owen will reflect on the hopes thrown away and 
the opportunities bungled lamented the liberal guardian 
newspaper 
owen 50 the former foreign secretary once tipped for the 
premiership rallied only a handful of loyalists to debate 
apartheid nuclear weapons and british shopping hours at the party 
convention this week in torquay a south england coastal resort 
three years ago the british broadcasting corp gave owens party 
conference full and live television coverage just like the 
conservative labor and liberal party conferences the atmosphere 
was heady 
this year the trappings remained cameras reporters agendas 
resolutions but the bbc covered less than half the proceedings 
and delayed screening owens keynote address because it clashed 
with the olympics 
the centrist parties dont speak to a clear constituency and 
their support has generally been negative from people who dont 
like the tories or dont like labor rather than having any clear 
perception of what the centers policies are political analyst 
peter keliner said in an interview 
in most other west european countries center parties thrive 
often in coalition governments under electoral systems that 
allocate parliamentary seats according to the percentage of the 
vote won in britain a legislator wins only when he wins his 
district 
fundamentally the british electoral system operates against 
center parties kellner said 
owen appealed in vain to the labor party for a new voting system 
less harsh on small parties 
does the labor party go on vainly pretending that they can 
challenge and beat the conservatives outright he asked 
the social and liberal democratic party controls 19 seats in the 
650member house of commons compared with the conservatives 374 
and labors 228 
the experiment in centrist politics began in 1981 when 
disenchanted laborites broke away to form the social democratic 
party the same year the new party formed an alliance with the 
liberals a party started in 1828 that once governed the country 
but was reduced to a minority 
in the 1983 election the twoparty alliance made an impressive 
debut capturing onefourth of the vote four years later its 
share of the vote fell the alliance promptly split after its 
liberal coleader david steel demanded a formal merger arguing 
that a twoheaded party had no chance 
the merger which resulted in the social and liberal democratic 
party was finalized in march 1988 after months of political 
infighting 
owen has remained with what is left of the original social 
democratic party and steel retired and was succeeded by paddy 
ashdown a liberal legislator 
today as a result we see dr owen a leader without a party 
worth the name and the social and liberal democrats a party 
devoid of leaders worth the name commented peter jenkins 
columnist in the london newspaper the independent

the cia let north korean agents smuggle 
highperformance hughes helicopters out of the united states and 
withheld the information from law enforcement officials for nearly 
a year according to an nbc news report 
the agency was aware during the operation that shipments of the 
aircraft were being made through a west german trucking company 
between 1983 and 1985 nbc said wednesday 
authorities told nbc the trucking company had been bugged and 
the cia had listened to north korean agents plan details of the 
smuggling operation 
the cia believed its source of information was so sensitive that 
passing on details to law enforcement agencies might compromise cia 
agents in germany nbc reported 
cia spokesman william devine told the associated press the 
agency had no comment on the nbc report we neither confirm nor 
deny the report he said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci told nbc this is the kind 
of thing weve got to stop very damaging no question 
the north koreans protected their investment by obtaining a 
lloyds of london insurance policy against confiscation of the 
helicopters according to the report nbc said it obtained a copy 
of the policy which contained details of the smuggling routes from 
los angeles to north korea the choppers took a circuitous route 
that included stops in belgium the netherlands and hong kong 
authorities in california discovered the smuggling operation and 
seized the last shipment of 15 helicopters in 1985 but dave 
peters the lead us customs agent on the case told nbc had 
different information been passed along perhaps these shipments 
could have been stopped 
the helicopters were hughes 500e models commercial versions of

a consumer group is asking the transportation 
department to investigate the fitness of trans world airlines 
because of a series of impending financial transactions critics say 
threaten the carriers financial health 
the petition by the consumer federation of america maintains 
that plans to convert twa into a private company would saddle the 
airline with 23 billion in debt and declining assets because more 
than 700 million in twas cash could be used in the transaction 
twa chairman carl icahn earlier this month won investor support 
for the stock deal which would allow icahn to recover his 440 
million investment and control 90 percent of twas stock through a 
new holding company icahn now owns about 77 percent of the airline 
the petition filed by the consumer group claims twa could be put 
on the brink of bankruptcy by the transaction which also has 
been denounced by twas unions 
a suit filed by the air line pilots association in the new york 
supreme court asks that the court prevent icahn from looting 
twa through the stock transaction plan it maintains that icahn 
will strip twa of 665 million and threaten the airlines 
economic future 
the consumer federation told the department that air travelers 
holding nearly 500 million in advance and unused tickets as well 
as credits on twa frequent flyer programs stand to loose 
substantial amounts should twa go bankrupt or be forced to cut 
service or routes 
the federation alleged that icahn who purchased twa in 1985 
when it was near collapse has run up large debts at the company 
while holding on to large amounts of cash cash equivalents and 
marketable securities but the petition alleges most of those cash 
assets will be wiped out in the stock transaction 
the precarious financial structure after this transaction 
raises serious questions about whether the airline will be able to 
meet its financial and quality of service obligations to the 
public said mark cooper director of research for the consumer 
federation 
after running up huge amounts of debt the icahnled group now 
proposes to take all its money and then some out of twa leave the 
company with absolutely no equity and leave the airline on the 
brink of bankruptcy he continued 
furthermore the federation maintained that consumers are 
virtual captives of twa because of its domination in several 
cities such as st louis where more than 80 percent of all 
flights are operated by twa 
the failure of the airline or a significant reduction in 
service would have a devastating impact on these consumers who have 
few alternatives for air travel said cooper 
twa officials in st louis and new york did not immediately 
return calls seeking comment wednesday 
earlier this week the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress found that twa had achieved dominant 
control of airport traffic in and out of st louis since it 
acquired ozark air lines two years ago ozark had been twas 
biggest competitor at st louis 
bill mosely a transportation department spokesman said the 
petition was still being reviewed we are expecting some decision 
fairly soon he said 
earlier this year the department launched an indepth 
examination of texas air corp the holding company of eastern 
airlines and continental airlines after questions were raised 
about the companys financial dealings no irregularities were 
found at texas air

hungary is performing a delicate 
balancing act between east and west as it opens its doors to the 
business and technology of the capitalist world 
communist party chief karoly grosz has extended a diplomatic 
hand to many nations the rest of the eastern europe keeps at a 
distance 
hungary is the first east bloc nation that is to normalize 
diplomatic ties with south korea the announcement was made in 
seoul on sept 13 but no date has been set 
foreign ministry spokesman istvan komoroczki said the move was 
in harmony with a hungarian drive to openness to the world 
irrespective of social systems 
in the same week budapest also became the first eastern bloc 
nation to agree to resume diplomatic ties with israel severed 
after the 1967 middle east war after a private visit to budapest 
sept 1415 israeli premier yitzhak shamir the first israeli head 
of goverment to visit hungary said israel would renew full 
diplomatic ties with hungary in the near future no date was 
set 
grosz became party boss in may and immediately embarked on a 
series of trips to the west including visits to the united states 
canada and britain the communist leader has emphasized hungarys 
need for western technology and investments that would reverse its 
economic slump and allow it to begin chipping at an 18 billion 
foreign debt 
i hardly think i have to reiterate the importance to the life 
and development of this country of mutually advantageous external 
economic relations grosz told the englishlanguage official 
daily news last week 
after being named hungarys premier in june 1987 grosz also 
visited west germany in october of that year and greece in november 
but the communist party leader has been careful not to neglect 
or antagonize his soviet bloc allies as he opens his country to 
capitalitstic influences unlike romanian leader nicolae ceausescu 
whose maverick policies won him western support in the 1970s but 
irritated moscow 
in a balancing move grosz made a quick visit to moscow before 
his 10day us tour in july apparently to win soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs support for his overtures toward the west 
while visiting east germany in september grosz emphasized the 
need to boost economic relations between the two countries 
although east berlin has balked at gorbachevs proposed reforms 
budapest also has refrained from criticizing czechoslovakia 
although hungarian activists oppose a joint hydroelectric project 
on the danube river that links them 
when relations between romania and hungary hit an alltime low 
this summer in the wake of bucharests alleged discrimination 
against its 17 million minority hungarians grosz met with 
ceausescu in romania on aug 28 
the hungarian leader drew criticism at home for his failure to 
persuade the romanian government to scrap its plan to raze 
thousands of villages inhabited by the hungarian minority 
a western analyst in budapest speaking on condition of 
anonymity said hungary with its good human rights record and 
liberal policies has presented itself to the west as 
userfriendly 
at the same time budapest seems to have moscows approval in 
pursuing whatever foreign policy it chooses as long as they dont 
damage its ties to the warsaw pact alliance 
this independence began long before grosz and gorbachev but it 
received a boost when the two leaders came to power 
in 1985 hungary was the east bloc host of a 35nation cultural 
forum under the helsinki human rights accords 
in march 1987 hungary became the first east bloc country to 
join the west in backing a minority rights resolution at the vienna 
conference on security and cooperation in europe 
more recently budapest was the site aug 3031 of a closeddoor 
meeting of arms experts from nato and the warsaw pact and it has 
offered to host a sovietus summit 
hungarys joint bid with austria to host the 1995 worlds fair 
in vienna and budapest has strengthened the impression that hungary 
is seeking a role similar to that of neutral austria a center of 
eastwest contacts

investigators of last months delta air lines 
crash in texas are trying to determine whether several click 
sounds on the jets cockpit voice recorder are indications the 
flight crew set the flaps before takeoff 
the boeing 727 crashed seconds after taking off from the 
dallasfort worth airport aug 31 killing 14 of the 108 people 
aboard the investigation has focused on whether a false flap 
setting may have kept the plane from gaining altitude 
at least two clicks can be heard on the recording according to 
sources close to the investigation but additional sounds also are 
being studied to determine the exact number of clicks and whether 
they relate directly to the flaps position 
the flaps which provide an aircraft with lift during takeoff 
were supposed to have been set at 15 degrees for proper takeoff of 
flight 1141 
the dallas morning news on wednesday quoted national 
transportation safety board officials it did not name as saying 
they were studying the possibility that the flaps were extended 
but not far enough 
what you hear on the tape of the cockpit conversation are 
two clicks in quick succession that means that the flaps were at 
least at the 5degree setting the newspaper quoted one source as 
saying 
the boeing 727 has flap settings of 2 5 and 15 degrees the 
flap control mechanism in the cockpit has notches that produce 
clicking sounds as the lever is moved 
meanwhile investigators are expected to conduct tests in flight 
simulators to determine what minimum flap setting would have been 
required for the plane to gain proper lift 
some aviation experts who have followed the accident 
investigation say the boeing 727 which was not fully loaded 
should have been able to take off even with a lower than optimum 
flap setting 
drucella anderson a spokeswoman for the ntsb said wednesday 
the safety board would have no comment on what investigators are 
examining on the cockpit voice recorder tapes 
investigators have uncovered conflicting evidence as to the 
jets flap setting at the time of takeoff 
the voice recorder shows the copilot acknowledged having set 
the flaps to 15 degrees during the routine preflight checklist 
fifteen fifteen green the copilot was heard to say on 
the cockpit recorder tape according to sources involved in the 
investigation 
one source suggested that the copilot if he set the flaps 
probably did so earlier and was reading off the flap setting at the 
time his response was recorded 
the reference to green refers to a light showing the 
position of separate control surfaces on the forward edge of the 
wings called slats a green light shows them to be in the extended 
position 
slats also are supposed to be extended during takeoff but 
investigators have said they found the slats on the wrecked 
aircraft in an unlocked but retracted position 
investigators have said the jack screws on the wings also 
indicated the flaps were in a retracted position and the flapslat 
control lever in the cockpit was found in an up position 
indicating the flaps were retracted the copilot who was 
responsible for setting the flaps has told investigators he cannot 
remember anything after the aircraft was pushed back from the gates

as republican sen chic hecht struggles 
to hold his seat against a strong challenge from democratic gov 
dick bryan their battle has turned bitter with party and campaign 
officials making accusations on usuallyuntouchable subjects such 
as bryans sex life and hechts intelligence 
on the surface bryan and hecht have been debating one another 
on familiar themes a possible nuclear dump in nevada defense 
spending conservative vs liberal philosophies and balanced 
budgets 
hecht 59 has sought to link bryan to organized labor in this 
state of legalized gambling as well as tie the democrat to the 
liberal views of presidential nominee michael dukakis he also has 
accused bryan of deserting voters who elected him to a second 
fouryear term as governor in 1986 
in turn bryan 51 has attacked hecht for flipflops on the 
nuclear waste dump for voting against social security increases 
and for being generally ineffective he also points to poll after 
poll showing him with a comfortable lead over the oneterm 
incumbent 
and both have been publicly critical of another level of the 
campaign in which top party officials and key campaign staffers 
have accused one another of dirty tricks 
bryan blasted clark county republican chairman charles ivy for 
a despicable campaign tactic in mentioning on a radio talk show 
that there have been rumors about bryans little extramarital 
hobbies since he was first elected to the state assembly in 1968 
this kind of crap kind of discourages people from putting 
their names on the line said bryan adding that there is no 
truth to the rumors of infidelity and he would consider legal 
action after the election 
hecht insisted his campaign staff had nothing to do with the 
comment and any staffer would be fired immediately if involved 
hecht also has complained about recent news accounts citing his 
verbal miscues including a reference to a nuclear repository that 
unintentionally came out as nuclear suppository he also noted 
the oppositions references to hechts recent ranking by senate 
administrative assistants as the least effective member of the 
senate 
hecht a las vegas businessman upset sen howard cannon in 1982 
after the incumbent was bloodied during a tough primary fight 
cannon had to fight mob shadows after he was named in the 
indictment of then teamsters president roy lee williams and mob 
figure allen dorfman he testified at length in their trial just a 
month before the election 
bryan campaign chief sam singer describes the hecht campaign as 
watergatestyle politics the likes of which this state has never 
seen and blames hecht campaign chief ken rietz for the dirty 
tricks 
rietz responds that singers attack is a little bit like the 
pot calling the kettle black adding that the bryan camp 
criticized him for political low blows and now theyre 
distributing information on me 
singer circulated a stack of news clips linking rietz to 
political espionage during the watergate era and quoting 
thenrepublican national chairman george bush now the gop 
presidential nominee as saying in 1973 he wanted none of the 
people involved in the activity ever working on gop campaigns again 
rietz said bush wasnt referring to him but rather was talking 
about those convicted in the watergate scandal that didnt 
include me i was not charged with anything during watergate he 
said ive been working in republican campaigns ever since then 
singer said the hecht campaign has shown a series of dirty 
tricks that began with a rietz employee or exemployee trying to 
dig up information on democratic lt gov bob miller who would 
take over bryans job as governor should bryan defeat hecht 
singer said that was followed by claims by ivy that bryan had 
engaged in extramarital affairs misstatements and misleading 
advertisements and what appeared to be a planted story about lt 
gov millers ties to a casino executive convicted of skimming 
there are dirty fingerprints everywhere said singer 
nevadas gaming industry has a black book of unsavory types 
excluded from clubs and if nevada politics had a black book 
senator hechts campaign would be in it

george bushs press secretary says the 
campaign is not interested in anything that would garble our 
message and that includes cluttering it up with questions from 
the news media 
so the republican presidential campaign is wending its way 
toward the november election with an eye toward maximizing canned 
events that look good on television and minimizing contact with 
reporters who might ask questions that are not on the bush agenda 
bushs democratic rival michael dukakis has tried to take a 
page from the same strategy playbook but so far with less success 
as his tv shots often find his back to the cameras 
even his recent celebrated tank ride aimed at projecting 
himself as strong on defense and widely photographed turned out to 
be a flop at convincing viewers a poll showed 
still both candidates are engaged in an election game plan that 
keeps reporters at a distance so as not to detract from their 
stateoftheart visual events that they wrap around their campaign 
message of the day 
bush press secretary sheila tate said the idea is that the 
campaign is trying to communicate with voters and were not 
going to purposely garble our message by everyday discussing what 
reporters put forth as an agenda as opposed to our own 
thus when bush recently went to new jersey to appeal to hispanic 
and bluecollar voters the traveling press was ushered into the 
goya food plant to watch him sample hispanic foods 
although the reporters were stationed only a few feet from him 
bush waved off their questions because he was engaged in food 
tasting at the moment we gotta get the message out he said 
the orchestrated days with little opportunity to question or 
challenge the candidates on topical issues has engendered 
frustration among the press corps whose job it is to cover the 
campaigns some tv and print journalists have begun including 
regular statements in their bush stories such as bush as usual 
refused to respond to any questions 
the bush campaign generally is keeping the candidate so far from 
reporters that were even out of shouting distance now said 
usa today reporter jessica lee 
reporter ellen warren of knightridder has taken to wearing a 
monocular a field glass with a single eyepiece so that she can 
observe bush from her faraway press perch 
dukakis remains more accessible than bush but the access is 
generally at latenight airport arrivals when most media deadlines 
are already past 
both candidates occasionally chat on the record with reporters 
flying with them but most reporters agree that these casual 
sessions do not lend themselves to the more probing 
questionandanswer typical of a more formal news conference and 
the candidates tend to close it off when the questions take on that 
tone 
dukakis has an average of one or two news conferences a week 
considerably less than before a campaign survey found his tv 
coverage was centering not on his tailormade message but on his 
responses to reporters questions about bushs latest allegations 
since bush was nominated in midaugust his scheduled 
questionandanswer sessions with reporters have dwindled to an 
average of one a week and chances to shout questions at airports 
and rope lines are significantly fewer 
campaign officials dont deny the holdthepressatbay strategy 
in these last weeks of the campaign we have to have a clear 
message said tate it is important to us that we set the 
agenda we have a need to be responsive to the press we also have 
a need to run a successful campaign the only way to do that is to 
get your message out and your agenda 
senior dukakis aide kirk odonnell recently complained that the 
tv networks werent covering dukakis speeches and said the 
campaign would alter its media strategy to get on the networks 
bushs advance team diligently escorts camera crews around 
factories and behind podiums for the best shots of the gop nominee 
the results are pictureperfect tv a series of events where 
bush has stood amid waving american flags has spoken against the 
backdrop of majestic columns on capitol steps and been flanked by 
colorful school bands cheerleaders and choirs 
the dukakis visuals are improving since the media adviser 
francis obrien began traveling with the candidate two weeks ago 
but the democrat has had a string of events where cameras saw 
only the back of his head or where the lighting obliterated what 
should have been a good shot 
that was the case when he went to yellowstone national park to 
stand before a blackened forest the singed background was so dark 
it was impossible to tell what it was 
another time dukakis lined up a group of teenagers on a san 
francisco beach to talk to them about the environment the students 
faced the cameras while dukakis was positioned on the sand in 
front of them his back to the cameras

former politburo member geidar aliev ducked 
military service in world war ii and later covered up his scheme 
with phony records saying he was a veteran a newspaper reported 
a lengthy article in wednesdays editions of the weekly 
literaturnaya gazeta accused aliev the former communist party boss 
of azerbaijan and a close associate of the late soviet leader 
leonid i brezhnev of rampant corruption 
aliev brezhnevs last appointment to the ruling politburo 
before he died in 1982 worked for many years in the azerbaijan kgb 
secret police 
aliev 65 was dropped from the politburo on oct 21 1987 
ostensibly for health reasons but there were suggestions that he 
was tainted with corruption in his association with brezhnev now 
widely criticized for permitting corruption and stagnation 
a kgb commission established years ago that when nazi germany 
attacked the soviet union in 1941 the 18yearold aliev quit his 
studies in the industrial institute and to avoid being called 
into the army went to his motherland his native town 
nakhichevan said the article which was written by lawyer arkady 
vaksberg there he obtained a document stating that he allegedly 
suffered from a severe form of tuberculosis and was freed from 
service 
he then began work in the archives of the nkvd the precursor of 
the kgb vaksberg said 
after the war aliev obtained documents saying he was a war 
veteran the article said 
despite the commissions discovery alievs older brother 
gasan intervened aliev was reprimanded but remained in the 
communist party and was able to build his career the article said 
vaksberg said a former kgb officer and state prosecutor gambai 
mamedov repeatedly tried to draw the attention of azerbaijani 
officials to widespread corruption and falsification of production 
statistics under aliev but the lawyer said mamedov was hounded out 
of his job and the republic by officials who lavished praise on 
aliev in party and government meetings 
he said that since alievs ouster mamedov has been able to 
return to baku the azerbaijan capital from leningrad where he 
lived in the apartment of his wifes relatives

its the battle of devils den pitting 
tourist convenience against the national park services desire to 
curtail traffic through the gettysburg battlefield 
the park service has proposed eliminating two access roads as 
well as part of a third to the historic devils den area of the 
pennsylvania battlefield 
the idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original 
appearance and to halt an erosion problem at devils den an area 
of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot national park service 
spokesman robert davidson said wednesday 
the debate moved here last week when rep bill goodling rpa 
presented to park service director william penn mott a petition 
containing signatures of more than 11000 people who oppose the 
plan 
mott has agreed to personally inspect the site as part of a 
review of the plan according to park service spokesman george 
berklacy 
there was a road constructed in about 1904 during a period 
when people were visiting on horses and buggies davidson said 
since then the response to more and larger vehicles has been 
more pavement and we just feel that the time has come to take a 
new direction 
but the devils den access committee brought maps and a slide 
show last week to document their concerns to the park service that 
the plan would be counterproductive 
phil cole a battlefield guide who heads the citizen protest 
said wednesday that he fears people would have to walk to devils 
den from a planned new parking lot that may be too small to 
accommodate visitors 
the walk is threequarters of a mile round trip 
people are not all joggers or athletic plus there is 
inclement weather and hot days he said 
traffic he said will be diverted to other roads that will 
become more congested 
an access road would be made available so that the disabled 
could be driven to the site the park service said 
the gettysburg national military battlefield has been holding 
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the bloody civil war battle 
on july 13 1863 some 50000 union and confederate soldiers were 
killed or wounded on the battlefield later the scene of abraham

a nervous airport security dog prompted extra 
precautions as soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrived 
wednesday night for what could be the last fulldress ussoviet 
talks in washington during the reagan administration 
shevardnadze landed without incident however and was taken to 
the soviet embassy where he will stay during two days of meetings 
with secretary of state george shultz and other senior us 
officials ending in a call on president reagan at the white house 
on friday 
the soviet aeroflot jetliner carrying shevardnadze from new york 
was parked more distant than usual from terminal buildings and news 
media facilities at andrews air force base outside washington 
because a dog used to sniff and detect explosives became nervous 
said a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but it proved to be just a precaution and no explosives were 
found the official said 
a motorcade carried deputy secretary of state john c whitehead 
assistant secretary rozanne ridgway and other welcoming officials 
from the state department and soviet embassy to planeside while 
camera crews assigned to photograph the arrival were left at their 
usual position at least 250 feet away 
shevardnadze making no arrival statement left the airport 
immediately 
by state department count his negotiations with shultz on arms 
control human rights ussoviet and regional issues will be 
their 28th meeting 
they are expected to meet again at un headquarters in new york 
next week and possibly in europe if there is a breakthrough on 
human rights and other issues before the current review session at 
vienna austria of the 1975 helsinki accords on eastwest security 
and cooperation 
but ms ridgway told reporters this week there is no possibility 
that the two sides will be able to resolve differences before the 
end of the year on their mutual goal of achieving 50 percent cuts 
in strategic ballistic missile warheads to enable reagan to sign 
another arms treaty before the end of his presidency 
shevardnadzes schedule also includes a separate meeting with 
vice president george bush the republican candidate to succeed 
reagan arranged at bushs request a us official said bushs 
democratic rival massachusetts gov michael dukakis has not asked 
for a meeting with the soviet minister the official added

the cabinet today temporarily passed the imperial 
mantle to crown prince akihito as japan fretted over the failing 
health of emperor hirohito the worlds longest reigning monarch 
officials of the imperial household agency which runs palace 
affairs set up booths today around the country and allowed people 
to sign their names in books for the emperor 
crowds have gathered in front of the imperial palace in central 
toyko since hirohito took to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four 
days ago palace officials said today that he remained in serious 
but stable condition 
i felt like my grandfather was dying aya kitade a 
22yearold college student said wednesday at the palace 
she came from kyoto 230 miles away after her grandparents 
asked her to visit and convey their greetings to the emperor 
across japan shinto shrines held services to pray for the 
emperor 
many older people still hold hirohito in high regard but 
younger japanese typically give him little thought a minority 
strongly opposes the imperial system charging it represents the 
strongly centralized state control and militarism that 
characterized wartime japan 
the united states forced the emperor who has occupied the 
throne since 1926 to publicly renounce his claim to divinity after 
world war ii he remains a symbol of japan without wielding any 
real power 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi said the cabinet met today 
and agreed to put 54yearold akihito temporarily in charge of all 
imperial duties 
taking into consideration the emperors illness and medical 
treatment we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume 
responsibilities obuchi said in a nationally televised press 
conference 
government officials said foreign minister sosuke uno will not 
leave for washington today for talks with secretary of state george 
p shultz they said that in view of domestic circumstances 
they had also postponed upcoming visits to japan by prime minister 
ciriaco de mita of italy on sunday and by irish leader charles j 
haughey on wednesday 
one year ago when hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass 
operation the prince took charge of all duties for three months 
in december hirohito resumed most of his imperial duties 
the emperors health problem began late monday when he vomited 
blood the hemorraging is related to an inflamed pancreas 
palace officials widely quoted in press reports said the 
emperor on wednesday requested food and a television to watch his 
favorite sport sumo wrestling the emperor is known as shy man 
especially fond of his work as a published marine biologist

rotary club luncheon 
after introducing quayle goldwater reclaimed the microphone 
i forgot something that i had to say and i hope you take this 
kindly but i want you to go back and tell george bush to start 
talking about the issues ok the 1964 republican presidential 
candidate said 
goldwater did not elaborate but the dig seemed aimed at bushs 
capturetheflag campaigning from his constant criticism of 
michael dukakis for vetoing a 1977 bill to penalize teachers who 
refuse to lead the pledge of allegiance to his stop tuesday at a 
new jersey flag factory 
goldwater brushed aside reporters questions afterwards saying 
im not talking i want to get the hell outof here 
quayle before the 400 rotarians laughed and said only i 
wish barry would just say whats on his mind 
later he told reporters in bakersfield calif barry 
goldwater is my dear friend were talking about the issues 
quayle almost crossed paths with his democratic counterpart 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas at the airport in fresno calif 
where their campaign planes were parked 400 yards apart for a 
while they did not meet 
the final day of summer was an unusual one for the 41yearold 
quayle who trekked from las vegas to phoenix to californias san 
joaquin valley before reuniting with his wife marilyn for a 
fundraiser at a posh los angeles hotel a dozen feminists were 
waiting there with signs protesting bush and quayles opposition to 
abortion 
he was hounded in two stops in the phoenix area by vietnam 
veterans three of them clad in colorful chicken costumes 
he made a detour to pick up goldwater at his home only to get 
admonished 
arizonas ousted republican gov evan mecham showed up to 
deliver an unsolicited endorsement of quayle 
at california state universityfresno he was greeted by 
skydivers balloons and a phalanx of students chanting 
bushnoriega 88 
but inside a student union he got an enthusiastic reception 
from 600 students as he denounced dukakis for opposing the death 
penalty and signing a proclamation in february 1985 supporting a 
union boycott of table grapes 
in both fresno and at a rally before 1000 people outside the 
courthouse in bakersfield quayle lit into dukakis as a 
cardcarrying member of the aclu and charged he would appoint 
judges like rose bird the liberal california supreme court justice

in an unusual meeting of the financial 
district and the red light district an investor group plans a 
stock offering to raise money to buy the mustang ranch the 
nations biggest legal bordello 
the group led by reno attorney peter perry and real estate 
developer donald clough plans to raise 233 million through a 
stock offering to purchase the famed brothel 10 miles east of here 
perry said 
the group filed an application friday with the securities and 
exchange commission to sell 1165 million common shares of mustang 
ranch inc at 20 a share perry said wednesday 
this is the second attempted share offering to raise money to 
buy the mustang ranch a proposed 18 million sale by another group 
fell through in 1985 when it failed to attract enough investor 
interest 
weve got everything in motion now and are just waiting to see 
what the sec does said perry chief executive of mustang ranch 
inc formed last year to make the transaction 
perry citing sec rules declined to discuss details of the deal 
or name the other two officers besides clough who will control more 
than 40 percent of the company 
documents filed with the sec indicate 18 million would be used 
to buy the 105room brothel the remaining funds would cover 
capital improvements financial reserves and administrative costs 
the ranchs founder and owner joe conforte announced in july 
his plan to retire from the business after roughly 30 years he 
needs the proceeds from the sale to pay back income taxes and 
penalties 
im 62 years old said conforte who was brought to america 
from sicily in 1937 by his producesalesman father i only have a 
few years left to live the good life and i want to enjoy them 
mustang ranchs gross revenue fell last year to 56 million 
from 59 million in 1986 but profits rose to 917000 from 
848000 according to the prospectus 
the prostitutes work as independent contractors paying the 
ranch 10 a day for meals and facilities and splitting the gross 
receipts 5050 with the house 
the prospectus noted that the stock offering was a highrisk 
venture because of potential lawsuits adverse publicity and the 
possibility that clients could get acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
nevada law requires prostitutes to be tested monthly for aids 
and so far no working women have tested positive for the aids 
virus the brothels also require customers to use condoms to 
protect against disease 
the sec planned to file a response to the investor groups 
application within 20 days listing any deficiencies 
if the stock offering is allowed it would the first time a 
bordello has become a publiclyheld corporation 
conforte and his wife sally began operations at the 440acre 
ranch in the late 1950s when nevada merely tolerated prostitution 
in 1971 conforte won storey countys approval for the brothel 
pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in most 
counties the state now has about three dozen licensed brothels 
although none is as large as the mustang 
the couple has been trying to sell the ranch since early 1985 
when conforte finished serving 18 months in prison on charges 
involving 2 million in unpaid income taxes he also served time 
for an income tax conviction in the 1960s 
at least 12 million in proceeds from the sale would go to pay 
back the taxes plus interest and penalties conforte said

a modified version of a natural poison kills 
aidsinfected cells in the test tube while ignoring normal cells 
offering a possible strategy to help treat aids scientists 
reported today 
the specialized toxin may be able to kill infected cells in 
people before the cells produce more viruses said researcher 
bernard moss of the national institutes of health 
moss ira pastan and five other nih scientists describe 
experimental results in todays issue of the british journal nature 
in a second development scientists at nih and in italy say they 
have produced stable aids virus infections in rabbits a step that 
may help animal testing of aids vaccines and drugs until now such 
infections have been shown only in chimpanzees which are costly 
and in limited supply 
the poison research involved pseudomonas exotoxin a which is 
produced by bacteria called pseudomonas aeruginosa it is so strong 
that a dose about the size of a salt grain can kill a human 
were encouraged both by the low amount of drug which is 
effective and its ability to ignore uninfected cells in testtube 
experiments said moss 
to make the poison seek out aidsinfected cells researchers 
essentially replaced the part of the poison molecule that normally 
guides the toxin to its target in its place they put part of a 
protein called cd4 which latches onto a protein found on the 
surface of aidsinfected cells 
the redesigned poison was produced by combining genes for the 
poison and the cd4 and placing them into bacteria called e coli 
the bacteria commonly used as a vehicle for gene splicing then 
churned out the hybrid poison 
in testtube experiments with white blood cells the redesigned 
poison killed infected cells while leaving uninfected ones unharmed 
moss said scientists still have to determine whether the poison 
would reach all infected cells in the body and whether it would 
overlook infected cells in which the virus was lying dormant rather 
than reproducing 
while the toxin would not kill the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome previous research suggests it might 
prevent the virus from infecting new cells moss said 
martin hirsch of harvard medical school called the poison 
research a scientific advance but said any medical usefulness will 
take a long time to demonstrate there is a long jump from the 
test tube to the patient he said 
also in todays issue of nature italian scientists report aids 
infections lasting a year in six rabbits and in an interview this 
week thomas kindt of nih said about 20 rabbits in his laboratory 
have remained infected for up to about 10 months 
oliviero varnier of the institute of microbiology in genoa 
italy said in a telephone interview that four rabbits have now 
stayed infected for 18 months the other two died a month ago of 
unknown causes he said 
his group injected the rabbits in the abdominal area with either 
infected cells or freefloating virus a few days before the 
injection the animals had been treated to produce white blood 
cells in the abdominal area that would be ready to engulf 
anything that you give to them varnier said 
but no significant outward symptoms from the infections were 
observed varnier and kindt said 
kindts experiments produced aids virus infection by injecting 
infected human blood cells 
duke university researcher dani bolognesi said rabbit infections 
may prove useful for vaccine and drug testing if they can be 
produced routinely and if they are found to mimic natural virus 
infection closely enough

critics of the ruling sandinistas by saying the cia tried to 
destabilize nicaragua

private enterprise council on wednesday called wrights statements 
irresponsible full of politicking and moral and ethical faults 
he said wright made the comments out of ambition and a 
partisan fight to reach the white house in his internal 
politicking lacking ethics and morals wright is capable of 
sacrificing the security of people 
bolanos made his remarks from miami to radio liberacion the 
nicaraguan rebels clandestine radio station 
wright dtexas said tuesday that congress had received clear 
testimony that the reagan administration sought to secretly 
undermine the nicaraguan peace process thus damaging longterm 
prospects for an accord between the leftist sandinistas and 
ussupported contra rebels 
president reagan on wednesday accused wright of talking 
indiscreetly about us intelligence secrets but stopped short of 
denying the claim 
the sandinista government had no immediate response but the 
official newspaper barricada ran a banner headline wednesday

lasting peace to replace a march 23 preliminary ceasefire pact 
cannot be held until the 40 are freed

machetes during a mass six days before the coup 
the demonstration was previously scheduled for wednesday and 
confederation leaders had suspended it saying they would meet 
instead with the leader of the military rebellion sgt joseph 
heubreux and avril 
there was no confirmation the meeting was held 
a mob on wednesday placed the smoldering body of a tonton 
macoute killed the previous day at st boscos where several 
hundred people gathered 
the macoutes were the private army of the regime created by 
francois duvalier that ruled this impoverished nation for 29 years

military 
when the high command hesitated soldiers took matters in their 
own hands ousting their commanders all over the carribean country

a peoples army at least for the moment said a western 
diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity

a federal appeals court has barred the 
deportation of up to 100000 aliens until it decides whether the 
immigration and naturalization service was too restrictive in 
denying them amnesty 
in a decision made public wednesday the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals also authorized temporary work permits for the aliens 
the court ordered the temporary measures until it rules on 
whether the ins exceeded its authority by denying amnesty to aliens 
who had left the united states briefly depending on its ruling 
the court could reopen the nowexpired deadline for aliens to apply 
for amnesty under the new immigration law 
the court said it would hear arguments in the case in november 
under an accelerated schedule the government is appealing a 
federal judges ruling in april that the ins interpreted the 
grounds for amnesty too narrowly 
this is a great day for our system of justice said ralph 
abascal a california rural legal assistance lawyer in the case he 
said four other federal judges around the nation have restricted 
ins enforcement of related provisions of the amnesty law but that 
this was the first order from an appellate court 
the number of aliens potentially affected by the case is 
estimated to be from 50000 to 100000 nationwide he said 
justice department lawyer scott mcintosh who represented the 
ins declined comment 
the new immigration law allowed aliens who have been in the us 
continuously since jan 1 1982 to apply for amnesty by may the 
first step toward legal residence 
a trip outside the country that is brief casual and 
innocent does not disqualify an alien from amnesty under an ins 
interpretation however any departure after may 1 1987 when 
amnesty applications began that lacked advance approval from the 
ins could not be innocent and made the alien ineligible for 
amnesty 
abascal said in a statement that the ins had used its reading of 
the law to bar amnesty to several aliens who had made brief trips 
to mexico to see a dying relative and to one who fell asleep in a 
car shortly before his friends went to tijuana for a twohour 
frolic 
chief us district judge lawrence karlton of sacramento ruled 
in april that the ins interpretation was not authorized by the law 
after finding that numerous aliens had been denied amnesty 
improperly or had been discouraged from applying he issued a 
nationwide order in june reopening the application period through 
nov 30 which the government appealed 
the appeals court decision requires that the government question 
any aliens arrested under the immigration law to see if they would 
be eligible for amnesty if not for foreign travel of the kind 
covered by the suit if so the aliens must be released without 
bond and given work permits while the court case is pending 
the same rights must be provided to aliens who approach the ins 
with questions about their status and are covered by the case 
abascal said the ins also is required to contact aliens who have 
been denied amnesty because of brief trips out of the country and 
tell them their cases are being reopened

the nations railroads routinely use freight 
and passenger cars with defective brakes wheels and undercarriages 
despite warnings from safety inspectors according to a newspaper 
report 
business pressures have created a tugofwar between inspectors 
who order cars repaired in the shop and transportation employees 
who schedule trains said peter brawley assistant general foreman 
of amtraks coach yard at philadelphias 30th street station 
im not going to tell you that there arent cars getting out 
of here that shouldnt be moving it happens brawley told the 
pittsburgh press in an article published wednesday 
an inspector finds something wrong and wants to shop the car 
but transportation needs that car for a train leaving in three 
hours so the car goes out he said 
in addition to amtrak the nations only longdistance passenger 
rail line problems were found with conrail and csx freight trains 
the press said 
however the newspaper did not link any train derailments or 
other major service problems to the defects 
wayne geist an engineer on amtraks broadway limited on the 
pittsburghharrisburg leg of its chicagonew york run said he was 
ordered june 19 not to slow down despite repeatedly reporting that 
his speedometer did not work 
im talking about taking a train loaded with 400 or 500 
passengers up and down the steepest grades in pennsylvania where a 
difference of 5 or 10 mph will not only violate conrails amtraks 
and the federal rules but also endanger the passengers geist 
said 
amtrak chairman w graham claytor said his company runs safe 
operations although conditions are not ideal 
business is so good we overutilize our equipment he said 
we have a whole lot of mechanical failures on the road more than 
we should we turn around equipment too fast but we cant let it 
lay over 48 hours if we do that a lot of people are not going to 
be able to ride 
but we are not going to cut corners on safety or on our 
basic maintenance policy claytor said 
the press said it learned that one amtrak car was used between 
harrisburg and philadelphia from june 18 until july 5 even though 
inspectors had found a steel wheel marked by a heat crack that 
could have caused the wheel to shatter 
the newspaper said three cars that derailed in the 30th street 
station yard june 29 were sent out unrepaired on a philadelphianew 
york run despite amtrak policy requiring the replacement of any 
wheels that leave the track 
there was a serious mistake made by releasing those three 
cars said robert burk chief mechanical officer of the federally 
subsidized rail service 
the press said it documented similar problems a week later in 
chicago on amtraks california zephyr bound for san francisco the 
empire builder bound for seattle and the capitol limited bound for 
washington dc 
at conrails giant enola yard at harrisburg the newspaper said 
it observed a man in a supervisors white hardhat in midjune 
remove nine tags that inspectors had attached to freight cars to 
indicate the need for major repairs 
all nine cars were returned to service despite the defects 
which the newspaper said included a cracked undercarriage on a 
tanker 
similar activity was documented at conrail yards in buffalo 
ny conway pa and columbus ohio the newspaper said 
donald rugh an ohio public utility commission rail inspector 
said i get the conrail trains that come out of conway when they 
get into canton and they are loaded with defects i have found 25 
or 30 on a single train ranging the full gamut from bad air brakes 
to broken handholds 
richard hasselman conrails vice president for operations 
responded that he believes inspections are being conducted properly 
because supervisors make spot checks regularly 
hasselman said cars are tagged sometimes for repairs that arent 
needed and sometimes no defects are found on a tagged car 
the press cited its own observations and inspectors records in 
reporting that csx freight cars with defects ranging from 
inoperable brakes to cracked couplers were allowed to roll from 
yards in atlanta nashville hazard ky and other locations 
however a crane jones a senior vice president at csx 
retorted 
if we find any supervisor doing that or allowing this to be 
done well we have a saying on the railroad that we would 
almost make a milepost out of him

a man on parole for manslaughter and held 
for harassment was freed on 500 bail and allowed to commit a 
double murdersuicide because a judge did not take steps to 
discover the mans violent past a report said 
the report by morris county assignment judge reginald stanton 
also said failures by probation officers prosecutors and family 
caseworkers contributed to the release of nicolas vutca of 
parsippanytroy hills 
no officials will be disciplined however because no one was 
guilty of repeated acts of violating proper procedures stanton 
said 
vutca a romanian national killed his wife dorina and her 
mother maria vacariu on sept 10 at their home in effort pa 
and then shot himself to death 
looking at the total situation we see an incredible 
combination of things that went wrong said stantons report 
which was released tuesday and submitted to state supreme court 
chief justice robert wilentz 
if any one of them had gone right the tragic consequence 
might have been avoided 
vutca was convicted of aggravated manslaughter in 1983 in the 
stabbing death a year earlier of his livein girlfriend he was 
paroled in 1986 and married dorina last year 
vutca was arrested aug 17 on charges of harassment and 
violating a court order to stay away from his wife mrs vutca and 
her mother then moved to pennsylvania 
superior court judge karen d russell set bail at 25000 the 
day of the arrest the next day morris county judge paul bangiola 
in a routine bailreview hearing reduced the bail to 5000 or 
500 if paid in cash 
vutca posted bail tracked down his wife and motherinlaw and 
shot them to death authorities said 
stantons report said bangiola didnt know about vutcas 
manslaughter conviction when he lowered bail because ms russells 
bail memorandum mentioning the conviction didnt arrive on his desk 
until the next day 
the report also said a probation officer failed to notify the 
county prosecutors office about bangiolas hearing and the 
hearing was conducted without a prosecutor present 
the report said many judges in judge bangiolas position would 
have seen the 25000 bail and suspected that the case must involve 
something more than verbal threats it said bangiola could have 
telephoned ms russell or taken other steps to find out more about 
vutcas background 
bangiola said through his secretary he would not comment on the 
report 
stanton said judges and court employees have been 
reeducated about proper procedures and that workers and the 
prosecutors office have been encouraged to inform him or other 
judges when they think something has gone wrong

as congregation sharai torah observed yom kippur 
at a nearby jewish school a 12yearold boy apologized for setting 
fire to the congregations building days earlier 
two youths were arrested on arson and other charges after they 
allegedly spraypainted swastikas on the walls of the orthodox 
synagogue set a fire and unrolled and burned six torahs the 
sacred handwritten scrolls that contain the first five books of the 
old testament 
the crime on the sabbath before yom kippur shocked brooklyns 
huge jewish community an estimated 10000 people turned out sunday 
for a memorial service for the burned torahs 
we believe that everything including this fire is from 
god said the president of the 300member brooklyn congregation 
hirsch wolf 
the president of the rabbinical council of america rabbi max n 
schreier issued a statement wednesday calling it an act of 
ruthless vandalism the likes of which have not been seen since the 
holocaust

his first name joey said he was only out to have fun saturday 
morning when he and a 15yearold companion desecrated the 
synagogue 
in an interview with new york newsday published wednesday joey 
said he hadnt known what a synagogue was and did not vandalize it 
out of antisemitism if he had the opportunity he said he would 
tell members of the congregation im really sorry

fish oil provides the first effective way of 
keeping newly opened heart arteries working smoothly after 
angioplasty a procedure used on 200000 americans annually with 
heart disease according to a study published today 
it looks very promising said dr gregory j dehmer its 
the only agent so far that has even shown a hint of having an 
effect this study is a little like the light at the end of the 
tunnel 
dehmer now a cardiologist at the university of north carolina 
was in charge of the fish oil experiment at the veterans 
administration medical center in dallas 
angioplasty is widely used because it provides a nonsurgical 
alternative to coronary bypass operations for people with coronary 
artery disease doctors use tiny balloons to squeeze open clogged 
heart arteries 
a major drawback of the procedure is restenosis the spontaneous 
reclosing of the newly cleared arteries this happens in about 
onethird of all patients within six months of their angioplasties 
when the va doctors tested fish oil on 82 men they found that 
it cut the restenosis rate by two to three times in men who were at 
especially high risk of this complication 
reaction from other experts was mixed 
dr alexander leaf of massachusetts general hospital who is 
conducting a major study of fish oil in angioplasty said he 
believes the therapy works 
but dr spencer b king iii of emory university commented my 
main concern is that a lot of small studies have made it look like 
restenosis was helped by so many different interventions i would 
like to see bigger numbers before i buy into this 
the study was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine one similar recent study also found that fish oil seemed 
to prevent restenosis while two others showed no effect 
although its in the new england journal its a little 
premature to rush out and buy a carload of fish oil for every 
angioplasty patient said dr donald baim of bostons beth israel 
hospital a coauthor of one of the negative studies 
the researchers said they do not recommend that all angioplasty 
patients take fish oil because their study was too small to be the 
basis of sweeping recommendations and they said people undergoing 
angioplasties should not take the supplements unless they discuss 
it with their doctors 
however dr eric h eichhorn a coauthor of the study 
commented if i were undergoing angioplasty the balance of 
potential benefits versus risks is such that i would take it 
myself 
fish oil capsules widely available in drug and health stores 
have been advertised as a way of warding off heart disease 
although evidence is still skimpy 
eskimos who eat large quantities of oily fish such as salmon 
have remarkably low levels of heart disease however doctors 
disagree over whether fish oil capsules will prevent the gradual 
buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries a process called 
atherosclerosis that underlies heart attacks 
leaf said the latest study suggests to him that fish oil 
capsules may be of benefit to everyone at risk of heart disease 
not just those undergoing angioplasty 
since angioplasty restenosis pathologically appears to be a 
very rapid progression of atherosclerosis the fact that they find 
they can prevent restenosis suggests that fish oil will prevent 
coronary heart disease and heart attacks leaf said 
in the latest study half the patients took 18 capsules of 
maxepa fish oil daily starting a week before their angioplasties 
and continuing for six months after three months 19 percent of 
those who took fish oil had restenosis compared with 46 percent in 
the comparison group

the landmark 1986 tax overhaul boosted the 
bite on 250 giant profitable corporations by about 9 billion last 
year but still left 16 of them legally paying no federal income 
tax a private research group said today 
the number among the 250 that paid no tax was down from 40 in 
1986 and from a high of 72 in 1982 according to citizens for tax 
justice a laborfinanced organization whose reports were credited 
with helping win passage of the new tax law two years ago 
the 1986 law cut tax rates for most individuals and corporations 
but took away or reduced several deductions and credits one result 
was to shift about 125 billion of the federal tax burden from 
individuals to corporations over a fiveyear period

warmer drier weather was 
returning today but officials expressed confidence that the fires 
that have blackened half of the oldest national park would not 
flare anew 
meanwhile a newspaper report said park officials allowed fires 
to burn unattended for nearly three weeks after they were ordered 
to fight all fires because they wanted to protect pristine areas 
from the destruction caused by bulldozers fire engines and 
irrigation equipment in all the fires have blackened roughly half 
the parks 22 million acres 
elsewhere officials banned outdoor smoking in parts of northern 
california and hundreds of firefighters prepared to go home after a 
9000acre blaze in oregon was contained 
the national weather service confirmed what firefighters in 
yellowstone already knew this summer was one of the parks warmest 
and driest on record 
the weather service said wednesday that temperatures at the 
mammoth area of the park in june averaged 554 or 78 degrees 
higher than average average temperature in july was 664 degrees 
28 degrees above average temperatures were just slightly above 
normal in august 
rainfall totals were more than an inch less than normal each 
month and the weather service said it is unlikely any major 
precipitation will offset the parks shortage soon 
steady rain tuesday prevented the remaining blazes from growing 
significantly although skies have since cleared longer nights are 
bringing longer periods of humidity recovery when small fuels 
such as pine needles and twigs can soak up moisture area commander 
ken dittmer said 
the worst is over dittmer said 
forecasts for the weekend called for another cooling trend 
accompanied by a chance of showers which could help the 4500 
firefighters battling the blazes winds are expected to remain calm 
the new york times reported today that officials concerned about 
the destruction caused by firefighting equipment did not fight the 
yellowstone portion of the clovermist fire until nearly three 
weeks after interior secretary donald p hodels july 21 order that 
all fires be fought 
bulldozers were allowed in the park only on a casebycase basis 
even at the height of the fires the paper reported and bulldozers 
were never used to make fire lines around the yellowstone part of 
the clovermist blaze which has burned 411000 acres in the park 
and the adjacent shoshone national forest 
the times also reported that park rangers threatened a 
firefighting crew with citations for destroying park vegetation 
when they crossed a meadow with their truck to extinguish a spot 
fire 
elsewhere state firefighters battling blazes that have charred 
more than 40000 acres in northern california issued an emergency 
decree banning outdoor smoking in portions of 44 counties 
jerry partain director of the california department of 
forestry said the extreme danger posed by fire and acute dry 
conditions prompted the decree 
fire officials predicted they will have the vacaville fire out 
by saturday evening the blaze has destroyed seven homes blackened 
27000 acres and caused an estimated 183 million in damage 
in oregon 400 firefighters were scheduled to go home from the 
shady beach fire in willamette national forest after the blaze was 
contained at just under 9000 acres wednesday night us forest 
service spokesman chuck tonn said another 400 firefighters are 
scheduled for release friday leaving fewer than 1000 on the 
lines he said

a 7yearold accused of making sexual 
remarks and waving an unloaded 38caliber handgun at his 
firstgrade classmates will be transferred to another school after 
undergoing psychological testing officials say 
looking at the severity and the sadness the boy is in need 
of some help i intend to pursue psychological testing john a 
stewart polk county school superintendent said wednesday 
the outcome of the evaluation will determine whether he is sent 
to a school for children with emotional problems said bill duncan 
who oversees discipline for polk county schools 
crystal lake elementary school principal w james pace sent a 
letter home with students wednesday informing parents of a 
sheriffs investigation and assuring them their children were safe 
at school 
it is also not fair to blame the school because this 
happened he wrote this could happen at any school 
the boy who told investigators he brought the handgun from 
home was suspended immediately after the sept 12 incident 
stewart said 
he apparently pulled the gun from his knapsack twice once after 
a gym class and again after school there reportedly were some 
sexual remarks shouted at a girl followed by angry banter between 
the boy and another boy stewart said 
he also carried two bullets but they were too large to fit the 
gun which authorities described as a derringer 
after receiving reports from investigators stewart said he was 
particularly disturbed by the level of violence and strange level 
of knowledge of sexual behavior at such an early age 
we need to see what is at the root of the problem stewart 
added 
the boy and others from the group were questioned wednesday to 
determine what happened stewart said he will study results of that 
closed factfinding session before making any decisions 
expulsion may not be the best approach with a boy this age 
he wouldnt learn anything by expulsion said stewart 
sheriff detective paul baggett said the boy may have made a 
derogatory sexual statement to a girl while the children were 
walking home but his statement was not a demand for sexual favors 
as some officials had reported earlier

the new military ruler gen saw maung 
says the army does not intend to hold onto power and has asked 
opposition leaders to help restore peace and prepare for free 
elections the opposition said today 
saw maung made his remarks in a letter to prodemocracy 
activists aung gyi aung san suu kyi and tin oo a copy of the 
letter was shown to the associated press today 
the activists sent the general a letter tuesday calling for 
dialogue to resolve the crisis that erupted after he seized power 
in a coup sunday toppling civilian president maung maung 
saw maung is the third head of burmas government in two months 
by official count troops have killed at least 144 people since 
the coup a western ambassador said the actual death toll may be as 
high as 400 
rangoon was calm today with no street demonstrations for the 
third consecutive day after daily demonstrations the past two 
months 
the government has described the dead as looters and 
destructive elements but the ambassador said many of them were 
unarmed peaceful protesters demanding democracy 
in a reply letter wednesday saw maung did not directly respond 
to the call for dialogue he asked for help in restoring law and

for a long time in addition to its existing onerous duties we had 
to step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating general 
conditions in the country 
we promise you that free and fair general elections will be

in rangoon more roadside shops were open than the previous day 
but larger markets remained closed the doors of government offices

on prodemocracy strikes since aug 8 
sketchy reports received today from mandalay the secondlargest 
city and other towns indicated there was fighting earlier this 
week between security forces and protesters though not as fierce 
as in the capital 
opposition leaders had succeeded in keeping the protests 
peaceful but that changed after sundays coup

police stations and other places one group opened fire with a 
grenade launcher and automatic weapons late tuesday at soldiers 
guarding the city hall and the main government administration

1962 and promised elections that would end the exclusive rule of 
the burma socialist program party but the opposition rejected that

diplomats say saw maung like sein lwin and maung maung is a 
close associate of ne win and the coup may have been staged to 
preserve the ruling military autocracy

two of the hunt brothers who once shared one of 
the worlds wealthiest legacies have filed for personal bankruptcy 
protection their latest attempt to recover from an alleged scheme 
to corner the world silver market 
nelson bunker and william herbert hunt filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization wednesday because of a courts 
requirement that they post a 225 million bond to appeal their loss 
in a new york federal court said tom whitaker a spokesman for the 
brothers 
a federal jury decided aug 20 that the two hunts and brother 
lamar hunt must pay more than 130 million in damages to minpeco 
sa the peruvian governments mineral marketing company 
the company alleged in its civil suit that the brothers 
conspired in the late 1970s with middle eastern businessmen in a 
failed attempt to corner the silver market ruining minpecos 
investments 
a us district court judge has temporarily stayed the bond 
given that bunker hunt was at one time one of the wealthiest 
men in the world its absurd to imagine theyve come to this 
point thomas gorman trial attorney for minpeco told the dallas 
morning news 
the hunts also face classaction suits in new york on behalf of 
more than 17000 silver futures traders who lost money when silver 
prices crashed in early 1980 in addition the commodities futures 
trading commission has proposed an 80 million fine against the 
brothers 
the brothers separate bankruptcy filings which could have the 
effect of blocking such lawsuits list substantial assets but no 
dollar figures 
the hunts said raising 225 million in the minpeco case would 
force a fire sale of assets and would result in nonpayment to 
business and personal creditors 
the hunts also said they chose bankruptcy to keep minpeco 
attorneys from beginning foreclosure on their assets until their 
appeal can be made 
hunt attorney bob wolin said the case may not even reach the 
appeal stage he said he has six or seven separate motions that 
could either reduce the damages substantially bring about a 
judgment notwithstanding the verdict or force a new trial 
its very winnable wolin said 
in brief summaries of their assets in the petitions herbert 
hunt listed 13649 byzantine coins a 44piece roman and greek 
bronze collection a halfinterest in a ski lodge in vail colo 
between onethird and onefourteenth interest in 3442 acres in 
louisiana a 3yearold cadillac and a 15yearold mercedes benz 
the morning news said 
bunker hunt listed ancient coins art objects bronze statues 
oil and gas properties in 40 counties nationally three gas plants 
14 ranches 1390 acres of undeveloped land a condo in hawaii 
five cars and other assets 
both brothers listed the irs and minpeco as unsecured creditors 
with a miniscule 1 disputed claim they also listed manufacturers 
hanover trust co as an unsecured creditor owed 36 million the 
new york bank filed suit friday in dallas attempting to collect on 
the 4yearold note 
the bankruptcy filing is the latest chapter in the hunts 
struggle to hang on to what is left of the fortune they inherited 
from their father texas oilman hl hunt 
heavy losses in silver oil and real estate cut the trios 
wealth from more than 5 billion to an estimated 1 billion 
according to the dallas times herald the brothers trust funds 
subsequently filed for bankruptcy 
last friday a federal bankruptcy judge approved a 
reorganization plan to settle 750 million in loans and pull the 
trust funds out of chapter 11 
the plan called for turning their financially strapped penrod 
drilling co which is not in bankruptcy into a corporation 
jointly controlled by creditor banks 
that plan was part of a settlement aimed at ending litigation 
between the hunts and the banks which the hunts claimed were 
trying to force them out of business by refusing to renegotiate 
15 billion in loans 
the agreement called for the brothers to pay 538 million in 
cash and surrender real estate to resolve 200 million in debt 
placid oil co owned by the hunt trusts also is in chapter 11 
bankruptcy the trusts had offered in july to pay 8035 million to 
placids lenders

prosecutors are seeking to step 
up charges against confessed twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi to 
include a count of attempted murder of an american passenger a 
court spokesman said today 
the lebanese shiite moslem defendant already is on trial for 
murder air piracy and other charges stemming from the june 1985 
ordeal in which a us navy diver was killed 
court spokesman falk thomas said that after recent dramatic 
testimony from american passengers and crew members frankfurt 
prosecutors have asked the court to include a charge of attempted 
murder of american passenger kurt carlson 
witnesses have testified that hamadi and his accused fellow 
hijacker hassan ezzeddine mercilessly beat the rockford ill 
man during the hijacking that kept 39 americans captive for 17 days 
the prosecutors office has asked the court to formally notify 
hamadi that his actions can be judged as attempted murder thomas 
told the associated press in an interview 
the court will still have to decide whether such a charge is 
included thomas added he said there is no time pressure for 
the court to make such a decision 
thomas said that the maximum sentence for attempted murder is a 
life prison term 
in the latest testimony regarding carlson chief flight 
attendant uli derickson on wednesday described how carlson was 
attacked by both hijackers and said that he lay quietly near the 
cockpit 
i was convinced he was dead because i had to step over him 
several times the 44yearold mrs derickson said but then i 
touched him and he moved 
the flight attendant said she then told hamadi of carlsons 
family and hamadi apologized to the beaten army reserve officer 
saying i didnt mean to kill you 
carlson survived the ordeal and has also testified at hamadis 
trial about his beatings 
on wednesday mrs derickson broke down in sobs as she talked 
about the lasting psychological impact of the hijacking 
i can imagine everyone on that flight is suffering she told 
the court i suffered deep psychological effects and i am still 
under therapy 
hamadi who prosecutors say is 24 years old has admitted taking 
part in the hijacking but has denied killing us navy diver robert 
stethem of waldorf md 
but john testrake the pilot testified last week that he 
believed hamadi was the hijacker who shot and killed stethem 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
in the week following his arrest two west germans were 
kidnapped in beirut in a failed scheme to win his release 
kidnappers have since released both west german hostages 
in addition to murder and air piracy hamadi has also been 
charged with hostagetaking causing bodily harm and robbery he 
also is on trial on charges of smuggling explosives and use of 
falsified documents stemming from his arrest at frankfurt airport 
the twa jet was hijacked to beirut on a flight from athens in 
june 1985

calm prevailed today in a tense 
impoverished neighborhood where rioting by hundreds of blacks was 
triggered by an interracial drugrelated killing 
neighborhood school officials said today that classes would be 
open although absences would be excused if parents wished to keep 
their children home 
the almost exclusively black area known as cedar grove became 
the province of rioters and looters for about five hours tuesday 
night and early wednesday after a black man was killed by a white 
woman shopping for cocaine according to police and witnesses at 
least one witness said the victim was a bystander 
less intense violence surfaced again wednesday night in the 
states secondlargest city despite pleas for calm by black 
ministers and politicians police detoured traffic when cars 
passing by the neighborhood were pelted with rocks bricks and 
bottles then they sealed off a 12block area when gunshots were 
heard 
at least one fire was set in the area but a crowd of about 200 
youths began to disperse by midnight 
its mostly a very calm situation mayor john hussey told 
reporters when police began to withdraw around midnight leaving 
heavy patrols to investigate scattered reports of gunfire most 
of the area i saw was still secure 
the riot was centered near a park where police said dealers 
provided curbservice crack 
ten years ago the neighborhood was a mixedrace workingclass 
area but it has become increasingly poor violent and dangerous 
authorities said vacant buildings give the appearance of a war 
zone and drug dealers have intimidated the elderly and families 
high teenage unemployment and a feeling that police had failed 
to provide equal protection for blacks have made the area a time 
bomb waiting to explode said state sen greg tarver a black 
former city councilman 
you can come through here any time get robbed get cut get 
shot added richard kenner a policeman who has patrolled cedar 
grove from midnight to dawn the past seven years therell be 100 
people standing around and nobody saw anything 
there were no arrests or injuries wednesday night but the 
windshield of a pickup truck containing three whites was shattered 
in three places and its passengerside window was smashed out 
officials said the trouble was triggered by the tuesday night 
slaying of william david mckinney 20 who lived in the 
neighborhood a witness said mckinney just happened to be standing 
nearby when tamala c vergo who was shopping for cocaine opened 
fire on some men who snatched her purse

president of the national baptist convention of america inc 
agreed problems run deep throughout shreveports black community 
weve got problems in our economy weve got problems in our 
racism weve got many other problems hussey said

of camouflaged special response team officers and canine units were 
withdrawn from a command post at a nearby elementary school 
police remained stationed at two major intersections and beefed

a former senior aide to gen manuel antonio 
noriega says vice president george bush met with noriega five years 
ago and complained about money laundering in panama according to a 
british television documentary 
the assertion by col roberto diaz herrera contradicts bush 
claims that the reagan administration took action against noriega 
panamas de facto leader as soon as it learned that noriega was 
allegedly involved in drugs 
norieiga was indicted in federal court on drug charges in 
february and us sanctions began against him early this year 
a spokesman for the vice president said bush met with panamas 
thenpresident ricardo de la espriella and other officials 
including noriega in panama in 1983 but he added there is 
nothing to indicate the vice president spoke with noriega 
james baker chairman of bushs presidential campaign responded 
to questions about the matter on cbs this morning today 
youre going to hear a lot of rumors and specualation as this 
campaign moves through its last 47 days he said 
diaz and jose i blandon a former senior intelligence officer 
in panama also said noriega claims to have pictures and tape 
recordings that would link bush or his aides to secret training of 
nicaraguan rebels 
from october 1984 to october 1986 us law prohibited any us 
government aid to the contras in their fight to topple nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government the documentary did not say when the 
pictures were taken nor when the tape recordings were made 
we have learned that as early as 1983 george bush sat down 
with gen noriega to complain about th laundering of drug money in 
panama reporter julian manyon said on the thames television 
program which was screened for reporters wednesday 
one of the vice presidents concerns according to panamanians 
who were there was an estimated 3 billion of drug profits that 
had already been laundered through panama manyon said 
noriega was shown on the documentary saying he never met bush 
nor had any contact with him your source of information is 
mistaken he said 
in washington bush spokesman steve hart said wednesday the vice 
president spoke of drug interdiction efforts when he met with 
espriella during a stopover in panama but did not speak of any 
allegations against the general 
the vice president dealt with espriella one of the topics 
they discussed was money laundering in panama hart said they 
also talked about drug interdiction efforts there is nothing 
to indicate the vice president spoke with noriega 
manyon said the meeting took place dec 10 1983 at the vip 
lounge of panama citys airport according to a blackandwhite 
photograph shown of the gathering diaz attended the meeting 
manyon said the meeting raised important questions about 
bushs claims the administration acted as soon as it learned of 
allegations against noriega concerning the laundering of drug 
profits 
diaz who was interviewed in venezuela said he once saw noriega 
examining photographs which apparently showed contras being 
secretly trained in panama under an arrangement with col oliver 
north the white house aide dismissed over the irancontra scandal 
in which profits from arms sales to iran were allegedly funneled to 
the contras 
noriega suggested that the tapes and photos gave him an 
advantage over bush according to diaz who has accused noriega of 
corruption electoral fraud and political murder 
in the tv interview blandon replied of course when asked 
if he believed people inside the bush campaign are aware of the 
threat that noriega poses for them by allegedly having tape 
recordings about the illegal training of contras 
blandon a witness at a senate foreign relations committee 
hearing investigating noriega said the general has sent a message 
to bush campaign officials that he has the tape recordings 
hart said it was no secret the vice president was in panama in 
1983 
george bush was down in argentina for the inauguration of 
president raul alfonsin he did a refueling stop in panama and he 
met with president de la espriella at the airport hart said 
one of the persons in the group was noriega who was there to 
represent the defense forces 
as for any picture showing bush and noriega together hart said 
when you meet with people in a meeting you go around and shake 
hands 
the documentary was to be broadcast tonight on britains 
commercial independent television network

hundreds of chanting flagwaving 
slavic students called a school strike today and marched around the 
capital of ethnically troubled kosovo protesting alleged 
harassment by albanians 
about 1000 teenagers marched behind the red blue and white 
flag of yugoslavias largest republic serbia after going to four 
schools to declare a boycott of classes and collect supporters for 
their protest 
plainclothes police kept a close watch but there was no atempt 
to interfere and uniformed police stopped traffic on the main 
thoroughfare to allow the marchers to pass 
the march illustrated the high level of tension in this city of 
200000 
we are afraid to go to school said the students when youth 
officials tried to persuade them to return to class 
on tuesday night about 5000 serbs and montenegrins both 
slavs rallied after a serbian girl allegedly was attacked by an 
ethnic albanian monday night 
that rally was one of the latest in a series of meetings backing 
serbian communist party leader slobodan milosevic who wants more 
control over serbias two autonomous provinces of vojvodina and 
kosovo 
kosovo one of yugoslavias poorest and most backward regions 
has a history of ethnic tension between serbs and montenegrins who 
see the province as their historic homeland and the albanians who 
now make up about 90 percent of kosovos 2 million people 
in 1981 ethnic riots left at least nine dead and prompted 
federal authorities in belgrade to impose martial law for a few 
weeks 
kosovos albanians have not yet staged any public protests in 
response to the current wave of slav rallies but serbs allege 
individual harassment by albanians have increased and nervous 
residents in both ethnic groups report tension at a high level 
federal authorities dispatched extra police units equipped with 
armored pesonnel carriers to kosovo earlier this month 
todays protest started when about 200 slav teenagers walked up 
the central downtown street chanting kosovo is serbia and 
we will give our lives but we will not give kosovo 
some participants said the march was sparked by the alleged rape 
attempt monday night but others said there had been fresh trouble 
wednesday involving a fight between albanian and serbian students 
a worried serbian mother who did not identify herself sobbed 
outside one school children should not solve problems i have a 
child in there i am afraid 
a serbian woman looking at the march said what will happen 
now albanian kids know who is marching and they could do 
something

house speaker jim wright defended himself 
today against charges that he improperly disclosed a covert cia 
operation in nicaragua as republican leaders formally asked for an 
investigation of his actions 
i havent revealed anything that was committed to me as secret 
or classified wright told a reporter i am not a member of the 
house intelligence committee i have not been present at the 
secret classified briefings i have simply said what is generally 
known and what is true 
but wright dtexas declined to specifically say how he had 
learned of the covert operation in nicaragua or whether he had 
been told of it informally by an intelligence committee member 
wright on tuesday said he had received clear testimony from 
the cia that the agency had fomented opposition demonstrations in 
nicaragua to provoke the leftist sandinista government and sabotage 
peace talks he told a reporter later that cia officials had made 
the admission under congressional questioning 
he repeated the assertion to reporters today noting that the 
reagan administration had not disputed it 
in late august of last year i became aware that elements of 
the us government were seeking to foment disturbances with a 
view to seeing if they could provoke the sandinistas into a 
crackdown that would derail peace talks wright said 
that seems to me just intolerably twofaced he said wright 
added that he had been given indirect assurance that the 
practice has now been halted 
to bolster his case that the cia activity already was well 
known wright distributed a list of news stories that document 
agency activity in nicaragua the list included past cia actions 
such as mining nicaraguan harbors secretly resupplying the contra 
rebels and supporting opposition groups but contained no specific 
mention of covert efforts at fomenting civil unrest and 
demonstrations 
meanwhile house minority leader bob michel rill and rep 
dick cheney rwyo chairman of the house republican conference 
asked for an investigation of wrights actions in letters late 
wednesday to the house ethics and intelligence committees 
because of the possibility such a disclosure of classified 
information may have occurred we are writing to ask your 
committee to promptly and thoroughly investigate the circumstances 
surrounding these events and to recommend appropriate action to the 
house of representatives michel and cheney said in a letter to 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif 
in a separate letter to rep louis stokes dohio chairman of 
the house intelligence panel they asked for an immediate meeting 
of the committee to discuss these matters to ascertain whether 
any unauthorized disclosures have in fact occurred and to decide on 
an appropriate course of action 
house republicans were meeting today to discuss the wright 
matter and in particular to weigh its implications for legislation 
that would tighten congressional control over the cias covert 
activities 
the reagan administration opposes the bill which is scheduled 
for floor consideration next week a version already has been 
passed by the senate where sponsor william cohen rmaine rose on 
the floor today to chastise wright 
cia people do not testify in open session cohen said 
there is the clear implication that the speakers statement could 
only have been derived from classified information in the 
possession of the house intelligence committee where did he obtain 
this information on what basis did the speaker believe he had the 
privilege to speak to reporters about this classified information 
cohen said while the legislation may still be passed by the 
house next week wrights disclosure makes it less likely 
proponents will be able to muster the votes to override an almost 
certain presidential veto 
the fact he has made the disclosure is serious said rep 
henry hyde rill the senior republican on the house intelligence 
committee i am astounded to hear sandinista propaganda coming 
out of the speakers office 
asked during a photo session wednesday about wrights comments 
president reagan said the reaction i have and i think it should 
fit the speaker also there is no way we should talk publicly about 
intelligence operations of any kind 
but he declined to confirm or deny the substance of the 
speakers disclosure adding if i start going down that road 
then im creating the same violation that he did 
we simply cannot comment on covert operations or intelligence 
matters of this kind white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said and sometimes that means having to accept information that 
may or may not be true 
but fitzwater told reporters that at the outset of a meeting 
with the joint chiefs of staff on wednesday reagan remarked that 
there is nothing that we are doing anywhere that wasnt reviewed 
and approved by the house and senate intelligence committees 
thats an important point fitzwater said because if 
wright has a problem he ought to take it up with the intelligence 
committees he added that wright has always been more than 
eager to take the position of the ortega government but its 
impossible to say what the real damage might be in this case 
house rules stipulate that information given to the house 
intelligence committee which oversees the cia nd other spy 
agencies is classified and may not be disclosed except under 
certain tightly controlled circumstances unauthorized disclosure 
is subject to investigation by the ethics committee

republican george bushs campaign will spend a 
modern record of about 60 percent of its 54 million budget for 
television advertising this fall a bush aide said today 
presidential campaigns traditionally set aside about half of 
their federally restricted funds for paid media and the other half 
for campaign organization 
the bush aide who spoke only on condition that he not be 
identified said 60 percent or 324 million is a pretty accurate 
figure which would make it the largest television expenditure in 
modern history 
the washington post quoting an unnamed bush aide said the gop 
campaign is benefiting so much from the use of money raised by the 
republican party for political activities that it can use a far 
larger share for advertising 
both campaigns are limited by federal law to a 54 budget with 
46 million coming from the federal treasury 
mark gearan a spokesman for democratic nominee michael dukakis 
said wednesday i think well be competitive with the bush 
campaign but beyond that we dont detail our spending 
he said the high amount spent by the bush campaign is not 
surprising in this market

a new court decision may finally end a 
23yearold racial discrimination case filed by black workers at an 
alabama railroad car manufacturing plant 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals issued a ruling wednesday 
in the workers case against pullmanstandard division of 
chicagobased pullman inc the court gave a partial victory to the 
workers ordering a lower court to determine damages for workers 
who suffered discrimination between 1965 and 1974 but ruling in 
favor of the company in other aspects of the case 
few cases better represent the idea that the road to justice 
can be a long and tortured one circuit judge thomas a clark 
wrote in a prologue to the decision 
complaints of racial discrimination were first brought by the 
workers shortly after president lyndon johnson signed legislation 
that accommodated such claims 
at the time according to court documents the factory in 
bessemer ala was divided into 28 departments some of them 
integrated but many either allwhite or allblack the black jobs 
paid less 
in 1965 an arbitration decision opened up some jobs to blacks 
but pullman stopped its onthejob training program that enabled 
many blacks to attain the skills needed to work at the plant 
four years later pullman entered into an agreement with the 
department of labor to encourage blacks to move into the previously 
allwhite departments and develop a program of outside vocational 
development 
but several complaints of racial discrimination were filed with 
the equal employment opportunity commission between 1966 and 1969 
in 1972 the commission consolidated all the complaints and found 
that pullman had discriminated in hiring promotion and job 
assignments 
just before the commissions ruling worker louis swint filed a 
classaction lawsuit contending that pullman practiced racial 
discrimination and the case went to trial in 1974 swint won 
kicking off a litany of appeals crossappeals trials and 
reversals 
in the meantime pullman closed its bessemer plant in 1982 
putting some 3500 people out of work it was later purchased by 
trinity industries and still makes railroad cars employing about 
600 people said plant safety director festus pierce 
many of the original workers have since died according to court 
documents 
four trials were held on swints lawsuit and the case made it 
to the us supreme court in 1982 after the fourth trial in 1986 
both sides appealed once again to the 11th circuit 
wednesday the appeals court upheld a lower courts ruling that 
pullmans seniority system was not created or maintained in order 
to further discrimination the appeals court also said evidence 
showed that discrimination in departmental assignments ended in 
february 1969 
but one issue was reversed in the workers favor and sent back 
to us district court in birmingham ala to determine damages 
the appeals court said pullman should be held liable for any 
discrimination occurring between october 1965 and january 1969 on 
job assignments 
in addition it said pullman is liable for discrimination in 
promotions that happened between september 1966 and august 1974

a minister was convicted today of 
killing and beheading a church handyman and setting the church on 
fire in a bid to leave nashville and establish a new identity 
the circuit court jury deliberated three hours wednesday night 
and an hour this morning before finding john david terry guilty of 
murder and arson the sentencing portion of the trial was to begin 
later today 
terry 43 looked calm as the verdict was read 
he was accused of killing handyman james chester matheny 
cutting off the mans head and other parts of his body to make 
identification difficult and leaving the body in his emmanuel 
church of christ oneness pentecostal which he then set on fire 
prosecutors said terry killed matheny 32 in june 1987 in an 
attempt to make it look as though he himself had been slain so 
that he could adopt a new identity and start a new life 
mathenys headless body was found in the ruins of the church 
but the head was never found the exact cause of death was never 
determined 
in his closing argument assistant district attorney general 
john zimmermann called terry a calculating killer with ice in his 
veins not blood 
you may never hear of a more coldblooded brutal murder than 
this one zimmermann said 
defense lawyer lionel barrett presented no witnesses on terrys 
behalf and did not make a closing statement saying the real 
trial will begin if the jury is asked to impose the death 
sentence barrett said he planned to argue that terry was suffering 
from some sort of mental condition when matheny was killed 
zimmermann argued that terry began planning the crime early last 
year after receiving 50700 from the sale of church property 
unknown to other church officials and after learning that he would 
not get a promotion he had expected 
the prosecutor told the jury that terry picked a name off a 
tombstone of a child who died in 1951 and began assembling 
identification papers in that persons name the child had been 
born three days before terry in 1944

the securities and exchange commission today 
announced that it would take no action against those involved in 
the sale and default of 225 billion worth of washington public 
power supply system bonds 
in a 376page report on its fiveyear investigation the 
commission staff criticized several parties involved in the sale of 
the bonds which were issued to finance two nuclear power projects 
that later were terminated 
the report concluded that enforcement action was unnecessary 
because of a civil trial difficulty in determining responsibility 
for disclosure statements attached to the bonds and concern that 
the commission lacked the resources to pursue the case 
bondholders are suing 18 utilities that are members of wppss 
the construction arm of the states public utilities system plus a 
financial adviser and two engineering firms in a trial that began 
sept 1 in tucson ariz 
most parties originally named as defendants in the suit 
including washington power itself have settled out of court for a 
total of 461 million including 96 million in contested insurance 
claims 
the report concluded that the default the largest in municipal 
bond history resulted from extensive cost overruns and 
construction delays at washington powers project no 4 at the 
hanford nuclear reservation and no 5 at satsop west of olympia 
the power company which issued the bonds was responsible for 
the official statements used to sell them but avoided disclosure 
of negative developments the report said most significantly 
the supply system failed to disclose that in october 1980 
participants who were concerned about rising project costs and 
falling power demands asked the supply system to study a possible 
slowdown or termination of the projects 
work was halted on the projects in 1982 both were abandoned 
later that year and in 1983 wppss quit making payments on the 
bonds after the washington state supreme court held that the 
utilities contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus 
unenforceable without payments from the 88 participating 
utilities many of them in other states wppss defaulted

hurricane helene is packing winds of 100 mph far 
off in the atlantic ocean and heading toward the americas but 
forecasters say it has a lot to prove before it should be 
considered dangerous 
at midday today helene was centered near latitude 132 north 
longitude 427 west or about 1125 miles east of barbados and 
2500 miles east of miami about 100 miles closer than it was six 
hours earlier according to a national hurricane center advisory 
issued just before noon 
if it makes it all the way over to the west side of the 
atlantic theres a chance it could become much more significant 
but it also has to go through a lot of wind patterns in the 
atmosphere that could mess it up said randy lascody a 
meteorologist at the center 
the atlantic hurricane seasons eighth named storm was moving 
west at 10 mph it was expected to maintain that path for a day or 
two the advisory said 
its a long long way from causing any problems lascody 
said 
a nominal hurricane about 250 miles wide helene is the first 
hurricane to form since gilbert which reached that status rapidly 
after it entered the caribbean gilbert last week thrashed jamaica 
the cayman islands mexico and the texas gulf coast 
weather systems that form this month near the cape verde islands 
off africas coast as helene and gilbert did enjoy excellent 
hurricanespawning atmospheric conditions they are often the 
strongest of the sixmonth atlantic storm season that begins june 1 
the waters warm the environment is favorable conditions are 
right for some additional strengthening said forecaster hal 
gerrish 
forecasters couldnt predict if helene might become as fierce as 
gilbert described as the centurys most intense hurricane in terms 
of barometric pressure the hurricane center expected to send a 
reconnaissance plane to check helenes growth on saturday when the 
storm is closer gerrish said until then forecasters will rely on 
satellite reports 
this hurricane could do any of a number of things but 
typically in this part of the ocean they dont strengthen too much 
until they get closer to the windward islands lascody said 
tropical depressions winds swirling around a warm core of low 
pressure are named as storms when top sustained winds hit 39 mph 
and reach hurricane status when top sustained winds hit 74 mph 
besides gilbert which packed top winds of 175 mph two small 
hurricanes formed this season debbie brushed the mexican coast 
and florence moved over louisiana

california leads the nation in farm income 
but when the states are rated in terms of dollars earned per acre 
none comes close to rhode island 
a new analysis by the agriculture department for 1987 earnings 
said californias net farm income was more than 558 billion 
rhode island was reported in 47th place at 464 million alaska 
was at the bottom with 149 million 
but the comprehensive agricultural income and finance report 
which was issued this week by the departments economic research 
service also ranked the 50 states according to average net farm 
income per acre 
rhode island was at the top averaging 636 per acre in 1987 
california was seventh at 174 per acre and rhode islands 
peracre average income was almost double secondplace connecticut 
which was reported at 352 per acre 
wyoming was ranked 50th with an average net income of 2 per 
acre in 1987 the report said nationally the average was a net 
income of 46 per acre 
california also led in net income per farm ranches included 
in 1987 averaging 73790 per operation arizona was second at 
71492 per farm although the state placed 30th in total net 
income last year rhode island was third at 61924 per farm 
nationally the average was 21286 per farm 
especially high net farm income per operation or acre reflects 
highvalued or relatively perishable crop usually produced near 
large metropolitan areas the report said conversely low net 
income per operation or acre typically occurs where farms are 
isolated or produce farm products which require a great deal of 
land 
rhode island had approximately 750 farms averaging 97 acres 
each the report said in contrast lastplace wyoming had about 
8800 farms averaging 1700 acres 
the leading commodities for rhode island were greenhouse 
dairy products eggs and potatoes the report said such 
highvalue labor and capital intensive products tend to be typical 
of more populate states with small farms 
rhode islands four leading commodities accounted for 65 percent 
of the states total 1987 farm marketings the value of 
californias four leading commodities dairy products cattle 
greenhouse and grapes accounted for 41 percent of total farm 
marketings by comparison 
the mix of land labor and capital resources required for 
californias leading commodities is indicative of larger farms 
compared to those in rhode island the report said 
here are the 1987 state rankings in order for net farm income 
per acre in dollars per acre in the first column the second 
column shows the average net income per farm in those states

tobacco farmers have a bigger harvest this 
year but oldcrop inventories are smaller meaning there will be a 
reduced total supply in the 198889 marketing year the agriculture 
department says 
stocks entering the new marketing year likely will equal 285 
billion pounds about 14 percent lower than a year earlier the 
departments economic research service said wednesday in a new 
outlook report although surpluses continue for some kinds and 
grades there are shortages for others 
nationally the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent from 
last year because of increased acreage and greater yields due to 
better weather for fluecured and some other kinds of tobacco 
however dry weather kept burley yields below normal but those 
still were up from last years low levels 
prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a small 
increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured 
tobacco the report said us tobacco use may increase from 
198788s 166 billion pounds because of greater use of 
domestically grown tobacco in us cigarettes and higher cigarette 
production 
the report said us cigarette output this year is expected to 
increase from 689 billion pieces in 1987 because of rising 
exports 
however cigarette consumption among americans 18 years and 
older is expected to continue a longterm decline dropping around 
15 percent this year from an average of 3196 cigarettes in 1987 
which was the lowest since world war ii cigarette use peaked at 
4345 pieces about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each in 1963 
the cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers and 
nonsmokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from year 
to year 
fluecured sales began july 26 and by sept 15 growers had sold 
nearly threefifths of their anticipated 1988 marketings the 
report said even with the larger crop market prices are near last 
years higher prices averaging 1545 a pound less than half a 
percent below the 1987 level 
as of september this years fluecured crop was estimated at 
780 million pounds up 13 percent from last year 
this years burley production is expected to be up 7 percent 
from the small 1987 harvest and was estimated earlier this month at 
449 million pounds

the american civil liberties union has accused 
university of nevadareno officials of persistent discrimination 
and said its refusal to allow a gay rodeo at a campus arena is just 
the latest example 
face it if youre not a friend of the university and if 
youre in some minority group you dont have a chance there 
state aclu executive director shelley chase said 
her office is working on six discrimination cases against the 
school involving complaints based on sex age race and handicap 
and has joined one lawsuit 
ms chase held a news conference wednesday in front of the 
lawlor events center to protest the schools refusal to allow the 
national gay rodeo championship finals to be held there oct 2223 
despite organizers successful efforts to raise an extra 9600 to 
cover expenses in advance 
donald klasic general counsel for the state university system 
denied the school and lawlor wrongfully reneged on a verbal deal in 
which officials agreed to hold the event if backers presented the 
9600 
the dates are taken for the basketball team to practice 
klasic said this agreement was reached on aug 31 after it 
appeared that the rodeo wouldnt be taking place 
theres not a word of truth to the discrimination charges 
he added the coaches simply feel that the more time spent 
practicing in lawlor the better the home court advantage 
ms chase however said the basketball team normally defers to 
scheduled events and practices elsewhere 
its just too much of a coincidence she said and weve 
been trying to talk to them and they wont even return our calls 
now 
on monday the international gay rodeo and silver state gay 
rodeo associations lost a court battle against lawlor 
a washoe district court judge ruled that the groups had verbally 
modified a february written contract by agreeing to meet a 
prepayment schedule to cover expenses for parking security and 
other operating costs 
but the rodeo organizers who already had paid 7300 to rent 
the arena could only raise about 2200 of the expense money and 
thus broke the contract judge william forman said 
lawlor director richard linio told forman the oct 2223 dates 
were still open and rod sumpter the attorney for the 
associations said lawlo officials later said the stadium would 
still hold the rodeo if the expense money were presented in advance 
but when sumpter told the university tuesday that an anonymous 
businessman had written a check for the additional money officials 
told him the stadium was booked he said 
klasic said it was a simple mistake and linio wasnt aware the 
dates had already been taken by the team 
sumpter said his clients were continuing to look for a place in 
reno to hold the october finals in which the top riders and ropers 
from regional events compete

sixtyyearold sedans and newer porsches 
maseratis and corvettes will open their throttles along a 93mile 
stretch of remote nevada highway this weekend in the nations first 
legal openroad race in decades 
but the first silver state classic has no prize money no ticket 
sales and spectators are not encouraged said race organizer and 
twotime indianapolis 500 winner rodger ward president of vintage 
racing club in redondo beach calif 
this is not a spectator event said ward who won the 500 
and the us auto club championship in 1959 and 1962 this is a 
speed event all the way and is made so people with vintage cars can 
get them on the road and test them 
no one will be allowed along the highways well if people 
want they can watch the race start or wait at the finish line 
theres really not much along the highway mostly dirt roads 
some driveways and farms ward said well have guards at all 
32 highway access roads though so nobody gets it into their head 
to get in the way 
that shouldnt be too difficult since the affected section of 
nevada 318 through the mostly flat white river valley crosses no 
other highways irrigation fields and distant ranch houses are the 
only signs of human life 
the nevada state department of transportation the nevada 
highway patrol and the nye lincoln and white pine county 
commissions all had to give permission for the race with the 
access guards as a condition ward said the federal government 
didnt become involved because it is a state highway 
drivers are to start out at oneminute intervals sunday from 
lund a tiny eastern nevada farming town best known for producing 
one or two high school graduates each year 
the faster cars racing southward will arrive about 45 minutes 
later at the finish line in hiko the lincoln county seat in the 
late 1860s but now reduced to a ghost town 100 miles north of las 
vegas 
i dont anticipate the cars running flat out but some will 
get up there going 160 170 ward said these cars are made 
for speed 
the older vehicles will travel more sedately and arrive a little 
later the cars will compete in five categories so the older ones 
are not outclassed 
a lot of the drivers are people who just have an interest in 
vintage cars said ted roberts of burbank calif others with 
the faster cars can take them out and really drive them this is 
the ultimate highspeed run down a public highway and its legal 
roberts music supervisor for the matlock television series 
planned to drive the 1968 javelin he drove in the transam series 
in 1969 and 1970 
ward who is not driving sunday said he would like to make the 
race an annual event it is financed by entry fees from 100 to 
250 depending on the type of car

democrat michael dukakis chided republican rival 
george bush today for once referring to social security as 
largely a welfare program and promised never to use social 
security trust funds to help balance the federal budget 
you know when election time rolls around mr bush likes to 
say he is a great friend of older americans dukakis told a 
lunchtime crowd at a senior citizens center in boston 
maybe he thinks we all have amnesia the democratic nominee 
said because it was just over three years ago may 10 1985 
that george bush cast the tiebreaking vote in the senate to deny 
you a costofliving increase in your social security and to make 
you pay more for your medical benefits and dan quayle voted with 
him and against you 
if elected dukakis said he and vice presidential running mate 
lloyd bentsen would stop the attack on social security and 
medicare and well stop it cold 
accompanied by his 85yearold mother euterpe and new york 
gov mario cuomo the massachusetts governor said the national 
economic commission studying ways to reduce the budget deficit 
wont get to first base in a dukakis administration if it 
recommends cuts in social security benefits 
i am committed to maintaining full benefits and costofliving 
increases dukakis said no matter what the commission 
recommends as president i will ensure that the nation honors its 
commitments so that current and future beneficiaries can count on 
the promise of social security 
dukakis took time out from preparations for his nationally 
televised debate with bush on sunday at winstonsalem nc to 
promise guaranteed health care for children and pregnant women and 
to accuse the vice president of ignoring the needs of poor families 
dukakis aides said cuomo also may return to boston on friday 
when a campaign source said dukakis is scheduled to take part in a 
mock debate washington attorney bob barnett is standing in for 
bush a role he played in 1984 when geraldine ferraro was preparing 
for her debate with bush 
dukakis spent much of wednesday studying for the debate and has 
rented a meeting room in a boston hotel for practice sessions new 
jersey sen bill bradley was in town to offer advice wednesday and 
is expected back friday arkansas gov bill clinton also is to 
visit dukakis in advance of the debate 
bradley also attended dukakis only public appearance his visit 
to brigham amp womens hospital to outline his healthy start 
program which is modeled after a massachusetts program that has 
provided services to 16000 mothers since 1985 dukakis visited 
with two of them before delivering his speech 
today more than 12 million children in this country grow up 
in families without a dimes worth of health insurance dukakis 
said too many of these children dont get checkups they arent 
treated when they are sick and theyve never seen a dentist 
dukakis said the healthy start program would provide money to 
states that adopt efforts similar to a massachusetts program that 
has been cited as a factor in the states declining infant 
mortality rate 
it offers doctors and hospital care to pregnant women who are 
uninsured or underinsured and also provides basic coverage for 
their babies aides said the federal program would cost 100 
million in the first year but that the money would be saved within 
12 months because the government would not have to pick up the tab 
for more expensive treatment of preventable childhood illnesses 
dukakis contrasted his proposal with bushs record listing 
programs affecting poor families that have been targeted for cuts 
by the reagan administration 
he was there when his administration conducted an annual 
assault on immunization programs dukakis said he was there 
when they cut maternal and child health programs

prime minister brian mulroney formally apologized 
today for the internment of 22000 japanesecanadians following 
japans 1941 attack on pearl harbor during world war ii 
mulroney said the canadian government would provide 288 million 
in compensation to the 12000 survivors 
most of that money 252 million will be given in 21000 
payments to each of the survivors the remainder will go to the 
japanesecanadian community for educational social and cultural 
activities and to finance a new canadian race relations foundation 
no amount of money can right the wrong undo the harm and heal 
the wounds mulroney told parliament as representatives of the 
japanesecanadian community watched then stood and applauded from 
the public gallery 
but it is symbolic of our determination to address this issue 
not only in the moral sense but also in a tangible way mulroney 
said 
the canadian leader said the internment was not only unjustified 
on moral and legal grounds but it went against the grain of the 
country itself 
error is an ingredient of humanity mulroney said solemnly 
so too is apology and forgiveness we have all learned from 
personal experience that inadequte as apologies are they are the 
only way we can cleanse the past so that we may as best we can in 
good conscience face the future 
japanesecanadians were interned following the 1941 attack on 
pearl harbor property was seized and 22000 including 17000 
citizens were relocated or interned on the canadian prairies or in 
northern ontario camps 
the us government decided this summer to pay 20000 to each 
of the 120000 survivors of us internment camps

lapp reindeer herdsmen in villages hit 
by fallout from the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident have thrown out 
all the animals killed this week because radiation levels were many 
times higher than allowed a swedish daily said thursday 
the ostersunds post said 400 reindeer were discarded in the 
northern province of jamtland after the annual slaughter when tests 
on the meat disclosed cesium levels ranging up to 4500 becquerels 
per pound 
a becquerel is a unit to describe the activity of radioactive 
substance the approved government limit for the meat for 
consumption is about 680 becquerels per pound 
im beginning to lose faith that there is a future in raising 
reindeer said thomas ahstrand 22 a herder reached by telephone 
in his village of frostviken 
about 10 percent of swedens total reindeer slaughter was banned 
for eating the ostersunds post said 
we raise reindeer for the garbage dumps there is no sign that 
the cesium levels are being reduced by even a few becquerels 
said ahstrand who bought his first herd of 50 animals just before 
the chernobyl nuclear plant in the soviet ukraine sent up a cloud 
of radioactivity in april 1986 
thirtyone people died in the worlds worst nuclear plant 
disaster 
sweden was badly affected by fallout because of a freak wind 
that carried the radioactive isotope cesium 137 over a belt of the 
northern and central regions swedens 300000 reindeer were 
particularly vulnerable because they feed on lichen which soaks up 
cesium and is slow to dispose of the contamination 
the swedish government compensates the herders at market prices 
for the destroyed meat but the seminomadic lapps or samis as 
they prefer to call themselves say their lifestyle has been 
threatened 
we ask ourselves how long will the government keep on 
supporting us said ahstrand 
last year ahstrand and other herdsmen rescued part of their 
reindeer by moving them 250 miles south to graze in an 
uncontaminated region but the move was costly and difficult and 
the herdsmen stayed home this year 
we felt that we didnt belong there we have lived in the 
mountains for so many centuries tending our herds among these 
fields it is more than an occupation its a way of life said 
ahstrand

shevardnadze told reporters he planned fullscope negotiations 
and had with him specific proposals in many areas 
speaking through an interpreter shevardnadze said we have 
not come empty handed as you can see we have a lot of baggage 
he said the discussions would cover nuclear and space weapons 
along with conventional armaments and chemical weapons 
shevardnadze said the two sides will take up continuing 
differences over interpretations of the 1972 antiballistics 
missile treaty and will seek to narrow the gap on their joint 
effort to achieve reductions in strategic nuclear weapons 
also on the table will be proposals for reducing airlaunched 
and sealaunched cruise missiles 
shevardnadze arrived at the state department two hours later 
than originally planned us officials said shevardnadze had asked 
for the delay complaining that he was tired after his 
transatlantic flight on wednesday 
shevardnadzes talks here will include separate meetings friday 
with reagan and vice president george bush the latter encounter is 
being held at bushs request a us official said adding that 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has not asked for a 
meeting with the soviet diplomat 
but shevardnadze during his remarks on arrival appeared to 
leave open the possibility of a meeting with dukakis 
with no new summit meeting on the horizon and no prospect for a 
major arms reduction agreement shevardnadzes visit lacks some of 
the drama which has accompanied many of his previous 27 meetings 
with shultz dating back to 1985 
according to well established procedures the agenda for the 
talks includes discussions on nuclear issues human rights 
bilateral issues and third world military conflicts in which both 
countries have an interest 
assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway told reporters 
there is no possibility that the two sides will be able to resolve 
differences before the end of the year on their mutual goal of 
achieving 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missile warheads 
many of the unresolved issues involve ways to verify that each side 
is fulfilling its commitment 
one area in which some progress may be possible centers on the 
peaceful nuclear explosion treaty which was approved during the 
mid 1970s but never ratified 
ridgway said the two sides are very close to a an agreement 
governing verification of the treaty which sets ground rules for 
use of nuclear weapons for such activities as building dams and 
altering the course of rivers 
once verification procedures are agreed to the treaty will be 
submitted to the senate for ratification 
shultz and shevardnadze also planned to discuss verification 
procedures for a second unratified treaty which limits to 150 
kilotons the size of underground nuclear explosions each side may 
carry out as part of an experiment to improve verification 
procedures experts from the two sides have been monitoring each 
others nuclear tests 
perhaps the most serious area of arms control contention between 
washington and moscow involves a us demand for the dismantling of 
a soviet radar facility at krasnoyarsk 
the administration has said repeatedly that the installation 
violates the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty because it could be 
used to coordinate defense of soviet missile silos or other 
military facilities 
on regional issues the two sides are encouraged by the 
prospects for agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign forces 
from angola and namibia a high priority administration goal 
but moscows decision to continue arms shipments to nicaraguas 
leftist government even after the us military aid cutoff to the 
contra rebels has been a major disappointment for the 
administration 
administration officials have said that the soviets have refused 
to negotiate seriously on this issue

debate experts say that neither george bush 
nor michael dukakis is any great shakes as a public speaker and 
the winner of their first facetoface showdown sunday night may be 
whoever exceeds low expectations 
veteran forensic judges also agree that the candidates will try 
their utmost to observe the cardinal rule of presidential debates 
avoid calamitous mistakes 
that may be good politics but it can make for dull debating 
said members of the associated press presidential debate judges 
panel 
james j unger executive director of the national forensics 
institute at american university in washington dc and chairman 
of the judges panel said these highstakes debates are 
exercises in erroravoidance by the candidates 
unger who also chaired ap panels that judged the presidential 
debates in 1976 1980 and 1984 said it is rare for a candidate to 
make a major gaffe like gerald fords in 1976 when he insisted that 
eastern europe was not dominated by the soviet union 
all too often he added the candidates just sit there with 
their prepared answers desperately seeking out a question to which 
they can attach the answer 
william southworth director of forensics and speech professor 
at the university of redlands in california said im not 
convinced either one of them is going to be dynamic confronting 
each other a lot will depend on how willing they are to take 
risks 
frank sferra debate coach at jk mullen high school in denver 
and president of the national forensic league said neither one 
is a terribly exciting speaker 
i get the feeling theyre too programmed to be debaters you 
bring up an issue and they know where theyre supposed to run and 
what to say said sferra theyre all so afraid theyre going 
to say something wrong 
dukakis engaged in 21 debates during the primaries with his 
rivals for the democratic nomination and he once moderated a 
public television debate series called the advocates 
bush faced off with his republican rivals seven times he also 
has a 1984 vice presidential debate with democrat geraldine ferraro 
under his belt the one about which he boasted afterwards that he 
tried to kick a little ass 
melissa maxey wade director of forensics at emory university in 
atlanta said that in the primary debates bush demonstrated more 
range positive and negative he had very strong persuasive 
responses when he was being attacked by al haig and jack kemp 
in the early debates 
dukakis was real consistent he doesnt seem to make major 
goofs he doesnt have big highs or big lows she said 
lanny d naegelin a speechtheater arts specialist for the 
north east independent school district in san antonio texas said 
both bush and dukakis lack pizzazz as speakers but dukakis 
is easier when he talks than bush its more obvious when bush 
speaks that hes working at what hes doing 
james m copeland national executive secretary of the national 
forensic league ripon wis said dukakis has great debate 
skills but he tends to be very monotone and flat in his 
presentation he said bush is a very strained speaker his 
voice tends to get a little screechy when hes excited 
sherry hall debate coach at harvard university in cambridge 
mass said that in collegiate debates content wins more points 
than style but in these presidential debates the emphasis is 
much more on style she said 
thats what people remember with president reagan four 
years ago people remember how he looked not what he said she 
said 
the sevenmember panel will use a scorecard similar to that 
employed in collegiate and scholastic debates to determine a winner 
of the sept 25 bushdukakis debate it will also evaluate their 
second debate on oct 13 or 14 and their running mates oct 5 
encounter

the iranian navy began mineclearing 
operations in the persian gulf on thursday irans official news 
agency reported as iran marked the eighth anniversary of iraqs 
invasion 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia quoted 
the unidentified commander of irans naval mine sweepers as saying 
that helicopters and frogmen also were involved in the 
mineclearing 
the iranian navy can defuse magnetic contact and other types of 
mines the officer was quoted as saying 
he said the operations underlined the islamic republics 
commitment to maintaining security and guaranteeing the safety of 
shipping in the region 
the report could not be confirmed independently 
a united nationssponsored ceasefire in the iraniraq war began 
aug 20 
when irans naval commander rear adm mohammadhussein 
malekzadegan announced last week that his forces would begin 
mineclearing operations a us official said that was 
tantamount to admitting that they laid the mines during the 
8yearold war 
iran has never admitted it laid mines in the waterways shipping 
lane but said it did so in its coastal waters for defense but 
tehran boasted last year that it could sow mines like seeds in 
the gulf 
the us navy captured the iran ajr an iranian naval vessel in 
the gulf a year ago while it was allegedly laying mines at night 
several mines were found aboard the ship and others it had laid 
were found nearby 
irna gave no other details on the mineclearing or specify where 
it was being carried out the naval officer said only that the 
operation was being conducted in international waters in the 
600milelong gulf 
the us and other western navies that sent forces to the gulf 
to protect neutral shipping have found dozens of mines mainly in 
the northern and central sectors of the waterway since july 1987 
irna said iranian ships detected and destroyed four mines last 
year in the gulf of oman off the united arab emirates port of khor 
fakkan western naval officials believe the iranians had planted 
the mines in the first place 
at least eight ships including the reflagged kuwaiti tanker 
bridgeton and the us missile frigate samuel b roberts have been 
sunk or damaged by mines in the last 16 months western officials 
said all were apparently laid by the iranians 
us navy officers estimate that as many as 200 mines mainly 
contacttype devices moored to the seabed are still in the gulf 
most are believed to be in shallow waters of the iraqi coast in the 
northern end of the gulf 
iraq is believed to have laid some but most are believed to be 
iranian 
irans navy had four coastal and two inshore mine sweepers when 
the war broke out in september 1980 along with a squadron of six 
usbuilt rh53d mine helicopters 
western analysts believe that only two of the iranian mine 
sweepers remain operational while the two surviving rh53d 
helicopters are no longer able to function as mine sweepers 
in tehran sacred defense week organized to mark the eighth 
anniversary of the war opened with a military parade in azadi 
square irna reported 
the iranians and most military historians say the war began when 
the iraqi army stormed across the border sept 22 1980 iraq says 
the conflict began sept 4 when the iranians shelled border towns 
after weeks of skirmishing 
irans president ali khamenei reviewed the parade and 
declared although we have no practical war at the fronts yet 
we do not feel the enemys threat any less than before irna said 
he called on irans forces to remain on alert because the 
enemy intends to again plot against this nation and the islamic 
revolution 
he charged that the iraqis were massing troops along the border 
and warned baghdad against renewed aggression 
irna in a separate commentary termed sept 22 1980 the 
blackest day in contemporary history the day the army of 
pagandom launched a war against islam the day the hordes of 
ignorance charged against the citadel of wisdom

prime minister rajiv gandhi on thursday 
withdrew a defamation bill that journalists and opposition 
politicians charged was an attempt at censorship 
we praise all good deeds by the government said prithvis 
chakravarthy an editor of the calcuttabased bengalilanguage 
newspaper aajkal and member of the editors guild of india this 
withdrawal is one of the few good acts committed by the government 
in a long time and we welcome it 
in a statement gandhi said he was withdrawing the bill because 
it has aroused misapprehensions and misgivigs among the press 
and public 
the law would have expanded the concept of defamation and 
abolished any presumption of innocence by journalists or others 
making disclosures construed as defamatory 
it permitted up to two years imprisonment for first offenders 
and up to five years imprisonment for subsequent convictions 
the government had said the legislation would protect people 
from irresponsible journalism newspapers denounced it as 
fascist and undemocratic and said it was an attempt to 
muzzle the press after a year of reports of alleged kickbacks 
involving defense contracts 
prominent indians including some of gandhis friends have been 
accused of receiving millions of dollars to facilitate contracts 
for swedens bofors artillery guns and west german submarines 
gandhi has denied receiving any money and a government inquiry 
failed to note any wrongdoing 
gandhi said the issue of defamation still must be resolved 
the freedom and rights of the individual are sacred it is 
this that makes the issue of defamation serious his statement 
said 
the defamation bill was passed by the lower house of parliament 
on aug 30 but it still required a vote by the upper house

michael dukakis and george bush counting down to their 
nationally televised debate on sunday swiped at each other three 
days early today from different parts of boston 
as bush arrived in town to try and embarrass dukakis by 
accepting the endorsement of a boston police union dukakis the 
massachusetts governor was telling senior citizens at a separate 
gathering that the democrats would stop the attack on social 
security and medicare 
dukakis told the elderly people that bush had once referred to 
social security as largely a welfare program and had cast the 
tiebreaking vote in the senate in 1985 on a bill to deny you a 
costofliving increase in your social security and to make you pay 
more for your medical benefits 
bush meanwhile was greeted by several hundred produkakis 
demonstrators when his motorcade pulled up at a boston restaurant 
where he was to receive the police endorsement 
the protesters carried signs and chanted bush go home 
inside bush supporters chanted in return we want bush and 
dump the duke and one dukakis backer who shouted out during 
the proceedings was ejected by police officers 
my opponent is strongly out of the american mainstream on 
issues such as fighting crime said the republican vice 
president who was flanked by about threedozen members of the 
boston police patrolmans association 
your endorsement is more than an endorsement of me its an 
endorsement of a philosophy this is an enormous boost for me 
bush said 
the candidates were easing back their public schedules after 
today in order to prepare for the debate the faceoff was just 
three days away but bushs top aide said today the two sides still 
hadnt settled on who would ask the questions 
the dukakis campaign made a proposal that we use only network 
anchors for the panelists and the moderator three panelists and 
one moderator and we said we didnt think that would be 
appropriate because that would entirely foreclose print media 
participation said campaign chairman james baker iii 
he said the bush campaign had submitted a list of 14 names 
including print journalists and network correspondents as well as 
tv anchors 
president reagan in comments prepared for delivery at baylor 
university in texas criticized democrats implying dukakis though 
not naming him as bornagain george pattons in supporting 
strong military defense 
while vice president bush spent wednesday engaging in a mock 
debate and in briefings with advisers dukakis conferred with sen 
bill bradley of new jersey on the sunday night faceoff 
the democratic nominee according to campaign sources scheduled 
his own mock debate on friday and planned to meet with two 
governors wellversed in the successes and pitfalls of public 
speaking mario cuomo of new york and bill clinton of arkansas 
dukakis played down the endorsement by the boston police 
patrolmans association citing the associations history of 
supporting republicans and the backing he has received from other 
law enforcement organizations including the massachusetts police 
association the international brotherhood of police officers and 
the combined law enforcement associations of texas bushs home 
state 
meanwhile the washington post reported that bushs campaign 
plans to spend more than 60 percent of its 54 million budget on 
television advertising 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said i think well be 
competitive with the bush campaign but beyond that we dont detail 
our spending 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen was pitching 
the democratic tickets theme of good jobs at good wages in 
santa clara calif and everett wash republican vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle was addressing the council of 
foreign affairs in los angeles 
on wednesday dukakis proposed his healthy start program 
which would provide prenatal and postpartum care to pregnant women 
and children who are either uninsured or underinsured 
dukakis met with two new mothers and their babies at brigham amp 
womens hospital in boston and said afterward when the time came 
to stand up for our childrens health care needs george bush was 
nowhere to be found 
the democratic nominee spent the rest of the day preparing for 
the debate even renting a meeting room in a boston hotel for 
practice sessions said campaign sources who requested anonymity 
the sources said dukakis will hold a mock debate on friday with 
washington attorney bob barnett standing in for bush barnett 
played the same role in 1984 when democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro was preparing for her debate with bush 
negotiators for the two campaigns neared agreement on the 
heights of the lecterns for the debate at wake forest university in 
winstonsalem nc 
the 6foot1 inch bush will stand at a 48inch high lectern 
according to a bush source who said the 5foot8 dukakis will use a 
41inch lectern and a riser 
a new poll meanwhile found that bush has gained in the race 
for the white house by solidifying his support among republicans 
and republicanleaning independents 
the survey conducted by gallup for the times mirror corp 
showed that bush has benefited from increased satisfaction with the 
course of the nation and confidence in the economy 
the news was not all good for the republican ticket which 
received a bit of critical advice wednesday from an unlikely source 
retired sen barry goldwater 
i want you to go back and tell george bush to start talking 
about the issues ok the conservative and 1964 gop presidential 
nominee told quayle after introducing him to a rotary club luncheon 
in phoenix

britain accused three czechoslovak diplomats 
thursday of spying and ordered them to leave the country within two 
weeks 
a foreign office announcement said the three envoys including 
two military attaches engaged in activities incompatible with 
their status diplomatic parlance for espionage 
the diplomats are maj bedrich kramar the assistant military 
and air attache maj vlastmil netolicky a member of the military 
attaches staff and paval moudry a member of the commercial 
section 
the expulsions prompted speculation the envoys were linked with 
a londonbased art dealer erwin van haarlem who says he is 
czechoslovakian and who is awaiting trial on charges of preparing 
to set up a spy ring 
britain also has complained this year about supplies of 
czechoslovakmade explosives reaching the outlawed irish republican 
army which is waging a bombing and shooting campaign to drive the 
british from northern ireland 
the foreign office refused to elaborate on its terse 
announcement at the czechoslovak embassy a telephone receptionist 
told reporters after the 1245 pm announcement that the embassy 
was closed for lunch and said later it was closed for the day 
in prague czechoslovak foreign ministry spokesman dusan 
rovensky said he had no comment 
czechoslovak ambassador jan fidler was summoned to the foreign 
office on thursday morning and given the expulsion order 
the foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe wishes it to be 
clearly understood that while we wish to build up our relations 
with czechoslovakia we are not prepared to relax our policy on the 
sort of activities in which maj kramar maj netolicky and mr 
moudry have engaged the statement said 
kramar and moudry have been in britain since 1984 and netolicky 
arrived in september 1985 the foreign office said 
they brought to seven the number of czechoslovak diplomats 
britain has expelled since 1983 usually amid speculation the 
envoys were suspected of spying on behalf of the soviet union 
there are certain instances for example where the kgb the 
soviet secret police or the gru soviet military intelligence has 
not wanted to get directly involved and has used czech intelligence 
to do so christopher lee a defense analyst at emmanuel college 
cambridge said in a radio interview thursday 
van haarlem who has a dutch passport was arrested last april 
at his london apartment police burst in and said they caught him 
using radio equipment to transmit signals to a foreign power 
he has been indicted for trial at londons old bailey central 
criminal court no date has been set 
britain last expelled soviet diplomats in september 1985 a 
total of 31 soviets and 31 britons including businessmen and 
journalists were ordered out of london and moscow in a series of 
retaliatory expulsions 
britain has expelled four other diplomats in the past month a 
tunisian who refused to pay hundreds of dollars of parking fines a 
vietnamese who brandished a gun at demonstrators a cuban who fired 
a gun in a street and the cuban ambassador

science literacy among americas school 
children is at an alarming and depressing level that may 
prevent many high school graduates from doing well in skilled jobs 
or collegelevel course according to a study released thursday 
the science report card a federally funded project 
conducted by the educational testing service of princeton nj 
found that more than half of the nations 17yearolds are so 
poorly educated in science that they cannot benefit from special 
job training and cannot perform work requiring basic technical 
understanding 
only seven percent of the 17yearolds in the study demonstrated 
sufficient skills to do well in collegelevel science courses 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers called the findings depressing and alarming and said 
the poor level of science education could be disastrous for the 
country 
the science report card reflects data collected in 1986 it is 
the fifth national study of science skills among 9 13 and 
17yearolds to be conducted by the nea since 1969 
among the findings 
science achievement remains well below the results of the 1969 
study for students at age 17 although there was a slight upturn 
observed in the 1982 and 1986 surveys 
declines in science achievement are less for pupils aged 9 and 
13 but the average achievement at age 13 remains below that 
measured in 1970 and achievement at age 9 has only now returned to 
the level measured in 1970 
science proficiency for black and hispanic students aged 13 and 
17 remains at least four years behind the levels of white students 
of the same ages 
a marked difference in science proficiency is measured between 
girls and boys at the 13 and 17 age levels although the genders 
measure approximately the same at age 9 at age 17 half of the 
males demonstrate an ability to analyze scientific procedures and 
data while only a third of the females have such skills in the 
study of physics the study said the gender gap is extremely 
large by the 11th grade 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association said the findings paint a stark picture of science 
education in our nations schools 
scientific understanding is more and more a prerequisite for 
informed citizenship said ms futrell if americas citizens 
of tomorrow are not scientifically literate we place our very 
democracy at risk 
she said that the lower level of science achievement by females 
and minority students is the most disturbing of the findings 
by many measures of science proficiency the inequalities for 
both minorities and females actually increase as students move 
through the grades she said 
shanker in a statement released by the american federation of 
teachers said the findings could be troubling for americas future 
when only a small number of our students can understand basic 
scientific concepts the results are disastrous for the entire 
country he said here we are one of the great scientific 
giants of the world and almost 60 percent of our successful 
17yearolds dont have the scientific literacy required of 
informed citizens 
the science report card reinforces results of an international 
study released earlier this year that showed american school 
children at all levels performed far behind children of the same 
age in most of the other 14 nations surveyed 
the science report card study is financed by the department of 
education as part of a program called the national assessment of 
educational progress national report cards also are issued in 
other subjects as part of the program

republican george bush raided michael dukakis 
home turf today to accept the endorsement of a boston police union 
and declared the support would give his campaign an enormous 
boost 
who was it who said the police arent there when you need 
them bush said theyre wrong 
the vice president flanked at a restaurant by about threedozen 
members of the boston police patrolmans association accepted the 
endorsement voted the day before by the 1500member union 
his motorcade was met outside by several hundred produkakis 
demonstrators chanting bush go home and where was george 
inside bushs supporters had their own chants of we want 
bush and dump the duke and one dukakis backer who when 
bush began talking about war on crime shouted war on noriega 
was ejected from the room by police officers 
in brief remarks bush said im here not only to accept this 
endorsement but to make it clear im the one in this race who wants 
to strengthen law enforcement 
my opponent is strongly out of the american mainstream on 
issues such as fighting crime the vice president said your 
endorsement is more than an endorsement of me its an endorsement 
of a philosophy this is an enormous boost for me 
robert t guiney president of the association said as 
police officers in the capital city of massachusetts we know gov 
dukakis well and we can state publicly he is no friend of police 
the vice president who is limiting public appearances this week 
to prepare for sundays presidential debate spent wednesday in 
briefings with advisers and engaged in a mock debate 
while aides are working out final logistical details on the 
sunday debate bush was taking a break from his preparations today 
for the trip to boston and an appearance with president reagan in 
houston 
the boston visit is the second this month for bush he 
previously toured boston harbor and claimed the democratic nominee 
did little to clean up the heavy pollution in the harbor 
police union officials citing dukakis opposition to the death 
penalty and his support for a former program granting weekend 
furloughs for convicted felons said they supported bush because he 
would be more attentive to law enforcement needs 
they also said they were angry the governor had failed to attend 
the funerals recently of three police officers killed on duty 
the police officers in this city are upset with the governor 
and his policies said guiney theres a feeling we are taken 
for granted 
republican leaders were elated and bush telephoned his thanks to 
several of the union officers 
this sends a message to the whole country that the law 
enforcement agency that knows dukakis best doesnt want him to 
become president said alexander tennant executive director of 
the state republican party 
dukakis downplayed the endorsement citing the associations 
history of supporting republicans including reagan in 1980 and 
1984 
dukakis said he has received backing from other law enforcement 
organizations including the massachusetts police association the 
international brotherhood of police officers and the combined law 
enforcement associations of texas bushs home state

guilty plea rather than run the risk of a jury trial and conviction 
on a charge of firstdegree murder summerfield said 
her trial had been scheduled to start monday the trial had been 
moved to fayette county from mercer county because of pretrial 
publicity

fayette county jail without bond since her return to west virginia 
mrs cloud contended that her husband was murdered by a masked 
assailant who emerged from the darkness outside their home and 
demanded money then fired one shotgun blast 
mercer county prosecutor david knight questioned why the man 
hadnt robbed the house while the clouds were at the dinner party

crown prince akihito assumed all his fathers 
duties thursday while 87yearold emperor hirohito bedridden with 
a serious illness ate two ice cubes and watched sumo wrestling on 
television 
more than 23000 people many in suits or kimonos took up 
calligraphy brushes and inked their names on registries set up in 
12 sites around the country to wish a speedy recovery to the 
worlds longest reigning living monarch 
chartered buses began bringing hundreds of pilgrims to the gates 
of the imperial palace in central tokyo and priests at shinto 
shrines and buddhist temples across the country continued their 
prayer services 
crowds have gathered in front of the palace since hirohito took 
to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four days ago palace officials 
said thursday he remained in serious but stable condition 
palace officials said he was receiving oxygen and intravenous 
dosages of nutrients and medicine and was under intensive 
roundtheclock care 
we are continuing to regard the situation seriously one 
palace official said on condition of anonymity he said the 
emperors condition has not changed significantly 
the japanese government meanwhile protested to two british 
tabloid newspapers for their strongly negative coverage of 
hirohito a recent headline in the daily star read sun sets on 
the god king while the sun announced hells waiting for this 
truly evil emperor 
also thursday japans finance minister announced he would not 
attend a series of international monetary meetings scheduled to 
begin in west berlin this week due to the emperors illness 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa was scheduled to leave friday 
afternoon for meetings with the international monetary fund and 
world bank he also was to participate in a meeting of the group of 
seven the united states japan west germany britain france 
italy and canada 
japan will be represented by bank of japan governor satoshi 
sumita 
palace officials confirmed thursday that the emperor had eaten 
two small ice cubes and had been transferred to a special bed 
making medical treatment easier news reports said he watched 
television including a broadcast of sumo wrestling 
the cabinet temporarily passed the imperial mantle to akihito 
the 54yearold crown prince assumed part of his fathers duties 
last september when hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass 
operation 
taking into consideration the emperors illness and medical 
treatment we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume 
responsibilities chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi said 
the duties include placing an official seal on government 
appointments and new laws convocation of parliament and various 
ceremonial functions it was not known whether the crown prince 
carried out any of his duties thursday but news reports said he 
was expected to sign several cabinet orders on industrial policy on 
friday or monday 
under the constitution the emperor has no real power but he 
signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a 
symbol of unity for the japanese people 
the imperial household agency came under fire for providing only 
sketchy reports on the health of the emperor 
within allowable limits they should as much as possible give 
careful reports chief government spokesman keizo obuchi said at 
a news conference 
obuchis remarks followed a report in the nationally circulated 
mainichi shimbun newspaper that the agencys failure to disclose 
sufficient information on the emperors health led to conflicting 
reports and was reminiscent of the agencys tightlipped policy 
during the reign of hirohitos father the taisho emperor who died 
on christmas day 1926 
the imperial household agency is the notoriously conservative 
guardian of the monarchys affairs news briefings on hirohitos 
condition last only a few minutes and invariably exclude 
foreigners although officials answer telephoned queries from 
foreign news agencies 
officials at the foreign ministry said they were pressing the 
palace to deliver fuller reports 
most other cabinet ministers canceled plans to leave tokyo 
including foreign minister sosuke uno who was to leave thursday 
for talks with us leaders in washington the government has asked 
italian prime minister ciriaco de mita and irish leader charles j 
haughey to postpone state visits to japan this month

boston university has backed down in its quest for 
neartotal control over chelseas schools by agreeing to let the 
citys school committee retain some power 
bus decision to modify its proposal for a contract to manage 
the troubled 3300student chelsea system came after failing to win 
a 10year management pact this summer 
the university agreed wednesday night that committee members 
could override any of their management decisions by a twothirds 
majority 
this is our best shot said peter r greer dean of bus 
school of education 
but some school committee members were still reluctant to enter 
into a contract with the university some felt rushed by the 
universitys push for a vote 
you expect us to do all this in a week committee member 
elizabeth mcbride said after hearing the proposal i think its a 
little much 
chelsea which is near bankruptcy has had problems running its 
schools efficiently it also has had trouble raising the average of 
students standardized test scores which are lower than the state 
average 
under bus latest proposal the university would take over all 
aspects of the school system including negotiating union 
contracts hiring setting curriculum and developing educational 
policy 
it allows parents and community leaders to serve on two advisory 
boards established to aid university representatives but the 
primary governing body would be a bucontrolled board 
bu and the committee would have the right to terminate the 
contract 
if the committee agrees to the bu proposal it must be approved 
by the citys board of aldermen and the state legislature

the piper alpha disaster prompted calls for review of safety 
procedures in the industry and the government has recommended 
additional safety measures on all oil and gas rigs 
royal air force spokesman pat coffey a spokesman at a base at 
pitreavie stressed that the ocean odyssey incident was not 
anything like the piper alpha

activist escaped detention and took refuge in the us consulate 
where three other activists have been holed up for 10 days a us 
spokesman said today 
police issued an arrest warrant for clifford ngcobo who fled 
wednesday while being treated at johannesburg hospital and went to 
the american consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown johannesburg 
office tower authorities later said the warrant had been suspended 
ngcobo claims he was assaulted by police the night he was 
detained 
the consulate which has been providing refuge to three other 
activists who escaped last week decided to allow ngcobo to remain 
us embassy spokesman william zavis said in pretoria

american diplomats had contacted the south african government about 
the newcomer there was no immediate comment from government 
officials 
the south african police considers ngcobo as an ordinary 
accused in a criminal case and he will be treated in accordance 
with normal legal procedure police said 
police have not accused ngcobo of any crime but said they were 
investigating charges of illegal possession of weapons and 
intimidation 
two leaders of the banned united democratic front the countrys 
largest multiracial antiapartheid alliance and another activist 
have been inside the consulate since sept 13

refused to leave the consulate despite a promise from the white 
minority government that they will not be arrested again or 
restricted 
they have given no indication how long they plan to stay 
us officials say the activists will not be expelled from the 
consulate despite a worldwide us policy of refusing asylum in 
its diplomatic missions

president reagan hit the campaign trail for 
george bush today with ridicule for bornagain gen george 
pattons in the democratic party who say they support a strong 
national defense 
without mentioning the name of democratic candidate michael 
dukakis the president told a republican texas victory 88 
rally that liberal democrats have had a deathbed conversion to 
gop positions supporting the submarinebased trident missile and 
the stealth bomber 
reagan was interrupted repeatedly by deafening screams and 
applause from about 9000 baylor university students who hissed at 
the presidents frequent mention of liberal democrats signs on the 
wall read rock em ron and push for bush 
when the liberals say family they mean big brother in 
washington when we say family we mean honor thy father and 
mother reagan said the crowd went wild 
reagan declared that under his and the vice presidents 
leadership our nation is again respected in the world our armed 
forces are strong and america is at peace 
reagan was stumping for bush and rep beau boulter rtexas who 
is seeking the senate seat of democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen before joining the vice president at 
fundraising dinner in houston tonight 
reagan said he recently vetoed a 2995 billion defense 
authorization bill because he was convinced it would have harmed 
us military strength he then invoked the name of gen george 
patton a crusty and venerable world war ii combat hero in 
lambasting the democratic ticket 
but lately some liberal leaders have seen what was happening 
to them in the polls and had a deathbed conversion he said 
theyd have you believe that theyre bornagain gen george 
pattons but if we go the way they want to go our defenses will 
run out of gas in no time 
bush has charged repeatedly that his democratic rival the 
governor of massachusetts was soft on defense issues and would 
weaken the national security dukakis has said he opposes the 
railbased mx missile and has voiced concerns about how far the 
united states should go in deploying b1 bombers 
but in an effort to deflect the vice presidents criticism 
dukakis donned a military helmet and took a ride in an m1 battle 
tank last week at a defense contractors plant in michigan to 
underscore his argument that he believes in a strong military 
the president said that when democratic liberals talk of 
supporting new weapons systems they whisper that theyre also 
for delaying deployment of both systems the trident and the 
stealth bomber pending the outcome of arms talks which could drag 
on for years while the soviets could be deploying new systems of 
their own 
said reagan they shout loudly that there for maintaining the 
effectiveness of the landbased leg of our strategic missile 
triad but theyre against the modern missile systems that will be 
available for years to come and would like to see an end to the 
flight testing needed to develop new systems 
on wednesday reagan offered bush some advice on the vice 
presidents first nationally televised debate with dukakis on 
sunday in winstonsalem nc 
the president told reporters he advised bush to take no 
prisoners in the faceoff at wake forest university 
during todays trip reagan also planned to visit the johnson 
space center in houston where he was to meet with the five 
discovery space shuttle astronauts who are preparing for a sept 29 
launch 
his joint appearance with bush is their second since the vice 
president won the gop presidential nomination in midaugust texas 
with its 29 electoral votes and status as bentsens home state is 
a pivotal campaign battleground for bush and dukakis 
after dukakis tapped bentsen as his running mate the senator 
was allowed to remain on the texas ballot in his bid for a fourth 
senate term under the socalled lyndon law which was passed to 
allow lyndon b johnson to run simultaneously for reelection to 
the senate and for the vice presidency with john f kennedy in 1960 
reagans last visit to the space center was a grim one coming 
only days after the disastrous explosion of the challenger space 
shuttle on jan 28 1986 the challengers seven crew members 
perished when their spacecraft erupted in a giant fireball only 73 
seconds after liftoff 
at the time reagan mourned the loss of our seven star 
voyagers and pledged that america would forge ahead with an 
effective and safe space program 
the president also said wednesday that he supported bushs 
criticism of dukakis for vetoing a 1977 bill in massachusetts that 
would have required public school teachers to lead students in 
reciting the pledge of allegiance dukakis has cited an advisory 
opinion of the state supreme court that the bill was 
unconstitutional 
ive seen many children today who dont know what theyre 
supposed to do when the national anthem is played or when the flag 
goes by reagan told reporters i remember that i learned all 
that in school why shouldnt they 
the president was asked whether teachers should be forced to 
lead students in the pledge 
thats what theyre there for he shot back their job is 
to teach something

police continued a nationwide 
crackdown on government opponents thursday but they backtracked on 
a detainee who escaped and joined three other activists holed up at 
the us consulate 
police issued then withdrew an arrest warrant for clifford 
ngcobo who escaped wednesday while being treated at a hospital and 
fled to the 11thfloor consulate in a downtown johannesburg office 
building 
consular officials who have provided refuge for three prominent 
activists since their escape sept 13 allowed ngcobo to remain 
while his case is assessed us embassy spokesman william zavis 
said 
police have pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if 
they leave the consulate but law and order minister adriaan vlok 
said a multipronged crackdown against other activists is under way 
across the country this week more than two dozen activists have 
been detained or barred from political activities offices of 
antiapartheid groups have been raided and pedestrians and 
motorists in urban centers have been subjected to random searches 
the crackdown comes during an increase in bombings including 
five in a ninehour span late wednesday and early thursday 
authorities said 38 people were injured including 18 whites at a 
johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks eight hours later at a 
disco on the other side of the city 
the owner of the disco said three white men entered then left 
without drinking any of the beers they had ordered shortly before 
the explosion 
police blame most recent bombings on the outlawed african 
national congress the major guerrilla group fighting 
whiteminority rule but activists believe rightwing vigilantes or 
a covert security force unit carried out the recent bombing of a 
johannesburg building used by antiapartheid groups 
vlok said the security crackdown was intended to counter an 
alleged campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal elections next 
month 
activists advocate a boycott of the elections and say the 
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a 
whitecontrolled system that excludes blacks from central 
government 
police also have been targeting activists expected to 
participate in a national antiapartheid conference this weekend in 
cape town the main sponsor of the conference the congress of 
south african trade unions said thursday that eight of its members 
were detained and four barred from leaving the johannesburg area 
ngcobo 30 was active in the antiapartheid soweto civic 
association and had been held since april 23 his attorneys said 
ngcobo alleged that he was assaulted by police on the night of 
his detention and he was hospitalized four days after he was 
detained the attorneys said 
police issued an arrest warrant for ngcobo on thursday and said 
he was wanted for illegal weapons possession and intimidation but 
several hours later the foreign affairs department said the warrant 
was suspended 
the department said the case against ngcobo dealt only with 
weapons possession not with any other alleged offense and was 
referred to the attorney general for consideration 
authorities did not elaborate on what would happen to ngcobo if 
he left his refuge 
the government has said it will act against the three activists 
who escaped to the consulate last week 
they are murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa leaders of the 
banned united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition and vusi khanyile chairman of the banned 
national education crisis committee 
the three eluded guards while receiving physiotherapy at 
johannesburg hospital the same facility that ngcobo escaped from 
the three have called for the release of all political detainees 
and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government 
assurances 
us officials say the activists will not be expelled from the 
consulate despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in us 
diplomatic missions 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

voters doubts about george bush and michael 
dukakis are such that despite bushs recent strength in the 
presidential race the debates between the two men will prove 
critical analysts of a new poll suggested thursday 
we consider this contest still a very close one said andrew 
kohut president of the gallup organization which conducted the 
poll for the times mirror corp 
the poll suggested that bush has gained in the presidential race 
more by solidifying his support among republicans and 
republicanleaning independents than by siphoning off democrats 
from dukakis 
he has performed in a way that has caused republicans to come 
home analyst norman ornstein said at a news conference where the 
poll results were released 
kohut said bush has won the first round of this campaign and 
seized the momentum but that support for both men was soft 
with many people who expressed a preference saying they might 
switch to the opponent 
ornstein of the american enterprise institute said bush was 
vulnerable on the irancontra affair and on the administrations 
handling of drug charges against panamanian leader manuel antonio 
noriega with the noriega question more significant to people 
than any other issue 
bushs criticism of dukakis prison furlough program resounds 
with more voters than any other charges against the massachusetts 
governor ornstein said 
voters are also sensitive to dukakis veto of a bill that would 
have required the pledge of allegiance in massachusetts schools 
not because it raises questions about dukakis patriotism but 
because the public thinks his judgment was wrong kohut said 
the poll analysis called bushs running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana the achilles heel of the republicans because of doubts 
about his qualifications while quayle did not appear to be an 
issue on which votes were swinging directly ornstein said quayle 
would be more of an issue than the overall numbers suggest as 
a symbol of george bushs judgment combined with noriega and 
irancontra 
given the doubts whether either candidate has the judgment 
to be a good president these debates are either going to 
reinforce doubts or erase doubts about their judgment ornstein 
said i think the debates are critical 
bush and dukakis have their first debate sunday in 
winstonsalem nc their second on oct 13 or 14 in los angeles 
the poll suggested that bush has advanced his cause by painting 
dukakis as ideologically out of step and he has benefited from 
increased voter satisfaction with the nations course and 
confidence in the economy 
but while bush has drawn some conservative democrats to his 
side he has lost ground among other democraticoriented groups 
said gallups analysis 
it said the more significant movement was bushs greater support 
from republicans in general and particularly from 
republicanleaning bluecollar conservatives identified in the 
survey as disaffected voters 
for all the talk of the importance of the reagan democrats 
this analysis suggests that the most significant dynamic in recent 
weeks has been the return of republicans to the fold with 
disaffecteds showing the largest proportionate swing gallups 
analysis said 
the disaffecteds set apart by their suspicion of 
government made up about a tenth of the registered voters in the 
poll they went from a nearly even division on bush and dukakis in 
may to backing bush by 61 percent to 27 percent this month gallup 
said 
the poll defines the electorate by grouping voters with shared 
values rather than through the more traditional measures of 
political party identification or ideology 
bush has made inroads only in the most conservative democratic 
groups kohut said and he lost ground among another democratic 
group seculars who are nonreligious and put an emphasis on 
personal freedom 
a produkakis group the liberal 60s democrats supports 
dukakis more strongly now apparently in reaction to bushs 
ideologically based attacks 
at the same time core republican groups support bush almost 
unanimously and in each there has been a dramatic increase in 
the proportion who say they support bush strongly gallups 
analysis said as a result it said it is clear that the main 
effect of the bush efforts has been to solidify his base among 
republicanoriented groups 
overall bush was supported by 50 percent in the poll of 2001 
registered voters to 44 percent for dukakis the survey done sept 
914 had a margin of error of three percentage points so bushs 
lead was not statistically meaningful but in this as in other 
polls bush had trailed badly before the republican convention in 
august

us rep jim mccrery got the backing of 
gov buddy roemer when he ran for roemers former congressional 
seat but now that hes seeking reelection his major opponent is 
roemers mother 
adeline roemer says she entered the race because shes 
disappointed with the incumbents brief performance in congress 
mccrery a republican who formerly worked as a top aide to 
roemer when roemer was congressman called the challenge in the 
oct 1 open primary quite awkward and quite uncomfortable but 
said hes confident of winning his first full twoyear term 
mccrery won a runoff in april to fill the rest of roemers 
unexpired term roemer a democrat who was elected four times to 
the 4th district seat took office as governor on march 15 
i voted for jim mccrery in the runoff said mrs roemer 64 
a democrat 
while i felt there were two good people in the runoff i felt 
i knew jim better i thought he would vote across party lines 
in the best interests of the people of the district i do not feel 
that has been the case she said 
a third primary candidate robert briggs has only a small 
political base if neither mrs roemer nor mccrery wins a majority 
the two top votegetters will be forced into a runoff 
name recognition in mrs roemers favor hasnt hurt his 
campaign mccrery said 
i have lost a few of the roemer people who voted for me last 
time because of their allegiance to buddy and his mother but they 
are few in number he said 
mrs roemer who described herself as a lifelong political 
activist most concerned with persuading qualified people to run for 
office said mccrery cast a couple of votes that put up little 
red flags including opposition to a 60day notification for 
plant closings and a catastrophic health care bill 
i felt like he has cast a straight party line vote even when 
it hurt his district and it would not have hurt his standing in the 
republican party for him to have voted differently she said 
the incumbent said he voted against the plant closing provision 
because it could have pushed small businesses into bankruptcy and 
would have discouraged expansion he said the health care bill 
was not in the best interest of the district 
mrs roemer said she decided to enter the race because no strong 
candidate was emerging to challenge mccrery i walked down the 
levee and through the cotton fields and decided i would run 
it certainly wasnt the governors idea she said 
when i called him up on that saturday morning and told him i 
planned to run for congress and asked him if that would cause him 
any problems there was dead silence she said when he came 
back on he said mom are you serious 
roemer and his wife patti recently appeared at a 1000 per 
couple fundraiser for his mother last spring the governor drew 
the ire of state democrats when he supported mccrery 
mccrery whose campaign raised about 80000 with a fundraiser 
featuring retired marine lt col oliver north a major figure in 
the irancontra controversy said he has done in congress exactly 
what he promised to do 
no 1 is what is in the best interest of the united states 
no 2 is what is in the best interest of the district i said that 
during the last campaign he said 
mccrery 38 said he hopes the race will not have negative 
effects on the district 
i have supported buddy roemer for a number of years and hope 
to continue to support his efforts to turn around the economy of 
louisiana he said

a conductor of moscows bolshoi opera said 
thursday he defected to america because his outspoken doubts about 
soviet politics made him a secondclass citizen and hampered his 
work in his own country 
while we were trying to build one type of society in the 
soviet union we were in fact building one very different one in 
which it was very difficult to live and in which there was little 
hope for the future said ruben z vartanyan who sought asylum 
at the us embassy in bolivia last week while visiting that nation 
i am an outspoken person vartanyan told a washington news 
conference i could not disguise my feelings vartanyan said 
and he believes that informers reported back to the authorities 
vartanyan said he first experienced trouble on his return to 
moscow in 1976 after a stay of nearly six years in bolivia where 
he was the principal conductor of the national symphonic orchestra 
in la paz 
although he was never charged or openly accused of disloyalty to 
the soviet union he was unable to find a permanent post for four 
years after his return 
the situation improved slightly after he wrote a letter to 
leonid i brezhnev who was then the soviet president and from 
1980 until his defection vartanyan was one of several conductors at 
the bolshoi opera in moscow conducting more that 500 performances 
vartanyan met last week with mstislav rostropovich another 
soviet defector who is now director of the national symphony in 
washington the two were acquainted years ago in the soviet union 
when vartanyan was principal conductor of the armenian state 
symphony in yerevan 
rostropovich was unfamiliar with vartanyans work and had no 
comment on the defection said a spokeswoman for rostropovich 
they had been very much out of touch and mr rostropovich did 
not know that mr vartanyan was conducting at the bolshoi he did 
however recognize his face said the spokeswoman nadya efremov 
vartanyan whose defection was disclosed wednesday has not 
received any invitations to work in the united states but told 
reporters i am an optimist 
the soviet conductor said that he had great respect for kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and his attempts to reform soviet 
society although there have been improvements in literature film 
and theater in music things are the opposite said vartanyan 
the political leadership is not as interested in music as they 
are in literature and film he said 
the world of soviet music is run by the same people in the 
ministries and the communist party central committee who have sat 
there for the past 20 years it is impossible for them to change 
he said 
the bolshoi theater which includes an opera and a ballet 
company remains a political fiefdom where the level of artistic 
discussion can be compared to any graveyard in moscow and the 
director fires those who disagree with him he said 
i do not consider myself a traitor or a defector he said 
but i felt i was under suspicion and did not have the confidence 
of the people who ran the musical world they did not have 
confidence in my political views 
because of that he said he was considered a second class 
citizen and a member of the lowest category of society 
vartanyan said that his only close relative in the soviet union 
was a sister his wife died two years ago they had no children 
and his parents are deceased he said

terry povah is up to his 
warehouse ceiling in sweatshirts coffee mugs fishing tackle and 
thousands of other items normally carted home by tourists during a 
typical yellowstone summer 
but the summer of 88 was far from typical in the countrys 
first national park 
forest fires that raged over half of yellowstone national parks 
22 million acres meant evacuation and early closure of many 
facilities it also meant the hasty exit of thousands of visitors 
who ordinarily would crowd the aisles of povahs 15 retail stores 
past labor day 
will i have to reorder inventory for next year god i hope 
not said povah 43 president of his familys hamilton stores 
inc the oldest concessioner under the jurisdiction of the 
national park service 
first we had the great depression then world war ii then the 
59 earthquake then the arab oil embargo then the 76 teton dam 
disaster and now the fires there are always hurdles in the road 
this is just another one i try to be philosophical 
wanna buy a tshirt cheap 
povahs quip is typical of the kind of humor he says has helped 
his family cope with mother nature and washington bureaucrats 
during the nearly three quarters of a century hamilton stores has 
been in yellowstone 
we basically fly with one eye open anyway said povah 
whos to say in august of 88 that we wont have a gas shortage 
in july of 89 and the tourists wont come anyway the company 
philosophy is conservative that means we have a 72year history of 
annual crapshoots 
povahs grandfather charles ashworth hamilton arrived in 
montana by train in 1905 from st paul minn and went to work for 
the yellowstone park association which then ran the commissary 
through three generations of its owners grit hunches neck 
protrusion and luck hamilton stores which formally began in 1915 
when its founder bought out a retiring storekeeper at old faithful 
has grown into a multimilliondollar operation 
today hamilton stores concessions are scattered throughout the 
park they include service stations snack bars grocery and 
general merchandise stores and camera shops they also provide 12 
dormitories for their 800 summer employees 
povah says his family will remember this year for a long time 
it was wild he said shaking his head in may and june we 
were doing a tremendous business so in july we heavily reordered 
then the fires came 
we didnt lose any facilities but we had smokedamaged 
merchandise and a helluva lot of inconvenience 
he even spent a few days helping fight fires with his companys 
two fire trucks 
thered be a power outage and wed be running around trying to 
save ice cream then old faithful was threatened and we were 
shuffling all the merchandise around povah said 
povah recalled the night he and his three children headed home 
to west yellowstone from the park got cut off and had to wait it 
out while hundreds of firefighters fought one of the biggest blazes 
the kids were saying uh dad i think you should turn around 
and i looked to see flames everywhere said povah i tried to 
say no problem but i was a little worried 
so hows povah going to relax after such a stressful summer 
im going to take a bus from tibet to nepal over 
18000foothigh mountain passes he said that should prepare 
me for next summer in yellowstone

the nations savings institutions lost 75 
billion in the first half of this year the government reported 
thursday as a senate leader called for the biggest federal bailout 
in history 
the federal home loan bank board said sampls lost 36 billion in 
the apriljune quarter a modest improvement over the 39 billion 
loss of the first quarter 
nevertheless the industry in only the first half of the year is 
already approaching the postdepression record loss of 78 billion 
for all of 1987 
senate banking committee chairman william proxmire dwis who 
is retiring after building a reputation as a pennypinching 
legislator during 31 years in office said thursday that the next 
congress will have to appropriate at least 20 billion about 81 
for every man woman and child in the country to bail out the 
industry 
and healthy sampls which have been paying to close or merge 
failed institutions so far will have to contribute an additional 
30 billion he said 
it is with reluctant but profound conviction that i rise to 
state the next congress will be required to appropriate at 
least 20 billion proxmire said in a speech prepared for 
delivery on the senate floor 
the bailouttocome will be the largest ever in the history of 
the us it will be far bigger than the combined cost of the 
assistance to chrysler corp lockheed corp and new york 
city he said 
the bank board report and proxmires statement came within a 
week of several new and larger than previous estimates of the 
cost of cleaning up the thrift industry 
the general accounting office congress auditing arm says it 
will cost 45 billion to 50 billion the american bankers 
association the trade group for commercial banks says 74 billion 
and some private analysts put the cost as high as 100 billion the 
bank board says it intends in october to raise its 31 billion 
projection 
meanwhile treasury secretary nicholas f brady on wednesday 
directed a top deputy undersecretary george d gould to 
independently assess the conflicting estimates 
that would be the first step in a possible reevaluation of the 
administrations stance which has been that the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp has as much money as it can efficiently 
spend well into next year 
at a time when the administration is struggling to reduce the 
federal budget deficit the question of how much must be spent on 
sampls is becoming increasingly critical 
since midaugust alone the bank board has pledged nearly 13 
billion in assistance to resolve the cases of more than 50 
institutions because fslic lacks the cash to complete rescue 
packages its aid is coming in the form of prommissory notes and 
guarantees against certain kinds of future loss 
according to figures released last week at a house banking 
committee hearing fslic has more than 19 billion in outstanding 
commitments rep jim leach riowa said the commitments which 
have been made without congressional approval threaten to create a 
constitutional cataclysm 
proxmire accused brady of being nonchalant about the problem 
and said the administration has its head buried in the sand 
in turn sen jake garn of utah the senior republican on the 
committee criticized the sanctimonious attempts of colleagues 
to blame the administration and said he was outraged by repeated 
efforts to get the us taxpayers to pick up the tab 
bank board economist james barth said he detected some signs of 
improvement in the latest financial report net losses declined for 
the second quarter in a row from the record threemonth loss of 4 
billion in septemberdecember 1987 
the number of insolvent institutions among 3092 reporting 
slipped from 509 to 497 and the percentage of moneylosing 
institutions declined slightly from 31 percent to 29 percent

in the current quarter but he noted that about 800 million of the 
second quarter loss occurred at 60 institutions that have since

greek foreign minister karolos papoulias told 
congress thursday he was confident his government and the united 
states can reach agreement on us military bases in greece a 
congressional source said

papoulias reiterated prime minister andreas papandreous terms 
for a new military base agreement that include ending us 
operations at hellenikon and not transferring them to any of the 23 
other american installations in greece the source said 
hellenikon is a logistics base at athens international airport

negotiations that greece says will restart in two weeks in athens 
the existing fiveyear agreement gives us forces 18 months to 
leave if a new accord is not reached by dec 21

palestine liberation organization operative rashid is serving a 
sevenmonth sentence for entering greece may 30 using a forged

president amin gemayel said he was 
leaving office at the end of his 6yearterm at midnight tonight 
and would hand power to an interim government parliament failed 
today to elect a new head of state 
gemayel did not name members of the new interim cabinet 
presidential palace sources said the cabinet will be announced 
later in a presidential decree 
i leave the presidency today worried and filled with 
anxiety gemayel told the nation in a fiveminute farewell 
address televised nationwide 
the constitutional authority should have passed through the 
free will of parliament members to a president who enjoys the 
confidence of the people he said 
gemayels delegation of power to an interim government defies a 
warning by the nations moslem religious leaders that such a move 
would partition lebanon 
earlier today fighting broke out along the citys dividing 
green line and state radio said gunmen killed two senior 
commanders of the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia 
christians and moslems have been fighting a civil war for the 
past 13 years ravaging the once prosperous economy of this nation 
and dividing the country into factions controlled by bands of 
guerrillas 
under an unwritten national covenant dating from independence in 
1943 the lebanese president must be a maronite christian the 
prime minister a sunni moslem and the parliament speaker a shiite 
moslem 
daoud daoud and mahmoud fakih top amal officers for southern 
lebanon were killed instantly when a rocketpropelled grenade 
hit the car they were riding in on the ouzai highway the broadcast 
said the highway is in syrianpoliced south beirut 
daoud and fakih whose amal shiite movement is backed by syria 
led a crackdown on proiranian shiite fundamentalists in south 
lebanon earlier this year that operation ousted the extremist 
hezbollah or party of god from most of the southern villages 
shell explosions and bursts of gunfire echoed across beirut 
after the parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem put 
off voting for 24 hours 
police said one christian militiaman was killed and two soldiers 
of the regular armys predominantly shiite moslem 6th brigade were 
wounded in mortar and machine gun duels near the old parliament 
headquarters 
moslems have said that if gemayel appoints a christian to be 
prime minister they will declare their own republic in territory 
they control that would formalize the breakup of lebanon into 
rival sectarian ministates 
former president charles helou said after meeting with gemayel 
the new prime minister would probably be a member of the helou 
clan it was an apparent reference to his cousin pierre helou a 
maronite catholic businessman who maintains close ties with several 
moslem leaders 
three christians are standing for election to replace the 
maronite president syria backs two of them former president 
suleiman franjieh 78 and 58yearold parliament deputy mikhail 
daher 
the third veteran politician raymond edde has been living in 
selfimposed exile in paris for 12 years after escaping three 
assassination attempts in lebanon 
edde 75 is the most popular in public opinion polls but 
dahers chances appear stronger in parliament because he is backed 
by the united states as well as syria lebanons main power broker 
damascus has 40000 troops in the country 
militant christians have rejected both daher and franjieh 
charging they would allow lebanon to become a syrian satellite and 
give moslems too much power in the government

decriminalizing heroin and crack would remove 
the profit from the drug trade reduce street crime and ease the 
burden on the legal system baltimore mayor kurt l schmoke said 
thursday 
id like to see leading the war on drugs the surgeon general 
not the attorney general schmoke said at a debate sponsored by 
the new york board of trade and held before 100 business 
executives students and journalists 
schmoke whose support of decriminalization caused a stir at the 
us conference of mayors in april plans to testify sept 29 at a 
congressional hearing on the issue 
i was a prosecutor for 7 years and i know what im talking 
about schmoke said as long as we continue doing what were 
doing children are going to be lured into the drug trade and dirty 
needles are going to kill people i want to treat people with the 
disease called addiction as patients not as criminals 
you have to reallocate those resources to the public health 
system toward education treatment and prevention he added 
he also called for a national commission that would examine 
prescription and illegal drugs alcohol and cigarettes to determine 
the most effective way to regulate each 
schmoke shared the dais with georgette bennett a 
decriminalization advocate whose 1987 book crimewarps about 
future crime trends was nominated for a pulitzer prize 
opposing them were robert a stutman a special agent with the 
drug enforcement agency and the new york state director of 
substance abuse services julio a martinez who founded the 
phoenix house drug rehabilitation program 
martinez showed the audience a bottle of multicolored pills a 
container of liquid methadone and a bottle of brandy as examples of 
substances that are widely abused even though they are legal 
stutman disagreed with schmokes assertion that prohibition was 
a failure stutman noted a decline in alcoholism and cirrhosis of 
the liver during the prohibition years while schmoke said making 
alcohol illegal gave rise to organized crime and deprived the 
government of tax revenue

decades of racism and black unemployment 
made it inevitable that shreveport would see an outbreak of 
violence like this weeks rockthrowing and arson following the 
killing of a black man a civil rights leader says 
shreveports been dodging the bullet for 25 years said 
larry english of the local naacp chapter 
the violence tuesday and wednesday nights set off when a white 
woman shot a black man was confined to a few blocks in cedar 
grove a mostly residential neighborhood of modest houses and small 
businesses about six miles from downtown 
police spokeswoman cindy chadwick said no problems were reported 
in cedar grove after dozens of heavily armed special response team 
officers left the area early thursday 
police took down roadblocks that sealed off the area for about 
four hours wednesday night but chadwick said beefed up patrols 
were ready to seal off the area again if violence resumed 
the rioting was set off by the killing tuesday night of william 
david mckinney 22 a 17yearold white girl was arrested and 
officials said the shooting followed a drug deal that went bad 
with the victim an innocent bystander 
black leaders said another factor was anger over the killing of 
a black teenager by a white teenager at a restaurant last month 
and they said there was lingering frustration over the recent 
acquittal in west texas of three law officers accused in the 
beating death of a florien la black man arrested last christmas 
day on suspicion of drunk driving 
but those three incidents were only catalysts black leaders 
said 
the rev e edward jones president of the national baptist 
convention and a longtime shreveport civil rights leader blamed 
longstanding institutional racism for the trouble but he 
warned blacks against violence 
destruction is not the way we need reasoning and logic 
said jones 
the rev jesse jackson blamed the unrest on poverty and 
illiteracy 
theyve had too much access to guns and drugs and too little 
access to jobs to scholarships jackson said in baton rouge 
in that city today we must make the appeal for the haves and 
the have nots the black and the white to come together and study 
war no more jackson said 
classes at caddo parish schools near the riot area continued 
without interruption although assistant superintendent ealie 
thornton said absences would be excused if parents decided to keep 
their children home 
the school board said security would be beefed up at this 
weekends high school football games where there have been 
occasional racerelated problems over the years but board official 
david barr said the security was planned before the cedar grove 
incident because of a rash of minor stadium crimes 
tuesdays violence centered around a small grocery where the 
white shooting suspect and her companion fled after mckinney was 
shot the grocery and a neighboring liquor store were gutted by 
fire and a television news teams car was burned while hundreds of 
people rampaged breaking store windows and looting 
five arrests were reported in connection with the rioting and 
tamala vergo 17 was booked with seconddegree murder official 
police reports contain few details but individual officers city 
officials and one witness indicated mckinney was an innocent 
bystander felled after a drug deal went sour 
wednesday nights violence was on a much smaller less intense 
scale 
there were reports of sporadic gunfire and at least one fire 
but no injuries or arrests were reported as police let the 
troublemakers disperse by themselves 
residents say cedar grove once was a quiet racially mixed 
suburb that has deteriorated for a variety of reasons the area is 
now predominantly black the apparent result of white flight 
during the civil rights years 
one police officer called the small area where most of the 
violence occurred a curbservice crack store 
buddy chamness a former resident who moved away five years ago 
said people of both races have left because of crime particularly 
the drug trade 
at one time it was peaceful said chamness when i was 
young children could walk up and down the streets without fear 
our moms could walk to the store i dont know what happened to the 
neighborhood

vice president george bushs plan to spend a 
record amount on tv advertising continues a trend toward 
presidential campaign budgets dominated by paid media expenditures 
political analysts said thursday 
four years ago democratic nominee walter mondale spent more 
than 20 million on media and president reagan spent about 25 
million 
this fall vice president george bush expects to mount a 32 
millionplus tv blitz thats at least 60 percent of the combined 
54 million that the candidate and his national party can spend 
directly 
a bush aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity said 60 
percent or 324 million is a pretty accurate figure which 
would make it the largest television expenditure in modern 
history 
mark gearan a spokesman for massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
the democratic nominee said dukakis would be competitive on the 
airwaves but declined to be specific 
both candidates are relying on their parties to raise tens of 
millions of dollars in unrestricted soft money for political 
activities at the state and national levels enabling them to 
divert a greater percentage of their own limited campaign resources 
to media 
the soft money is available for partybuilding activities 
including lawn signs phone banks generic tv ads voter 
registration and getoutthevote drives such expenditures do not 
count toward the candidates overall spending ceiling 
bay buchanan reagans campaign treasurer in both 1980 and 1984 
said the reagan campaign forked over several million dollars for 
getoutthevote activities four years ago 
if you can get the party to raise it thats 3 million to 
4 million dollars youd obviously put to media time she said 
its a very effective way to be running an organization usually 
the states know better how to raise and spend the money 
the bush game plan represents the increasingly critical role 
played by tv advertising 
the very first thing i did in 1984 was take 50 percent of 
the total amount we were allocated and put it to media said 
buchanan then if any money could be picked up from other 
areas we moved that money to media thats where any loose money 
went because we felt it was the most effective way to reach 
voters 
democrats and republicans alike say they are not surprised by 
this years heavy tilt toward media spending given the increasing 
importance of tv ads and the high cost of buying air time 
particularly during widely watched events such as the olympics and 
the world series 
but they caution against treating it as a revolutionary 
development 
its not a dramatic escalation of media dollars said 
republican consultant john buckley it shouldnt be overstated 
its just incrementally more than has been spent before in real 
terms and in percentage of the overall budget

the federal election commission took a step 
thursday toward partial closing of a loophole that allows political 
parties to pour millions of soft money dollars indirectly into 
presidential election campaigns 
the independent regulatory agency is under federal court order 
to clarify its vague rules on soft money which is banned in 
federal elections but permitted in state and local contests 
the commission unanimously agreed wednesday to publish a notice 
in the federal register seeking public comment on proposed rule 
changes governing soft money 
the new rules proposals include alternative methods of 
allocating funds that benefit both federal and local election 
activities these include payment of administrative expenses and 
financing of voter registration drives 
the fec changes also could result in substantial bookkeeping 
requirements on state and local political organizations 
soft money includes union and corporate donations as well as 
individual contributions that exceed the federal limit of 1000 
per candidate 
national political parties are limited to spending 8 million 
each toward electing a presidential candidate but they accept 
millions of dollars in soft money accounts which they give to state 
and local affiliates fo dukakis courts seniors

michael dukakis struck back forcefully after 
george bushs visit to his home grounds thursday accusing his 
republican rival of being a fugitive from the truth in 
portraying himself as a crimefighter and advocate of the 
environment education and elderly 
were here today to investigate a felony assault and battery 
on the truth the democratic presidential nominee told a 
boisterous rally outside the massachusetts statehouse shortly after 
bush came to boston to pick up an endorsement from the leaders of a 
boston police union 
what george bush is doing to the truth in this campaign is a 
crime dukakis said in his harshest attack yet on bush he spoke 
to hundreds of cheering supporters and law enforcement officials 
called in from around the nation to counter bushs endorsement by 
the police group 
dukakis also spent considerable time thursday preparing for his 
sunday debate with bush meeting with new york gov mario cuomo to 
discuss strategy and also attending a morning meeting with staff at 
a boston hotel where he is scheduled to take part in a mock debate 
friday 
at the rally recalling bushs visit earlier this month to tour 
polluted boston harbor dukakis said the vice president came here 
to boston to impersonate an environmentalist he portrayed the 
reagan administration as an enemy of the clean water act and 
programs to clean up toxic waste 
thats not the only time mr bush has been a fugitive from the 
truth dukakis said ridiculing his rivals pledge to be the 
education president and saying that when bush has criticized the 
massachusetts economy hes mugged the truth every time hes 
opened his mouth 
surrounded by police officers from several massachusetts 
departments as well as by law enforcement officials from texas 
florida michigan ohio connecticut rhode island maine and two 
nationwide police associations representing more than 100000 
officers in all dukakis said of bush now hes here in boston 
impersonating a law enforcement officer 
were here to give george bush what joe friday used to ask 
for just the facts maam just the facts dukakis said invoking 
the name of the fictional character in the popular dragnet 
television series 
his administration has waged not a war on crime but a war on 
crime programs dukakis said 
he then launched a scathing attack on bushs crimefighting 
record saying drug task forces the vice president headed were 
dismal failures 
dukakis also attacked reagan administration ethical standards 
and lashed back at bushs frequent criticism of a massachusetts 
furlough program that until amended earlier this year allowed 
weekend passes to firstdegree murderers 
for the past eight years george bush has been running with a 
crowd that wouldnt know the rule of law if it hit them in the 
face dukakis said to rousing applause 
as for furloughs dukakis said the federal government furloughed 
nearly 16000 inmates last year for up to 45 days at a time among 
them hundreds and hundreds of drug pushers and drug traffickers 
and he said the suspect in the murder of a boston police officer 
was a repeat violent offender who had been paroled from federal 
prison after serving less than half of a prison term for bank 
robbery 
thats whats going on in the federal system these days my 
friends dukakis said 
dukakis had an energetic supporting cast for his rally 
including new york gov cuomo and ron delord president of the 
combined law enforcement associations of texas the largest police 
organization in bushs adopted home state 
im tired of this pandering cuomo said of the bush 
campaign im tired of the simplistics and the distortions by 
people like the vice president 
delord who gave dukakis a 10gallon hat after the rally fired 
up the crowd with an impassioned attack on bush delivered in the 
style of a preacher 
im the only damn texan in this town today representing police 
officers not george bush delord said delord said he has been 
president of the texas organization for 12 years and ive never 
seen george bush in person 
the rhetorical flogging of bush by dukakis and his supporters 
overshadowed dukakis only planned event of the day a visit to a 
boston senior citizens center to reiterate his support for social 
security while attacking bush for breaking a tie in the senate in 
1985 with his vote to deny costofliving adjustments to social 
security recipients 
when election time rolls around mr bush says he wants to be 
a great friend of older americans dukakis said maybe he 
thinks we all have amnesia dukakis also noted that bushs 
running mate indiana sen dan quayle was among the republicans 
voting to block the costofliving adjustments 
lloyd bentsen and i have a very different view dukakis said 
in touting his running mate the texas senator were going to 
stop this attack on social security and medicare and well stop it

violence in st patricks cathedral that left an 
usher and his deranged attacker dead was a special sacrilege and 
tragedy cardinal john oconnor said thursday as he resanctified 
the church and prayed for the assailant and victim alike 
it was the first time in the 109year history of the church that 
the rite to purify a profaned sacred place was performed 
the attack occurred about 8 pm wednesday an hour before the 
church would close when a man ran naked through the cathedral and 
bludgeoned parttime usher john winters 77 to death with an iron 
stanchion he also injured a worshiper and a police officer before 
being shot to death by police 
the cardinal had seen the man jorge delgado 32 at morning 
mass that day when delgado joined the line for communion 
it was clear instantly there was something seriously wrong 
oconnor said i looked up and there he is standing before me a 
very big man a very powerful looking man bizarrely dressed 
he rolled his eyes he opened and closed his eyes he rolled 
his head and the priest who was standing next to me whispered be 
careful he gets violent the cardinal said 
delgado a vagrant who was born on st patricks day in 1956 had 
pleaded guilty 11 times since 1982 to charges including assault 
attempted robbery and burglary he had been in the cathedral many 
times and had committed minor acts of vandalism there before 
many homeless people enter the church to avoid the heat or cold 
or to find a place to sleep despite the attack the archdiocese 
will not change its opendoor policy oconnor said i would hate 
to see us now get defensive 
oconnor was not in the cathedral when delgado naked and 
carrying red carnations and his sneakers came into the church 
wednesday night delgado had stripped off his dirty shorts and 
shirt minutes before in front of the rca building at rockefeller 
plaza a block away from the fifth avenue cathedral 
when he first entered the church delgado hit a man sitting in a 
back pew with the flowers and screamed get out get out said 
chief of detectives robert colangelo 
he continued walking up the center aisle of the church to the 
pew in which linda lawson 39 was praying and repeatedly struck 
her in the face colangelo said 
the 6foot4 250pound delgado then went to the altar of the 
shrine of st elizabeth and pulled from the marble floor a bolted 
wroughtiron stanchion that held a prayer plaque 
officer james mcmann 50 who is assigned to the cathedral 
spotted delgado and ordered him to put down the weapon as delgado 
advanced on mcmann the officer radioed for help 
delgado attacked the officer striking him in the head he then 
went to the main altar where he found winters and struck him 
seven or eight times in the head killing him istantly colangelo 
said 
by then three other officers arrived and repeatedly ordered 
delgado to stop when delgado started to lunge toward one the 
officer fired once fatally striking delgado in the chest the 
chief said 
the entire incident was over in 10 minutes 
ms lawson was treated for facial injuries at the scene and 
mcmann was in stable condition thursday at bellevue hospital 
before performing the resanctification rite oconnor spoke 
about delgado saying he believed the attacker didnt have the 
slightest idea what he was doing 
for it to have happened here is a special sacrilege and 
tragedy oconnor said adding that st patricks was a magnet 
for catholics everywhere 
while the cathedral has been desecrated while this 
magnificent temple of almighty god famous throughout the world 
has been violated we must not forget that two men were killed here 
last night oconnor told several hundred people attending the 
first mass of the day 
it is for their souls i will be offering this mass as well as 
for the purification of the cathedral

calling the garbage disposal problem on top 
of us the environmental protection agency unveiled ambitious 
draft plans thursday to persuade americans to recycle a quarter of 
their garbage in four years 
that would be 2 times the proportion recycled today in a 
society that puts a premium on convenience and saving time and 
energy americans generate 35 pounds of garbage and trash each day 
for every man woman and child 
places to put it are rapidly disappearing as shown by the saga 
of the garbage barge from islip ny last year that couldnt 
unload 
recylcing and the companion strategy of generating less garbage 
in the first place source reduction enjoyed a vogue in the 
early 1970s but lost steam in most places 
for example reynolds metals co claims to recycle more than 100 
percent of its aluminum beverage cans because it accepts cans made 
by others its much cheaper to buy an old can and melt it down for 
new aluminum than to refine aluminum ore 
j winston porter the agencys assistant administrator for 
solid waste said soaring costs of landfilling will bring recycling 
back 
not only does it feel good there are stark economic realities 
out there to push recycling porter told a briefing for reporters 
on the draft strategy put together by a special epa task force 
convened in february 
in the 1970s when people got energetic about recycling they 
quickly hit the hard economic realities landfilling was available 
for 2 a ton now its 50 or 100 porter said 
though las vegas nev has plenty of land nearby and pays 6 a 
ton for landfilling east lyme conn recently paid 100 a ton 
the agency said 
from 18000 in the 1970s and 9000 in 1984 the number of 
landfills has shrunk to about 6000 and the agency believes a third 
of those will close in the next five years 
todays landfills handle 80 percent of 160 million tons of 
garbage and trash a year the rest is equally split between 
recycling and incineration 
the load is growing mostly because of paperwastepaper has 
risen about 50 percent since 1960 to about 65 million tons a year 
paper for takeout dinners paper for diapers paper for computer 
outputs paper for hospital gowns 
twenty percent of that is recycled now that could be roughly 
doubled said porter 
about 1 percent of plastics is recycled we could get to 8 or 
10 percent without much trouble 
the agency hopes to see recycling and reduced generation at 25 
percent and incineration at 20 percent in 1992 leaving 55 percent 
to be landfilled 
ten states already require recycling in some form or other and 
600 communities do it 
these programs frequently require householders to separate 
metals plastics glass paper leftover food and yard waste before 
collection 
the agency has given a 250000 grant to the environmental 
defense fund for an advertising campaign in cooperation with the 
advertising council to promote recycling 
asked about the usefulness of mandatory refundable deposits on 
purchases of soft drinks as some states require porter said he 
would be reluctant to prescribe for every state but i have seen 
some good successes generally im personally in favor of that 
whats going to be needed is an executive order by the 
president probably the next president directing federal agencies 
to purchase recycled goods porter said that would jumpstart 
a lot of things 
an environmentalist was skeptical 
it appears to me to be more of an exercise in public 
relations said henry cole of the clean water action project 
we think new incinerators should not be permitted until a 
community has met recycling goals which should be set at about 
50 percent of the waste stream cole said

a congressional candidate being sued by twa for 
allegedly distributing posters accusing the airline of spreading 
aids may be disavowed by his party the state democratic chairman 
said thursday 
he was a realtor an educator and seemed like a nice guy 
state party chairman buie seawell said of john j mitchell 53 of 
colorado springs 
mitchell was nominated without opposition in the heavily 
republican 5th district to run against freshman rep joel hefley 
the gop candidate the district encompasses the colorado springs 
area south of denver and it never has sent a democrat to congress 
seawell compared mitchell to a walkon candidate and said 
the party nominated him with the best of intentions 
but we were not toughminded enough almost nobody is under 
these circumstances and weve got to begin to get that way he 
said 
neither democratic party officials nor reporters have been able 
to reach mitchell for comment by telephone or in person since his 
name surfaced in the lawsuit filed monday by twa 
the denver federal court suit accuses mitchell of libeling the 
airline and seeks 500000 damages 
seawell said the 5th district central committee will meet oct 2 
to consider the mitchell case the state centays read 
aids is spread through twa todays twa means aids and twa 
travel with aids 
twa claims mitchell sent a poster to the airlines new york 
office on july 26 with a note that said thousands of these have 
been sent around the country our staff is working on a new poster 
they will continue to be sent until twa corrects the hurt you have 
causedcost me 
if mitchell does not remove himself as a candidate the party 
may move to disavow itself from mitchell said seawell 
the democratic party does not in any way endorse or condone 
alleged statements made by mr mitchell regarding trans world 
airlines he said 
seawell said it may take a court action to actually remove 
mitchells name from the ballot we will do everything necessary 
to provide a fair hearing before any action is taken by the 5th 
district the chairman or the central committee he added 
mitchell who has no previous political experience has operated 
j mitchell realty in colorado springs since 1984 according to his 
resume he was a teacher in massachusetts from 1962 to 1981 before 
moving to colorado he once served as a waiter in the air force 
academy dining hall before receiving his real estate license

its not as cheap as a string 
around the finger but a new gadget for the forgetful gives a 
gentle nudge at the waistline as a reminder of whatever it is the 
wearer wants to be reminded 
a psychologist invented the vibrating gadget named the 
motivaider 
the invention is based on what psychologist steve levinson of 
thief river falls says is obvious that the human brain does a 
poor job of making sure its owner does all the things that a person 
has firmly resolved to do 
the gadget he calls an intention arousing device is about 2 
inches square and hangs like a beeper from the users belt 
set for intervals of one minute to 24 hours it flutters 
silently against the waistline 
the wearer has programmed in his or her memory what the reminder 
means says levinson 
ros fairbank who lost to martina navratilova in the wimbledon 
quarterfinals this year told the star tribune of minneapolis that 
it helped improve her backhand her problem was failing to get her 
racquet back early enough and to hit over the ball she said in 
a phone interview 
she set the motivaider at threeminute intervals and wore it 
during practice when it vibrated she said to herself early 
preparation and thats what she focused on 
i wouldnt say it made me win a match she said but it 
developed my backhand and my confidence in my backhand 
bill priedeman a deephaven sales manager says he improved his 
golf game when the 7995 batteryoperated device fluttered at 
threeminute intervals he told himself keep your head down slow 
on the backswing and stop before you come down again the result

they came up on the short end of last weeks contest held in 
brunswick county va

woodside 
the virginia county accepted the challenge but was unable to 
attend last years cookoff in georgia he said 
they even went so far as to approach their commonwealth to get 
a resolution claiming they had the original brunswick stew 
woodside said so in the spirit of competition the brunswick 
legislative delegation approached the georgia general assembly and 
received a similar resolution 
chef dan dickerson said virginias version of brunswick stew

bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
says former us attorney robert merkle knowingly used false 
testimony in a criminal probe involving allegations that pindling 
had accepted bribes from drug traffickers 
justice department spokesman loye miller declined comment 
thursday on pindlings accusations contained in a letter the 
bahamian government said was delivered to us attorney general 
dick thornburgh it calls for appointment of a special prosecutor 
to investigate merkle the former us attorney in tampa fla for 
prosecutorial misconduct 
a threepage statement describing the letter was made available 
to the news media by the bahamian embassy in washington 
the letter by an attorney for pindling ira dement says merkle 
used perjured evidence knowing it to be false or not caring 
whether it was true or untrue seeming for political gain merkle 
was defeated in a florida primary election earlier this month in a 
bid for a us senate seat 
convicted drug smuggler george william baron testified under 
questioning by merkle earlier this year at the trial of colombian 
drug dealer carlos lehder that in 1980 he paid pindling 400000 
in cash in a paradise island casino in the presence of lady 
pindling tourism minister clement maynard mrs maynard and many 
others merkle opened a grand jury probe of pindling 
dement said testimony by baron and gorman bannister alleging 
official complicity in drug smuggling was easily refutable but 
that merkle made no effort to check out their stories in may 1988 
merkle was advised by pindlings personal attorney f lee bailey 
that bannister and baron were lying said dement 
bailey offered merkle the full cooperation of the prime 
minister said dement who added that bailey is prepared to testify 
that merkle promised an expeditious conclusion of his probe 
merkle used barons groundless recitation again only a month 
later in the trial of robert castoro without making an effort to 
verify his testimony said dement 
the statement made available to the news media said dement sent 
thornburgh documentation showing that the pindlings were in africa 
when the payoff allegedly was made dement said the prime minister 
and deputy prime minister clement maynard have indicated they are 
willing to cooperate in an investigation of the allegations of 
banister and baron and the lack of effort by merkle to review the 
evidence of that falsity 
in an interview in thursday editions of the new york times 
merkle was quoted as saying that sir lynden is full of hot air 
and that his investigation was handled in accord with justice 
department rules

a house committee on thursday approved a 
550000 budget increase for the ethics committee to cover mounting 
costs of an investigation into allegations of financial 
improprieties by house speaker jim wright 
the chairman of the ethics panel rep julian dixon dcalif 
said the outside counsel hired to conduct the investigation has 
been costing 150000 a month and by the end of this month would 
exhaust the 300000 earlier earmarked for the probe 
its taking a lot of time said rep john t myers rind 
the senior minority member of the ethics committee formally known 
as the committee on standards of official conduct it takes a lot 
more indepth investigation than we ever anticipated 
but he added we have a commitment to the congress to be 
thorough this is necessary i dont think we have any choice 
the counsel chicago attorney richard j phelan has assigned 
six or seven attorneys to work on the case which involves 
allegations that wright dtexas abused his congressional office 
for personal gain and improperly intervened with federal regulators 
on behalf of constituents 
the attorneys together are spending an average of 1200 to 1300 
hours monthly on the probe dixon said 
dixon told the committee on house administration the chambers 
housekeeping panel that the 550000 funding boost would enable 
the probe to extend through the end of the year if needed it also 
is possible the investigation could extend into 1989 dixon said 
wright who appeared before the panel for more than five hours 
last week to present his defense has said repeatedly that he wants 
the investigation completed before congress adjourns for the year 
in midoctober 
dixon declined to comment on why the probe was taking longer 
than expected 
on a separate matter relating to the speaker dixon told 
reporters that a new request from the house republican leadership 
for an ethics probe of wright concerning his disclosure of a 
purported cia covert action in nicaragua would be dealt with 
separately from the current probe 
that would be done independent of this he said i think 
it would be done in a whole different manner perhaps with the 
cooperation of the intelligence committee he added

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle said thursday that perestroika in the soviet union has yet 
to live up to its promise and he cautioned against making 
unilateral concessions to the soviets at the arms table 
the indiana senator wrapped up a fourday swing across the west 
with what aides billed as a major foreign policy address and he 
used a teleprompter for the first time since his convention 
acceptance speech 
in a foreign policy speech earlier this month in chicago quayle 
discarded his text and gave a rambling discursive address 
addressing 1300 people at a los angeles world affairs council 
luncheon quayle made no mention of michael dukakis the democratic 
presidential candidate but he criticized several dukakis foreign 
policy and defense stances 
quayle said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev recognizes that 
without major changes the soviet union could well enter the next 
century like a third world nation 
of perestroika or restructuring he said like the book of 
the same name actual content has so far not lived up to the 
advance press notices 
americans should judge the soviets actions by whether they pull 
back from global pot stirring in afghanistan angola 
nicaragua and other places he said 
he called the soviet radar station at krasnoyarsk a blatant 
violation of the abm treaty and it should be dismantled 
immediately not turned into an international space tracking 
station as gorbachev recently suggested 
he also urged the soviets to demonstrate their seriousness on 
arms control by reducing their longrange ss18 missiles and their 
new mobile ss24s and ss25s 
and gorbachev should show his good faih by renouncing the 
brezhnev doctrine unequivocally and agreeing to a pullback of 
soviet troops from eastern europe he said because of the current 
imbalance of soviet and nato forces the soviets must pull back 
more troops quayle said 
he also called for the soviets to allow freedom to emigrate 
for jews and refuseniks and anyone else 
one does not deal with the soviet union by unilaterally 
removing negotiating leverage before the negotiations even begin 
he said in what appeared to be a reference to dukakis opposition 
to the mobile mx and midgetman missiles 
turning to star wars he said the proposed spacebased missile 
defense system is not a fantasy or a fraud or a gizmo as 
some have called it 
it is the margin of survival for american citizens if a 
nuclear missile whether by design or accident is ever launched 
against our land he said 
he urged a return to bipartisanship in foreign policy saying 
congress serves the nation best when it allows the president 
maximum freedom in foreign policy decisionmaking 
quayle who says the war powers act should be curtailed or 
drastically rewritten said cited nicaragua as an example of a 
confused foreign policy congress has no business drawing silly 
distinctions between lethal and nonlethal aid to a guerrilla 
army 
quayle fielded 13 questions from the audience strongly 
defending contra aid with a declaration that the monroe doctrine 
is alive and well in america 
there is something in this country that is called the monroe 
doctrine that says foreign powers coming into our hemisphere 
is against the national interest of this country quayle said 
quayle said he voted for sanctions against south africa to 
send a message that we must begin to work and to see what a 
postapartheid government will look like but he said he does not 
support additional sanctions now 
meanwhile in washington quayles campaign said that sen bob 
packwood rore will play sen lloyd bentsen as quayle prepares 
for the oct 5 debate with his democratic counterpart 
packwood preceded bentsen as chairman of the senate finance 
committee serves on the panel with bentsen and is considered a top 
debater in the senate

the federal aviation administration on 
thursday ordered airlines to equip all their aircraft with devices 
that will help pilots detect and escape from deadly wind shears 
powerful shears called microbursts have been called the no 1 
killer of airline passengers and have been responsible for at least 
five fatal airline crashes and 500 deaths in the last decade 
according to aviation safety experts 
the faa regulation was announced by the transportation 
department which said the devices to be phased into operation in 
all aircraft of 30 or more seats over the next four years will 
cost 40000 to 50000 per airplane 
about 3600 commercial jet transport planes also will be 
required to have the devices department officials said 
a microburst is a powerful downburst of air caused by a sudden 
change in wind direction such a downburst struck a delta air lines 
l1011 as it was attempting to land at dallasfort worth in 1985 
and literally forced the plane into the ground killing 134 people 
the accident focused increased attention on developing and 
installing sophisticated ground radar that would provide advanced 
warning of shears along departure and approach lanes but the radar 
is not expected to be available until the early 1990s 
at the same time the faa and industry began taking a closer 
look at devices for the cockpit that would provide pilots with a 
clear indication when their plane is facing wind shear conditions 
piedmont airlines two years ago began installing the equipment 
being required by the faa and today has the devices in 112 of its 
191 aircraft according to piedmont spokesman mike clark 
it could not immediately be determined whether other airlines 
have bought similar equipment 
under the faa regulation the airlines will be allowed to phase 
in installation of the equipment over about four years half of an 
airlines fleet must have the devices within 27 months 
threefourths of the fleet within 39 months and the rest of the 
fleet within 51 months 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the equipment will 
enhance safety by giving pilots a valuable tool for coping with the 
dangerous wind shear phenomenon 
experience has shown that pilots can recover successfully from 
wind shear encounters if they can recognize the situation quickly 
enough and have sufficient information to execute escape 
maneuvers burnley said in a statement 
but the aviation industry has been divided on the value of the 
cockpit devices some experts note that the equipment is not a 
radar that would give advance warning of a shear 
instead the system consists of sensitive equipment that 
calculates airspeed and other factors and tells a pilot when the 
plane is in the midst of wind shear conditions critics of the 
equipment have suggested that by then it may already be too late to 
fly through a microburst especially if the plane is close to the 
ground as in a takeoff or landing 
the faa rule also requires airlines to provide pilots with 
increased training on wind shear recognition and recovery 
procedures while using the new equipment 
pilots are divided as to how best to fly through a shear many 
insist that a powerful microburst such as the one that struck the 
delta plane in dallas or the one encountered by a pan american 
world airways jetliner that crashed as it was taking off from new 
orleans in 1982 is virtually impossible to escape the pan am crash 
left 154 people dead 
the airlines as well as the pilots union have urged speedy 
development and installation of socalled doppler radar at major 
airports so that shears can be detected in advance and pilots can 
maneuver around them or not depart the first of 17 such doppler 
radars are scheduled to be installed at airports between 1990 and 
1992 about 30 additional radars would be installed at other 
airports later under an faa contract scheduled to be awarded later 
this year 
the faa and the national aeronautics and space administration 
also have under way a fiveyear research program aimed at 
eventually developing a more advanced wind shear detection device 
for the cockpit that would be able to warn a pilot in advance when 
it is about to encounter shear conditions

brushing aside reagan administration 
objections the house foreign affairs committee approved on 
thursday legislation imposing sanctions on iraq for its alleged use 
of poison gas against kurdish insurgents and unarmed kurdish 
civilians 
the committee acted after senior republican members told 
administration officials that there is strong bipartisan support 
for the measure in the house and urged them to reconsider their 
opposition 
one official peter burley deputy assistant secretary of state 
for middle eastern affairs told the panel the reagan 
administration believes the sanctions legislation is premature 
and counterproductive because it is likely to undercut intense 
diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing the future use of chemical 
weapons by iraq 
i am very disappointed in the statement that you read said 
rep william s broomfield rmich the panels senior gop member 
a lot of effort has gone into making this a bipartisan effort i 
think this is a very measured response and i think the 
administration will see when it hits the floor the large bipartisan 
support it will have 
unlike sanctions legislation approved earlier by the senate the 
house resolution does not accuse iraq of waging a war of genocide 
against the countrys kurdish minority and the sanctions it would 
impose at least initially are generally less severe 
the resolution declares that the iraqi army has destroyed 
kurdish villages in northern iraq and adds substantial evidence 
exists that the iraqi army has been using chemical weapons against 
kurdish insurgents and unarmed kurdish civilians 
it calls that a gross violation of international law 
in a series of initial steps the resolution would prohibit 
governmenttogovernment or commercial arms sales to iraq as well 
as sensitive high technology items 
it authorizes the president after consultation with congress 
to take a series of other punitive actions against iraq including 
barring iraqi exports including petroleum products from entering 
the united states barring or restricting us exports to iraq 
denying us financial credits or financial guarantees and opposing 
loans to iraq by international financial institutions 
the resolution authorizes the president to waive any or all of 
the sanctions if he certifies to congress that iraq is not using 
chemical weapons in violation of international law that iraq has 
provided reliable assurances that it will not use chemical 
weapons in the future and that it is willing to permit onsite 
inspection by impartial observers 
the committee approved the measure on a voice vote after acting 
to include a prohibition against the export to iraq of any chemical 
that might be used to produce chemical weapons and to authorize the 
president to bar the sale of an entire steel plant in texas to iraq 
the house committees action follows the issuance on wednesday 
of a senate staff report based on interviews with more than 200 of 
the 65000 kurdish refugees who fled into turkey following the 
alleged poison gas attacks on their villages by iraqi aircraft 
the report concludes that overwhelming evidence exists that 
iraq used chemical weapons against the kurds and that hundreds 
perhaps thousands of people likely were killed 
the only committee member to oppose the house resolution was 
rep toby roth rwis who said that while the use of poison gas 
is despicable sanctions against iraq will only hurt us 
exporters 
but rep james bilbray dnev said that to do nothing is 
unacceptable 
if we dont do something we are going to have tell our own 
children and grandchildren that we sat by while an entire people 
was exterminated he said 
burley said the state department is encouraged by a recent 
statement by the foreign minister of iraq which he said us 
diplomats interpret as meaning that there will be no future use 
of chemical weapons 
rep tom lantos dcalif told burley i am intrigued by your 
logic which looks at a criminal act sweeps it aside and takes the 
word of a criminal that he will not take criminal actions in the 
future 
burley replied we believe enacting these sanctions now will 
lessen our influence we do not believe that sanctions now would 
bring us closer to the objective we both share ending the use of 
chemical weapons by iraq

a federal judge thursday granted a defense 
request for a hearing on whether irancontra prosecutors could 
reindict former cia agent joseph f fernandez in virginia if 
charges filed here were dismissed 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr scheduled an oct 6 
hearing on a motion by independent counsel lawrence e walsh to 
dismiss five criminal charges against fernandez so that prosecutors 
could seek a new indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby 
alexandria va 
lawyers for fernandez who is charged with helping direct a 
secret arms supply network for the nicaraguan rebels in defiance of 
a congressional ban on such aid urged the judge to dismiss the 
case altogether rather than give prosecutors a chance to bring 
fresh charges 
the dispute stems from fernandezs refusal to waive his right to 
be tried in the eastern district of virginia on charges that he 
lied about his role in the armssupply network to his cia superiors 
and to the presidential commission headed by former sen john 
tower rtexas that investigated the irancontra affair 
four counts of the indictment alleging fernandez obstructed the 
commissions work and made false statements charge the alleged 
offenses occurred at cia headquarters in langley va 
the conspiracy charge which is the fifth count of the 
indictment alleges that fernandez former national security 
council aide oliver north and arms dealer richard v secord 
operated an illegal arms supply network part of the conspiracy 
occurred in washington according to the indictment 
last week fernandez moved to dismiss the four other charges 
because the federal court in washington lacked jurisdiction over 
them 
rather than face the prospect of two trials walsh asked 
robinson for permission to dismiss all five charges against 
fernandez so that he could seek a new indictment from a federal 
grand jury in alexandria 
defense attorney thomas e wilson argued in court papers earlier 
this week that prosecutors should not be allowed to bring the case 
in virginia because they already have been given a preview of 
fernandezs defense in motions filed before robinson

seven days before the us hopes to return to 
manned space flight president reagan lauded the seven heroes 
of the challenger on thursday and pledged you can delay our long 
trek to greatness but you cannot halt it 
returning to the scene of one of his most emotional times as 
president reagan told workers at the johnson space center 
soon the world will be watching as five brave americans lift 
off from earth america is going to space again and we are going 
there to stay 
three days after the challenger blew apart on jan 28 1986 
little more than a minute after liftoff reagan went to the johnson 
space center to console the relatives and friends of the seven crew 
members who died 
americas worst space tragedy shook the nation and threw the 
space program into disarray 
in a speech to nasa employees a week before discoverys 
blastoff reagan said our early settlers knew great risks and 
made great sacrifices but with their sacrifices they moved the 
frontier forward and built a great nation 
neither can we stand still nor be content and we are not 
afraid reagan said ill fortune can slow us down but it 
cannot stop us 
upon his arrival in houston reagan was asked if he wanted to go 
up in space ive been there for several years the president 
chuckled as he climbed into his limousine 
at the sprawling space center reagan greeted the five discovery 
crewmen commander frederick hauck copilot richard covey and 
mission specialists john lounge george pinky nelson and david 
hilmers 
the president was treated to a brief tour of a mockup of a space 
shuttle the crew clad in royal blue jumpsuits led reagan up the 
stairs to peer through an open hatch in the twostoryhigh mockup 
of the shuttle 
reagan queried after his brief tour whether he wished he 
committed more money to the space program replied ive tried to 
do all thats possible weve had some problems he added 
apparently referring to the challenger tragedy 
this program is the highest priority reagan said 
the president then walked toward the end of the mock shuttle 
where he addressed 8000 to 10000 nasa employees contractors and 
their families many of whom waved tiny american flags under the 
bright texas sun and roared their approval during reagans speech 
at the end of his speech hauck presented reagan with a royal 
blue jacket and told him that the insignia patch from the discovery 
mission would be flown into space with the shuttle crew and 
returned and presented to reagan at the end of the mission 
before meeting the astronauts who are under a modified 
quarantine before their scheduled launch reagan underwent a 
medical examination in which he was pronounced free of any disease 
that could be easily transmitted 
reagans senior aides and secret service detail were required to 
complete medical data forms before they were cleared to enter the 
space center with the president only reagan was to have direct 
contact with the astronauts 
next thursday the shuttle is scheduled to blast off from cape 
canaveral fla on a fourday stay in orbit a mission that will 
include the launching of a 100 million communications satellite 
the flight will be the first in 32 months a wrenching period 
in which nasa underwent a series of management and other changes 
including a redesign of the shuttle boosters emanating from a 
presidential commissions findings resulting from the accident 
the tragedy was a monumental setback to the space program which 
was the first to put a man on the moon and which had led the world 
in exploration after initially playing catchup with the soviet 
union in the late 1960s 
reagans spacecenter stop came on a day in which the president 
was making campaign appearances in texas for republican 
presidential candidate george bush and rep beau boulter rtexas 
who is trying to wrest sen lloyd bentsens seat from him bentsen 
is running for both the senate and the vice presidency under a 
texas law that permits such a dual candidacy 
the president was wrapping up his campaign day by sharing the 
stage with bush at a 1000aplate fundraising dinner for some 
2500 republicans 
in the johnson space center pep talk reagan said that when we 
launch the space shuttle discovery even more than the thrust of 
discoverys great engines it will be the inspiring courage of our 
heroes and the hopes and dreams of every american that will lift 
the shuttle into the heavens and may the hand of god bring it 
safely back to earth 
and when the discovery takes off seven precious souls will 
soar beside it the seven heroes of the challenger he added 
with their lives they moved a nation they summoned america to 
reach higher still as they wrote mans destiny into the stars 
reagan recalled how he had joined americans in mourning the loss 
of the challenger crew members one cold january day in 1986 
and said 
we are a nation born of pioneers and we will always create 
our future on the frontier america can live no other way

two house committees approved legislation 
thursday that grants banks broad new powers to affiliate through 
holding companies with securities firms 
the house energy and commerce and judiciary committees racing a 
deadline approved amendments to a bill passed by the house banking 
committee last month the senate also has completed work on a 
separate measure 
the energy and commerce committee under chairman john d 
dingell dmich hastily approved amendments drafted by the panel 
late wednesday night and early thursday morning 
one amendment which was being reproduced for members arrived 
at the committee at 1155 am and was approved at 1201 pm 
nevertheless dingell said in a statement after 23 committee 
members voted to send the measure to the floor with only rep 
ralph m hall dtex asking that he be recorded against the bill 
the committee today restored balance and equity to the 
restructuring of the financial services industry 
the real winners today were the nations depositors investors 
and taxpayers he said if everyone with an interest in this 
legislation both inside and outside the congress can come 
together in a spirit of harmony and compromise it will be possible 
to work out a bill 
treasury undersecretary george d gould issued a statement 
expressing strong opposition to the energy and commerce 
committees action 
it demonstrates that the house of representatives is not 
prepared to move forward into the modern financial world and 
is retreating into a protectionist anticompetitive regime left 
over from the 1930s he said 
the administration favors the banksecurities bill passed by the 
senate because it permits banks to enter into a greater number of 
securities activities 
donald g ogilvie executive vice president of the american 
bankers association said however his organization is extremely 
disappointed by the action taken by the dingell committee 
at a time when positive legislation is badly needed to 
modernize the banking laws so bankers can fully meet their 
customers needs the committees action removes the only positive 
feature contained in the house bill new securities authorities 
he said their action also makes the limited bank insurance 
authorities even more restrictive if passed the bill would be a 
dramatic step backwards for american consumers and us banking 
the judiciary committee also approved the measure after removing 
mandatory prison sentences for individuals who breach the socalled 
firewalls constructed between banking and securities functions 
an amendment introduced by rep william j hughes dnj 
the full house is expected to take up the measure next week 
in his opening statement dingell said any relaxation of the 
depressionera glasssteagall act designed to preclude virtually 
all securities activities by banks and their affiliates must 
carry with it the creation of strong firewalls functional 
regulation and effective prohibitions against conflicts of 
interest in order to repeat the abuses which necessitated the 
creation of the glasssteagall wall he said he believes his 
amendments do that 
among other things the amendments would 
prohibit loans between banks and their securities affiliates to 
prop up a failing affiliate or purchase securities underwritten by 
the affiliate 
strictly limit transfer of confidential customer information 
between banks and securities affiliates 
prohibit illegal tieins so that all dealings are armslength 
prohibit a bank from stuffing its trust department accounts 
with unsound securities underwritten by its securities affiliate 
prohibit shared name premises log and advertising 
prohibit shared officers directors and employees with 
rulemaking authority to make exceptions for smaller banks

the government expects to sell about 2500 
singlefamily homes within the next couple of days following a 
federal judges decision lifting a threeweek ban on such sales 
federal housing officials said thursday 
more than 27000 homes owned by hud went back on the market 
thursday morning after us district judge oliver gasch refused to 
issue a preliminary injunction in a suit by homeless advocates who 
say more of the governmentowned houses should be made available to 
people living in the streets 
government lawyers argued that stopping the sales would bankrupt 
the federal housing administrations home mortgage insurance fund 
all of the houses were obtained after buyers defaulted on 
fhabacked loans 
hud had more than 47000 such houses when gasch issued a 
temporary restraining order aug 30 but about 20000 of them were 
not affected because contracts already had been signed for their 
sale 
jim nistler hud deputy assistant secretary said field offices 
around the country to expect about 2500 sales contracts to be 
signed right away for the houses that were off the market since 
gasch issued the order in a suit by the national housing law 
project 
project lawyer florence roisman said thursday that homeless 
advocates were deeply disappointed with the oons 
resources 
ruder also said it would be difficult to determine who was 
responsible for deficiencies in the bonds disclosure reports 
he noted too that bondholders were already trying to recover 
their investments through a civil trial in tucson ariz 
in a 376page report that brought to a close what had been 
described as the largest single investigation in sec history the 
commissions staff found that wppss tried to put the best spin 
possible on the construction and financial problems that led up to 
the default in 1983 and in some cases avoided disclosure of 
negative developments 
others including the bond underwriters bond counsel and the 
rating agencies werent agressive enough in asking questions and 
exercising due diligence to ensure that investors were aware of 
the supply systems mounting problems the report said 
the report however drew no legal conclusions 
while taking no enforcement action the commission decided to 
seek public comment on a proposed rule that would impose stricter 
disclosure requirements on issuers of municipal bonds and the 
securities firms that sell them 
the secs decision drew criticism from some members of congress 
it sends a message that if you mess up mess up big because 
the principal regulatory agency doesnt have the resources to 
pursue enforcement action said rep ron wyden dore 
wyden said the report dances around the key issues and he 
would ask rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee to hold a hearing on the secs decision to 
drop the wppss case 
dingell who had previously said it would be a outrage if 
the sec failed to act against those responsible for the default 
said in a statement that his committee would look at the secs 
decision at the earliest possible time 
the decision to terminate the secs wppss investigation 
without enforcement is not well received by the wppss bondholders 
or by me dingell said 
the report concluded that the default resulted from extensive 
cost overruns and construction delays at wppss project no 4 at the 
hanford nuclear reservation in southeastern washington state and 
no 5 at satsop west of olympia wash 
cost of the projects had soared from an initial estimate of 
slightly over 2 billion to almost 12 billion before construction 
was halted in 1981 
both projects were abandoned in january 1982 and in 1983 wppss 
quit making payments on the bonds after the washington state 
supreme court held that the utilities contracts with the 
consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable without payments 
from the 88 participating utilities many in other states wppss 
defaulted 
as early as 1978 the report said wppss recognized it could face 
longterm financing problems 
top supply system officials told the 88 utilities participating 
in the projects in late 1980 that wppss cash flow coverage was 
so low that there was almost none at times the report said 
they warned that the projects might be terminated as a result of 
the cash flow situation 
the report said the participants also in late 1980 asked the 
supply system to study the possibility of slowing down construction 
or terminating the two projects 
the request was kept confidential because of its possible impact 
on the financial markets and wppss continued to sell bonds more 
than 400 million worth before the projects were eventually 
scrubbed the report said 
the report found that wppss also failed to adquately disclose in 
the official bond statements that forecasts showed a drop in the 
demand for electricity in the northwest

smalltown youths awed by easy money were used to 
build a major bigcity drug empire in what a federal prosecutor 
thursday called a tale of two cities rural marianna ark 
and cocaineinfested detroit 
cocaine processed in cookup houses by 14yearold girls 
into crack its smokeable form was sold by boys many under 16 in 
crack houses run by the chambers ring which once accounted for 
half of detroits crack trade prosecutors charge 
four chambers brothers billy joe larry marlowe otis bernard 
and willie lee and 10 other people are on trial on federal 
charges including cocaine conspiracy firearms and tax evasion 
counts 
us attorney roy hayes said in opening arguments that billy joe 
and larry chambers came from marianna in 1982 and built their 
empire on three secrets of success recruiting organization and 
discipline 
hayes first witness former organization member patricia 
middleton backed his descriptions of an expanding network of 
trusted lieutenants and child drug dealers kept in line by a 
noholdsbarred wrecking crew or beatup crew 
fourteen defendants their attorneys prosecutors and reporters 
outnumbered spectators in a small federal courtroom for the opening 
day of an expected sixweek trial jury selection took four days 
people passed through a metal detector to enter and us 
marshals sat at both ends of the hallway in detroits federal 
building 
william coonce agent in charge of the us drug enforcement 
administrations detroit office had pledged tight security to 
avoid any possible reprisals against more than 50 government 
witnesses 
fortyone cars including mercedesbenz cadillac and jeep 
models 250 weapons 500000 in cash and 500000 in jewelry were 
seized in serving 107 search warrants that led to federal 
indictments coonce said earlier 
authorities described a drug ring that had as many as 400 
employees operated up to 300 crack houses and at its peak in 
1987 sold up to 3 million worth of cocaine a day 
that ended with the indictments of 22 people in march four 
entered guilty pleas earlier and four remain fugitives 
defense attorneys in their opening arguments attacked hayes 
case and tale of two cities analogy saying he is relying on 
shaky witnesses many of whom are testifying to avoid prosecution 
for their own offenses 
david harris attorney for defendant morris hampton told jurors 
that by the time the trial is finished you will be reading a 
different book much ado about nothing 
middleton who was to take the stand again friday said she made 
money pickups for the organization for about six months under 
threats from larry chambers that the man she lived with would be 
hurt 
she said she saw crack cocaine made and sold saw organization 
members get paid up to 800 a week and saw people beaten who 
crossed the chambers brothers i got pulled into it thats not 
me said middleton who finally went to police and who testified 
in return for immunity from prosecution 
she pointed out eric lamar wilkins in the courtroom identifying 
him as a wrecking crew member she knew as fats she said she 
once saw him carry a body out of an apartment building where the 
organization sold crack and put it in a garbage bin in a field 
across the street

a new survey released thursday indicates that as 
many as 700000 young american men may have at least 10 sex 
partners a year putting them at considerable risk of sexually 
transmitted diseases including aids 
the national centers for disease control reported that a survey 
of us sexual habits shows that most americans appear to be at 
relatively low risk of infection with the virus that causes aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
however a sizeable percentage of young nevermarried men 
report more than 10 partners in the past 12 months including 5 
percent of those 1829 
the survey interviewed 1481 people asking them to write 
privately and submit anonymously their answers to four questions 
about their sexual habits 
three percent of the men interviewed reported five to 10 sex 
partners in the previous year one in 100 reported more than 10 
including 3 percent of the men between 18 and 29 1 percent of the 
men 3044 and 2 percent of the men 4560 
this is something that concerns us said dr william darrow 
a cdc aids specialist youre talking about millions of people 
and we dont know whether theyre taking other kinds of 
precautions such as discussing aids testing with partners and 
using condoms 
applied to the us population the survey indicates more than 
700000 single men aged 1829 and more than 100000 aged 3044 may 
have 10 or more partners a year leaving them at considerable 
risk of aids the cdc said 
aids is spread chiefly through sexual contact or the sharing of 
drug needles persons with multiple sex partners are considered at 
increased risk for the deadly disease more than 70000 us cases 
have been reported and federal health officials believe as many as 
15 million americans are infected with the virus that can cause 
aids 
overall 22 percent of the respondents said they had had no sex 
partners in the previous year and 60 percent reported only one 
partner eleven percent said two to four 2 percent said five or 
more and 6 percent did not answer the question 
at least 80 percent seem to be at relatively low risk of 
infection from sex darrow said 
people also were asked about the status of their sex partners 
their gender and whether they were spouses friends pickups or 
prostitutes 
six percent of the men and 1 percent of the women surveyed said 
at least one of their sex partners in the previous year was a 
casual date or pickup well below 1 percent reported paying 
for sex 
of the men reporting sex in the previous year 3 percent said 
their partners included males and another 6 percent didnt answer 
the question homosexual men make up the largest group of aids 
patients in the united states 
cdc researchers really didnt know what to expect from the 
survey darrow said noting there have been no definitive 
scientific sexual behavior studies in recent years the 
groundbreaking kinsey report on sexual behavior is too 
unscientifically based and is 40 years old 
the survey reported thursday included adults living in 
households prisoners and transients were not included and they 
may be at greater risk darrow said 
the survey was conducted by the national opinion research 
center a private center which has conducted surveys on social 
issues since 1972 the center receives funding from the national 
science foundation and shared its research with federal health 
officials darrow said 
the survey was conducted between feb 14 and april 25 the 
margin of error varies from finding to finding depending on a 
number of variables but is believed to be less than 4 percent 
overall norc researchers said

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
was stopped as he left the state department on thursday to hear an 
appeal from an armenian dissident who wants to visit his ailing 
mother 
amvarsam khlgatian 61 had been waiting for two hours across 
the street carrying a placard that read gorbachev let me visit 
my dying mother while shevardnadze met inside with secretary of 
state george p shultz 
as the motorcade started for the soviet embassy khlgatian 
dashed into the street carrying his placard the motorcade stopped 
and startled security agents wrestled khlgatian to the ground 
shevardnadze left his limousine to talk to the demonstrator for 
a few minutes 
he said dont worry ill take care of it khlgatian said 
afterward but he can do nothing its up to the kgb 
khlgatian said he made a similar appeal to shevardnadze in new 
york a few months ago and he said the same thing 
the protester said he was exiled from the soviet union in 1979 
after serving 15 years in labor camps for attempting to escape to 
the west he said he works as a machinist in new york 
khlgatian gave shevardnadze a leaflet in which he described his 
mother as 80 years old and fatally ill it said general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev despite promises of humanization had kept 
him from visiting her in yerevan the armenian capital 
for me no matter who was and who is on the top there wasnt 
and isnt justice on the bottom the leaflet said it concluded 
with an appeal for help 
later returning for another session with secretary of state 
george p shultz the soviet foreign minister said he had never met 
the demonstrator before 
asked about his appeal shevardnadze said i am looking into 
it this is the human approach

more threatening

made part of armenia attacked the citys prosecutors office in 
stepanakert thursday 
there are soldiers on every street at every crossroad 
checking passports and personal cars said a man who answered the 
telephone at the state radio and television office gostelradio in 
stepanakert 
nagornokarabakh in the caucasus mountains was virtually at a 
standstill and sealed off because of ethnic tension 
in yerevan capital of the armenian republic about 700000 
people flooded the streets for a threehour rally thursday night 
despite heavy presence by police and thousands of soldiers said 
resident arpine popoyan 
the foreign ministry closed azerbaijan to foreign journalists 
thursday a day after barring travel to armenia it gave no reason 
asked the mood of armenians mrs popoyans 17yearold son 
vahagen replied fighting 
dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers were deployed and 
soldiers guarded government and communist party buildings in 
yerevan mrs popoyan said by telephone 
its very tense everyone is at the edge she said 
she said several deputies of the armenian supreme soviet the 
republics parliament agreed at thursdays rally to push again for 
an emergency session to renew demands to annex nagornokarabakh a 
rally was set for friday and armenians vowed to pursue their 
general strike until they get an answer she said 
armenian authorities on wednesday refused to hold such a session 
staterun television showed armored personnel carriers in 
yerevan and said similar measures were taken in 16 other areas of 
armenia with a mixed population apparently meaning areas where 
both armenians and azerbaijanis live armenia has a population of

mostly armenian population 
he said the dead man and 32 of the injured were armenians the 
other casualties were azerbaijani perfiliev reported beatings 
mauraudings and more than 30 buildings burned down 
perfiliev blamed it on corrupt elements trying to distract 
attention from kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms

the government on thursday 
banned a national antiapartheid conference planned for this 
weekend and a fourth activist took refuge in the us consulate 
after escaping from detention 
organizers had depicted the cape town conference as one of the 
most important antiapartheid gatherings in 30 years more than 70 
groups with members ranging from black militants to liberal white 
parliament members had planned to discuss strategies for 
countering repression of dissent 
the ban was part of a crackdown on opposition 
earlier thursday authorities backed off in the case of the 
latest escape by a detainee who joined three other antiapartheid 
activists holed up at the us consulate police issued then 
withdrew an arrest warrant for clifford ngcobo who escaped 
wednesday while being treated at a hospital and fled to the 
11thfloor consulate in a downtown johannesburg office building 
consular officials allowed ngcobo to remain while his case is 
assessed us embassy spokesman william zavis said the consular 
officials earlier provided refuge for three prominent activists who 
escaped sept 13 
zavis said he could not confirm reports that the consulate 
turned away a fifth fugitive wednesday night local news reports 
said a black man sought by police was refused entry into the 
consulate and later was taken into custody under security 
legislation 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington 
thursday that the south africans given refuge agreed not to have 
contact with news media as a condition of their staying this was 
so the consulate could continue normal operations and avoid 
activities incompatible with diplomatic activity he said 
black activist winnie mandela visited the consulate wednesday 
and complained that us officials would not let the detainees 
contact reporters 
police pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if they 
leave the consulate but law and order minister adriaan vlok 
confirmed that a multipronged crackdown against other activists is 
under way 
across south africa more than two dozen activists were detained 
or barred from political activities this week offices of 
antiapartheid groups were raided and pedestrians and motorists in 
urban centers were subjected to random searches 
brig leon mellet spokesman for vlok announced the conference 
ban he said one goal of the conference was to promote disruption 
of upcoming nationwide municipal elections 
activists advocate a boycott of the elections saying the 
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a 
whitecontrolled system that excludes blacks from central 
government 
mellet said participants in the conference were sympathetic to 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement and were 
seeking to fill the vaccuum created by the banning in february of 
17 major antiapartheid groups the groups included the united 
democratic front a nationwide coalition 
the crackdown comes during an upsurge of bombings including 
five in a 9hour span late wednesday and early thursday 
authorities said 38 people were injured including 18 whites at a 
johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks at a disco on the other 
side of the city 
the disco owner said three white men left shortly before the 
blast without drinking their beer 
police have blamed most recent bombings on the anc but 
activists believe rightwing vigilantes or a covert security force 
unit carried out the recent bombing of a johannesburg building used 
by antiapartheid groups 
redman said of ngcobo he indicates that he is a member of the 
united democratic front and had been in detention for five months 
prior to his escape he is now in temporary refuge with the three 
other activists 
the three are murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa leaders of 
the udf and vusi khanyile chairman of the banned national 
education crisis committee 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

troops fired live 
ammunition and plastic bullets to put down widespread palestinian 
demonstrations thursday including an attack by masked axwielding 
youths twentyfour palestinians were wounded arab hospital 
officials said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin escaped injury during a tour of 
the gaza strip town of khan yunis when a palestinian assailant 
hurled a chunk of cement from a nearby rooftop soldiers rushed to 
the site but made no arrests 
rabin said mass arrests of grassroots activists in gaza 
succeeded in curbing largescale riots but added have we 
succeeded in bringing stone throwing to a standstill not yet 
rabin said he did not see the rock hurled thursday but said 
about 80 percent of the violence in gaza involved stonethrowing 
also thursday the army said four soldiers would face trial in 
the beating death of an elderly palestinian man khader al tarazi 
in gazas jabaliya refugee camp 
israel radio said they were to be charged with manslaughter it 
said the soldiers struck the man with clubs after they broke into 
his home aug 22 to arrest palestinian youths suspected of throwing 
stones 
in the west bank city of nablus dozens of palestinian youths 
marched through the casbah or market chanting antiisraeli 
slogans waving palestinian flags and holding pictures of plo chief 
yasser arafat an army spokesman said 
the youths wore arab headscarves wrapped around their faces and 
garbage bags over their clothes to hide their identities 
they attacked troops with rocks and axes soldiers responded 
with plastic bullets and live ammunition an army spokeswoman said 
sixteen palestinians were wounded in the clash including a 
12yearold shot in the right hand and two 16yearolds hit in the 
stomach officials at nablus al ittihad hospital said they said 
four other palestinians were wounded in clashes in villages near 
nablus 
other arab hospital officials said four palestinians were 
wounded in the gaza strip including a 13yearold boy who was shot 
in the chest and rushed to tel avivs tel hashomer hospital in 
serious condition 
acording to the army and to a military spokesman 11 
palestinians were wounded in nablus and nearby burka village and 
three were wounded in gaza including one listed in serious 
condition 
rabin credited the use of plastic bullets against stone throwers 
for a recent upsurge in casualties and said they reduced violence 
in the territories 
according to army orders troops can fire plastic bullets at the 
legs of stone throwers even if soldiers lives are not in danger 
unlike live ammunition israeli officials say plastic bullets 
are not generally lethal when fired at a distance of 20 yards or 
more 
rabin also said israel would never relinquish control over the 
occupied territories to the united nations before peace 
negotiations as demanded by arafat last week in france 
i would like to clarify that all the plo talk about the 
possibility that some international entity will come here is mere 
chatter rabin said 
a think tank the independent jerusalem center for public 
affairs on thursday reported 191700 jews live on captured arab 
land about twothirds in israeliannexed arab east jerusalem 
after the 1967 war israel occupied the west bank and gaza strip 
and annexed arab east jerusalem

democrat lloyd bentsen told a silicon 
valley audience thursday that the republicans donothing trade 
policy has left the american military dangerously dependent on 
imported computer parts 
the reagan administration turned its back while competitive 
american businesses such as semiconductor manufacturers were 
devastated by unfair competition the vice presidential 
candidate told employees of the intel corp one of the nations 
premier producer of computer chips 
this administration talks tough on national defense but 
their donothing trade policy has left us dependent on japan for 40 
percent of the computer chips used in our own weaponry he said 
im here to tell you that a dukakisbentsen administration 
will not rest until strong competitive american companies like 
intel have an equal opportunity to compete around the world 
bentsen said 
there is one clear difference in this election mike dukakis 
and lloyd bentsen support a trade policy for america 
with dukakis back in massachusetts bentsen was campaigning for 
californias 47 electoral votes which both sides consider crucial 
to winning the white house on nov 8 
the area near the intel plant voted for president reagan over 
his democratic challenger walter mondale in 1984 by a margin of 
58 percent to 41 percent but bentsen was warmly welcomed in the 
crowded plant cafeteria 
the texas senator also delivered the same warning that dukakis 
gave in boston that the bushquayle ticket will try to use social 
security funds to reduce the federal budget deficit if elected in 
november 
over the past eight years the republican party has waged 
unrelenting warfare against social security bentsen said 
calling it guerrilla warfare in a later appearance in everett 
wash 
and he urged the 300 workers outside the scott paper co plant 
in everett to watch sundays debate because george bush isnt 
going to be able to duck the issues any more 
george bush doesnt get to vote very often he told the 
intel employees but one of the few votes he cast as vice 
president scored a direct hit on social security benefits for your 
parents and some of you 
bentsen cited the occasion in may 1985 when bush presiding over 
the senate as vice president cast the tiebreaking vote in favor 
of freezing costofliving adjustments for social security benefits 
they can wrap themselves in the flag but they cant hide from 
the truth on social security he said as ronald reagan said 
facts are troublesome things 
he also accused his gop counterpart sen dan quayle of indiana 
of voting against programs benefiting the elderly 
if the republicans are elected bentsen said man the 
barricades and get a firm grip on your social security care 
because bush will make a run at the benefits 
democrats will never tamper with the system or loot the trust 
fund he said

medieval times to launch explosives into the base defended by 
about 50 men the guerrillas then attacked with rifle fire he said

vice president george bush claiming there is no 
longer any need to match the soviets bullet for bullet and tank 
for tank said thursday he would work on reordering us 
conventional defenses if elected 
the competitive strategies initiative would involve using 
conventional weaponry in new ways put heavy emphasis on naval 
forces and use high technology to deploy and mobilize conventional 
forces in europe aides said 
democratic rival michael dukakis has made beefedup conventional 
forces a cornerstone of his campaign 
aides said bushs comments at a 31 million texas fundraiser 
in which he shared the stage with president reagan could pave the 
way under certain circumstances for us troop reductions in 
europe in the future although bush did not automatically favor 
such a reduction 
and one senior campaign adviser speaking only on the condition 
of anonymity said that elements of bushs socalled competitive 
strategies initiative would be embraced by the outgoing reagan 
administration and announced within the next few days by defense 
secretary frank carlucci 
it marks a change in the way we utilize forces using 
conventional weaponry in new ways the official said 
meanwhile reagan here to help bushs presidential candidacy 
and to raise money for the party said democrats use our words 
and borrow our tune but the song is way out of key 
reagan said prevailing democratic party views on national 
defense would make two prominent late texans president lyndon 
johnson and house speaker sam rayburn shake their heads in 
wonder and confusion 
serving as a warmup speaker for bush reagan accused dukakis of 
flipflopping on such questions as support for the b1 bomber 
without mentioning dukakis name reagan told 2500 gop faithful 
that we believe in a national defense that defends our shores and 
our allies by land air and sea and very soon space through the 
strategic defense initiative 
but the opposition wants to reduce the size of our navy right 
at a critical moment when the soviets are building up their naval 
presence in the pacific he said 
reagan in particular reiterated his call for a 600ship navy 
bush aides said the candidates new defense proposal likewise 
would put heavy emphasis on naval forces 
bush here after a brief foray into dukakis backyard to collect 
the endorsement of a boston police union discussed his defense 
proposals without getting into specifics 
he said in prepared remarks his competitive strategies 
initiative would be based on the idea of putting our strengths 
against our competitors weaknesses 
he said the initiative had been under study for two years in the 
reaganbush defense department he said he would make the 
program and working on it with us allies a high priority in 
my administration 
the plan is based on existing weapons systems and those we 
have in the pipeline now bush said 
it is designed to ensure that we need not match the soviets 
bullet for bullet and tank for tank bush said 
in general the proposal involves using high technology systems 
for mobilizing and deploying forces principally for the defense of 
europe in the wake of the new ussoviet treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles aides said 
asked if bushs remarks could suggest a movement toward reducing 
the number of us troops in europe bush spokeswoman alixe glen 
said it could it could mean there would be less emphasis on 
that 
however she said that the initiative did not automatically mean 
that bush favored such a reduction 
and dennis ross bushs foreignpolicy adviser said that the 
proposal is simply a new management process for spending our 
money smarter in new weapons systems of the future 
bush said he would detail the proposal in the weeks ahead 
in the speech here and in an earlier address to republican 
activists and college students on the campus of baylor university 
in waco texas reagan accused the democrats of moderating their 
views on national security issues in response to public opinion 
polls 
reagan said dukakis and democratic running mate lloyd bentsen of 
texas had adopted his and bushs issues 
youll hear them say there are no disagreements between them 
and us about these bedrock principles reagan said but it just 
doesnt sound right they use our words and borrow our tune but 
the song is way out of key 
the joint appearance by reagan and bush was their second since 
bush was nominated as the republican presidential candidate in new 
orleans last aug 17 the pair appeared together at a rally in los 
angeles a week later 
during the waco speech earlier reagan seemed to be poking fun 
at the attempt in recent weeks by the dukakis campaign to burnish 
the massachusetts governors defense credentials particularly the 
decision to have dukakis don a helmet and pose in a military tank 
lately some liberal leaders have seen what was happening to 
them in the polls and had a deathbed conversion he told some 
9000 cheering students and others in the baylor university 
athletic center theyd have you believe that theyre bornagain 
george pattons but if we go the way they want to go our defenses 
will run out of gas in no time 
gen george patton was a renowned world war ii combat hero

vice president george bush came to his rivals 
back yard thursday to accept the endorsement of the boston police 
patrolmens association new englands largest police union 
it was the second visit by the republican presidential nominee 
to boston this month 
the vote was viewed by democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis as personally devastating according to the attorney 
for the union 
as dukakis planned a hasty counterrally outside his governors 
office at the statehouse bush visited a restaurant in east boston 
and criticized dukakis as being soft on crime 
who was it said that the police arent there when you need 
them said bush as he stood flanked by some 50 patrolmen all of 
them elected representatives of the police union 
im here to receive this endorsement but also to make it clear 
that im the one in this race who wants to strengthen law 
enforcement bush told the room full of reporters about 150 
supporters and police our first priority must be to keep the 
criminals away from the people who want to live in peace and 
safety 
two hours after the midday rally dukakis surrounded himself 
with scores of law enforcement officials top elected officials and 
new york gov mario cuomo dukakis said were here today to 
investigate a felony assault and battery on the truth 
what george bush is doing to the truth in this campaign is a 
crime were here to give george bush what joe friday used to ask 
for the facts maam just the facts 
the bush rally stemmed from a 510 vote by elected officers of 
the patrolmens association wednesday to endorse bush for 
president it was not the first time the union has endorsed a 
republican in 1980 and 1984 the association supported ronald 
reagan and in 1984 it endorsed republican ray shamie in his 
unsuccessful senate bid against john kerry 
but dukakis himself in a conversation with union attorney frank 
mcgee on wednesday afternoon said according to mcgee that the 
union endorsement would do him great harm 
i hope these guys realize that if they go ahead and do this 
that i would regard this as personally devastating to me mcgee 
quoted dukakis as saying 
in his rally thursday dukakis said that unlike bush he 
supports providing federal assistance to local law enforcement 
agencies 
and dukakis countered criticism of his past support for 
furloughs for firstdegree murderers by saying that the reaganbush 
administration last year gave some 16000 furloughs some as long 
as 40 days to convicted drug pushers 
patrolmens association president robert guiney told the crowd 
at the bush rally that dukakis is no friend of police 
during his term as governor he has presided over a revolving 
door criminal justice system guiney said we are ever mindful 
of his total opposition to capital punishment especially in view 
of our recent tragic loss of three outstanding officers who paid 
the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty 
one of the patrolmen also criticized dukakis absence in the 
past year from the funerals of those three officers killed on the 
job 
earlier this month bush came to boston harbor to spotlight what 
he called dukakis tolerance of delay in cleaning up polluted 
boston harbor 
dukakis has been endorsed by the massachusetts police 
association the massachusetts police chiefs association the state 
district attorneys and the 14 county sheriffs two of whom are 
republican dukakis has also won the endorsement of a number of 
outofstate law enforcement groups 
the boston police force is the largest in new england as is its 
patrolmens union which has 1621 members endorsements are made

republican george bush touted his endorsement by michael 
dukakis hometown police union thursday prompting dukakis to 
surround himself with other law officers and accuse his rival of 
assault and battery on the truth 
what george bush is doing to the truth in this campaign is a 
crime the democratic presidential nominee said in perhaps his 
strongest attack on bush to date his administration has waged 
not a war on crime but a war on crime programs 
the sharp rhetoric came three days before dukakis and bush were 
to face each other in the first of their two nationally televised 
debates confrontations that both sides consider crucial 
the bipartisan commission on debates announced thursday that jim 
lehrer of public televisions macneillehrer newshour would be 
moderator sunday in winstonsalem nc and panelists would be 
peter jennings of abc news anne groer of the orlando sentinel and 
john mashek of the atlanta constitution 
and an nbc newswall street journal poll released thursday 
showed bush and dukakis essentially tied with bushs 4541 lead 
softened by a 2 point margin of error the lead for bush was lower 
than the 4740 recorded for bush last month and the survey of 
2630 likely voters found he had lost support among reagan 
democrats going from 35 percent to 25 percent 
furthermore half the respondents thought indiana sen dan 
quayle was a bad choice to be bushs running mate 
meanwhile president reagan was back on the campaign trail for 
his vice president in texas scorning bornagain george pattons 
who say they support a strong national defense it was an apparent 
reference to dukakis who spent last week sounding hawkish as he 
laid out his defense policies and rode in a modern m1 tank 
reagan spoke to students at baylor university in waco then was 
joining bush at a big fundraising dinner in houston 
bush also stressed defense issues and hinted that the 
administration was on the verge of unveiling a new strategy for the 
defense of europe with conventional weaponry 
without offering specifics bush said that what he called the 
competitive strategies initiative would be based on the idea 
of putting our strengths against our competitors weaknesses 
dukakis has offered what a conventional defense initiative to 
counter the reagan administration emphasis on star wars 
bush traveled to boston to pick up the endorsement of the boston 
police patrolmens association a 1500 member union 
im the one in this race who wants to strengthen law 
enforcement declared bush my opponent is strongly out of the 
american mainstream on issues such as fighting crime 
although dukakis has won the backing of other police groups in 
his state and in bushs adopted home state of texas a spokesman 
for the boston police group said its members felt bush would be 
more attentive to law enforcement needs than would the 
massachusetts governor 
robert t guiney president of the association called dukakis 
no friend of police he cited dukakis opposition to the death 
penalty his support for a former program granting weekend 
furloughs for convicted felons and dukakis failure to attend 
funerals for three police officers recently 
however it was not the first time the union has endorsed a 
republican in 1980 and 1984 the association supported reagan and 
in 1984 it endorsed republican ray shamie in his unsuccessful 
senate bid against john kerry 
the visit was bushs second to boston as the republican 
presidential nominee earlier this month he denounced dukakis for 
failing to clean up pollution in boston harbor 
dukakis responded a few hours after bush spoke today with a 
rally scheduled hastily in hopes of blunting the bush endorsement 
on the massachusetts statehouse steps the governor was 
surrounded by police officers from massachusetts and eight other 
states 
he declared bush a fugitive from the truth who has 
shamelessly portrayed himself as a crimefighter and advocate of the 
environment education and elderly 
he was joined by new york gov mario cuomo who accused bush of 
pandering im tired of the simplistics and the distortions by 
people like the vice president cuomo said 
dukakis counterpunch overshadowed his only previously planned 
event of the day an appearance at a senior citizens center where 
he accused bush of trying to harm social security 
accompanied by his 85yearold mother euterpe dukakis blasted 
bush for a 1985 vote against costofliving increases for social 
security recipients he said bush once described social security as 
largely a welfare program 
when election time rolls around mr bush likes to say he is a 
great friend of older americans dukakis said maybe he thinks 
we all have amnesia 
democratic running mate lloyd bentsen campaigned in californias 
silicon valley and said the reagan administration turned its back 
while industries such as semiconductor manufacturers were 
devastated by unfair competition 
this administration talks tough on national defense but 
their donothing trade policy has left us dependent on japan for 40 
percent of the computer chips used in our own weaponry bentsen 
said 
in other developments 
bush aides said their campaign will spend a modern record on 
television advertising the campaign plans to spend 60 percent of 
its 54 million budget or 324 million on television ads 
bush chief of staff craig fuller said bush complained to a 
highlevel panama official about drugmoney laundering during a 
visit five years ago but fuller said bush did not discuss it with 
panama strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
he commented on a british television documentary quoting a 
former senior aide to noriega as saying bush had complained to 
noriega about money laundering that assertion is counter to bushs 
contention that the reagan administration took action against 
noriega as soon as it learned of alleged drug activity

hurricane helenes winds strengthened to 110 mph in 
the midatlantic on thursday but forecasters said the storm was 
still no threat to land 
at 1030 pm edt the center of the 250mile wide storm was at 
latitude 141 north and longitude 443 west or about 1020 miles 
east of the caribbean island of barbados 
helene was moving westnorthwest at 10 mph and was expected to 
continue that track and speed through thursday 
this is a very good hurricane its already something to 
reckon with national hurricane center forecaster miles lawrence 
said but the currents suggest it is going to turn to the north 
its just too early to speculate 
air currents from a low pressure trough over the ocean may draw 
helene northward into the open atlantic away from the caribbean 
islands and north america lawrence said 
helene showed signs of northwest movement by late thursday but

government soldiers rounded up 
10 people from this village accused them of collaborating with 
leftist rebels and killed them with grenades and rifle fire 
relatives and neighbors said thursday 
the killings wednesday in san francisco a tiny farming town 30 
miles east of san salvador appear to constitute the biggest mass 
slaying of civilians in this warravaged country in four years 
the armed forces press office reported earlier thursday that 10 
subversives were killed wednesday just outside san francisco 
it said troopers of the jiboa battalion surprised a group of 
extremists of the fmln who were moving through the area it 
described the confrontation as fierce combat 
marxistled rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front or fmln have fought el salvadors usbacked centrist 
government for nearly nine years 
but more than 10 witnesses to wednesdays incident interviewed 
by the associated press said there was no combat and that the 10 
men and women killed had been taken from their homes or detained as 
they carried out chores or walked along village paths on errands 
several of those interviewed by the ap were detained along with 
most of the villages inhabitants in the local schoolhouse they 
said the three women and one of the men killed were taken from the 
schoolhouse and marched about a mile to a ravine where six other 
village men were detained 
three explosions presumably grenades were heard at about 330 
pm wednesday followed by a steady fusillade of rifle fire the 
villagers said 
local residents were prevented by the troopers from going the 
place of the killings wednesday evening the villagers found the 
bodies early thursday morning 
an officer at the armed forces press office asked about the 
villagers version of events said the armed forces had no further 
information to modify its earlier report but the officer who 
declined to give his name said the matter would be investigated 
the 10 bodies were covered while still in the ravine with a 
banner proclaiming a slogan of the leftist guerrilla group 
villagers put the bodies in hammocks thursday afternoon and 
carried them to the local churchyard where relatives mourned their 
dead some of the bodies were disfigured by explosions or shrapnel 
relatives identified the victims as teresa argueta 47 maria 
zoila rivas 45 maria jesus sibrian 27 jose maria flores jose 
alfaro nicolas alfaro francisco alfaro ulises sibrian jose 
atilio rivas and jesus zepeda 
the ages of the men were not known 
maria julia argueta jose atilio rivas common law wife said 
five jiboa troopers arrived at the familys adobe house at 530 
am wednesday she said they searched it thoroughly then took her 
husband away and ordered her to remain inside with the couples 
three children 
they said they were going to give him a talk that they did 
that whenever they went into a village mrs argueta her eyes 
red from crying told the ap in the churchyard 
mrs argueta is also the sister of teresa argueta one of the 
slain women 
maria gumersinda melendez 28 said she and her daughter 
blanca were walking to the nearby town of san sebastian when they 
were detained by the troopers at 630 am 
the two said they were held in the schoolhouse all day with 
about 35 of the villages approximately 70 residents including 
about a dozen children at midafternoon the soldiers called the 
names of ms argueta ms rivas and ms sibrian along with those of 
francisco alfaro and rosa emilia rivas 
the five stepped forward were blindfolded and led out they 
said rosa emilia rivas told the ap that she was released outside 
the schoolhouse apparently because the soldiers realized they 
wanted maria zoila rivas instead of her 
the women said the soldiers had a list of names from which they 
appeared to be working they said different soldiers who addressed 
the detainees in the schoolhouse accused the villagers of 
supporting the front 
rosa emilia rivas told the ap she believed she was being led out 
to be killed when she was taken from the school 
they called us collaborators of the guerrillas she said 
i dont feel safe here anymore i would like to leave but i 
dont have anywhere to go she said 
i feel a great fear about staying here said mrs argueta 
the last mass killing of noncombatants attributed to the army 
took place on aug 30 1984 in the town of las vueltas in 
chalatenango province thirtyfour civilians were killed there 
according to local and international human rights groups 
no officer or soldier was prosecuted for that atrocity

president daniel ortega cancelled on 
thursday his scheduled visit to the united nations because the us 
government delayed visas for about two dozen members of his 
delegation a government official announced 
this arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a denial of 
nicaraguan rights deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco 
said in making the announcement at a news conference 
on wednesday nicaraguas un ambassador alejandro serrano 
caldera said the state department was blocking visas for most 
nicaraguans who wanted to attend ortegas speech to the general 
assembly in new york including ortegas wife and children 
in washington state department spokesman rudi boone said he was 
not aware of ortegas cancellation of the trip we have not seen 
those reports yet he said 
asked if the visas might be expedited to allow the trip boone 
said i could not say 
a state department official in washington earlier denied the 
administration was blocking or delaying the visas 
earlier this month the state department criticized the leftist 
nicaragua government for refusing to allow the united states to 
replace ambassador richard melton and seven other diplomats the 
sandinista government expelled on july 11 the sandinista 
government accused the diplomats of trying to destabilize the 
country 
the united states in turn expelled nicaraguan ambassador carlos 
tunnerman and seven of his colleagues 
ortega family members his doctor chief of protocol and many of 
his senior advisers were among the 22 to 25 nicaraguans whose visas 
were not processed in time for the sept 28 address serrano said 
the sandinista government protested the unjustified delay in 
issuing the visas according to a foreign ministry communique 
broadcast over staterun radio wednesday night 
it said nicaraguas representatives to the un and the 
organization of american states had been instructed to intercede 
before the state department so that without major delays the visas 
in question are granted 
the statement said the state of usnicaraguan relations should 
not be a factor in the issuance of the visas 
in adopting this type of attitude the united states clearly 
ignores those commitments it has assumed as the host country of 
international organizations specifically violating existing 
stipulations in the agreement between the united nations and the 
united states relative to the site of the united nations the 
foreign ministry statement said 
the state department told the nicaraguan mission that ortega and 
some senior nicaraguan officials would have received their visas in 
time for their scheduled arrival friday serrano said on wednesday 
but he said the state department also told the nicaraguan 
mission that the other 22 to 25 visas would not be decided until 
oct 4 a week after ortega was to speak to the 159member general 
assembly 
the united states since 1981 has supported rebels seeking to 
overthrow nicaraguas sandinista government 
state department spokesman charles redman has said that in 
addition to refusing replacements for melton and the seven other 
expelled diplomats nicaragua is not issuing visas to us 
diplomats assigned to replace envoys being routinely reassigned or 
to personnel seeking to visit the embassy on official business

portauprince haiti ap rebellious soldiers wound down 
their purge of repressive army commanders thursday but continued 
hunting henchmen of the deposed duvalier dynasty independent radio 
reports said 
the new military government of lt gen prosper avril appealed 
for an end to the lawlessness that began over the weekend when a 
coup toppled lt gen henri namphy and sent him into exile in the 
neighboring dominican republic 
a military communique carried on state television said formal 
instructions have been passed on to the forces of order to arrest 
all individuals committing acts of brigandage and pillaging it 
said violators would be duly tried and punished 
the army announced retirements or discharges of 29 officers 
most of whom were removed by rebellious soldiers 
radio metropole meanwhile said staff at the army general 
headquarters issued a 16point declaration demanding elections 
higher pay medical benefits subsidized housing and commissary 
privileges 
it appeared the unit was speaking for itself although their 
demands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by enlisted men who 
carried out the coup saturday night 
radio haiti inter reported that soldiers hunted for members of 
the tonton macoutes who have long terrorized the population 
the tonton macoutes were the dreaded private army of francois 
duvaliers regime and that of his son jeanclaude the 29year 
duvalier dictatorship ended when the younger duvalier was forced 
into exile in february 1986 
avril the former army adjutant assumed the presidency early 
sunday 
since then rankandfile soldiers nationwide have revolted 
against their commanders depositing them handcuffed outside army 
headquarters in portauprince the capital 
radio haiti inter reported the ouster thursday of two more 
commanders in southwestern cotes de fer and the northern port of 
st marc that brought to 21 the number of commanders who served 
under namphy known to have been forcibly removed 
capt ernst ravix commander of the 40man st marc barracks and 
reputed macoutes sympathizer was ousted one day after soldiers 
fired on demonstrators there killing a 12yearold boy and 
wounding three people the cotes de fer commander was not 
identified 
radio haiti inter said that after ravix was arrested and brought 
to portauprince soldiers launched a hunt for tonton macoutes 
the high command on thursday night announced the retirement of 
26 officers and the discharge of three others most of them already 
forced from command 
gerard desmangles head of the commerce ministry was removed by 
underlings telehaiti said the asssistant minister of immigration 
also was removed by lowerranking personnel but his name was not 
reported 
bernard degraff the governments assistant director of 
information said removal of unpopular officers was proceeding 
peacefully 
the ouster movement should cease very soon degraff said 
loss of control is still possible but i have seen an 
improvement in the situation 
sporadic nighttime gunfire continued and there were reports of 
more reprisal attacks but for the most part the capital was calm 
thursday namphys country retreat in foret des pins outside 
portauprince was among the houses reported pillaged 
what is happening now could mean the possible elimination of 
macoutism jeanclaude bajeux a leading human rights activist 
and a centerleft opposition leader 
now we can construct democracy soldiers are asking for 
justice law and order under the 1987 constitution 
namphy suspended the constitution which was approved by 99 
percent of the voters in a referendum in march 1987 
avril said democracy was the ultimate goal of the military 
on monday he named a new cabinet of 11 civilians and one military 
man but has never mentioned restoration of the constitution or 
elections 
dr louis roy founder of the haitian red cross and coauthor of 
the 1987 constitution said he thought the political situation 
remained dangerously unsettled 
he said the purge of macoutes under way now should have happened 
when jeanclaude duvalier was overthrown 
macoutes were not punished then they were encouraged by the 
government he said 
namphy headed a junta that promised a transition to democracy 
however independently run general elections nov 29 were thwarted 
when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at least 33 people at 
polling stations 
leslie manigat a civilian was elected president in january in 
militaryrun balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential 
candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities namphy ousted 
him in june

un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar said thursday that independence is closer than 
ever for southwest africa 
the territory commonly known as namibia is africas last 
colony and has been ruled by south africa in defiance of united 
nations resolutions 
perez de cuellar arrived early thursday on his first visit to 
south africa since 1983 to discuss recent regional peace 
initiatives which have revived the uns 10yearold plan for 
namibian independence 
we are closer than ever to a solution to the problem the 
peruvian diplomat said at a cocktail party after a day of talks 
with namibian and south african officials 
we hope that in the very near future you will have next to our 
country a sister republic the republic of namibia he said 
earlier perez de cuellar met for more than two hours with 
foreign minister pik botha both emerged to say progress had been 
made 
botha was host of the subsequent reception attended by more 
than 200 guests of all races at a former presidential residence in 
pretoria 
i would be kidding you if i said the un was a popular 
concept in south africa botha told perez de cuellar at the 
reception but it is a privilege to have you here 
south africa has agreed to end its 73year rule over namibia and 
allow un observers to oversee the transition to independence but 
only if the estimated 50000 cuban troops in neighboring angola 
withdraw 
cuba has agreed in principle to withdraw its troops but there 
is dispute over the timetable usmediated talks involving 
angola cuba and south africa aimed at setting this timetable are 
to resume monday in brazzaville congo 
most opposition parties in namibia rejected an invitation by 
perez de cuellar to come to pretoria for consultations but members 
of the territorys transitional multiracial cabinet met with him 
for more than an hour thursday 
perez de cuellar was scheduled to meet president pw botha on 
friday then travel to angola for talks with leaders of its marxist 
government

the house on thursday passed election year 
antidrug legislation that would severely punish recreational users 
and murderers alike but it could face constitutional tests if 
enacted into law 
the 37530 vote is not the final word on congress latest effort 
to respond to americans fears over drug abuse the senate still 
must consider its own antidrug legislation and a conference will 
likely be needed to reconcile competing versions 
despite constitutional concerns even by sponsors the tug of 
electionyear politics was so strong that house members appeared 
willing to enact the toughest possible bill and let the courts 
decide the legal questions later

washington the nuclear regulatory commission ruled thursday 
that before receiving a lowpower license seabrook nh plant 
owners must prove they can pay to decommission their reactor if 
they never secure a fullpower commercial license 
in a unanimous vote without debate the commissioners ordered 
seabrook owners to submit a plan within 30 days that provides 
reasonable assurance that adequate funds will be available so 
that safe decommissioning will be reasonably assured in the event 
that lowpower operation has occurred and a fullpower license is 
not granted 
seabrook officials quickly expressed optimism that they would be 
able to file a plan to pay for decommissioning that will satisfy 
the commissioners

born out of wedlock to a us gi and a welsh woman 
during world war ii shirley mcglade for years knew only her 
fathers name and one clue as a small boy he had lived in idaho 
as a teenager she would visit stratford on avon shakespeares 
birthplace on the infinitesimal chance that some american tourist 
might mention her dad 
she wrote to us senators government officials and president 
reagan and after 14 years of searching she found him in 
california 
mrs mcglade now helps others less lucky heading one of two 
british groups that help hundreds of war babies look for their 
roots 
often equipped with little information they face tight privacy 
laws intransigent bureaucracies and the lingering stigma of 
illegitimacy some give up most say they cannot 
youre always told for gods sake dont tell anybody your 
father was an american said mrs mcglade 43 whose father left 
england not knowing her mother was pregnant i kept it quiet for 
my mums sake 
but after she founded war babes she says she got hundreds of 
phone calls from people saying im the same as you im 
looking the group now has 300 members 
the birmirk 
well thats not the only reason 
i wanted to go to florida so my son could play golf down 
there she adds those were the major points however i love 
eccentric character roles and they dont come around very often 
fortunately i have finally reached an age 51 when i can do them 
and not worry about any of that glamour stuff anymore 
brennan plays the mean superintendent of an orphanage in the 
new adventures of pippi longstockings based on the popular 
childrens stories i love meanies and this goes back to capt 
lewis in private benjamin you know why because they have no 
sense of humor people who are mean or unkind or rigid think 
about it cannot laugh at themselves if we cant laugh at 
ourselves and the human condition were going to be mean 
amazingly brennan can laugh this despite a 1982 auto accident 
that broke both her legs and made her face look like in her former 
husbands words et on a pillow months and months of plastic 
surgery followed along with two sessions in the betty ford center 
because of her addiction to painkillers 
the recovery lasted four years and now her face shows no 
evidence of the ordeal nor does her spirit even though she has 
also undergone a masectomy her humor remains wickedly offbeat but 
she also speaks about serious matters too such as her work for 
mothers against drunk driving madd 
the los angelesborn brennan was educated in convent schools 
then studied at the american academy of dramatic arts in new york 
her first broadway show little mary sunshine lasted two 
years then she toured in the miracle worker for two years 
she was a member of the original company of hello dolly 
when producer norman lear spotted her and cast her for a comedic 
role in his film divorce american style she followed with a 
series of eccentric characters in the cheap detective the 
sting murder by death scarecrow at long last love 
and the last picture show 
brennan recently came to los angeles from her ojai horse ranch 
to make spot announcements for madds drive for life day on sept 
3 which happens to be my birthday 
her feelings about drunken driving stem only partly from her 
accident 
four years before i had stopped drinking i went to aa 
alcoholics anonymous she said goldie hawn her close 
friend and private benjamin costar and i hadnt had anything to 
drink over dinner the driver who hit her on a badly lighted 
street hadnt had anything to drink 
having experienced what can happen on the streets even to sober 
people brennan feels strongly about those who drive under the 
influence two recent films infuriated her 
i never would have seen license to drive except that my dear 
friend carol kane is in it she said my sons and i just sat 
there stunned by the lack of conscience that would propel people to 
do this why 
we walked out after my friend harvey miller one of the 
writers of private benjamin did a drunken driving scene singing 
wonderful old frank sinatra songs people were laughing they 
thought it was so funny i looked at my sons and we stood up and 
walked out 
i havent seen arthur 2 on the rocks i was offered the part 
of a social worker and i really wanted to work with dudley moore 
i read the script in which moore and liza minnelli wanted to 
adopt a baby and the social worker was all for it 
i said to the producers peoples consciousnesses are raised 
now do you think youre going to get away with this no woman 
worth her salt would give a child or encourage a couple to adopt a 
baby if there is alcoholism in the family im an adult child of 
alcholics so i know what im talking about 
i had to walk away from that job and i could have used that 
money too

standing in front of a big circular barn near 
hancock mass the rev bill turpee described how the shakers a 
small closeknit christian community considered round barns more 
efficient in farming 
the efficiency of the shaker barn meant that there would be 
more time to worship and serve god said turpee an american 
baptist minister from boston in the opening scene on a new 
interfaith cable tv network visn 
vision interfaith satellite network started operations monday 
the countrys first broadly ecumenical network involving a wide 
spectrum of us religious traditions 
to begin each day of broadcasts network cohost turpee or a 
woman colleague still to be named will offer a short description 
of some religious group that has made an impact on american life 
the networks initial fare also represented a combination that 
planners say will be standard music dramas with ethical points 
callin talk shows documentaries and magazinetype exploration of 
issues 
were providing programs of a moralsfaith kind that has been 
at the core of our countrys whole value system but which largely 
has not been on national television said the rev wilford v 
bane jr 
bane a united methodist and the networks interim general 
manager said its going to broaden the perspective and give a 
more rounded picture of what religious life is all about 
even for viewers without strong religious convictions he 
said it will provide entertaining and throughtprovoking 
alternatives to ordinary television 
with 10 major multisystem cable companies under agreement with 
the network it has a potential of reaching 185 million 
households but initially was estimated available to only about 6 
million households 
this was expected to grow toward the higher mark and beyond as 
local systems adjust channel assignments 
startup financing has come through the cable industry whose 
fees are expected to cover the central operational budget of about 
6 million annually denominations initially are footing most 
production costs however foundation gifts and commercial 
advertising are expected once the number of subscribers is 
determined 
the new network has rules against any soliciting of money or 
proselytizing 
launching of the network came at a time many cable systems were 
seeking replacements for programs of scandaltainted televangelists 
such as jim bakker and jimmy swaggart 
the rev daniel matthews an episcopalian and board chairman of 
the network said most religious television lately has emphasized 
personal pietism exclusively slanted toward a narrow 
perspective 
it gave a distorted image of american religious life he 
said 
matthews rector of manhattans richly endowed trinity church 
where the new network has offices said it will reflect historic 
faiths that have been the backbone of america 
besides mainstream protestant roman catholic greek orthodox 
and jewish bodies the network also involves such groups as the 
mennonites salvation army sevenethday adventists and mormons 
for the first time we have an example on television of the way 
religion ought to work in a democracy with tolerance and 
respect said george w baskin the networks director of faith 
group relations 
although catholic bishops decided against using the network 
participation was voted by the association of catholic radio and 
television syndicators including church orders and institutions 
active in tv production 
richard p lindsay communications officer for the church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints mormons said visn will offer 
topquality valuesoriented programming appealing to a 
broad spectrum of viewers 
the networks program director jeff weber a presbyterian 
corralled a varied composite for opening week ranging from dramas 
produced by seventhday adventists to magazine shows produced by 
roman catholics and lutherans 
at the outset broadcast schedules were limited to five hours on 
weekdays 1 pm to 6 pm edt and longer on weekends from 7 
am to 5 pm on saturdays and 6 a m to 5 pm sundays 
childrens shows have a big place only on saturdays along with 
weekend bible study shows dramas and worship 
the network expected to expand to a 12hour daily schedule by 
the first of the year including prime evening time 
the rev bruno caliandro a united methodist and the networks 
director of program development predicted the network will be 
reaching 30 million households within two years 
besides denominationally produced programs he said the network 
acquires programs from other producers and also will produce 
programs itself with some now in planning stages with various 
academic institutions including 
programs on biomedical issues with the chicago medical center 
on world religions with harvard on everyday ethical problems faced 
by americans with boston university and on interdisciplinary 
viewpoints with notre dame

a new book ministry of greed concludes 
that moral majority founder jerry falwell tricked fallen

drawn from newsweek coverage of the case and further reporting

network for the scandalbumped bakker apparently had miscounted on 
these possibilites 
at one extreme he falwell might win kudos for statesmanship 
in rescuing a troubled ministry and easing the corrupt bakker out

religious organizations often fail people at 
the most critical times especially during their midlife 
reexamination of values according to a major national study 
theres an unstated norm in a lot of church communities that 
you dont talk about faith like politics and sex said connie 
leean one of the authors of the study sponsored by 23 religious 
organizations 
its a fearful thing to do because many people have the notion 
that different experiences of faith may not fit easily into a dogma 
or confessions of the church said leean a lutheran educator 
the sixyear study faith development in the adult life 
cycle combines poll data from the gallup organization and 
indepth interviews with more than 1000 people nationwide 
directed by the rev kenneth stokes the study is for church

with jobs scarce at home so many 
filipinos have gone to work abroad that they have become one of 
their countrys main sources of foreign currency and a key factor 
in keeping the economy going 
hundreds of thousands leave each year and many of them are 
trained workers who take jobs far below their capabilities because 
of the higher pay abroad 
teachers for example work as maids overseas because the wages 
are much higher than a teachers salary at home 
even so president corazon aquino calls these export workers the 
philippines new heroes 
the estimated 15 million to 25 million overseas contract 
workers remain a steady source of income for the countrys 
faltering economy 
overseas workers sent home 7919 million in 1987 making them 
the countrys third largest source of foreign exchange after 
exports of electronic components and garments central bank figures 
indicate that foreignworker remittances for the first half of 1988 
totaled 4193 million 
the money doesnt go directly to the philippines government but 
the government benefits by its flowing into the economy 
in general the workers send some of their foreign wages home to 
their families the families exchange the foreign currencies at 
banks or other financial houses for philippines pesos the foreign 
currencies then circulate through the philippines financial system 
the currencies might be purchased by a philippines importer for 
example to buy foreign goods or by the government to pay off part 
of the nations foreign debt 
tomas achacoso director of the philippine overseas employment 
administration poea says 450000 workers with contracts approved 
by his agency left for work abroad last year 
that does not include uncounted thousands who leave without 
seeking help from the poea those with poea approved contracts 
included 60000 maids some of whom left skilled professions in the 
philippines to work as domestics abroad 
achacoso said the exodus has left shortages in some key skills 
at home shipping companies for example say they have problems 
finding skippers for ferry boats in the philippines archipelago as 
well as crews for domestic oil and chemical tankers 
nurses are also in short supply and pretty soon we might 
have a shortage of computer experts or programmers achacoso said 
but achacoso denies there has been a brain drain and he 
said the foreign exchange earnings outweigh the disadvantages are 
you cant speak of a brain drain because most of these people 
do not have jobs here he said those who were employed here 
and left simply opened up positions for the unemployed here 
president aquino told filipino maids in hong kong last april 
that overseas workers helped reduce the unemployment rate to about 
9 percent and if they had remained at home you could have been 
part of that statistic 
the worker exodus began in the mid1970s when persian gulf oil 
countries hired thousands of foreigners to build roads office 
buildings hotels and homes and to manage new development projects 
even though the oil boom has faded the middle east remains the 
major destination of filipino workers saudi arabia alone employs 
at least 300000 of them as nurses office clerks public transport 
drivers janitors and as private servants 
families of overseas workers often are the only ones with money 
to build homes or buy new appliances in rural areas 
but overseas workers sometimes suffer abuses 
the problems are with those who go there as tourists he 
said the moment their visas expire they are open to a lot of 
abuses and they can range from rape to being forced into 
prostitution nonpayment of salaries and being beaten up 
ernesto catequista a 31yearold accountant recently applied 
for a job abroad with poea 
id like office work clerical bookkeeping anything he 
told the associated press he added that he had earned 2500 pesos 
125 a month at a local bank until it closed in 1985 he has 
since been earning about the same amount selling encyclopedias 
because he cannot find a steady job 
josefina pahilga 38 who trained as a teacher took a job as a 
maid abroad after she could not find a teaching post and ended up 
earning 2000 pesos 100 a month rolling cigarettes in a tobacco 
factory 
as a maid in western europe she earns the equivalent of 450 a 
month plus free board and lodging and has seen much of the world 
before coming home on for a sixmonth leave she joined her german 
employer on a family ski vacation in bulgaria 
others cite reasons beyond economics for working abroad 
its always the money and going to the united states said 
a former xray technician who works as a maid in cairo egypt 
they always think it will be easier to get to the united states 
from other countries than from the philippines

european automakers must think this is the 
year for you to take the plunge on that sports car with enough 
horsepower to achieve earth orbit or on the luxury barge with 
faucets for red and white wine in the back seat 
theyre offering more models than ever before 40 that get 
caught by the us gasguzzler excise tax according to the 
annual fuel economy ratings released by the environmental 
protection agency on thursday for 1989 models 
five cars bearing us names are also taxed two of them are 
largely made in europe and are aimed at the same hangtheexpense 
market segment that the europeans are going after the other three 
are the only entirely us models ever to pay the tax which they 
also paid in 1987 but escaped last year 
as usual the japanese are the mileage champs for the fourth 
straight year the fuelstingiest cars are the japanesemade geo 
metro formerly the chevrolet sprint and the twoseater honda 
civic crx hf 
the metros mileage was 53 miles per gallon in the city 1 mpg 
below last years figure for the same car and 58 on the highway 
test the same as last year geo is the new nameplate general 
motors corp is putting on the imports of its chevrolet division 
the civics figures are identical to last years 50 mpg city 
56 mpg highway 
the gasguzzler tax unique to the united states assesses a 
penalty in the form of an excise that rises with declining fuel 
economy it starts at 500 and goes up to 3850 it was enacted in 
1975 when fears of fuel shortages were rampant and aimed at 
discouraging the unthrifty 
in all 45 models some of them identical except for trim are 
official gasguzzlers last years list included only 24 and the 
year before that the count was only 18 
this years includes five rollsroyces that escaped in previous 
years through a nowclosed loophole that exempted cars of more than 
6000 pounds gross vehicle weight 
european models that will pay the tax come from rolls and its 
bentley badge plus maserati ferrari mercedesbenz porsche 
astonmartin jaguar volvo and bmw 
the proliferation of guzzlers reflects a growing desire for 
performance and status analysts say 
around here its almost a status symbol to have paid a 3000 
penalty tax commented garrett stasse auto editor of the 
register in shrewsbury nj in affluent monmouth county 
if you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its 
performance image youre in more trouble today than if you have an 
official gasguzzler said ed miller a senior editor at wards 
automotive publications in detroit 
clarence ditlow director of the center for auto safety in 
washington an advocacy group that frequently has opposed 
relaxation of government fuel standards said we are going in 
the wrong direction we ought to be headed the other way and making 
gassippers 
but manufacturers he said think theyll make more in profits 
than they pay in penalties 
the tax really isnt objected to by the buyer of luxury 
cars said kyle johnson of gms cadillac division it does not 
alter gms commitment to stay away from the gasguzzler tax on 
usbuilt cars 
johnson was commenting on the cadillac allante a 50000plus 
twoseater introduced last year to compete against the upscale 
europeans a larger engine this year brought it under the tax with 
a rating of 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway adding 
650 to the sticker price 
the other taxed us entry is one model of the chrysler tc by 
maserati which had readings of 17 and 21 other tc models escape 
the tax but not the one with the turbocharged 25liter engine 
152 cubic inches without the topgear lockup feature on the 
threespeed automatic 
this car is built in italy using many ussupplied components 
the cadillac allante is built in the united states using an italian 
body 
the other us gasguzzlers are the chrysler fifth avenue and 
its identical twins the dodge diplomat and the plymouth grand 
fury they get 16 mpg in the city and 23 mpg out of town according 
to epa compared with 1723 last year and 1621 in 1987 
repeat tests of the same car can yield slightly differing 
results the car has not changed said tony cervone a chrysler 
spokesman 
the fifth avenue family is in its last year successors were 
introduced last year the chrysler new yorker and dodge dynasty 
rated at 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway for 1989 
in all japanese and korean manufacturers captured the top 10 
spots as they did last year because japaneseowned plants in the 
united states and in japan have in the past supplied the same cars 
to the us market simultaneously epa no longer lists the top 
domestic models but the top usmanufactured car from a big three 
company appears to be a ford escort recorded at 3242 
the biggest guzzlers this year are four astonmartin sports cars 
new to the united states all 811 and carrying the top penalty of 
3850

cbs might as well come on the air saturday night 
and announce hey bonehead the olympics are on nbc why arent 
you watching 
instead the network offers a remarkably lame study in the 
obvious bodywatching based on the desmond morris books on 
body language 
did we know that the facial expression for joy is the same in 
every culture a smile did we know that hands express emotion 
did we know that hello is goodbye reversed 
of course we did were not stupid get to the sex 
the special actually reveals stop the presses how mens 
bodies are different than womens but this is network television 
so dont expect to see the good parts 
bodywatching starts off by examining the body language of 
doortodoor salesmen rap pleasantly on the door one vacuum 
merchant suggests to another talk your way in the door make the 
vacuum cleaner look easy to use 
this is scientific 
eventually bodywatching slinks up to the subject it 
constantly suggests first with a woman who designs brassieres she 
says her job is not unlike designing a suspension bridge you 
have to somehow get the bust up pushup bras create curves 
that are highly sexual gushes narrator burgess meredith whose 
body language is thankfully unseen 
on to a beach in brazil hairy chests string bikinis simply 
put its really about mating meredith squeals 
for some reason much of the first half of the special is taken 
up with following a blind sculptor to italy where he gets to feel 
michelangelos masterpiece david this is rather er 
touching but it doesnt seem to have much to do with body 
language remember michael is blind meredith exclaims 
irritatingly several minutes into the piece apparently the writers 
think the viewers are too 
the best body language for bodywatching is turning the 
channel

them 
this time around even host paul rodriguez isnt in particularly 
fine form the only standout of the five comics he introduces is 
the closing act richard jeni and he isnt particularly special 
his bit about fighting in new york is pretty funny it takes 40 
minutes to actually work up to violence after various stages such 
as determining the opponent has a problem as in you got a 
problem hey whats your problem man 
cathy radman trots out an old bit about crossing the canadian 
border for a gig only to get into a confused argument with a border 
guard who thinks she said canadian instead of comedian if 
radman doesnt get some new material therell be no such problem 
paul dillery has some decent material and a unique style with 
his baby face and slight figure he says he once tried to get a job 
in construction the foreman looked at me and said you can have 
the job just fill this out he handed me a shirt 
rick reynolds litany of unhappy material he makes fun of a 
grandfather with facial paralysis for pitys sake eventually 
sinks to dumb sex jokes interrupted line by line with his operatic 
singing 
haywood banks is embarrassingly desperate to cram his mishmash 
of material into a cohesive gimmick so he dresses inexplicably 
like a nerd he pushes far beyond its potential one bit in which he 
holds up a sign that says this did you see this look at 
this whats this doing on the floor he follows up with 
that something and nothing 
perhaps hbo should consider doing a young comedians show every 
other year or every five years or as warranted

in the tumultuous days of chinas cultural 
revolution grace king was exiled to the provinces to work on a 
farm today her income is in the six figures and she owns an 
apartment on manhattans fashionable east side 
not surprisingly she has no plans to return to her homeland 
going back would close off all our possibilities ms king 
said it would be too much of a sacrifice 
still ms king remains a citizen of china one of a growing 
number of chinese who have chosen to seek their fortunes in 
american businesses and at american universities 
sons and daughters of highranking communist party members and 
even party members themselves the chinese came as students part 
of deng xiaopings program of modernization 
some are taking jobs to round out their american education 
gaining practical experience that will better enable them to 
contribute to chinas development once they return home others 
have become enamored of the united states and have decided to 
settle here 
the largest group af all however dont know where they will 
end up torn as they are between appreciation of american freedom 
and ties to their homeland 
ms king 32 arrived in america nine years ago from beijing 
after graduating from columbia university with a masters degree in 
business administration in 1984 she took a job with merrill lynch 
as an investment banker 
ms king the daughter of two highranking communist party 
members saw her family ripped apart by the ultraleftist cultural 
revolution of 19661976 her welleducated parents were purged from 
the party lost their jobs and were kicked from their apartment 
as part of chinese leader mao tsetungs program that forced 
intellectuals to do physical labor ms king herself was sent to 
the countryside to farm during those years she spent much of her 
spare time in political meetings hearing harangues against the 
capitalism and imperialism of chinas thenenemy no 1 the united 
states 
but then came a rapprochement between the united states and 
china and educational opportunities in america ms king jumped at 
her chance 
im really happy that i came she said in a recent 
interview it gave me a chance to see a different world 
like many of her countrymen whove decided to stay ms king 
says shes here for her career 
in china advancement still doesnt depend so much on talent 
and results she said there are other things like your 
attitude and your political ideology i cant tolerate that 
leo orleans a china scholar at the library of congress who is 
writing a book on chinese students in the united states estimates 
that at least 22000 of the 62000 who have come here as students 
since 1979 have decided to stay 
that fact he believes prompted beijing to consider slashing 
drastically the number of chinese students allowed in the united 
states official chinese documents seen in new york in march 
indicated that china has debated cutting the number from around 
18000 in 1987 to 600 but those plans it appears have not been 
put into place 
jerome cohen an expert on the chinese legal system and 
modernization drive sees the mainland chinese generation in 
america as crucial to the countrys modernization regardless of 
whether they return 
these people will help their country no matter where they 
are he said its difficult for a westerner to understand the 
depths of their patriotism 
in addition he said its vital that the chinese have people 
who know the practice as well as the theory and that is not 
only true in business 
hu quing a 27yearold postdoctoral fellow in physics at the 
university of california berkeley says the kind of experience 
hes getting would be unattainable in china 
experimental physics requires a lot of equipment and supplies 
and china just doesnt have the resources said hu certainly 
if i go back i will disappear from the world of academia 
ms king and hu say that even if they did return china a poor 
country with 1 billion people wouldnt be able to use their skills 
liu tings father former chinese premier liu shaoqi was the 
main target of the cultural revolution and died imprisoned and 
alone in a hospital in western china in 1969 
ms liu 36 came to this country eight years ago and in 1984 
became the first woman since communist china was founded in 1949 to 
graduate from harvard business school 
the chinese leaders say they want us to give our lives to help 
the country grow said ms liu 36 who works for rockefeller 
associates but havent we given enough i can see compromising 
to help ones country but never sacrifice 
ms liu says she plans on settling here but i may change 
she said if china continues to open to the west i may go back 
orleans predicts that in the future more chinese will try to 
stay 
first the chinese are just beginning to realize that america 
doesnt just throw people out of the country if they are here 
legally he said even though their government is calling them 
back the students are beginning to understand that they can stay 
anyway 
the politcal crackdown and official warnings that followed a 
recent series of student protests calling for more democracy in 
china make america look that much better he said 
still some students plan to return among them mei shan an 
analyst with kissinger associates with degrees from harvard law 
school and columbias school of international affairs 
my generation is the generation that can change china said 
mei 40 who spent eight years in inner mongolia during the 
cultural revolution repairing farm machinery and now does 
geopolitical risk analysis for the consulting firm 
we are the only ones who know the country and have expertise 
the younger ones they may have more desire for democracy or fancy 
things but they dont really have the driving force they didnt 
experience the cultural revolution so they have little 
understanding of bitterness for me the bitterness has been my 
strength 
mei acknowledges he is taking a chance in going back to china 
sure i might not be able to do what i want to do he said 
but not being in china even now i somehow feel guilty

higher rents and gasoline prices largely replaced food as the 
sharpest spurs to higher prices that kept inflation at an 
annualized rate of 52 percent during august the government said 
separate goverment reports also released wednesday showed a 
modest rise in personal income and a drop in housing construction 
the news had little impact on the financial markets where stocks 
bonds oil prices and the dollar were little changed 
trading was more dramatic in precious metals gold prices 
tumbled below the 400atroyounce level in the united states for 
the first time since early last year on the commodity exchange in 
new york gold for current delivery fell 690 a troy ounce to 
close at 39840 the first time the metal closed below 400 since 
feb 18 1987 when it fetched 39270 
analysts have attributed the recently depressed gold market to 
growing investor disillusionment with bullion as a hedge against 
inflation 
in its report on inflation the labor department said food and 
beverage prices rose 05 percent in august as the effects of the 
drought in the farm belt began to ease prices jumped 09 percent 
in july when the greatest impact of the dry weather began hitting 
consumer pocketbooks 
but gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in august the 
biggest increase in 12 months and despite lower utility bills and 
home energy costs shelter expenses rose 06 percent in august 
their largest increase in seven months 
but analysts agreed there was nothing alarming in the numbers 
the scare that were off to the races or that an inflationary 
sprial is under way has not materialized and it wont 
materialize said larry chimerine of the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa consulting firm 
separately the commerce department said personal income rose a 
modest 02 percent in august the smallest gain in eight months 
although much of it represented declines in both farm subsidies and 
farm income wages and salaries were up just 03 percent 
after adjustments for inflation the government said americans 
average weekly earnings fell 13 percent in august the decline in 
workers buying power was the third in the past four months and the 
worst since the government began keeping tabs on real earnings in 
1964 
the decrease stemmed from a 09 percent drop in the average 
number of hours worked from 349 hours to 346 hours and the 04 
percent hike in consumer prices average hourly earnings were 
924 unchanged from july 
another commerce department report showed housing construction 
fell 33 percent last month with a steep drop in new apartments 
outweighing a small gain in singlefamily home building for the 
first eight months of this year housing starts are running 99 
percent below the same period in 1987

skepticism about the outcome of the upcoming meeting of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries pricing committee 
has made traders relucant to sell analysts said the meeting is 
scheduled for sunday and monday 
this is a market that sees considerable storm clouds on the 
horizon said stephen smith a research analyst with bear 
stearns amp co crude prices are holding up probably because 
theres some chance that opec can pull a rabbit out of the hat 
there is speculation that such a meeting could lead to a 
gathering of all 13 opec members and a possible reduction in the 
cartels oil output recent reports have suggested that several 
opec countries are producing far above their assigned quotas 
helping to flood world markets with oil and keeping prices weak 
nevertheless nearmonth contracts for crude oil and gasoline 
continued to gain strength from falling inventories in the face of 
strong demand oil brokers said demand is up nearly 2 percent from 
last year 
the american petroleum institute reported tuesday that us 
crude oil stocks were down by 6212 million barrels in the week 
ended sept 16 while gasoline stocks fell by 258 million barrels 
analysts said the fall in gasoline inventories stemmed from last 
weeks hurricane in the gulf of mexico and the temporary shutdown 
of several refineries in the area

representatives of 24 third world governments get 
together today to discuss ways to win more help from richer 
countries as formal sessions begin for the joint annual meeting of 
the world bank and international monetary fund 
informal meetings have been going on all week during the arrival 
of delegates from the 151 member governments as well as 
representatives of banks and industrial companies 
at the top of most governments concerns is the burden of 
interest payments on developing countries debt due to reach 12 
billion by the end of this year 
in new york the biggest debtor brazil which owes about 120 
billion is to sign a new 82 billion agreement with its creditor 
banks including 52 billion in new loans to help the nation cover 
its obligations for 1987 1988 and the first half of next year 
brazil suspended interest payments on its debt in february 1987 
but officially ended the moratorium on wednesday 
but new money lent by banks goes largely to pay interest on old 
debt third world governments will ask wealthier governments and 
the bank and fund to increase their lending 
later in the week the wealthier countries will meet on their 
own problems as well as those of the third world the most 
important session will be by the group of seven comprising the 
united states japan west germany france britain canada and 
italy 
the third world debt problem has been getting much vocal 
sympathy in berlin a countercongress consisting of critics of 
the world bank and imf also opens on thursday 
on wednesday former west german chancellor willy brandt 
appealed for debt reductions for developing nations with president 
reagans administration taking the lead the world bank and imf 
have resisted such pleas as counterproductive the united states 
has the largest share of voting strength in both entities 
critics of the imf and world bank say the need to make interest 
payments and conditions set by the fund and bank for new loans 
compel governments to raise prices and to reduce wages fund and 
bank officials argue that such policies are needed to prevent worse 
suffering and to put the debtor countries into better position to 
borrow again 
mobilizing criticism here has been the leftwing green party 
whichhas representatives in the berlin legislature and the west 
german parliament 
the group which says it disapproves of violence as a political 
method plans a mass demonstration in berlin on sunday when it 
hopes to bring 40000 protesters into the streets 
the greens also have taken the lead in organizing a permanent 
peoples tribunal to meet monday and accuse the bank and fund of 
damaging the environment and violating the united nations charter 
spokesmen for the imf and world bank say they will furnish 
information to the organizers but will not send representatives to 
appear at the fourday session

manager ed mertz said wednesday but theyre going one way and 
were going another 
buick introduced its new lineup of cars for the coming model 
year on wednesday saying the decline in the gm divisions sales 
has ended 
oldsmobile cadillac and chevrolet introduced their 1989 
versions earlier this month 
in the early 1980s gm was criticized for making too many cars 
that looked too much alike but recently including this months 
introductions of 1989 models executives from each of gms car 
divisions have stressed the differences between their cars and 
those of other divisions 
chevrolet has been seen as aiming its new cars especially 
through the new geo line at economyconscious buyers and 
oldsmobile is shifting its sights to a market that is younger and 
more interested in high technology than the segment traditionally 
associated with its cars 
mertz predicted at a news conference that buicks sales in the 
89 model year would show slight gains from the previous model year 
we have arrested the sales downturn he said november 
was the low 
he speculated final figures for the model year due early next 
month should show buick held 57 percent of the market that share 
mertz said should rise to 6 percent to 65 percent during the 
coming year 
much of the sales gain is expected from the riviera a twodoor 
coupe being lengthened by 11 inches in 1989 mainly in the rear of 
the car to about 16 feet 
we see an 18000 to 22000 range in 89 about twice that of 
the current year mertz said of riviera sales 
buicks twoseater reatta with a base price of 26700 will 
return for 1989 after its introduction last january buick has sold 
2500 of the cars and production is quickening toward a 1989 goal 
of 7000 to 8000 mertz said 
reatta is the sixthshortest but is one of the heaviest of 
buicks 16car lineup weighing in at 3394 pounds only the 
riviera coupe and two fullsize station wagons are heavier 
officials said buick would continue its skylark and skyhawk 
models with base prices starting at 9285 and we will have a 
small but steady market in fullsize wagons mertz said 
in the middle of the model year buick will introduce its park 
avenue ultra a luxury sedan with full leather interiors multiple 
seat adjustments and other features no price has been set

executives of american suzuki motor corp say the 
company has recovered strongly since a private report in june 
alleged that its samurai utility vehicle was prone to flipping 
i think the consumers are reassured suzuki spokesman james 
weber said at a news conference wednesday to introduce the 89 
suzuki line of two utility vehicles and a car right now weve 
sucked the pipeline for samurais dry 
it just shows the consumer confidence in the vehicle weber 
said of the rebound i think were stronger 
weber predicted selling somewhere around 2000 samurais monthly 
in the 1989 model year 
last june suzuki was stung by reports by consumers union 
publisher of consumer reports that the samurai was dangerously 
prone to rolling over the company denied the charges but watched 
its june sales plummet 638 percent to 2199 from 6074 in may 
but by august aided by a major buyer incentives campaign sales 
had rebounded to 12208 vehicles 
this coming model year the samurai will be back in suzukis 200 
dealers in 39 states joined by two new models the swift 
automobile and the sidekick fourwheeldrive vehicle 
the swift to be available in two models is a companion for 
chevrolets newly introduced geo metro an economyminded car built 
by suzuki in japan the sidekick will be linked the geo tracker a 
fourwheel drive vehicle also built in japan 
in april production of those suzukis and chevrolets will be 
moved to canada 
suzuki officials insisted sidekick and samurai sales should not 
overlap 
sidekicks they said were aimed for an older market than were 
samurais which are built a little more for offroad use a bit 
shorter and narrower but with more ground clearance than the 
sidekick 
the sidekick comes in a number of variations depending on 
among other things whether its equipped with a 13 or 16liter 
engine and whether it has a cloth or hard top 
base price for the samurai will be 8495 and the sidekick will 
go for a base of 8995 the swift glx has a base price of 7495 
and the gti will retail for 8995 
between now and april suzuki said it hoped to sell 30000 
sidekicks and 10000 of both swift models like the samurai the 
sidekick will be brought to the united states as a truck

the securities industry is expected to mount a 
constitutional challenge to new massachusetts regulations designed 
to protect small investors by barring agreements that prevent 
investors from suing their stockbrokers 
responding to a flood of investor complaints after last years 
stock market crash massachusetts today becomes the first state to 
ban such agreements the new regulations outlaw contracts that 
require arbitration in disputes over losses 
securities industry officials say massachusetts is treading on 
thin constitutional ice in enacting the guidelines because the us 
supreme court last year upheld contracts that make arbitration 
agreements a precondition for doing business 
any lender has preconditions on what terms they lend you 
money william j fitzpatrick general counsel of the securities 
industry association said wednesday its not unreasonable to 
say if we have a dispute were not going to go through the very 
expensive and inefficient method of litigation 
fitzpatrick who testified against the massachusetts rule at a 
july hearing predicted securities industry groups would sue the 
state over the mandatory arbitration ban 
officials said 16 other states are planning similar regulations 
massachusetts new rules to be filed today by the secretary of 
states office take effect jan 1 1989 
were concerned about investors having a choice said deputy 
secretary of state martin t meehan we dont want them to be in 
a position where they have no choice but to sign away their day in 
court 
most brokerage firms require customers to settle disputes 
through an arbitration hearing sponsored by the new york stock 
exchange the national association of securities dealers or other 
market organizations 
arbitration is cheaper and faster than suing but investors have 
only a limited right to appeal while big institutional investors 
can negotiate contracts with brokerages individual investors 
usually have little choice but to agree often unknowingly to 
arbitration 
a securities and exchange commission survey this year of 65 
firms handling 90 percent of all customer accounts found virtually 
all require arbitration particularly for customers who borrow 
money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky stock 
options 
massachusetts officials said they have received hundreds of 
complaints since the oct 19 market crash from disgruntled 
investors who didnt realize they had waived their right to sue for 
losses 
the new york stock exchange said it received 1175 arbitration 
cases through august compared with 616 for the same period of 1987 
and a total of 1000 for all last year 
securities lawyers said mandatory arbitration agreements often 
are buried in boilerplate gobbledygook of contracts in sections 
on margin accounts or options 
i know of very few industries that try to incorporate such 
restrictions in their agreements or have been allowed to do that to 
such an extent said earl cantwell a buffalo ny securities 
lawyer who opposes mandatory arbitration 
cantwell said the market crash led to more investor complaints 
only because people started losing money 
one two three years before the crash a lot of improper 
practices by brokers simply went unnoticed or wouldnt be focused 
on by investigators because things were going well he said 
in addition to the state action a bill introduced in congress 
in july would make it illegal for a broker to turn away a 
customers business for refusing to sign an arbitration clause and 
would reform the arbitration process 
it would probably be more beneficial if the arbitration system 
itself was fairer and took into consideration the customers point 
of view more frequently than it does now said maria crawford 
scott editor of the journal of the chicagobased american 
association of individual investors 
analysts say the system favors brokers because investors are 
allowed a limited number of challenges and arbitration boards 
generally consist of former securities officials and can be 
insensitive to small investors concerns 
arbitration remains and probably will remain the primary 
dispute resolution for customers with complaints against their 
brokers said james c meyer president of the north american 
securities administrators association an organization of state 
regulators but that doesnt mean it should be exclusive or 
individuals should be denied their fundamental rights 
the association said the number of its arbitration cases 
quintupled from 800 in 1980 to 4100 last year and could climb 
above 6000 this year 
but fitzpatrick said only a very small percentage of complaints 
to the sec are about arbitration he said most brokerage firms 
dont require customers with cash accounts to sign arbitration 
clauses and customers who want to borrow money on margin can go to 
banks or elsewhere 
according to the secretary of states office the 16 other 
states planning to impose similar regulations are alaska 
colorado florida georgia idaho indiana iowa north dakota 
ohio oregon pennsylvania south dakota tennessee virginia 
washington and wisconsin

digital equipment corp the no 2 computer maker 
is opening its doors to outside technology 
analysts say digitals acquisition of a 5 percent stake in mips 
computer systems inc marks a move to accept and implement 
technological advances occurring outside the company 
digital announced plans wednesday to develop computer work 
stations based on the california companys technology 
work stations are expensive desktop computers that typically are 
used for work that requires extensive manipulation of numbers or 
sophisticated graphics such as science engineering design and 
financial modeling 
this is an acceptance on decs part that the computer users 
dollar is being spent on work stations and small systems said 
bruce watts an analyst with needham amp co 
i think they feel that internally theyve got enough on their 
hands in terms of keeping their own product line up to date and 
competitive and if they want to tap other segments of the market 
they have to look outside he said 
digital said it is lining up with mips based in sunnyvale 
calif to speed new work station products to the marketplace the 
maynardbased computer giant is second to sun microsystems inc in 
the fastgrowing work station field 
under the agreement digital will used mipsdesigned 
microprocessors that use reduced instruction set computing or 
risc a way to speed up computing by simplifying the steps a 
processor has to carry out the faster risc microprocessors are 
used increasingly in work stations 
with the addition of risc technology digital will offer 
customers even more versatility in computer performance to match 
specific application demands said william strecker a digital 
vice president 
digital stock closed at 9262 in composite new york stock 
exhange trading wednesday up 12 cents 
analysts said they expect digital to unveil a work station using 
mips chip technology by the end of the year they said the decision 
by digital marks the first time it has strayed from its reliance on 
its own vax computer design 
analysts also said the mips deal marks a concession to industry 
standards because riscbased systems work well with unix the 
standard operating software made by american telephone amp telegraph 
digital also acquired the right to use future mips technology 
in the past digital has designed all its computer components 
itself

after advising its stockholders to 
ignore two hostile takeover attempts polaroid corp has sued to 
block shamrock holdings incs unwanted bid 
the suit filed tuesday in delaware seeks to prohibit the 
burbank calif based shamrock from acquiring any shares of 
polaroid stock or attempting another tender offer and asks that the 
company divest itself of polaroid stock it now owns 
the suit was filed after polaroid urged its stockholders to 
reject as inadequate a sweetened 26 billion takeover bid by 
shamrock last month polaroids board of directors turned down 
shamrocks first unsolicited offer 
the complaint alleges shamrock engaged in a variety of 
securities law violations including fraudulent deceptive and 
manipulative acts the suit also claims that shamrock failed to 
disclose material information to stockholders 
polaroid is taking a more aggressive stance said william 
relyea a photography analyst with eberstadt fleming inc in new 
york 
polaroid officials allege in the suit that shamrocks offer to 
buy polaroid shares at 42 is illusory they said the move 
either was designed to allow shamrock to reap a quick premium by 
selling its own polaroid stock or to allow shamrock to pressure 
polaroid into a merger at a price that would be detrimental to 
other stockholders 
relyea said polaroid may slow shamrock down with the lawsuit 
echoing what he said was a widelyheld view that shamrock actually 
may be paving the way for another company to take over polaroid 
while it makes a tidy profit 
the suit also claims shamrock violated the federal reporting 
requirements by failing to disclose the identity of all members of 
its ownership group 
and the suit alleges shamrock is trying to exclude the polaroid 
employee stock ownership plan from its offer which is contrary to 
federal requirements that all stockholders receive equal treatment 
in a tender offer 
shamrock spokesman john grimaldi said wednesday that the company 
had not seen the suit and could not comment 
polaroid has asked the us district court to conduct a hearing 
on its request for a preliminary injunction against shamrocks 
offer before oct 6 
last month polaroid rejected an unsolicited offer from shamrock 
that would have paid stockholders 40 a share plus 40 percent of 
the eventual award in polaroids 57 billion patent infringement 
lawsuit against eastman kodak co analysts valued the offer at 
about 44 a share given a 1 billion settlement in the kodak case 
after advising stockholders tuesday to reject the sweetened bid 
polaroid also filed notice with the securities and exchange 
commission in washington that it has begun preliminary negotiations 
with third parties about issuing preferred stock to them a step 
that would make the company harder to take over 
shamrock which is owned by the family of roy e disney nephew 
of the late animator walt disney says that if its bid succeeds it 
would drop polaroids fledgling venture into 35mm film sell most 
of the companys undeveloped real estate narrow the companys 
manufacturing facilities and simplify polaroids research and 
development activities to focus on the companys core businesses 
the offer hinged on the invalidation of polaroids recent 
issuance of 97 million shares to a new employee stock ownership 
plan a move polaroid made early in its attempt to block shamrock

eastern airlines has renewed calls for federal 
mediators to declare an impasse in contract talks with its 
machinists union after 98 percent of the unions voting members 
rejected the carriers latest costcutting contract offer 
the predictable defeat of the contract proposalshould send 
another strong message to the national mediation board that the two 
parties are at an impasse tom matthews senior eastern vice 
president of human resources said wednesday 
the board must act quickly to release the parties from 
deadend mediation to resolve these issues he said contract 
talks began nine months ago 
the union vote tallied wednesday showed 81 percent of the 
unions 9500 mechanics and groundsupport workers cast ballots 
with 98 percent voting no and 90 ballots in favor of the 
proposal that local president charles bryan says would slash pay in 
half 
eastern has lost about 1 billion in the past decade and posted 
a secondquarter loss of 898 million the company says the 161 
million in wage concessions it seeks represent pay cuts of 10 to 20 
percent 
an impasse could be declared if federal mediator harry bickford 
told the board he could do no more if the board agreed both 
parties would have a chance for arbitration if either party 
declined that would begin a 30day cooling off period after which 
the union would become free to strike and eastern could impose its 
conditions unilaterally 
bryan who expects negotiations to resume soon said easterns 
offer was unacceptable because it would cut pay sick days 
vacation time and medical benefits 
the vote makes it crystalclear that the membership were very 
concerned by the number who turned out the people were very 
angry said bryan 
but eastern says cuts are essential to restore the carrier to 
profitability on sept 10 the miamibased carrier eliminated 
4000 jobs and two weeks earlier it cut 12 percent of its routes 
ending service to 14 cities 
we believe it was our best offer eastern spokeswoman karen 
ceremsak said of the proposal offered in july 
bryan claimed that frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
firm texas air corp hoped for a strike bryan reiterated his 
contentions that lorenzo aims to give eastern assets to sister 
carrier continental airlines which is largely nonunion 
absolutely not true ms ceremsak said what we do want is 
a 30day coolingoff period we believe the only way we can reach a 
settlement is if we have a deadline without a deadline theres no 
incentive for the iam to settle 
eastern also is negotiating a contract with its pilots union 
which with the flight attendants union took 20 percent wage cuts in 
1986 
bryan blames the companys money troubles on poor management 
and said the union offered to take a oneyear pay freeze

financial uncertainty caused by the 
drought are forcing farmers to hold off buying new machinery for 
their fields dashing hopes for a banner year in the farm equipment 
industry according to some salesmen 
this year will certainly slow down next year maybe not as 
much but there wil be a cloud hanging over us it takes a lot of 
years for a farmer to recover a loss said doug hennessey a 
territory manager for white new idea farm equipment co based in 
coldwater 
normally theyll trade it in on a 35 year basis and this 
wouldve been the greatest fall in eight years but then the 
drought hit and delayed their opportunity to buy said be 
miller southern ohio marketing manager for case ih 
hennessey and miller were among approximately 500 commercial 
exhibitors at the threeday farm science review which ends 
thursday the agricultural exposition included about 40 million 
worth of farm equipment 
the number of hours a farmer uses a tractor varies but cases 
cl lephart said an average for a cash grain farmer would be about 
250 hours a year normally a farmer may trade that in after five 
years but now they are allowing their equipment to depreciate and 
trading it in with as many as 7000 hours on it 
miller said this years drought was a particular letdown because 
analysts finally were anticipating a good year after years of a 
depressed farm economy 
theyd finally got their debt load paid off which wouldve 
permitted them to come back and buy but now said miller his 
voice trailing off 
lephart case marketing manager for northwest ohio said the 
drought led to a new marketing plan discounts financing 
leases were seeing a lot more of all of these lephart said 
john deere co parts marketing manager bob hothem said the 
company hopes to cash in on a us department of agriculture 
projection that there will be as many as 25 million new acres to 
till next year 
while equipment sales have been slow a different type of 
machinery has moved out of the storerooms and onto the farms 
tillage equipment such as field cultivators have sold better 
than usual because notillage didnt work out hennessey said 
referring to a farming method aimed at soil conservation 
conventional and mechanical tillage is coming back into 
play lepart said 
lepart and miller think 1989 will be a better year for sales 
but say they wont be able to put profits into perspective until 
all crops are harvested 
theres certainly a lot of room for optimism miller said 
the farm science review on the 992acre molly caren agriculture 
center about 25 miles west of columbus included field 
demonstrations and exhibits by farm equipment manufacturers and 
dealers the annual agribusiness exposition is sponsored by ohio 
state university

general motors corp has agreed to 
revise an advertising plan that state authorities say would boost 
car prices while illegally forcing dealers to participate 
according to attorney general charlie brown 
separately a group of ohio auto dealers has sued to block a 
similar advertising plan in their state 
gms chevrolet motors division planned to increase the amount 
its dealer franchises pay for their cars by 1 percent an average 
of 40 to 50 a car to finance a dealers association that would 
run the automakers national advertising campaigns 
the company offered dealers who joined the association a 25 
percent discount on the surcharge but told those who did not join 
that they would not receive the discount brown said wednesday in 
announcing the settlement 
under the plan the dealers would pass on the surcharge to car 
buyers chevrolet planned to begin the program with its september 
shipments and tacked the 1 percent charge on to its dealers bills 
for this month 
a lot of dealers complained about it brown said 
brown said he learned about the chevrolet plan in august steve 
herndon solicitor general for the attorney generals office 
investigated the plan then informed chevrolet that it violated 
west virginia law 
under the law autmobile dealers cannot be required to 
participate in a dealers association 
this type of deceptive business practice is a violation of 
fair trade competition and the consumer is the ultimate victim 
brown said 
obviously if gm dealers have to compete with other gm dealers 
in advertising it means better prices for consumers herndon 
said 
the attorney generals office and chevrolet last week negotiated 
a settlement under which dealers will participate in the ad plan 
only if they want and then pay the discounted fee those who dont 
participate will be paid an amount equivalent to the 25 percent 
discount 
dealers did not pay the september charge herndon said 
at least 27 other states have auto dealer laws similar to west 
virginias the attorney general said 
other automakers including ford motor co have tried similar 
tactics brown said 
in ohio the ohio automobile dealers association and three ohio 
dealerships sued gm and its gmc truck and chevrolet divisions in 
us district court in columbus alleging a similar advertising 
program in ohio violates state law prohibiting mandatory 
participation in a dealers association 
they plaintiffs want the court to stop the program and award 
them any damages allowed under state law plus double the amount gm 
has collected under the program 
the sept 8 suit has not been scheduled for trial gm has not 
filed a response

the united states and its european 
trading partners remain far apart on solving disputes over a ban on 
hormonetreated meat and support for civil aircraft development a 
us official said thursday 
but alfred h kingon the us ambassador to the european 
economic community told a news conference that trade relations 
between the united states and the 12nation european trading bloc 
are actually pretty good 
we have succeeded in the last year and a half of cleaning the 
table of most of the troublesome trade issues that existed some two 
years ago between the united states and the community he said 
trade between the eec and the united states will likely exceed 
more than 160 billion this year up from 145 billion in 1987 and 
131 billion in 1986 kingon said 
two key disputes remaining he said are european enforcement of 
a ban on meat from animals treated with growth hormones and us 
objections to government support for airbus industrie a 
fournation european consortium that competes with boeing co and 
mcdonnell douglas corp 
kingon said little progress has been made on either issue and no 
resolution was in sight 
the meat hormone dispute he said is perhaps the most 
difficult problem on the table 
an eec spokesman who demanded anonymity said no new 
initiative can be expected from the community on hormones there 
is a deadlock 
the eec says it wants to ban imports of all hormonetreated meat 
for health reasons late last year it decided to delay 
implementation of the ban until jan 1 1989 
the united states had threatened to take retaliatory action if 
the ban was imposed it contends the use of hormones to fatten 
animals which is a common practice among american farmers is not 
a health risk 
kingon predicted the issue would wind up in the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade an international body that solves 
disputes between trading partners 
on the airbus issue kingon said negotiations were continuing 
but he said i would not want to mislead you to say we are close 
to a solution because were not 
a key objective of useuropean negotiations has been to set 
effective discipline on new infusions of capital and on the 
conditions under which government support may be provided to future 
civil aircraft programs 
the four governments involved in the airbus program are britain 
france west germany and spain 
the eec is made up of belgium britain denmark france 
germany greece ireland italy luxembourg netherlands portugal 
and spain

the securities and exchange commission has 
authorized its staff to charge matthews amp wright group inc and 
several officers of the bond house with fraud and other abuses in 
connection with the underwriting of more than 1 billion in 
municipal bonds the wall street journal reported thursday 
quoting what it called people familiar with the situation the 
newspaper said the sec took the unannounced step at a closeddoor 
meeting tuesday the reported action followed a major inquiry into 
the new york firms activities 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue declined comment on the journal 
report in accordance with the agencys policy on enforcement 
matters 
but the sec had stated in a previously published notice that its 
agenda for the tuesday session included institution of 
administrative proceedings of an enforcement nature 
david aufhauser a matthews amp wright attorney was not 
immediately available to comment a receptionist said the journal 
quoted him as saying hed had discussions with the sec staff but 
could not elaborate 
matthews amp wright has consistently denied wrongdoing and has 
asserted its underwriting practices conform with industry practices 
the journal quoted sources as saying the sec action means the 
agencys enforcement staff will enter into settlement negotiations 
with matthews amp wright if those fail the sources were quoted as 
saying the sec may charge the firm with a range of alleged abuses 
most of the charges stem from matthews amp wrights role as an 
underwriter of 25 municipal bond deals in 1985 and 1986 the 
sources were quoted as saying 
the sec case doesnt include the firms bestknown deals 380 
million in questionable issues underwritten for guam and the 
northern mariana islands in 1984 and 1985 the newspaper quoted 
sources as saying 
it was unclear why these were omitted but the newspaper said it 
may have been because other government enforcement agencies are 
scrutinizing them 
last year a federal grand jury in guam charged arthur abba 
goldberg the firms executive vice president with fraud bribery 
and obstruction of justice hes pleaded innocent and will go on 
trial in january 
in august the internal revenue service decreed that interest 
income on the guam and mariana bonds arent taxexempt this is 
significant because the taxexempt status of such issues is a major 
selling point of municipal bonds

the cochairman of the congressionally 
appointed national economic commission says he did not call for tax 
hikes or cuts in social security to help erase the federal deficit 
despite several reports to the contrary 
i am somewhat surprised that there has been so much interest 
in my remarks in a speech tuesday to an economic consulting firm 
robert s strauss said in a statement wednesday let me make it 
clear that i did not call for or endorse cuts in the social 
security programs nor did i endorse a tax increase 
i did tell the cold statistical truth about the size of the 
deficit i further stated that the views expressed were my own 
strauss said tuesday in a speech that social security medicare 
and other government entitlement programs would have to be cut and 
spending would also have to be reduced in defense programs in order 
to get the deficit under control 
we have to go to social security medicare and entitlements 
generally and we have to go to defense strauss said adding that 
he realized how politically charged such comments were 
that means you are withholding money from the sick the 
elderly and the defense of the nation he said in the tuesday 
speech 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis said wednesday 
if the commission recommended cuts in social security they wont 
get to first base in a dukakisbentsen administration 
i oppose reductions in scheduled payments to social security 
recipients and i am committed to maintaining full benefits and 
full cost of living increases dukakis added 
the bush presidential campaign also denounced strauss 
suggestions 
any request by the economic commission for new taxes or tax 
increases or a raid on the social security system would be bounced 
back immediately with the stamp return to sender we would not 
take delivery on either of those proposals said bush spokesman 
mark goodin 
strauss a lawyer and former chairman of the democratic national 
committee said in his clarifying statement that defense 
expenditures account for 28 percent of the federal budget and 
entitlement programs account for 47 percent 
that leads to an inescapable conclusion to the extent that we 
reduce the debt by reducing outlays it has to be done largely in 
defense and entitlements he said in the statement 
nevertheless reports of strauss remarks spurred a vehement 
sen daniel p moynihan dny to promise social security will 
never be cut to help wipe out the federal deficit 
as chairman of the finance subcomittee on social security 
im here to say never moynihan said at a news conference 
wednesday it mustnt be done and it wont be 
moynihan is one of the commissions 12 members and in fact 
the body was created by legislation he sponsored at the urging of 
new york gov mario cuomo 
we have finally got the social security system in stable 
solid surplus condition moynihan said to start raiding the 
trust fund would be unforgivable given what we did in 1983 
that year congress passed social security reforms that resulted 
in 160 billion worth of additional revenues and benefit reductions 
over the years 1983 to 1990 according to moynihan

the european economic community will 
ask for an international trade inquiry into us restrictions on 
imports of sugar a spokeswoman for the european commission said 
the commission will make the request at a meeting thursday of 
the council of the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
international trade organization meeting in uruguay and studying 
ways to improve world trade relations 
the panel will be asked to examine the eecs contention that the 
longstanding us import curbs are inconsistent with international 
trading rules said the spokeswoman who declined to be named 
the eec and us officials had two inconclusive rounds of talks 
on the issue in july and early in september she said 
the united states has imposed import restrictions on sugar 
dairy products peanuts and cotton for many years ince it was 
granted a waiver from international trade rules in 1955 
the eec contends that the protection enabled us farmers to 
build up their production of the commodities 
sugar production in the united states rose to 54 million tons 
in 1986 from 42 million tons in 1955 according to the eec 
the spokeswoman said that the us import quota for sugar in 
1988 amounted to 700000 metric tons while the eec imported 4 
million tons of sugar last year 
the spokeswoman said that the eec had similar complaints about 
the other products covered by the waiver but is still reviewing 
those cases 
she also said that the eec would express to the gatt council its 
concern about the us trade bill which it believes to be 
protectionist and potentially damaging for the uruguay round of 
international trade talks

two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper 
and ironore mining scene of far northern michigan 
it started as a glint in a dow chemical co metallurgists eye 
first dow and now a colorado company crystal exploration inc 
entered the search for diamonds in the states upper peninsula 
seven kimberlite pipes volcanic rock shafts that can yield the 
earths hardest mineral have been discovered 
core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sandgrain sized 
diamonds too few and too small for commercial production but the 
explorers say the search is young 
the pipe formations are in a 40mile area around iron mountain 
and crystal falls at the western end of the upper peninsula along 
the wisconsin border 
in the few places on earth they are found kimberlite pipes 
occur in clusters of up to several dozen said james huml a dow 
research associate 
huml a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation said 
he thinks there are more than a dozen kimberlite pipes in the upper 
peninsula 
dow has searched for six years now more exploration and mining 
expertise is needed huml said dow is not a hardrock mining 
company 
dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data for an 
undisclosed amount to crystal exploration inc a colorado 
subsidiary of sydney australias restech international ltd 
restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in 
western australia 
it will carry on the search while dow holds onto an option to 
take part in the exploration and development and to share in any 
profits 
occasional diamond finds in ohio farm fields in the late 1800s 
and early 1900s long had geologists looking to the north said 
crystal explorations president sigfried muessig 
muessig said a kimberlite pipe named for kimberly in the 
diamondmining region of south africa is the only formation known 
to produce the gems 
it is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up 
120 miles from the bowels of the earth and the heat and pressure 
have formed the diamonds he said 
its a very rare occurrence huml said other kimberlite 
pipes have been found in arkansas kansas wyoming and colorado 
none commercially produce diamonds 
there were no volcanic remnants in ohio so geologists thought 
glaciers carried the diamonds there from canada muessig said 
but he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the us geological 
survey found a kimberlite formation the lake ellen pipe about 
10 miles northeast of crystal falls 
it was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200 
million years ago in the upper peninsula and possibly generated 
the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind 
the glaciers flattened the volcanoes but since 1981 dow has 
found six more kimberlite pipes several hundred feet across at 
the surface and covered by volcanic debris huml said 
in dows explorations he said we have found microdiamonds 
generally small less than a millimeter in diameter they are 
grainsized 
but the explorers still think the western upper peninsula was 
the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south we 
think there is good potential because of the historical finds 
muessig said 
crystal exploration will do more sampling in the already 
discovered pipes in the next year muessig said and will continue 
exploring for more kimberlite formations in hopes the next pipe 
we discover will have gemquality stones

northwest airlines has rejected a 200 
million offer from japanese real estate developers to sell land it 
owns in tokyo officials of the airline said 
northwest officials declined wednesday to discuss details of the 
purchase offer from koshin corp or say why it was rejected 
we dont have any property thats for sale said spokesman 
redmond tyler 
but in a letter to the us real estate agent for koshin 
northwest vice chairman james a abbott said the airline believes 
the land is worth more than has been offered and said it has been 
retained for possible further development by us in connection with 
our business in japan 
the developers wanted to build highrise condominiums on the 
50000squarefoot plot which would have been sold to 
propertystarved japa nese consumers for 10 million to 15 
million apiece koshin hoped to place 60 to 65 units on the 
property 
koar inc a los angelesbased real estate firm representing 
koshin said the property sought by koshin contains five or six 
small twostory buildings that the airline uses to house employees 
including flight crews and corporate staff members on both a 
permanent and temporary basis koar officials said the property is 
surrounded by exclusive residences department stores and highrise 
office buildings 
because of the scarcity of land and the density of the 
population in japan developers there are willing to buy property 
for 4000 per square foot which is the amount turned down by 
northwest 
tyler would not describe the property and said northwest did not 
want to discuss its real estate holdings 
koar said northwest has owned the property for more than 30 
years which would mean that it obtained it at a fraction of the 
price it could fetch today 
koar and koshin together own 366600 shares of northwest stock 
which represents about 13 percent of outstanding shares the price 
of northwest stock rose 875 cents to 50125 wednesday as news of 
the offer by koshin circulated broadly among brokers 
koar officials said koshin has been trying to initiate 
discussions with northwest officials about a land deal since may to 
no avail 
koshin made its most recent allcash offer two weeks ago in 
which it implored nwa to act in its shareholders best 
interests said koar officials northwest responded sept 12 with 
a letter from abbott which was provided to the star tribune of 
minneapolis by koar vice president bruce rothman the newspaper 
said

the securities and exchange commission today 
announced that no enforcement action would be taken against those 
involved in the sale and default of 225 billion of washington 
public power supply system bonds 
in a 376page report on its fiveyear investigation the 
commission staff criticized several parties involved in the sale of 
the wppss bonds which were issued to finance two nuclear power 
projects that eventually were terminated 
the report concluded that enforcement action was unnecessary 
because of a civil trial difficulty in determining responsibility 
for disclosure statements attached to the bonds and concern that 
the commission lacked the resources to pursue the case 
however because of settlements in the civil trial parties 
considered most responsible in the sale of the bonds will not be 
required to argue their cases in a public forum 
bondholders are suing 15 utilities that are members of wppss 
the construction arm of the states public utilities plus a 
financial advisor and two engineering firms in a trial that began 
sept 7 in tucson ariz 
most parties originally named as defendants in the suit 
including wppss itself have settled out of court for a total of 
461 million including 96 million in contested insurance claims 
the report concluded that the default the largest in municipal 
bond history resulted from extensive cost overruns and 
construction delays at wppss project no 4 at the hanford nuclear 
reservation in southeastern washington state and no 5 at satsop 
west of olympia wash 
wppss which issued the bonds was responsible for the official 
statements used to sell them but avoided disclosure of negative 
developments the report said most significantly the supply 
system failed to disclose that in october 1980 participants who 
were concerned about rising project costs and falling power 
demands asked the supply system to study a possible slowdown or 
termination of the projects 
work was halted on the projects in 1981 both were abandoned in 
january 1982 and in 1983 wppss quit making payments on the bonds 
after the washington state supreme court held that the utilities 
contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable 
without payments from the 88 participating utilities many in other 
states wppss defaulted 
the commission report also faulted the wppss bond counsel the 
firm of wood dawson smith amp hellman of new york which was 
responsible for assuring that the disclosures accompanying the bond 
sales were clear on the requirements that participating utilities 
pay for the projects 
although opinions on legal issues frequently contain some 
uncertainty the state of the law was not as clear as those relying 
on the counsels opinions might reasonably have assumed the 
report said further steps were not taken to clarify legal 
matters 
wood dawson settled outside court in the federal trial in tucson 
for 500000 
bond underwriters including some of the largest brokerage 
houses on wall street also were in a position to discover 
inadequacies in the disclosures the report said 
they did not however conduct the kind of investigation in 
the offerings of these competitively bid bonds that they perform in 
negotiated bond sales and in corporate securities offerings the 
report said 
bond underwriters settled in the massive lawsuit for 92 
million despite the size of that settlement representatives of 
the 24000 bond buyers with claims in the federal lawsuit said it 
was less than the profit of the underwriting firms in selling the 
wppss bonds 
besides the 15 utilities defendants in the trial include the 
firm of blyth eastman financial advisor to wppss and the 
construction engineering firms of united engineers amp constructors 
and ebasco

market to influence prices 
soybean futures posted slight gains at the opening in reaction 
to a soviet newspaper report that the soviet unions grain harvest 
this year would be smaller than the relatively good harvests of the 
two previous years 
but soybeans quickly turned lower on reports of beneficial rain 
in the soybeangrowing region of argentina and selling linked to 
the advancing corn and soybean harvest in the midwest 
harvest pressure is overhanging the grain markets as well 
limiting the potential for strong rallies analysts said 
there really is not much of a story developing said ted 
mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the harvest is progressing and in general the market is a little 
bit tired

the nations savings institutions continued to 
lose billions of dollars but at a slightly slower rate in the 
second quarter of this year when compared to the previous six 
months the government said today 
the federal home loan bank board said the nations 3000 sampls 
lost 36 billion in the apriljune period an improvement over a 
39 billion loss in the first quarter and a record 40 billion 
loss in the last three months of 1987 
the report came as the chairman of the senate banking committee 
predicted that taxpayers will have to provide 20 billion in a 
bailouttocome to solve the financial crisis confronting the 
industry 
in a speech prepared for delivery on the senate floor today 
chairman william proxmire dwis said it was his reluctant but 
profound conviction that the problem has grown beyond industry 
resources 
james barth chief economist for the bank board said however 
i like to think we have bottomed out and things wont get much 
worse 
but theres still a serious problem he aded 
sampls lost a record 78 billion last year and seem certain to 
surpass that this year having lost 75 billion in the first six 
months 
as in the past the industrys losses in the second quarter were 
concentrated in a relatively few number of institutions and in one 
state texas which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil 
prices 
the 271 thrift institutions in texas accounted for 32 billion 
of the loss the 20 worst institutions in the nation 17 of them 
in texas lost 26 billion 
there were 497 insolvent institutions down from 509 in the 
first quarter the bank board resolved the cases of 26 institutions 
in the apriljune period and 14 more institutions slipped into the 
red 
twentynine percent of the industry lost money 51 billion in 
the second quarter more than offsetting the 15 billion profit 
earned by the remmaining 71 percent 
proxmire in his speech proxmire said the taxpayers will have 
to contribute 20 billion toward fixing the problem and he accused 
the new treasury secretary of being nonchalant about the crisis 
even if the next congress appropriates the 20 billion healthy 
sampls will need to contribute another 30 billion over the next 
several years he said 
the bailouttocome will be the largest ever in the history of 
the us it will be far bigger than the combined cost of the 
assistance to chrysler corp lockheed corp and new york 
city he said 
despite that he said the administration has its head buried 
in the sand and treasury secretary nicholas f brady in his 
confirmation hearing last week was nonchalant about the sampl 
mess 
brady who replaced james a baker iii contended that the 
industryfinanced federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
guarantees sampl deposits up to 100000 has as much as it can spend 
for now 
estimates of the cost of cleaning up the industry vary from the 
bank boards 31 billion to private projections as high as 100 
billion 
the current bank board estimate is well within its 42 billion 
10year revenue projection but the agency has said it will issue 
an revised cost estimate this fall 
an official of the general accounting office the auditing arm 
of congress told the house banking committee last week that the 
problem was in the 45 billion to 50 billion range and would 
require money from congress 
the american bankers association a trade group representing 
commercial banks this week pegged the cost at 74 billion 
meanwhile brady on wednesday ordered a top deputy 
undersecretary george d gould to look into the rapidly growing 
cost estimates he called on congress to consider several steps 
including authorizing an additional 5 billion in borrowing by 
fslic before appropriating tax money 
a senior treasury department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the fslic has enough funds to operate well into 
next year however if the higher cost estimates appear to be 
valid then well say what this means to funding fslic how much 
it needs and how it should get it he said 
federal regulators have greatly accelerated the pace of sampl 
closings and mergers since midaugust committing more than 13 
billion in aid to resolve the cases of more than 50 institutions 
however proxmire charged that the regulators are engaging in 
sham resolutions these are garbage deals with garbage 
thrifts 
the rescues have brought little money from private investors and 
the acquiring institutions themselves often are thinly capitalized 
he said in other cases regulators are striking faustian 
bargains with investors who plan to use sampl deposits to further 
their own business ventures he said 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board said the bank board 
has brought in substantial private capital with its rescues 1 
billion since july 1987 and expects to bring another 750 million 
in by the end of this year 
sen jake garn of utah the senior republican on the banking 
committee issued a statement assailing sanctimonious attempts 
and partisan charges to shift the blame for the sampl crisis onto 
the administration 
while he did not mention proxmire by name he said he was 
outraged by repeated efforts to get the us taxpayers to pick up 
the tab

today marks the third anniversary of the plaza 
accord a fivenation agreement that might be described as the 
kelloggbriand pact of the financial world 
the kelloggbriand pact of 1928 was an international agreement 
to renounce war as an instrument of national policy in light of 
subsequent conflicts world war ii comes immediately to mind 
kelloggbriand was a miserable failure 
the plaza accord of sept 22 1985 was an agreement by the 
united states britain west germany france and japan to push down 
the exchange value of the dollar the idea was that a cheaper 
dollar would help shrink the us trade deficit and reduce 
protectionist sentiments in congress 
at first the plaza accord looked like a smash success the 
dollar tumbled all through 1985 and 1986 and into 1987 only a few 
impolite skeptics said the dollar would have fallen even without 
the accord 
then some funny things happened first the finance ministers 
got together again at the louvre in paris in february 1987 and 
decided that further declines in the dollar would be 
counterproductive 
naturally the dollar kept falling then it rose then it fell 
steeply at the end of 1987 this year it has risen up a fat 14 
percent against a marketbasket of foreign currencies since jan 1 
in light of these gyrations it has begun to seem as though the 
finance leaders are standing at the bow of an ocean liner with a 
toy wheel trying to convince the other passengers they are 
steering 
all this time people began to notice the cheaper dollar was not 
working wonders on the trade deficit instead of shrinking the gap 
set records in 1986 and again in 1987 it has taken until this year 
to see big improvements 
as time went on it has become increasingly clear that 
1 central bankers and finance ministers dont have much control 
over currency rates 
2 currency rates do not have nearly as much to do with trade 
balances as everyone had thought 
this is not to say the 3yearold plaza accord was a waste of 
time it was a valuable beginning toward cooperation in an 
interdependent world but this is where the comparison with 
kelloggbriand comes in 
in 1985 as in 1928 agreements between nations depend on the 
signatories willingness to adapt their national goals to the 
greater international good and that is a hard sell 
currency rates will never be stable as long as nations pursue 
widely differing economic policies abhorrence of inflation in west 
germany vs relative tolerance of it in the united states for 
example 
the gold standard for currencies forced policy coordination on 
the nations but its fatal flaw was that it put all the burden of 
adjustment on weakcurrency countries that gave undue leverage to 
the slowgrowth west germanys of the world 
businesses want stable currency rates so they can plan where to 
locate plants how much to manufacture for export from which 
nations to buy components and so on 
three years after the plaza accord however the goal of stable 
currencies is beginning to look like a distant dream economists 
estimates of the proper value of the dollar are all over the 
map from 100 yen to 200 yen the current rate is 134 
differing economic policies have something to do with the 
instability as do differing predictions for the trade deficit 
adding to the complexity is that trade flows are not the only 
controlling factor in rates investment flows are at least as 
important meaning that if japanese for whatever reason crave us 
treasury bonds and factories they will keep the dollar in strong 
demand even though they have little interest in importing american 
products 
stabilize currencies abolish war good luck

bank of new york cos 12 billion bid for 
rival irving bank corp has staggered to the oneyear mark with 
neither side ready to throw in the towel or even call the outcome 
at first it had the distinction of being the firstever hostile 
takeover fight between two big american banks now it has become 
the lengthiest such battle among major us corporations 
the strain of the bidding marathon clearly has taken its toll at 
both large new york institutions by distracting management from 
their usual work confusing stockholders and piling up millions of 
dollars in legal and other expenses 
a third friendly contender milanbased banca commerciale 
italiana spa recently was forced out of the running due to an 
unfavorable ruling by the federal reserve board which is patiently 
overseeing the proposed merger process 
its the economic equivalent of the iraniraq war because of 
the length and the substantial casualties said h rodgin cohen 
an attorney for the bank of new york 
at least were not using poison gas the banks chairman j 
carter bacot said jokingly in a recent interview only poison 
pills are involved 
the outcome of the irvingbank of new york war which began on 
sept 25 1987 is likely to be decided in a new york state court 
where among other things irvings poison pill antitakeover 
defense is under attack some observers say the entire process 
could drag on into the winter 
in the meantime the takeover attempt appears to have turned 
into a struggle of personalities between bacot and irvings equally 
strongminded chairman joseph a rice 
analysts say bacot is determined to merge the two banks not only 
because the two would fit nicely together but because he fears bank 
of new york itself could become a takeover target if a big west 
coast or foreign bank decided to enter the new york market 
a merger would nearly double bank of new yorks size making it 
the 11th largest banking company in the country and a more elusive 
target 
rice analysts say has his own vision of running his bank and 
believes it is worth much more than the bank of new yorks offer 
especially given its past investments in technological advances 
both men have held only a handful of facetoface meetings since 
bacot formally proposed the merger and each time talks have broken 
off without any signs of progress no new talks are planned 
because rice said we see absolutely nothing to be gained at 
this stage 
i think the financial issues were certainly important to 
irving early on and now but it clearly has become a personal 
issue said michael starr a banking analyst for duff amp phelps 
inc in chicago 
cohen a partner of sullivan amp cromwell which has represented 
many firms in takeovers agreed my own judgment is that they 
have created this fiction that the bank of new york is evil and 
horrible its almost a crusade 
that is an unfortunate turn of events many analysts contend 
since both banks have similar markets and services and would work 
well together 
irving has waged a tough defense to bank of new yorks 
persistent overtures from poison pills to proxy fights a recently 
instituted flipin provision to its poison pill would make an 
unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive by giving all irving 
shareholders except bank of new york the right to buy 400 of 
stock for 200 once bank of new york acquires 20 percent of irving 
the irving board has taken enough action of a defensive nature 
and the burden is now on them to be able to show that they are not 
merely trying to entrench themselves and irvings management 
said abraham nad publisher of the monthly newsletter directorship 
an authority on corporate boards thats a very fine line to 
walk 
bacot says he first broached the idea of a merger at a luncheon 
with rice about five years ago rice wasnt very receptive then he 
recalled he conceded that irving probably resents the fact we 
put an offer on the table like that after it had turned down the 
bank of new york privately 
whats particularly noteworthy about this battle is that its 
occurring in an industry where hostile takeovers are rare even in 
the best of circumstances the complex timeconsuming regulatory 
requirements that other industries are spared could make some banks 
think twice about a merger 
when the bid first emerged some experts predicted hostile bids 
could become more commonplace particularly among aggressive 
regional institutions theyre not so sure anymore 
hostile takeovers have no place in banking rice said 
recently they are a severe threat to the stability of the 
banking industry and the soundness of the economy 
new ground though was broken on the regulatory front for one 
thing the fed declined to make any distinction between a friendly 
or hostile offer in approving bank of new yorks application in 
february 
and in august the fed decided to treat foreign owners of us 
banks much the same as domestic owners by requiring instituto per 
la ricostruzione industriale the parent of white knight banca 
commerciale to apply separately to the fed iri which balked at 
the idea is controlled by the italian government and accounts for 
about a quarter of italys gross national product 
irving attorney robert falise who says he was forced to devote 
all his time to the takeover fight said irving is negotiating with 
several foreign and domestic banks about a possible merger 
however analysts say if an offer happens to emerge it must be 
extremely attractive to win over shareholders at this late date 
banca commerciale had offered 84 a share for 51 percent of 
irvings approximately 18 million common shares outstanding before 
withdrawing its bid the merger proposal was part of a complex 
defensive restructuring plan that included sale of irving assets 
costcutting measures and a special cash dividend 
bank of new york which owns about 49 percent of irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its own stock for each of 
irvings roughly 18 million common shares outstanding 
bacot maintains his bid is just as attracive now as it was a 
year ago although the cash portion has declined significantly if 
he had to do things over again hed still bid for irving bacot 
said 
we wouldnt have stuck with it that long unless we felt that 
way he said it gets a little frustrating you have to have a 
lot of patience

several senators today criticized airline 
deregulation and the rash of mergers it has spawned complaining 
they have given large air carriers monopoly power in some parts of 
the country and resulted in higher fares but less service 
simply stated people are paying more to fly today because the 
airlines have developed monopoly hubs declared sen ernest 
hollings dsc chairman of the senate commerce committee 
he complained that a fare from washington to charleston sc 
was 120 in 1977 before airline deregulation but that recently he 
paid 510 for the same trip 
but the committee at a hearing aimed at examining airline 
pricing practices were told by transportation secretary jim burnley 
that air travelers have benefited by the deregulation of the 
industry with average air fares declining 13 percent in the last 
decade 
he attributed an average 8 percent increase in domestic air 
fares during the first six months of the year to increased costs 
for fuel new aircraft and a number of governmentrequired safety 
initiatives 
as an example of competition benefiting air travelers burnley 
cited a recent decision by continental airlines to offer a 39 
offseason fare between the northeast and florida 
airline deregulation has resulted in a substantial improvement 
in overall competition to the benefit of the public insisted 
burnley 
but the explanation didnt satisfy a number of the senators 
including hollings sen john danforth rmo and sen larry 
pressler rsd who said fares and service to their parts of the 
country have suffered 
its cheaper to fly across the nation than it is to fly across 
south dakota that is a very bizarre situation complained 
pressler who suggested some reregulation would be in order 
that would require ticket prices to be linked to miles traveled 
hollings and danforth the ranking repubican on the committee 
also warned that airline fare and service practices could lead to 
some additional government controls on the industry 
in certain airports competition does not exist airlines get a 
lock on an airport and when they get a lock they can do pretty much 
what they please declared danforth 
he cited trans world airlines dominance at st louis where the 
airline controls 83 percent of the flights since its merger two 
years ago with ozark air line once its chief competitor single 
airlines also dominate at minneapolis pittsburgh and memphis said 
danforth 
burnley however defended his departments approval of 21 
airline mergers in recent years and maintained that even at the 
airports cited by the senators competition has been maintained 
not only has new entry by airlines occurred at each of these 
hubs but competing incumbent carriers continue to provide 
competitive service said burnley 
but when pressed by danforth burnely said the department has 
been disappointed at the level of competition as st louis lambert 
field since twas merger with ozark 
he said the department had expected for example that southwest 
airlines would move into the competitive void created by the 
twaozark merger with as many as 60 flights a day instead of the 22 
or 23 flights a day it currently operates through st louis 
id like to know why that has occurred said burnley 
promising the department would examine the competitive situation at 
the airport

the nuclear regulatory commission ruled today 
that the owners of the seabrook nh nuclear power plant must 
prove they could one day pay to shut down the plant if they are to 
be allowed to operate 
the commission voted unanimously to require the owners the 
submit a plan within 30 days that shows a reasonable assurance 
that adequate funding would be available for decommissioning the 
plant 
even if that issue is resolved the commission still has another 
financerelated issue facing it whether the owners are 
financially qualified to operate the plant 
seabrook officials expressed confidence the decommissioning 
question would be resolved in their favor 
were in the process of answering those questions right now 
and were confident this wont be an issue barring us from 
lowpower testing said ronald a sher spokesman for the 
reactors owner 
two financial problems with seabrook prompted opponents to 
challenge the owners financial fitness 
in january public service company of new hampshire the lead 
owner of the reactor filed for bankruptcy reorganization 
nrc chairman lando w zech jr said last week that the 
commission would not approve a lowpower license until it was 
satisfied seabrook could run safely despite the bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the second question revolves around the massachusetts municipal 
wholesale electric co which in june withdrew from the project and 
halted its 2 millionamonth payments mmwec owns 12 percent of 
the plant and other seabrook owners are working to secure investors 
to cover mmwecs payments through 1989 
the idle 56 billion reactor is losing 50 million each month 
in maintenance and finance costs 
if granted a lowpower license the reactor could operate at 5 
percent of full power and would need to be granted a further permit 
to operate at more than 5 percent of capacity

one of three hunts facing a 134 million federal 
court judgment did not follow the lead of his brothers in filing 
personal bankruptcy petitions because he did not have as much 
potential exposure in the claim a spokesman said thursday 
heirs to one of the worlds greatest fortunes nelson bunker and 
william herbert hunt two of the multimillionaire dallas brothers 
filed bankruptcy wednesday 
but attorneys say the filings wont affect previous chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings involving the brothers placid oil co 
owned by their trust estates 
jurors in a new york federal court decided aug 20 the two 
hunts their brother lamar and three other defendants must pay 
damages for conspiring in the late 1970s to corner the worlds 
silver market and ruining the investments of minpeco sa the 
peruvian governments mineral marketing company 
they the brothers are very upbeat there is not anybody 
hanging their head over this said a spokesman tom whitaker 
executive vice president for the hunt energy corp 
he said lamar hunt did not file a personal bankruptcy petition 
because he does not have the exposure of the other two brothers 
but the spokesman did not rule out the possibility of a later 
filing 
it was his lamars option not to file said whitaker he 
does not have the involvement in the potential silver litigation 
that bunker and herbert have he does have some exposure but not 
nearly as much 
whitaker declined to discuss why lamar hunt may be less involved 
in silver lawsuits than his brothers 
the hunts are optimistic about chances of getting a new trial or 
having damages reduced in their legal fight with the peruvian 
governments mining company said whitaker 
this reorganization was a business decision but they 
realized the decision would be painful to themselves and their 
family the spokesman said they are absolutely determined to 
fight this what we are calling the outrageous minpeco verdict 
meanwhile the chapter 11 reorganizations will avoid a fire 
sale in the wake of a required 225 million bond to appeal the 
court award to minpeco said whitaker 
us district judge morris e lasker of new york allowed a 
temporary stay against the bond 
herbert hunt in a statement said the personal filing will give 
him time to continue the fight to correct the injustice of the 
jury verdict the thought of even a dime going to the 
government of peru is repugnant 
the hunts maintain that peru as the secondlargest producer of 
silver in the world could only have profited as the silver price 
rose 
a fort worth texas bankruptcy attorney who is general counsel 
to placid oil said he was not surprised by the personal filings 
the ensuing events in the silver market and their results have 
made it clear that the individual brothers would have to take some 
action to be able to operate their original businesses said 
henry simon of simon anisman doby wilson amp skillern 
confirmation hearings for placid which begin monday before us 
bankruptcy judge harold abramson should be completed by the end of 
next week he said 
i dont think it the personal bankruptcy petitions have any 
effect on placid he said i believe placids reorganization 
will proceed and it will be a reorganized company 
by the end of next week we should have confirmation in which 
we satisfy that the plan is feasible that the company can pay for 
everything the us bankruptcy code provides and regarding 
deferred obligations whether there is a reasonable basis for the 
business plan so that creditors who vote for the plan have a 
reasonable chance of getting their money said simon 
whitaker said the two hunts personal bankruptcy petitions did 
not list value of their assets but that as the case proceeds 
through the bankruptcy court those values will be established 
however brief summaries of their assets detailed 13649 
byzantine coins and 44 pieces of a roman and greek bronze 
collection for herbert hunt bunker hunts petition noted ancient 
coins and various art objects and bronze statues 
bunker hunt listed oil and gas properties in 40 counties 
nationwide three gas plants 14 ranches 1390 acres of raw land 
a condo in kauai hawaii five cars and a host of other assets the 
dallas morning news reported 
herbert hunt listed halfinterest in a ski lodge in vail colo 
between onethird and onefourteenth interest in 3442 acres in 
louisiana a 3yearold cadillac and a 15yearold mercedes benz 
according to the newspaper 
rarely have brothers bunker herbert and lamar offered public 
glimpses of their empire once valued at some 6 billion but the 
silver crash prompted a 16 billion loss for bunker and herbert 
who had bought 59 million ounces of silver once estimated as 
onethird of the worlds supply 
other heavy losses in oil and real estate have according to 
some estimates cut the trios wealth to about 1 billion

the gasguzzlers are back 
the environmental protection agencys annual survey of auto 
gasoline mileage released thursday shows more models than ever 
paying the special gasguzzler tax on fuelhungry cars most of 
them expensive european luxury models 
the mileage champs are unchanged for the fourth straight year 
the top two cars are again japanese a general motors corp import 
and a honda 
in the luxury gasguzzler category for the first time are two 
cars bearing american nameplates the cadillac allante and the 
chrysler tc by maserati both have heavy italian input the 
cadillacs body and more than half the car by value is imported 
from italy and the chrysler is assembled in italy using many 
ussupplied components 
these are not the first us cars to pay the tax chrysler 
corps venerable chrysler fifth avenue and its nearly identical 
siblings the dodge diplomat and the plymouth fury were taxed in 
the 1987 model year they return to official guzzler status for 
1989 the last year of their production run after a year with 
mileage ratings good enough to take them off the list 
many analysts have noted buyer indifference to fuel economy in 
recent years of stable or declining gasoline prices 
the new models though reflect an increasing concern with high 
performance according to one observer 
if you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its 
performance image youre in more trouble today than if you have an 
official gasguzzler said ed miller a senior editor at wards 
automotive publications in detroit 
clarence ditlow director of the center for auto safety in 
washington an advocacy group that has frequently opposed 
relaxation of government fuel standards said we are going in 
the wrong direction we ought to be headed the other way and making 
gassippers 
but manufacturers he said think theyll make more in profits 
than they pay in penalties 
the tax really isnt objected to by the buyer of such 
luxurious chariots said kyle johnson of gms cadillac division 
it does not alter gms commitment to stay away from the 
gasguzzler tax on usbuilt cars 
the guzzlers are proliferating for 1987 18 models paid the 
tax last year 24 models were taxed this year 45 models are 
assessed counting five rollsroyces that escaped previously 
because their gross vehicle weight exceeded 6000 pounds the 
cutoff specified by the law the 1986 tax law changes closed that 
loophole 
other manufacturers with models subject to the tax are maserati 
under its own name ferrari mercedesbenz porsche astonmartin 
jaguar volvo and bmw 
the geo metro recorded 53 miles per gallon in the city and 58 
mpg on the highway geo is the new nameplate from general motors 
corp for the various imports of its chevrolet division the metro 
built by gms suzuki motors affiliate was sold in previous years 
as the chevrolet sprint 
second place went to the twoseater honda civic crx hf also for 
the fourth year in a row at 50 mpg city 56 highway 
last years ratings for the two cars were the same with the 
exception that the sprint recorded 54 mpg in city traffic 
engineers say repeat tests can yield different numbers and this 
variability is probably what happened to the fifth avenue family 
said chrysler corps tony cervone 
the car has not changed he said yet in the 1987 model year 
it got 16 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on this highway last year it 
was 1723 and this year it is 1623 
the tax enacted in 1975 to encourage efficiency when fuel 
shortages were feared gradually tightened until reaching its 
present form for 1986 models it is 500 the minimum for the 
fifth avenue diplomat and gran fury 
the allante a 50000plus twoseater got an announced 16 mpg 
in the city and 24 mpg on the highway last year and was not taxed 
it fell to 15 mpg city 23 highway this year with the use of a 
larger engine buyers gm hasnt found many will have to pay 
650 more 
the taxed chrysler tc by maserati some models escape is the 
turbocharged version using the 25liter 152 cubic inches engine 
and without topgear lockup in the automatic transmission it 
measured 17 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway cough up 
another 500 
the most fuelprofligate cars this year are four sports cars 
made by the british specialty manufacturer astonmartin and being 
sold in the united states for the first time all rated 811 
thats worth the top sticker addition of 3850 
another 1975 law requires manufacturers and importers to meet 
minimum mileage standards averaged over their fleets or face heavy 
fines the current standard is 275 mpg calculated from test 
results before epa applies deflation factors to the mileages it 
publishes the transportation department is considering a petition 
from gm for a lower standard for 1989 and 1990 as the department 
permitted for 1986 through 1988 
the tax applies to 225 mpg and below on the same calculation

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply rose in the week ended sept 12 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 30371 billion in the week ended sept 12 from 30357 
billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
38534 billion from 38495 billion 
on the other hand the narrowest measure of the money supply 
m1 fell to a seasonally adjusted 7821 billion from a revised 
7831 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
for the latest 13 weeks m1 averaged 7816 billion a 61 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks 
the fed said in mid1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent 
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 
percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since 
early 1987 
in other reports 
the federal reserve bank of new york reported commercial and 
industrial loans at major new york city banks rose 388 million 
compared with a gain of 358 million a week earlier 
the federal reserve said bank borrowings from the federal 
reserve system at the discount window averaged 124 billion up 
from 552 million 
the federal reserve bank of st louis reported that the 
monetary base the seasonally adjusted total of member bank 
reserves held at federal reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and 
in circulation was 2832 billion in the twoweek period ended 
wednesday up from 2811 billion two weeks earlier

the number of giant profitable corporations 
that legally paid no federal income tax was cut by more than half 
last year according to a new study but backers of the landmark 
1986 tax overhaul said thursday the figure may never drop to zero 
sixteen of 250 profitable companies surveyed by citizens for tax 
justice were able to wipe out their entire federal liability down 
from 40 in 1986 and 72 in 1982 according to citizens for tax 
justice a washingtonbased research group funded by unions 
churches and social groups some of the 16 disputed the report 
paul huard vice president of the national association of 
manufacturers criticized the report for what he called this 
horrorstory type of argument it is unfair to look at a 
companys taxes for one year only he said adding that the 
nature of corporate profits and tax accounting being what it is 
you are going to get these cyclical variations from year to year 
citizens for tax justice said most of the change was caused by 
the sweeping law enacted in 1986 which reduced or removed several 
individual and corporate deductions and credits while cutting tax 
rates 
tax reform has passed the most critical test of its 
effectiveness said robert mcintyre director of the organization 
tax reform may not have have made things less complex or 
cut everyones tax bill mcintyre told a news conference but 
tax reform has made great strides toward a system that puts all 
profitable corporations back on the tax rolls and that should 
over time help restore public confidence in our tax system 
sen bob packwood rore and bill bradley dnj key authors 
of the 1986 law voiced the same sentiments packwood said he was 
surprised that the number of legal tax avoiders had dropped so 
quickly 
some companies continue to hold loss carrybacks which are 
excess deductions that are used to wipe out past years tax 
liabilities and generate a currentyear refund packwood noted as 
those carrybacks are used up he predicted the number of companies 
paying no tax will continue to dwindle 
but there may never be a time when every profitable company pays 
a tax he said because companies may come up with things that we 
didnt think about when writing the law 
the bigget single corporate tax benefit remains accelerated 
depreciation which permits companies to recapture through the tax 
system part of the money spent for plant and equipment 
the report listed these 16 companies as having paid no federal 
income tax last year general motors ibm aetna life amp casualty 
baxter travenol laboratories carolina power amp light illinois 
power corning hewlettpackard ashland oil greyhound ogden 
sequa corp pennzoil goodyear tire amp rubber consumers power and 
gulf states utilities 
all but gulf states actually received refunds last year of 
pastyear taxes the report said general motors largely due to 
increased depreciation of automaking equipment received 742 
million while ibm received 1235 million in large part because 
of large tax payments to foreign countries the report said 
gm spokesman john hartnett disputed the reports findings with 
regard to the auto company saying gm paid 73 million in federal 
income taxes in 1987 he said the companys 1987 tax liability was 
less than in past years because of our nominal us operating 
profit our heavy investment in new and renovated plants and other 
factors 
the report is wrong in saying that ibm paid no federal 
income tax last year said ibm spokesman marti easterbrook while 
the company will receive a refund she said our net tax payment 
afer the refund will be in the millions of dollars 
elizabeth krupnick a spokesman for aetna denied the reports 
allegation that the giant insurer received a 32 million refund 
we sent in a check for 17 million and got no refund she said 
the annual survey of corporate taxes is based chiefly on 
stockholder reports filed by 250 of the nations largest profitable 
corporations the report deals only with taxes paid to the us 
government during a given tax year and does not accout for 
deferrals that could fall due in a future year 
thus an international company with large tax payments to 
foreign governments could be listed as paying no us taxes as 
could one that bought a large amount of equipment last year 
resulting in a deferral of liability 
among key findings 
the 250 paid 9 billion more in federal income last year than 
they would have paid under the old law 
as a group the 250 companies last year paid 27 billion in 
taxes on profits of 123 billion a 22 percent rate five years 
earlier they paid less than 12 percent on 87 billion net earnings 
the 14 largest corporations that paid no taxes in 1982 through 
1985 paid at an effective rate of 30 percent last year this list 
included atampt dupont boeing and dow chemical 
the 128 corporations that were off the federal tax rolls in at 
least one year from 1981 through 1985 paid an average rate of 195 
percent last year their average rate in 198185 was 37 percent 
the combined effective tax rate on the 250 corporations in the 
survey rose from 149 percent in 198185 to 221 percent in 1987 
their combined profits averaged 102 billion in each of the earlier 
years and 123 billion last year 
the number of giant profitable companies paying a tax rate of 
less than 10 percent has been cut in half to 55 
about twothirds of the 250 companies are paying a higher tax 
rate than before the new law was enacted about onefifth are 
paying a lower rate

members of a senate committee on thursday 
faulted airline deregulation for raising airfares for many 
americans and leaving some cities dominated by carriers that 
control local air service 
but transportation secretary jim burnley told the senate 
commerce committee that even though the airline industry has its 
flaws nearly 10 years of deregulation has benefited most 
travelers 
overall the airline industry has become much more competitive 
as to price and service as a result of economic deregulation 
burnley told the legislators 
burnley cited statistics showing that since 1978 domestic air 
traffic has grown from 275 million passengers to more than 450 
million while average fares have declined 13 percent adjusted for 
inflation 
the secretary said that if most americans are asked if 
deregulation has been helpful youll find an overwhelming 
perception that the country has benefited enormously 
burnleys defense however did little to ease the concerns of 
members of the committee many of whom come from sparsely populated 
states 
my fares have zoomed up up and away and my service has gone 
down said sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the panel 
hollings said it now costs him 510 to fly from charleston 
sc to washington compared with 120 in 1977 before 
deregulation which marks its 10th anniversary next month 
sen larry pressler rsd said it costs 269 to fly from 
aberdeen sd to rapid city sd while a washington to los 
angeles ticket can cost 239 
that is a very bizarre result he said our small cities 
and towns are really suffering from this thing 
sen john danforth of missouri ranking republican on the 
committee also complained that some airlines have been able to 
dominate air traffic so thoroughly in individual cities that 
competition doesnt really exist 
he said congress must determine whether deregulation is truly 
working and if its not working what are we supposed to do about 
it 
with the 1986 merger between trans world airlines and ozark air 
lines twa controls 82 percent of traffic at lambertst louis 
international airport a report released tuesday by the general 
accounting office an investigating arm of congress found that 
after the merger the number of st louis routes served by two or 
more carriers fell from 64 to 36 while twa fares from the city 
grew by 13 percent to 18 percent 
alfred e kahn who was chief of the nowdefunct civil 
aeronautics board in 1978 when deregulation was created told the 
senators that the airline industry is today far more competitive 
than it was under regulation 
to deal with problems faced by cities dominated by individual 
airlines he suggested tougher enforcement of antitrust laws when 
airline mergers are being considered allowing foreign airlines to 
purchase american carriers and taxing frequent flyer tickets to 
discourage repeated use of the same airline 
when deregulation began advocates argued that airlines would 
not be able to charge excessively high fares because competitors 
would be spawned who would set lower prices 
but critics have argued that it has been difficult for new 
airlines to start up because of the high costs involved and the 
lack of available space at many airports competition has also been 
diminished by the 26 airline mergers since 1985 and the increased 
dominance by individual carriers at certain airports across the 
country 
both sides in the dispute generally agree that deregulation has 
benefited vacation travelers who are able to take advantage of the 
proliferation of discount fares but passengers who must fly with 
insufficient advance notice or on inflexible schedules and those 
flying between small communities often find it difficult to find 
bargain fares 
with congress planning to adjourn next month it is unlikely 
that any legislation directed at the problems cited will be passed 
this year but lawmakers comments made it clear that airline 
deregulation is likely to come under close scrutiny when congress 
returns in january

the soviet union is opening its doors to 
the oncefeared copying machine through joint ventures with us 
partners 
two copying ventures announced this week were hailed as 
landmarks in the policies of glasnost and perestroika or openness 
and restructuring begun by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
alphagraphics printshops of the future a tucson arizbased 
chain of more than 250 print shops announced on thursday in new 
york that it plans to open its first two shops in moscow this 
winter 
alphagraphics said it will have two fullservice shops that will 
primarily serve foreign businesses members of the diplomatic press 
corps soviet government agencies and citizens who have access to 
hard currency 
a day earlier california businessman martin b lopata held a 
news conference at the soviet consulate in san francisco to 
announce plans to open kiosks in 18 hotels in moscow this winter 
the kiosks will offer overnight copying and printing services as 
well as selling computers and software audiovisual products 
advertising advice and american souvenirs books and magazines 
lopata said 
the soviet union has long exercised tight control over access to 
copiers duplicating machines and printing presses all of which 
are owned by the state lack of access to such services has been an 
obstacle to the many unofficial newspapers and journals that have 
sprung up under glasnost 
its a very very major political advance said jerry hough 
a soviet expert at duke university copying machines have been 
under lock and key and its been virtually illegal for most people 
to make copies in the soviet union 
laura frazer program officer at the us information agency in 
washington called the venture extremely radical because even 
most soviet government bureaucrats do not have access to copying 
machines 
alphagraphics is planning larger and more complete copying 
operations than lopata who plans to use the kiosks as collection 
points for copying that will be done at a central location 
a 50pound document that would cost 600 to 700 and take four 
days or so to ship from washington dc to moscow could be sent 
electronically and printed at an alphagraphics shop for about 30 
without danger of being stuck in customs said rodger ford the 
president and founder 
lopata said he sees his venture as a starting point for a wide 
variety of businesses 
this is a truly pioneering event lopata told a crowded news 
conference wednesday this will also be one of the first 
facilities to allow printing to the average soviet citizen 
lopata said the new business will be open to all soviets 
charging rubles and dollars plans are to open offices in moscow in 
january leningrad next summer and kiev a few months later he said 
the joint venture is an outgrowth of the gorbachevreagan moscow 
summit meeting earlier this year said soviet deputy consul general 
gennadiy i zolotov 
lopatas unicorn investments international is in a venture with 
mir the soviet publishing house and the soviet cooperative sintez 
dubbed sovaminco standing for sovietamerican international 
co the business was registered as a legal entity this week in 
moscow said zolotov and lopata the company is jointly owned by 
mir sintez and unicorn 
alphagraphics franchisee torontobased phargo management and 
consulting ltd is in a venture with kniga publishing house of 
moscow

a late rally that pushed grain and soybean futures prices higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade could mark a key reversal in 
the markets recent downward trend analysts said 
on other markets gold struggled back to 400 an ounce copper 
surged frozen pork bellies rose sharply while livestock futures 
were mixed energy futures were mostly higher and stockindex 
futures retreated 
soybeans for november delivery which had traded as high as 
903 a bushel just one week earlier swung in a 28cent range 
thursday plunging to 815 but settling near the days high at 
842 4 cents above wednesdays final price 
corn and wheat futures also finished moderately higher but were 
less volatile due to the supportive influence of new export 
business analysts said 
the soybean market liquidated early until there just wasnt 
any selling left below 820 then the strength in the wheat and 
corn really supported the bean complex said pat oconnell a 
grain analyst with refco inc a chicago futures brokerage 
i think the market told us today that its in good shape he 
said 
ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york said the drop to 815 appears now in hindsight to have 
been the end of the liquidation he said 
today could be a bullish key reversal agreed mario 
balletto soybean market analyst with merrill lynch capital markets 
in new york 
much of the buying apparently was based on indications of 
increased global demand for grain and soybeans particularly by the 
soviet union a large purchase this week of us soybean oil by 
pakistan also supported the soybean complex analysts said 
talk that the united states and the soviet union were nearing 
agreement on a new longterm grain agreement further fueled the 
rally analysts said 
wheat settled 5 cents to 6 cents higher with the december 
contract at 426 a bushel corn was cent to 3 cents higher 
with december at 291 a bushel oats were unchanged to 4 cents 
higher with december at 258 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower 
to 5 cents higher with november at 842 a bushel 
silver futures posted solid gains on new yorks commodity 
exchange and gold for october delivery rallied to 400 a troy 
ounce the psychologically important level the contract had 
breached a day earlier 
my gut feeling is that theres not much of any significance 
here said jack barbanel director of futures trading for gruntal 
amp co in new york 
he said the inflationsensitive gold market reacted to higher 
grain prices but that the lack of strong inflationary signals would 
continue to depress speculative buying 
buying could surface below 390 a troy ounce a level that gold 
is likely to reach within two or three weeks he said 
gold settled 60 cents to 80 cents higher with october at 400 a 
troy ounce silver was 71 cents to 73 cents higher with september 
at 625 a troy ounce 
copper futures soared on the commodity exchange resuming a 
monthlong upward trend linked to tight supplies and growing 
demand analysts said 
copper settled 18 cents to 305 cents higher with september at 
11535 a new lifetime high for that contract 
frozen pork belly futures surged as much as 182 cents a pound 
on the chicago mercantile exchange in a technical rally in the 
absence of fresh supplyanddemand factors analysts said 
hog futures were mostly higher in anticipation of a heavy 
weekend kill and cattle futures were mixed the bearish effect of 
weaker cash cattle markets was offset by expectations for higher 
cash prices analysts said 
live cattle settled 40 cent lower to 43 cent higher with 
october at 6940 cents a pound feeder cattle were 55 cent lower 
to 02 cent higher with september at 7920 cents a pound hogs were 
unchanged to 57 cent higher with october at 3925 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 95 cent to 182 cents higher with 
february at 5215 cents a pound

bond prices finished slightly lower thursday in 
sporadic trading failing to sustain their early gains of the 
session 
the treasurys closely watched 30year issue slipped point or 
250 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate 
trends rose to 903 percent from 901 percent late wednesday 
analysts said bond prices advanced early in the trading day in 
response to wednesdays positive news on inflation but lost ground 
later as gold prices rebounded 
the government reported wednesday that while consumer prices 
rose 04 percent in august inflation remained in check at the same 
52 percent annual rate as in july 
that makes bonds look good said john sebastian executive 
vice president of clayton brown amp associates an investment firm in 
chicago 
gold prices continued to slump early in the session trading 
below 400 a troy ounce the news on consumer prices and the fall 
in gold were positive for bond prices because they indicate an 
absence of inflationary pressures 
but the bond markets early gains soon were eroded when gold 
recovered analysts said the metal finished in new york at around 
399 an ounce up from 39635 late wednesday 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues slipped 132 point to 332 point intermediate 
maturities declined 332 point to 316 point and 20year issues 
were down point according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer fell 148 to 114346 
meanwhile corporate bonds inched higher moodys investment 
grade corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80

senate democrats failed thursday to break a 
republican filibuster of a bill clouded in presidential politics to 
raise the 335 an hour minimum wage for the first time since 1981 
on a 5343 vote seven short of the 60 needed the senate 
refused to limit to 30 more hours debate on legislation by sen 
edward m kennedy dmass to raise the wage floor to 375 in 
january 415 in 1990 and 455 in 1991 
its only clear that there is a deliberate attempt to stall 
action on this bill said majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva who called the republican tactics a filibuster 
sen orrin hatch rutah the leader of the republican 
opposition to any increase in the minimum wage that does not 
include a subminimum wage for new hires said the issue needs 
extended debate 
i know a little bit about filibustering and ive certainly led 
my share around here hatch said but i only lead them on very 
very important issues where we really have to have extended debate 
or what i would call extended educational dialogue this particular 
bill needs a lot of that 
hatch a week ago introduced the first republican amendment in 
the debate a 90day 80 percent subminimum wage applicable to all 
new hires 
as a parlimentary tactic kennedy immediately offered a 
substitute amendment slightly expanding a currently allowed but 
little used 85 percent subminimum wage for fulltime students who 
work no more than 20 hours a week 
since then there have been no votes in five days of debate 
under the senates rules approval of kennedys substitute would 
effectively kill what republicans call a subminimum training wage 
that president reagan and vice president george bush have coupled 
to their approval of any incease in the 335 wage floor 
were not going to get a fair hearing on the training wage 
because the labor leaders dont want it said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas its not the republicans versus the 
democrats its the republicans versus the labor leaders theyre 
telling us we can take this or leave it were not going to play 
that game 
aflcio president lane kirkland said republicans supporting the 
filibuster obviously know that the presidential nominee of their 
party george bush wasnt serious when he told americans he wanted 
an increase in the minimum wage 
bush has declined to specify in the past two weeks how a big an 
increase in the minimum wage he could support saying any raise 
should be coupled to a subminimum training wage 
his vice presidential running mate sen dan quayle rind 
this week again mentioned a raise to 4 over two years a proposal 
he submitted to the senate labor committee two months ago 
byrd scheduled a second cloture vote for friday in an effort to 
break the logjam amid indications that some of the support for the 
filibuster may be waning 
we may not be successful tomorrow but were going to try 
dole said 
three republicans sens lowell weicker of connecticut william 
roth of delaware and john chafee of rhode island joined 50 
democrats in thursdays vote to end the filibuster 
three democrats sens james exon of nebraska david boren of 
oklahoma and richard shelby of alabama joined republians in 
voting to allow it to continue 
its an open secret in the senate that the white house has 
asked the republicans to vote in favor of a filibuster kennedy 
said and the white house has asked them to keep on voting for a 
filibuster tomorrow and next week 
kennedy and other supporters of a minimum wage increase say it 
would only restore the 30 percent loss of purchasing power that 
inflation has taken away from workers on that bottom rung since 
it was last raised in 1981 
proponents said the raise will directly benfit some 15 million 
workers now paid below 455 an hour 
hatch however said only about 2 million of the minimum wage 
earners are what he called working poor heads of households 
the minimum wage really is irrelvevant except that by pushing 
up the bottom some 38 percent every other wage scale in the 
country has to go up correspondingly and the cost of every good 
and service in this country has to go up correspondingly he said 
the congressional budget office estimates that raising the 
minimum wage would increase the rate of inflation by 02 to 03 
percentage points a year inflation so far the first eight months 
of 1988 is running at 46 percent
