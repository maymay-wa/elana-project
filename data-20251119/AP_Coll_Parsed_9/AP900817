the speaker of iraqs parliament said friday that iraq will hold 
all foreigners from aggressive nations presumably including 
3000 americans until the threat of war against his country ends 
he said they would be housed throughout the country in military and 
civilian installations 
the white house refused comment friday night on baghdads 
announcement 
we dont have a reaction said doug davidson an assistant 
white house press secretary we may well have one in the 
morning 
the united states sent some of its most sophisticated offensive 
weapons to the region as the persian gulf crisis entered its third 
week 
included too were up to 38 commercial airliners which the 
pentagon said friday night were being turned over to the military 
to help haul troops and cargo overseas such a move by 16 airlines 
was the first time the us civilian air fleet has been diverted to 
a military use 
the moves continue in the aftermath of iraqs lightning invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 which precipitated the crisis and also trapped 
at least 4000 british citizens 
the people of iraq have decided to play host to the citizens 
of these aggressive nations as long as iraq remains threatened with 
an aggressive war speaker sadi mahdi said late friday in a 
statement carried by the official iraqi news agency 
mahdis announcement monitored in nicosia came after a meeting 
of iraqs revolutionary command council presided over by president 
saddam hussein 
mahdi said arrangements were being made for housing the 
foreigners with the ministries of oil and military installations 
the armed forces and other ministries military and oilrelated 
installations would be potential targets in an armed conflict 
the speaker urged all american and allied forces to withdraw 
from the region and attacked mandatory economic sanctions on iraq 
voted by the united nations saying these governments are 
going out of their way to starve the iraqi people in an 
unprecedentedly brutal fashion 
iraq which imports about threequarters of its food but is 
being impacted by an international blockade in the region holds an 
estimated 14000 westerners besides the americans and britons 
americans and other foreigners who feared being rounded up in 
kuwait disguised themselves as arabs drove through the kuwaiti 
desert in a convoy of 13 cars and reached saudi arabia on friday 
as soon as we left the paved road we ran into iraqis and they 
said we had to go back said stephanie mcgehee 37 one of at 
least three americans in the group we moved away and then took 
another turn through the desert sands and made a dash for it 
it was very very terrifying 
mcgehee an associated press photographer and parttime 
correspondent from leucadia calif reported by telephone from the 
khafji border post that the entire convoy was safe and sound it 
was not clear how many escaped though her car carried nine 
including a canadian friend one briton and four indians 
in new york the un security council expressed concern over 
the fate of the detained foreigners and asked the secretarygeneral 
to take all necessary steps to help them 
at the same time a special security council committee met to 
discuss compliance with the international embargo intended to force 
iraq to withdraw its troops from kuwait and the saudi border 
if the panel decides the boycott is not being honored the 
security council can declare a military blockade and urge member 
states to enforce it 
that would be an important development for the united states 
which did not seek un approval before ordering its ships in the 
middle east to intercept vessels carrying goods to or from iraq or 
kuwait 
the pentagon said navy commanders stopped two iraqi vessels in 
the persian gulf on friday but let them proceed after determining 
they carried no goods 
washington recently decided to strengthen its forces by adding 
stealth fighterbombers and amphibious assault ships among other 
offensive weapons and on friday president bush decided to call up 
some military reserve units administration officials in washington 
said 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said friday the 
soviet union would send troops to the persian gulf if the united 
nations calls for a multinational military force to solve the 
crisis 
japan also was considering joining the forces defending saudi 
arabia against a possible iraqi attack it may break with its 
longheld policy against deployment of military equipment overseas 
perhaps by sending minesweepers 
concern about the us citizens detained in occupied kuwait and 
iraq grew friday after about three dozen americans in the rashid 
hotel in baghdad were reportedly moved to an undisclosed location 
bush protested attempts to move americans against their will 
us officials in the iraqi capital demanded access to the 
detainees who were taken to iraq from kuwait after iraq invaded 
the emirate to increase its share of world oil reserves to 20 
percent 
the iraqi invasion stranded more than 2 million foreigners 
including more than 450 japanese 
about 6500 foreigners fled to jordan from iraq and kuwait on 
friday 
bush asked what would happen if the americans in kuwait were 
taken to iraq said i dont think anybody ought to be moved 
against their will in contravention of international law 
rep stephen solarz dny on a stop in israel went further 
saying iraq would face american military retaliation if americans 
were harmed 
in other crisisrelated developments friday 
iraq freed 1000 prisoners of its 198088 war with iran and 
started pulling iraqi troops back from the iranian border part of 
its campaign to focus on the escalating confrontation with the 
united states it has about 300000 troops facing iran and could 
send some to kuwait and the saudi border 
prices fell broadly on the new york stock exchange echoing 
losses overseas amid continued concern about the mideast the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 3664 to 264480 and 
at one point was down by as much as 65 points 
lebanons most influential shiite moslem cleric sheik mohammed 
hussein fadlallah called for a panislamic confrontation of us 
military forces in the gulf america has declared war on islam 
so let us confront the immense challenge that threatens 
us all said fadlallah spiritual guide of the fundamentalist

the three young cops did a doubletake when they 
spotted the citys mostarrested burglar sitting in the back room 
of chicago joes but there was nothing to worry about 
joseph pops panczko a 12time loser with more than 150 
arrests under his belt was in good hands the plainclothes 
detectives and the fbi agent were chipping in for his shrimp 
dinner and the advertising executive was plying him with shots and 
beer 
it was the monthly meeting of the merry gangsters and panczko 
a frequent guest of the state was the guest of honor 
despite their fearsome name the gangsters are just a group of 
otherwise reputable citizens who take pride in chicagos sordid 
past 
we just sit around and talk said retired adman billy 
reilly who founded the group with friends richard lindberg and 
nathan kaplan a year and a half ago 
much of the talk is about mobsters and madams but honor is also 
paid to corrupt cops and greedy politicians 
you can never get tired of this city its got real people in 
it real characters said kaplan 69 a freelance writer and 
retired salesman i go to other cities and watch the news i see 
their city councils theyve got straight bellies and good posture 
they use good diction i dont feel like im with real people 
by kaplans definition panczko 72 is a real person complete 
with potbelly 
despite his 50plus years as a professional criminal he was 
greeted affectionately tuesday night by the gangster regulars 
including burt neilson and jim brindisi both retired detectives 
panczko also got a special hello from a newcomer fbi agent bill 
clancy 
ive heard a lot about you pops but dont worry im a 
specialist in whitecollar crime clancy said 
theres nothing white collar about panczko who got his nickname 
from the only legitimate job he ever tried driving a softdrink 
truck 
i hated them calling me hey pop man so i went back to 
stealing he said 
i started stealing chickens when i was 11 and got my first 
pinch for swiping some of those dago cheeses you grind up and put 
on spaghetti said panczko if it wasnt wired down i stole it 
or maybe my brothers did one time i took the milkmans whole 
wagon horse too and my brother butch stole a cement mixer once 
somebody watched him and got him pinched him and the junkyard guy 
he sold it to 
panczko said he once paid a policeman a 1000 bribe to overlook 
the heist of a load of socks from the trunk of a salesmans car 
and then got only 20 for the socks 
damn cops thats where all my money went he complained 
gangster member lindberg the official historian of the chicago 
white sox smiled 
dicks writing a true history of the chicago police said 
reilly hell probably be arrested 
gangster member harold rubin of cicero does some filching too 
but he does his legally moving in on former mobowned buildings 
one step ahead of the wreckers 
a dealer in al capone memorabilia rubin isnt content with the 
small trophies like guns autographs and capones barbers straight 
razor he wants the impressive stuff too 
i just went into the old 4811 club in cicero the old 
gambling dive and i got some great items he said i got the 
26 table thats the dice game you played against the young ladies 
with the big busts you wouldnt know if you won or lost i also 
got the cell door 
cell door 
yeah they had this jail cell in the basement for guys who 
couldnt pay their tabs he said i pulled the door out of a 
couple of feet of water 
rubin said one of his coups was removing the interior marble 
from the lexington hotel a onetime capone headquarters 
kenan heise a chicago tribune obituary editor and historian 
spoke of another caponeowned hotel the metropole 
it was a beautiful place in its day and when my first book 
came out in 1971 i gave the publication party there he 
remembered it was a whorehouse by then though and i had a 
little trouble explaining what kind of party i wanted

saddam husseins takeover of kuwait wasnt 24 
hours old when the senate interrupted its business to deplore it 
and denounce him but what was that echo in the chamber 
why did a senator or two refer in a lookingoverhisshoulder 
way to the gulf of tonkin resolution 
why did minds turn back to an august debate 26 years ago in 
that debate the senate over the misgivings of only two senators 
reacted to reports that us navy vessels had been attacked off 
north vietnams coast by authorizing president lyndon johnson to 
prevent further aggression 
lbj used that resolution as the equivalent of a declaration of 
war the basis on which he sent 250000 american soldiers to fight 
an asian war americas longest war the first it lost 
almost by stealth america was sucked into a guerrilla war on 
the side of an unpopular government johnson hoped each escalation 
would be enough only to find that each instead made withdrawal 
more difficult 
and vietnam deteriorated into a quagmire an inextricable 
situation the united states couldnt win and couldnt quit 
is the gulf crisis another quagmire in the making another place 
where us forces cant win and cant get out stuck in 100 degree 
heat unable to do more than wait to react to saddam hussein does 
history offer some guidance here 
for the most part historians familiar with the region and with 
the ways war develop are more optimistic than that they find some 
similarities to vietnam but they draw encouragement from some big 
differences 
not the least of which said john gaddis diplomatic 
historian at ohio university in athens ohio is that this thing 
really is a multinational effort that grows out of a rather 
shocking provocation and neither was true in vietnam 
bernard lewis a retired princeton university historian and 
author of 20 books on the islamic world said saddam hussein made a 
crucial miscalculation last weekend he sought to turn his invasion 
of iraq into a religious crusade instead said lewis he only 
succeeded in isolating himself even in the arab world 
if his maneuver had worked saddam might have made his battle 
into an arabagainstthewest struggle instead he made it 
theworldagainstiraq lewis said 
saddam called for a jihad a religious war for the arab masses 
to rise up against their leaders and he did it just as the leaders 
were assembled in a summit at cairo 
they were hesitating when he produced this call to jihad 
said lewis this was a direct challenge it was an act of 
desperation 
in response the leaders of egypt syria saudi arabia and the 
other oil states of the persian gulf in an extraordinary rebuff to 
a fellow arab decided to send a military force to protect saudi 
arabia from saddam 
in vietnam by contrast americas allies even in asia largely 
limited their support to the sidelines only australia new 
zealand thailand and korea sent sizeable combat contingents 
political scientist nathan brown a mideast specialist at george 
washington university said quagmire in the persian gulf may be 
the best we can hope for considering the alternatives a 
humiliating us withdrawal or a military offensive against the 
iraqis in kuwait requiring a scale of warfare that is 
politically impossible 
brown questions whether the bush administration thought through 
its options 
even if iraq gains enough control in the region to restrict 
petroleum output and boost the price im not sure the 
repercussions are serious enough to say our national security is at 
stake brown said 
the worst that people are talking about is a recession 
brown said weve lived through recessions before that doesnt 
really affect our national security 
brown recalls the suez crisis of 1956 when britain in a break 
with the united states decided it simply could not permit the 
canal to fall into egypts hands but thats what happened eleven 
years later in the 1967 arabisrael war the canal was closed for 
seven years and nobody noticed 
but lewis views the threat of saddam controlling the oilfields 
of iraq kuwait and saudi arabia as graver than that 
you simply cant allow this man to obtain a stranglehold on 
the worlds supplies he said 
george herring a university of kentucky historian of the 
vietnam war said he sees in the persian gulf one big similarity to 
vietnam and one big difference 
the difference he said is that the american commitment to 
vietnam was slow and as concealed as lyndon johnson could manage 
it grew from a few hundred us troops sent to advise the french in 
the 1950s to more than 200000 troops engaged in fullfledged 
combat in july 1965 
in contrast the persian gulf operations has been sudden and 
dramatically large herring said where johnson sought to 
underplay the buildup president bush broadcasts his determination 
to commit whatever force it takes to pry iraq out of kuwait 
the similarity herring said is in the nature of the beast 
you are dealing with all the vietnam policymakers have admitted in 
the last 10 or 15 years that the crucial mistake they made was 
underestimating the enemy and the enemys willingness to make huge 
sacrifices 
if they miss that this time were in bad shape herring 
said they should have seen it in the iraniraq war they missed 
it in the french war against the vietnamese 
gaddis said the proper analogy is korea not vietnam then as 
now he said there was a swift crossborder invasion then as now 
it was met by a multinational unbacked response 
korea became an american quagmire too but gaddis sees a 
crucially different factor at play this time 
korea proved difficult to get out of but what kept us there 
was chinese intervention in november 1950 he said whats 
interesting this time is that this is the first crisis where the 
great powers have all been in agreement saddam hussein doesnt 
have that ability to play the superpowers against each other its 
been a most remarkable thing the unanimity that bush has been able 
to rally behind him 
kenneth oye of massachusetts institute of technology an expert 
on economic warfare also finds remarkable the degree of compliance 
bush has commanded so far in his call for an international embargo 
against iraq 
but he questions the staying power of nations for whom sanctions 
against iraq and life without oil from iraq and kuwait will be 
painful 
if saddam hussein makes no big moves doesnt use poison gas 
doesnt go into jordan doesnt stage air raids on the turkish 
border if he just sits tight i suspect that international support 
for sanctions will lose ground oye says and if they are not 
universally supported they lose their effectiveness 
he notes how president jimmy carters grain embargo to punish 
the soviet union for its afghanistan invasion became so unpopular 
with farmers that ronald reagan used it as an issue in his campaign 
against carter 
lewis concurs that patience is the key he says saddam clearly 
hopes the american people and business with their famously short 
attention span ultimately will pressure bush to bring the boys 
home just as public opinion ultimately forced the united states 
to find a facesaving formula for leaving vietnam with the war 
unwon 
but this time he thinks it wont work my guess is that the 
iraqis will break under the pressure of sanctions before american 
patience wears out but thats the key question 
bush compares saddam not to ho chi minh the ideologically 
driven strategist who commanded communist forces in vietnam but to 
adolf hitler a dictator who invaded his neighbors to enlarge his 
fascist reich 
historians lewis and gaddis find the comparison apt 
i think what happened in kuwait is very much the decision of 
one irrational leader and not some new trend in world politics 
said gaddis it is almost a reversion to the way leaders used to 
act in the 1930s 
said lewis if one can invade another country and get away 
with it were back in the 1930s were back in the international 
jungles then the world will belong to the violent and the 
ruthless

stay out of the music scene for four years 
and look what happens 
british soul stylist paul young can tell you all about it after 
his third album between two fires ran its course in 1986 he 
slowed down to start a family he then took two more years to put 
together his latest album other voices 
while he was gone the motown sound returned to the charts with 
blueeyed soul singers and fellow brits at the helm george 
michael simply red and lisa stansfield young returned just in 
time 
people could say ive been away long enough to be forgotten 
he said in an interview in some territories it is long enough 
to be forgotten but in other territories its been a break and 
thats not such a bad thing 
young began other voices with the same staff he had used on 
his three previous albums but was unsatisfied with the results 
six months work as he said went down the pan 
so he started anew he brought in plenty of guest musicians 
pink floyds david gilmour on guitar singer chaka khan on backing 
vocals and stevie wonder on harmonica nile rodgers produced a 
track and two more were done with former j geils band leader 
peter wolf 
but young still felt he had to get back to his roots in britain 
and did some recording there as well 
working with peter i was coming up with music that was very 
different from what id done before much more american he said 
my biggest audience is in europe and i cant ignore that 
other voices is filled with material by other artists 
including covers of the chilites oh girl and frees a 
little bit of love young sees doing these songs as a way of 
distancing himself from his own material 
id like to forget that i wrote them and approach them as an 
arranger and then i could probably enjoy it more he said but 
underneath it theres always my song and so i see it one 
particular way that somehow stops me from doing certain things 
with other songs ive heard them one way i see them another 
way so straightaway ive got this choice of things i can do with 
it and i think that makes it more enjoyable 
he also sees doing covers as a way to keep great old songs 
alive but likes to look for the less wellknown standards 
i tend to prefer finding songs that are little gems in the 
dust as it were and making them out to be something special 
because maybe they the audience missed it the first time 
round he said 
i dont like a lot of music that loses track of its roots i 
hope that what im doing when i do these things is keeping the old 
stuff in their minds but keeping up to date in terms of how i work 
the arrangements what instruments i use stuff like that 
on other voices young said he went back to playing a lot 
of stuff live again and not using too much machinery i think the 
trick is to use the machinery but still make it sound very human 
songwriting is not his forte he said but hes looking to 
change that 
i think i was working with a guy who also found it very hard 
to be a songwriter and that made it even more difficult he said 
so now ive made some contacts with people who actually enjoy the 
process of being stuck in a room for eight hours which i dont 
find in the least bit inviting 
youngs solo career began in 1982 after 3 years with the soul 
outfit the qtips his first break came in 1983 with a version of 
the marvin gaye classic wherever i lay my hat which stayed at 
no 1 in england for three weeks his debut album no parlez 
also reached the top of the charts there 
his longawaited us success came with the top 20 song come 
back and stay also from no parlez but his second album 
the secret of association released in 1985 contained his 
first us no 1 hit everytime you go away written by daryl 
hall of hall and oates 
he doesnt necessarily see other voices as a progression 
but rather a beginning of new things 
i think ive now built myself another little base to work 
from he said its a pretty good mixture of what the last 
three albums had done and its now on one album theres quite a 
few indications of ways i could go

citizens of tver and dozens of other 
soviet cities are casting off the names and symbols of a painful 
past 
the people of this ancient city 100 miles northwest of moscow 
started by taking back the name it bore for centuries before stalin 
called it kalinin for a henchman born near tver 
to catherine the great the city was the most beautiful in the 
empire after st petersburg now leningrad because of its 18th 
century architecture as the namesake of mikhail kalinin it became 
a reminder of repression and death 
gorky street in moscow the capitals main thoroughfare has 
been changed back to tverskaya street fashionable shops and stores 
lined the street before the bolshevik revolution and outside the 
city it became the main road to tver 
on july 19 the front page of kalininskaya pravda the local 
newspaper carried a decree signed by boris n yeltsin president 
of the russian republic it said the republics presidium 
decrees rename the city kalinin to the city tver 
yeltsin had reversed half a century and fulfilled a dream of 
many residents 
a poem published with the decree said well goodbye kalinin 
you were just a pseudonym of our returning tver 
now even the newspaper will have to call itself something else 
the name game is sweeping this vast country for decades 
cities streets ships farms and factories were renamed for 
bolshevik heroes and officials 
then as political times changed under mikhail s gorbachev and 
history was rewritten some of the officials were disgraced and the 
circle was completed 
naberezhni chelny renamed brezhnev was returned to its 
original name tsaritsyn renamed stalingrad became volgograd 
other name changes actual or likely include the emergence of old 
samara from kuibyshev nizhny novgorod from gorky transformation 
of kirov to vzyatka sverdlovsk to old ekaterinburg andropov to 
rybinsk the rescue of marnupol from zhdanov lugansk from 
voroshilovgrad and vladikavkaz from ordzhonikidze 
some people who are fed up with the old order even want to 
change leningrad back to st petersburg 
the name of mikhail kalinin the soviet president in 19381946 
was attached to many places other than tver which became kalinin 
on his birthday in 1931 
koenigsberg a historic german city incorporated into the soviet 
union at the end of world war ii became kaliningrad major streets 
in other soviet cities including moscow honor kalinin 
he was a figurehead president hated by victims of the 
collectivization of agriculture a dark period in the countrys 
history 
millions of people were arrested and executed as enemies of 
the people during the collectivization of the 1930s including 
many from kalinins home region some of the bodies are believed to 
have been dumped into mass unmarked graves near tver 
the campaign to regain kalinins old name began in the 1960s 
but did not get far until gorbachev and glasnost came along eleven 
engineers and intellectuals founded a group called return in march 
1988 with that as its goal 
boris yershov a leader of the group and a local legislator 
said returns members were described at first as extremists 
sometimes as hooligans 
people asked how could you insult the memory of mikhail 
kalinin a leading figure in the party government and society 
yershov said 
when we said he wasnt a leading figure of the party and the 
government people just didnt believe us people were so fooled by 
the propaganda for years for decades about our leaders they 
just didnt accept our words 
support for return gradually increased yershov said and people 
began asking if kalinin is not the person hes made out to be 
why do we bear his name why such a supreme honor to a person who 
promoted stalins crimes 
more than 14000 of the citys 475000 people signed a petition 
last year demanding it be called tver again local party and 
legislative bodies eventually gave their support and the idea was 
ratified by yeltsin a radical reformer elected president of 
russia the countrys largest republic in june 
residents interviewed the day yeltsins decree was published 
said the move was welcome but they also wanted other changes 
im not in a festive mood said natalya drozdenko a woman 
in her mid30s waiting in a long line to buy chickens 
its only right to change the name and we have been struggling 
for it lending our signatures to petitions etcetera but somehow 
i understand its only symbolic and it wont affect our 
wellbeing 
alexander bartyenyev an 84yearold world war ii veteran 
strolling past the shops remembers when the city was still called 
tver and said mikhail kalinin never deserved the honor 
kalinin was treated as one of our own bartyenyev said he 
was born here and worked here but as president of the country he 
could not stop the bloodletting 
yershov said his organization now would turn its attention to 
restoring monuments churches and the old street names

dutch customs officials have 
enlisted a chemical fingerprinting method to spot any iraqi or 
kuwaiti oil smuggled into rotterdam europes largest oil port in 
violation of sanctions 
the method relies on a process known as gas chromatography and 
is already used by oil companies and by a government agency trying 
to identify sources of north sea oil pollution customs service 
spokesman cornelis verlaan said thursday 
verlaan told the associated press the customs laboratory in 
amsterdam now plans to use the technique to check samples of crude 
oil shipments arriving in rotterdam 
in line with the aug 6 un embargo the netherlands has banned 
all iraqi and kuwaiti oil imports and transshipments through 
rotterdam europes largest refining center and site of a huge oil 
spot market the un action was to punish iraqi for its miitary 
takeover of kuwait on aug 2 
verlaan said it takes five to six weeks for an oil tanker to 
reach rotterdam so no oil loaded after aug 7 has arrived here 
yet 
the identification process is based on differences in texture 
and chemical composition found in every oil fields deposits 
verlaan said samples taken in rotterdam will be compared with a 
file of about 40 crude samples including those from iraq and 
kuwait 
you kind of take a fingerprint said verlaan if were in 
a real hurry we can conduct an analysis in 24 hours 
he said the procedure is now about 80 percent accurate adding 
were refining the technique all the time 
verlaan conceded that crude oil could be tampered with on its 
way to rotterdam but said you would see an entirely different 
picture than with oil that hasnt been doctored 
oil companies are using the process to check on the origin of 
their crude 
the traffic and waterways ministry has been using the gas 
chromatography technique to trace ships suspected of causing north 
sea oil spills verlaan said

following is the text of iraqi president 
saddam husseins open letter to president bush broadcast by the 
iraqi media in arabic and translated by the associated press 
in the name of god the almighty the compassionate 
an open letter to the president of the united states 
i have become aware of your latest statements and heated 
comments before the staff of the american defense ministry that 
reflected your intention in pursuing a policy harmful to iraq a 
policy of occupation that humiliates the sacred shrine and lands of 
the arabs and moslems in hijaz and najd 
i will not hesitate mr president to tell you that while i 
read your words that reflected clearly your mockery and disregard 
for the arab mentality and national and official arab sentiment 
your shallowness became so apparent i had thought you were more 
farsighted than that and i cannot but admit that my conviction in 
the just policy chosen by the iraqi people which i serve and lead 
has increased and so has increased my conviction in the 
righteousness of every patriotic arab and moslem who supports the 
path of holy war against the invading forces 
you have tried you as a president of a superpower along 
with your small agents to brand saddam hussein a liar after 
failing to stab him in other ways you all whose files are 
thickest in this respect 
you and your business partners in the region and your agents 
have said that saddam hussein promised egyptian president hosni 
mubarak that he would not do this or that yet he did although you 
are fully aware that it is beyond your wildest dream that saddam 
hussein should lie because he who lies will undoubtedly lose the 
ability of persuasion lose the drive for determination and lose 
the basic requirements for confidence 
what you the policymakers in the united states and your 
small agents in the region hate above all is the veracity of men 
and the most hated among these men is saddam hussein because his 
sincerity toward principles toward himself his people and his 
country make of him a true servant and leader of the people not a 
servant for the foreigner you consider those liars in the region 
your trusted friends although you are fully aware who is the liar 
and who are the liars in the region 
the western public opinion even the american public opinion 
will be on the side of righteousness so that even when the 
confrontation intensifies and the speeches become abundant your 
face and that of your mutilated allies will be unveiled and the 
americans will tell you we have unified america with blood so why 
are you acting against the unity of the people of iraq who were 
split by colonialism and why are you falling in the laps of those 
retarded opportunists 
they will ask you where are these legitimate interests that 
are threatened by iraq when they realize that iraq welcomes the 
legitimate interests the anger of the american people will rise 
and it is then that your downfall will come and the defeat will be 
inevitable for the forces that you had massed and hoped to use to 
terrorize the arab nation this great nation from which emerged the 
prophets and holy books 
you have lied mr us president to your people when you 
told them that you were massing troops to protect american 
interests in saudi arabia now you tell them that you did that to 
force iraq to withdraw from kuwait you never asked yourself if it 
is permissible that iraq asks you to withdraw from southern states 
in america will you respond to such a request if it were made 
we are on our soil kuwaitis and iraqis are all iraqis 
eternally the borders of iraq from the begining of times were 
zako in the north through the city of nidaa and the city of kuwait 
in the south along the sea the iraqis with their own irrevocable 
will have become one people as their history dictates despite the 
split caused by colonialism during which and for a short period 
they lived within fences set up by colonialism 
that era is gone and there is no way that the retarded oil 
emirs will ever be allowed back after they had mutilated the image 
of an arab by sitting on thrones and bringing shame to the arabs 
through their behavior and their alliances with their likes among 
the westerners and the americans 
you must be loyal to your people you elected president of the 
united states of america you must tell them that you have made a 
mistake and took hasty decisions after you had been misled by those 
who misled you 
and then you must ask for our help to save face by agreeing to 
measures and arrangements that will not change the core of what has 
been achieved in terms of the unit of iraq people and land you 
must be sincere to your people and tell them that the arab and 
islamic public opinion is against your presence on the land of holy 
messages and prophets and against your aggression against sacred 
shrines and iraq tell them that they will fight schemes and that 
pure souls will be sacrificed in the defense of the principles the 
sacred shrines and patriotic dignity and you will be defeated 
because there is no chance for the bad to win over the good among 
people clinging to justice righteousness and equality 
mr president arent you sad as you boast about democracy 
that your allies are the retarded thieves and liars among the 
arabs while the believers the warriors and the elite be on the 
opposite side 
but despite all that we will continue to pray and pray hard 
that there will be no confrontation by which you will receive 
thousands of americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed 
them into a dark tunnel 
the doors of heavens are open to all arabs and the scent is 
so sweet the opportunity for a respectable life is here and the 
doors of jihad holy war which angered the rude bush are open to 
all moslems and believers 
god is great the infidels and aggressors will be defeated 
pride and dignity will go to the arabs moslems and the 
supporters of righteousness

no one knows for sure how many people 
have died in liberias bloody civil war this is the story of a 
9monthold baby who survived 
last week doctors from the humanitarian organization doctors 
without borders evacuated 300 patients from st josephs roman 
catholic hospital in this suburb of monrovia 
heavy fighting was going on next to the hospital the last 
working clinic anywhere near the capital the doctors could not 
take everyone on the long trip behind rebel lines 
on tuesday a foreign correspondent entered the hospital morgue 
which was filled with corpses of those left behind 
a child was lying next to her mother eyes frozen in the blank 
stare of death the body of the childs mother lay next to her 
said hospital workers they did not know how long the woman had 
been dead 
after months of exposure to the brutality of liberias war many 
of the journalists covering it have developed thick skins fighters 
on both sides have gleefully shot civilians in front of journalists 
and photographers 
so it was only a fluke that steven smith looking at the body of 
the railthin infant was moved to close the babys eyes 
as his thumb brushed the babys eyelash she blinked and the 
vacant stare transformed into consciousness 
the girl appeared to have nearly starved to death having had no 
mothers milk or any other food since her mother died 
after several hours of treatment by one of the liberian nurses 
still staffing the hospital the baby appeared to have revived the 
next day smith africa editor for the parisian newspaper 
liberation decided to find a safer location for the infant 
there were few people left in monrovias eastern suburbs but 
the journalist knew one man who might be able to help so the child 
was taken to an italian with the last name of albertini who 
managed an italian construction company and has stayed behind to 
watch over the italian embassy residences 
albertini whose first name was not immediately available 
promised he would do what he could to look after the child 
no one knows the name her parents gave her but the journalist 
said that in recognition of albertinis compassion the child would 
be called albertina

gov l douglas wilder told virginians on 
thursday night he will freeze state employee salaries cut state 
spending by 375 million and consider eliminating some agencies to 
cope with budget woes 
some layoffs and office closings will result from the proposals 
to deal with a projected 14 billion shortfall in the states 26 
billion 19901992 budget the governor said in a statewide 
televised address 
my plan is tough but fair wilder said this plan requires 
government to be more efficient and effective in its use of scarce 
resources 
wilder said he would not recommend any increase in taxes would 
not reduce direct aid payments to the poor and medically needy 
would maintain public safety funding and would keep a 200 million 
budget reserve for emergencies 
the major points of his plan included 
reducing state agency budgets by nearly 375 million over the 
next two years 
every agency of state government including colleges and 
universities direct service agencies administrative agencies 
and yes even the office of the governor will reduce 
expenditures he said 
wilder said some employees will be laid off some field offices 
will be closed and some agencies and programs will be eliminated 
eliminate state funding for private museums foundations and 
attractions these projects cost 11 million in the current 
twoyear budget he said their funding will be reduced this fiscal 
year and recommended for elimination next fiscal year wilder said 
continue a moratorium on state construction for all but the 
most essential projects about 300 million in projected lottery 
profits over the next two years will go to operating expenses 
instead of building construction 
withhold 2 percent salary increases that state employees were 
to have received in december saving more than 145 million 
reduce state aid to localities which makes up more than half 
the states budget wilder did not specify how much aid would be 
reduced 
wilder said he will ask the general assembly in january to 
eliminate the department of world trade and possibly the department 
of volunteerism the council on the status of women and the council 
on indians 
the governor also said he will look into consolidating 
childrens services handled by several state agencies 
he said he would study cutting the use of stateowned vehicles 
cutting the number of field offices in the department of motor 
vehicles and providing an early retirement program to reduce the 
state work force 
in a 14minute televised response republicans said the governor 
had borrowed many of their ideas for budget cutting but still did 
not go far enough 
i think the governor has barely touched on any budget 
reform said del clint miller 
another republican delegate vincent f callahan jr said 
virginians still may wind up paying more taxes despite wilders 
nonewtaxes pledge 
the governor did not provide details on how his spending cuts 
and other savings would add up to 14 billion he said he would 
give specifics in an address friday to the money committees of the 
general assembly

saddam hussein is invoking the cultural 
glories of iraqs ancient empires and their legendary warriorkings 
like nebuchadnezzar ii of babylon to enhance his claim to be the 
new champion of the arab world 
the iraqi president has rewritten history books and purports to 
be a descendant of the prophet mohammed who founded islam in the 
6th century he has employed more than 1000 workers and spent 
millions to rebuild babylon capital of nebuchadnezzars empire 
saddam seeks to rally support among the worlds estimated 1 
billion moslems and legitimize his crusade against the west and 
israel in their eyes as he finds himself facing a usled 
international quarantine for invading kuwait on aug 2 
saddams evocation of iraqs ancient dynasties has given rise to 
suspicions among other arabs that he harbors imperial ambitions 
nebuchadnezzars empire embraced kuwait now gobbled up by iraq 
and what are now syria jordan israel and saudi arabia 
saddam 54 has been shrouding himself in the mythology of 
iraqs historical heyday from the 6th century bc to the 8th 
century to consolidate his power 
around this he has created an allpervasive personality cult 
huge posters and wall paintings of saddam in noble pose are 
everpresent as are photos of him on front pages of iraqi 
newspapers 
a plaque in the shiite moslem mosque of imam hussein in the holy 
city of karbala in southern iraq shows a family tree that 
supposedly proves that the former peasant boy can trace his lineage 
back to mohammed through the hashemite kings of arabia 
the information ministry in baghdad freely hands out copies 
although the accuracy of the family tree cannot be authenticated 
and many noniraqi arabs are highly skeptical of its provenance 
but to help it along saddam has in the last couple of years 
rehabilitated the once discredited hashemite monarchy of iraq 
overthrown in a 1958 coup and denounced as a british puppet regime 
iraqis like to point out that ancient mesopotamia in 
presentday iraq is generally viewed as the cradle of 
civilization mesopotamis means the land between the rivers 
the euphrates and the tigris 
archaeological excavations have produced evidence of settlements 
dating from 7000 bc the garden of eden is reputed to have been 
at alqurna where the euphrates and tigris join 
saddams most ambitious effort to project himself as the new 
nebuchadnezzar has been the resurrection of babylon the jewel of 
mesopotamian civilization 
saddam began rebuilding babylon four years ago during the 
198088 war with iran he brought in more than 1000 laborers from 
sudan to toil in the desert heat on the banks of the euphrates to 
rebuild nebuchadnezzars southern palace and other parts of the 
ruined city 60 miles north of baghdad 
by encouraging iraqis to steep themselves in the glories of 
babylon and those of the great mesopotamian cultures that 
flourished around the cities of nineveh nimrud and ur saddam 
sought to boost national morale as well as enhance his own dynastic 
credentials 
nebuchadnezzar was tailormade for saddams grandiose crusade to 
portray himself as the savior of the arabs against israel 
the baylonian king sacked jerusalem he took the children of 
israel into captivity for 50 years and fought for years with the 
persians ancient enemies of the arabs 
iraqi officials conveniently ignore however that the 
achaemenian persians conquered babylon in 539 bc 
iraqi history books now refer to nebuchadnezzar as the defender 
of the arab nation even though he lived 1000 years before 
there was such a thing 
rebuilding babylon has cost iraq millions of dollars while the 
country is saddled with a war debt estimated from 50 billion to 
60 billion 
that does not include the 10 billion owed to kuwait which the 
puppet government saddam installed there conveniently wrote off 
saddam has not restricted himself to identifying with 
nebuchadnezzar he has likened himself to hammurabi who ruled 
babylon in the 17th century bc and is credited with drawing up 
the worlds first written code of law and with razing the cities of 
his enemies 
mesopotamia was the center of the parthian empire which emerged 
in the 2nd century bc and lasted for 400 years its capital was 
ctesiphon whose ruins lie near modern baghdad 
the parthians came later and held back the romans and the 
byzantine empire until ad 637 when they were conquered by the 
arabs sweeping out of the south to spread the new religion of islam 
by the sword 
in 750 the abbasids whose capital was baghdad carved out an 
islamic empire stretching from what is now pakistan to morocco 
this was the era of caliph haroun alrashid when baghdad 
flowered as the center of arabic culture and the beguiling city of 
the thousand and one nights

diplomats have been known to greet each other 
politely sip a glass of sherry and do away with entire nations 
other times they end wars 
more often than not diplomacy is a way to avert bloodshed its 
a civilized occupation best performed by representatives of 
civilized nations 
evidently it has no place in the persian gulf at least not now 
president bush is relying on an economic blockade backed by a 
nucleararmed american naval armada not gentle conversation to 
try to persuade iraqs saddam hussein to reverse his takeover of 
kuwait 
what we need to do at this point is to enforce the 
international law bush said thursday in dismissing any notion of 
using jordans king hussein as a diplomatic intermediary to baghdad 
in fact it turned out the king did not bring bush any message 
from iraq where he stopped before flying to washington and then to 
maine to see the president 
history provides little evidence that diplomacy works with 
dictators or terrorists 
it did not restrain moammar gadhafi of libya however the state 
department detected a marked decrease in terrorism after us 
warplanes bombed tripoli in april 1986 
in 1981 diplomacy finally achieved the release of 52 american 
hostages in iran but only after they had spent 444 days in 
desperate captivity 
six americans still are being held hostage in lebanon despite 
questionable overtures to tehran by the reagan administration and 
repeated intercessions through third parties 
in confronting saddam bush is using us diplomats in iraq and 
kuwait solely to convey messages of protest and to insist that the 
more than 3000 americans trapped in the two countries be permitted 
to depart 
he isnt calling the americans hostages yet but neither are 
bush secretary of state james a baker iii and other senior us 
officials attempting to cultivate the iraqi leader with sweet talk 
or to negotiate a settlement in the gulf 
they are demanding a full iraqi withdrawal and not very 
diplomatically 
baker branded saddam a dictator in a report last week to nato 
foreign ministers in brussels bush has said several times that 
saddam is not a man of his word both bush and baker have made very 
thinly veiled appeals to the iraqi people to get rid of him 
the rhetoric is even sharper at the other end on thursday in a 
rambling attack carried on iraqi television saddam called the 
american president a liar and said the outbreak of holy war which 
saddam has called for could bring thousands of americans 
wrapped in sad coffins 
thats the sort of undiplomatic language saddam used to hurl 
against tehran when he was locked in an eightyear war with iran 
but as he tries to wriggle out of bushs economic noose saddam 
is not above engaging in diplomacy with the very people in tehran 
who only a few years ago sought to overthrow him 
on wednesday saddam offered to return seized iranian territory 
and iranian prisoners thereby meeting two key iranian demands 
the iraqi leader was not just being nice 
an accord with iran would free most of the iraqi military units 
deployed along the border saddam also hopes iran would be so 
gratified it would defy the international blockade arranged by bush 
and approved by the un security council 
and who asked iran to bring whatever pressure it could on iraq 
well in this upside down world the united states did through 
thirdparty intermediaries 
thats the same iran that denounced the united states as the 
great satan and held 52 americans in captivity

carbon dioxide the most common of the 
socalled greenhouse gases is increasing in the earths 
atmosphere faster than during the 1960s and early 1980s a federal 
agency reports 
according to a study by dr pieter tans of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration the concentration of carbon dioxide 
increased at an average rate of 171 parts per million over the 
last four years 
that is somewhat faster than the 15 parts per million rise 
reported in much of the 1980s in the 1960s the increase was 
reported at only 07 parts per million annually 
i think there is a tendency for the rate to be still 
increasing but it doesnt go smoothly just like the climate 
tans said thursday 
the carbon dioxide increase varies a lot from year to year 
one year it can change very little and the next year it makes up 
for the slow increase he explained in a telephone interview 
at the moment it seems to be increasing fairly fast 
concentrations of carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide cfc11 
and cfc12 are monitored by noaas climate monitoring and 
diagnostics laboratory in boulder colo 
the increasing amount of these gases in the air has caused 
concern in recent years the gases are produced by industrial 
processes heating and other human activities as well as some 
natural sources 
many scientists worry that the gases will act somewhat like a 
greenhouse causing earth to overheat 
the shortwave radiation from the sun that warms the earth passes 
through the gases easily but they can trap the longer wave 
radiation from earth that normally cools the planet and keeps 
overall temperatures in balance 
global concentrations of carbon dioxide the most common of the 
socalled greenhouse gases have increased by about 25 percent 
since the mid1800s to just over 350 parts per million 
however scientists disagree over whether any global heating has 
already occurred 
increasing the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide by 1 part per 
million requires the addition of 213 billion tons of carbon to the 
air much of this occurs through the burning of fossil fuels such 
as coal and oil 
other greenhouse gases are much less common 
methane concentrations rose by 12 parts per billion per year 
although officials said this growth rate may have declined slightly 
nitrous oxide increased at a rate of 07 parts per billion per 
year 
cfc11 was rising at 10 parts per trillion while the rate for 
cfc12 was 16 parts per trillion both of these chemicals are 
chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigeration and other industrial 
processes these chemicals also can damage the earths protective 
ozone layer and an international agreement has been signed to 
reduce their use

the bush administration largely ignored iraqs 
brutal and repressive human rights record while seeking to 
foster good relations with baghdad before the current persian gulf 
crisis a former us diplomat says in a forthcoming book 
david a korn who worked in the middle east and washington for 
about 20 years as a foreign service officer writes that the reagan 
and bush administrations paid scant attention to human rights in 
their dealings with iraq 
both have put the nurturing of new friendly relations with 
president saddam husseins government well ahead of addressing the 
violent and repressive nature of his regime korn said in 
uncorrected page proofs of the book 
the volume human rights in iraq is scheduled for november 
publication by human rights watch and yale university press human 
rights watch is a private organization that monitors rights 
violations worldwide 
iraq is a wellorganized police state and its government is 
one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in power today 
said korn 
president bush has strongly condemned saddam in recent days he 
halted trade with iraq and sent troops to saudi arabia in response 
to saddams aug 2 invasion of neighboring kuwait and the massing 
of iraqi troops near the saudi border 
as recently as june 15 however joshua gilder deputy assistant 
secretary of state for human rights told the senate foreign 
relations committee that the administration was not prepared to 
declare iraq guilty of a consistent pattern of gross violations 
that would trigger sanctions 
gilder made the statement after sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
called for an end to us exports to iraq because of alleged human 
rights violations 
the book details a long history of human rights violations in 
iraq it does not deal with the human rights records of other 
persian gulf countries although iraqs neighbors also have come in 
for sharp criticism 
iraq is particularly bad but the other countries in the 
region are far from having a clean slate said laurie mylroie an 
iraq analyst with the harvard center for middle east studies 
iraq is probably the worst then iran then saudi arabia and then 
kuwait palestinians in kuwait for instance live much better than 
palestinians in iraq 
andrew whitley of human rights watch in new york said the 
iraqi record in terms of monolithic political repression and total 
abuse of the norms of law and natural justice is far worse than 
any of the others 
amnesty international another human rights organization said 
last month that members of the kurdish minority have been subject 
to brutal treatment in iran and turkey as well as iraq the report 
said kurds were victims of a wave of secret executions in iran that 
ended in january 1989 
one of the most sensational human rights charges against iraq 
one that bush has mentioned repeatedly in recent days involves the 
use of poison gas against rebellious kurds in august 1988 an 
official of the international committee of the red cross estimated 
that 5000 kurds were killed 
the state department condemned the action and has consistently 
criticized the iraqis in its annual human rights report last year 
the iraqi human rights record was described as abysmal 
nevertheless wrote korn the bush administration did not 
raise with iraqi authorities the reports findings of murder 
extralegal detention torture and disappearance of political 
opponents and government critics according to state department 
sources 
nathan kingsley public affairs advisor in the state 
departments human rights bureau said our responsibility is to 
deliver a complete whole objective analysis of human rights 
abuses around the world that we have done you cant get much more 
public than this report which when it comes out is regarded sort 
of universally as the departments position 
james graham middle east coordinator for amnesty international 
said several hundred iraqi dissidents who had been living in kuwait 
were arrested after the invasion and the organization had reports 
that some of them had been returned to iraq 
given the past patterns of that regime there is good reason 
to believe that those people will certainly be imprisoned if not 
tortured and executed graham said

editors note the steady stream of us air power to the middle 
east is dependent on midair refueling national writer fred bayles 
was aboard an air force tanker as it rendezvoused with combat 
aircraft on their way to the military buildup 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there is little time for ceremony 
while traveling 530 mph five miles above the ocean 
pinch 15 are you full asked the airman first class 
operating the refueling boom of the air force kc135 tanker 
pinch 15 is full disconnecting said the pilot of the f4 
phantom fighter flying a scant 20 feet below the pilots face was 
hidden by his helmet visor and oxygen mask as the graceful gray 
aircraft severed its connection to the tanker in a spray of jet 
fuel 
good journey said the boom operator and the phantom was 
gone 
the brief ritual is being repeated often over the atlantic these 
days while the technological miracle of airtoair refueling has 
long been commonplace the difference is these pilots are flying to 
an uncertainty that may include combat 
we train to do this all the time said the tankers boom 
operator a 22yearold massachusetts woman but it makes it a 
little more urgent when its the real thing 
thursdays mission by the plattsburgh ny air force base crew 
was one of untold numbers conducted as the us military buildup 
grows in the iraq crisis 
the refueling of the 24 phantoms involved eight kc135s from 
plattsburgh along with eight from griffiss afb in new york and 
pease afb in new hampshire 
details about the total number of missions is classified lt 
col rick oborn an air force spokesman at the pentagon would only 
say the number of refueling sorties is well above normal military 
activity 
secrecy was a passenger on thursdays flight journalists aboard 
the tanker were asked not to use the names of the crew or identify 
the squadron squadron emblems and identification patches were 
removed from the flight crews uniforms 
potential terrorist reprisals explained base spokesman lt 
casey mahon 
whatever the number of refueling missions the stolid tankers 
the military cousin of the boeing 707 airliner are a vital link in 
the quick deployment of men and material to the persian gulf 
all combat aircraft and many of the transports flying to the 
middle east are potential receivers that need to be dragged 
across the pond air force lexicon for airtoair refueling over 
the atlantic 
there arent too many missions that can take place in the air 
force without a kc135 said the tankers pilot whose husband 
also flies the venerable aircraft 
the tankers crew of two men and two women was proud of their 
role and their aircraft despite the seemingly glamorless task of 
operating a flying gas station hot and noisy permeated with the 
odor of its kerosene cargo the skyblue airplane was flying well 
before john kennedy was president before the beatles before 
vietnam 
every time we fly we get pumped up said the pilot who at 
28 was born three years after her plane went into service 
thursdays receivers were phantoms known as wild weasels based 
at george afb outside los angeles the fighters are loaded with 
electronic gear and arms for the highrisk job of disrupting and 
destroying enemy radar and antiaircraft installations 
that deadly business was made apparent as the thirsty fighters 
swung into formation with the tankers 190 miles east of cape cod 
each of the sharpnosed aircraft carried gleaming white missiles 
under its wings 
inside the cavernous tanker the 22yearold boom operator took 
her position in the tail of the plane lying on a platform to 
maneuver the 20foot refueling boom into a port just behind a 
fighters canopy 
the nimble jet eased into position by listening to quick curt 
instructions from the operator and watching red green and white 
directional signals flashing from the tankers belly 
with three fighters flying in formation with the tanker she ran 
through the routine for more than an hour loading each plane with 
900 gallons of jp4 fuel then adding 400 gallons to top off the 
fighters already emptying fuel tanks 
when the process was finished the jets had been dragged 560 
more miles across the ocean it was time to turn for home other 
tankers were waiting along the flight path to escort the fighters 
farther along their journey 
and despite the protestations that this was just another 
mission the thoughts of the tankers crew turned to where the 
fighters were heading 
i know what theyre going over there for and i think about 
them said the planes captain were over here in our safe 
united states and theyre asked to do a lot more than we are right 
now

kuwait city has been eerily silent during 
the day but gunfire crackles in the night as kuwaitis stage 
hitandrun raids against the iraqi invaders refugees say 
they also claimed thursday that the iraqi troops who invaded 
aug 2 have still not been able to completely stifle resistance by 
the citizens of the oilrich kingdom 
but some said the kuwaiti underground is waiting for help from 
outside before launching a major offensive against the conquerors 
when the sun shines youre gripped with the awesome silence 
and desolation and after sundown theres the fear of violence and 
death said one kuwaiti saeed hussein 
resistance has been reactivated but only after dark 
a kuwaiti woman who spoke on condition of anonymity said some 
kuwaiti men go out with machine guns every night and kill one or 
two iraqis 
there was no independent confirmation of any significant 
resistance in the northern persian gulf state the extent of 
casualties in what clashes there may be is not known 
communications with kuwait are still cut 
iraq has an estimated 120000 troops in kuwait 
a growing us force backed by an international fleet drawn 
from the british french and other navies is mustering in saudi 
arabia to face the iraqis massed along the kingdoms northern 
border 
kuwaits radio station once the liveliest in the gulf region 
broadcasts clandestinely calling for resistance against the iraqi 
invaders 
kuwait will never be part of iraq announcers stress in 
between nationalist songs 
today brave kuwaitis in a speeding car hurled a grenade at a 
security base killing a number of iraqi soldiers and injuring 
others it claimed in a broadcast wednesday 
another traveler from kuwait who also requested anonymity 
said resistance is spreading young kuwaitis dont know mercy 
any more 
greg maine a 35yearold british businessman said the world 
shouldnt have the impression that kuwait has been rolled over the 
kuwaitis are there waiting for the outside world to act so they 
can respond 
his wife patricia said the invasion had brought out the 
best in the kuwaitis she said some kuwaitis who have a 
reputation for being prudent with their cash were handing out 
money to those left destitute 
most of the refugees fled with few assets from their country 
which once boasted one of the highest per capita incomes in the 
world 
now the refugees line up for handouts outside the kuwaiti 
embassy in bahrain an archipelago off the coast of saudi arabia 
kuwaits southern neighbor 
the embassy provides mattresses bedsheets pillows and other 
necessities the embassy is the only place where the kuwaiti dinar 
its value demolished by the invasion can be exchanged at anything 
near its former value banks wont touch it anymore 
the kuwaiti currency was worth 350 before the invasion but 
plunged below 1 after the invasion but the embassy changes one 
kuwaiti dinar for one bahraini dinar worth 265 
authorities in saudi arabia oman and the united arab emirates 
offer the refugees free accommodation the uae also provides 
every refugee family with 550 
in bahrains markets a group of kuwaiti refugees tried to give 
vendors kuwaiti dinars for their fish and shrimp but the vendors 
refused to take any money 
for many of the refugees their days are spent in gloomy hotel 
rooms huddled around radio and television sets reporting the 
crisis that has made them homeless

the agriculture department has used socalled 
federal marketing orders to give generations of fruit and vegetable 
farmers a way to boost prices but officials say that application 
is less prevalent than before 
through federal marketing orders the department can affect the 
volume quality appearance packaging or public perception of 
about 45 fruit and vegetable crops worth about 45 billion a year 
its a touchy subject defenders of marketing orders insist the 
programs assure consumers of consistent supplies and high quality 
but others claim the system promotes greed and waste by 
providing indirect subsidies to favored industries 
federal marketing orders for horticultural crops as fruits and 
vegetables are collectively called are controls authorized by law 
to let producers in a geographic area decide as a group how and 
sometimes when their crops are sold on the market 
the system is subject to regulations and supervision by the 
agriculture department although local boards carry out the 
daytoday functions 
nicholas j powers of the departments economic research service 
says the controls were sanctioned by congress in the early 1930s 
following earlier attempts by western cooperatives to withhold 
produce and limit market sales when supplies were abundant 
but those attempts failed because not everyone went along with 
the coop efforts and the us supreme court threw out early laws 
on controls and taxes for processing 
congress finally devised the agricultural marketing agreement 
act of 1937 the underlying basis for todays marketing orders and 
agreements 
in a report published this month in farmline magazine powers 
outlined the different kinds of marketing orders virtually all the 
orders allow growers to set minimum grade and size requirements in 
many handlers pay for advertising and promotion programs and for 
research on production and marketing 
twentyone marketing orders allow growers to apply some kind of 
volume control to limit the amount sent to market during certain 
times of the year 
consumers who buy produce in markets with limited quantities 
pay a higher price than otherwise powers said 
a few years ago federal marketing orders generated court 
challenges and other snarls in one case surplus navel oranges 
were used as livestock feed after being barred from the market 
the conservative heritage foundation in 1985 called federal 
marketing orders governmentbacked cartels that forced 
consumers to pay millions of dollars more for food than they would 
otherwise 
but there has been less flak about marketing orders lately and 
powers in a telephone interview thursday suggested some reasons 
why 
over the last decade theres been less emphasis on what are 
called the volumecontrol regulations he said those are the 
regulations which can be used to restrict supply to certain markets 
and thereby elevate prices in those markets 
marketing orders now tend to emphasize more of the 
advertising promotional activities along with the grading of 
produce to make sure crops are mature enough for sale to users 
powers said also more orders emphasize research and packaging of 
the produce 
but volume controls are still used last winter he said news 
reports described how california was controlling the amount of 
citrus going to market even after freezing weather had devastated 
so much of the florida citrus crop 
volume controls are still used in some of the orders but much 
less vigorously now than just a few years ago powers said 
powers says the decline in the use of marketing orders also is 
due in part to usda policy which does not encourage the industry 
to use volume controls as vigorously as they had in the past 
one alternative generally favored by usda is the use of 
marketing orders to formulate promotion and research programs 
which are paid for by the industry itself 
the 1985 farm law for example authorized such a national 
program for watermelons administered by the departments 
agricultural marketing service 
a few of the crops covered by federal marketing orders include 
florida citrus and tomatoes california peaches pears and plums 
california and arizona navel oranges idaho and east oregon 
potatoes georgia peaches virginia and north carolina potatoes 
maine potatoes peanuts grown in 16 states and hawaiian papayas

warnings about possible federal layoffs come 
when congress is most vulnerable to public pressure to reach a 
budget agreement with the administration the leader of a 
government employees union says 
the administration is reaping the benefits of the timing of 
this john sturdivant president of the 700000member american 
federation of government employees said thursday it just 
happens to be that these notices are going out when the congress is 
back home 
although complaining that federal employees are being kicked 
around for political reasons again he said elections are an 
amazing motivator for people who are elected to do their jobs 
under memos that began going out this week the nations 24 
million federal workers were told that they could face up to 22 
days without pay in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 if no 
agreement on a deficitreduction package is reached and mandatory 
budget cuts follow 
workers subject to the furloughs might be forced to take a day 
off without pay in each twoweek pay period said the office of 
personnel management 
because president bush and congress have failed to agree on a 
deficitreduction package the administration has ordered federal 
agencies to draw up plans to cut spending by 319 percent 
as much as 104 billion in spending cuts known in washington 
jargon as sequestration would take effect oct 15 unless 
congress and bush agree on a package of tax increases and spending 
reductions 
our people are outraged they dont appreciate being jerked 
around by the congress and the white house and theres certainly 
enough blame for both sides sturdivant said 
opm director constance newman advised federal personnel 
directors wednesday that they should begin contacting employees 
about the potential layoffs she noted bushs announced plans to 
implement massive budget cuts oct 15 as a result of the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law 
it was imperative that they begin making plans now its not 
our wish that they furlough employees nor are we encouraging them 
to do so its just an option that they have to consider said 
opm spokeswoman sharon wells 
under federal law agencies have to warn workers who might be 
threatened by layoffs by at least aug 31 a month before the 
deadline for reaching a deficitreduction package 
labor secretary elizabeth dole was one of the first department 
heads to send a memo to agency workers 
i want to emphasize that this does not mean that furloughs are 
a certainty only that they may happen mrs dole wrote 
departmentwide hiring freezes and cutbacks on travel equipment 
and contracts would be implemented before layoffs mrs dole said

the pentagon is putting a 118 billion price 
tag on the deployment of us air ground and naval forces in saudi 
arabia through september 
according to preliminary figures released thursday the armys 
deployment of ground troops supported by aircraft will cost 750 
million the navys share 230 million and the air forces 200 
million 
no estimate was given for costs beyond next month 
chief pentagon spokesman pete williams said the figures include 
neither 120 million in increased fuel costs due to higher oil 
prices nor the costs that would be incurred if bush decides to call 
up reserve forces for active duty 
the deployment called operation desert shield began aug 8 
two days after president bush ordered us forces to head for saudi 
arabia to guard against a possible iraqi invasion 
the announcement said costs beyond sept 30 could not be 
estimated because the size and composition of the armed forces in 
desert shield and their level of activity are still evolving 
the pentagon gave this partial breakdown of the total cost 
through sept 30 
294 million for transport of cargo by commercial and 
government aircraft activation and deployment of additional 
transport ships cost 74 million 
imminent danger and family separation pay totals 50 million 
use of volunteer reserve units for airlift tanker refueling 
and cargo handling cost 12 million 
activation and deployment of two hospital ships cost 10 
million 
25 million for medical supplies 
chemical protective equipment at a cost of 56 million

american pilots have locked in their weapons 
radar on iraqi planes in what one crew chief described as a 
little cat and mouse game that the iraqis refuse to go along 
with us airmen say 
they dont want to play with us one crew chief said 
thursday if i were in a mirage and an f15 locked onto me id 
get out of there fast too 
when an american jets weapons systems radar locks onto another 
plane it means the us jet has found its target and communicated 
that to its missile 
the iraqi pilot knows it too because his plane carries a 
warning system something like the fuzzbuster radar used by some 
automobile drivers in america to warn them that theyre under the 
scrutiny of police radar 
although the us airmen declined to go into detail there was 
no indication that any of the encounters involved iraqi planes 
attempting to intrude into saudi arabian air space the airmen 
suggested that the encounters occurred during missions near the 
border with kuwait 
col john mcbroom commander of the 1st tactical fighter wing 
from langley air force base in virginia refused to confirm the 
pilots reports and said he had instructed his airmen not to 
discuss any contact with iraqi jets 
im not going to get into our encounters he said 
but mcbroom did say he considered us air power here far 
superior to iraqs 
were not over here to go to war mcbroom said but we 
will finish one quickly in the air 
another officer in the unit and several crew chiefs said there 
have been several instances in which weapons systems aboard us 
f15s locked onto the iraqis frenchmade mirage jets 
one of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the 
radar locks on one crew chief said 
theres been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock 
on theyre gone said another 
asked again about the encounters mcbroom said all ill do is 
remind you our radar can lock on at a pretty good range beyond 
that youll have to ask the iraqis 
he seemed to be suggesting that the episodes involved iraqi 
planes flying well within kuwaiti airspace 
in washington pete williams the chief pentagon spokesman said 
he had asked military officials about the report but had received 
no information that would enable him to confirm or deny the 
accuracy of the crew chiefs remarks 
mcbroom said the fighter unit felt somewhat vulnerable on the 
ground when it arrived last week but now it has received powerful 
ground protection from other us forces including patriot 
groundtoair missile systems 
the unit has set up camp at a saudi air base it uses spare 
saudi hangars maintenance garages and other facilities 
ground rules for the a pool of us reporters flown here by the 
pentagon prohibit disclosure of the bases location the number of 
planes and other weapons systems or the names of noncommand 
officers 
the men are living in saudi barracks and schools but a tent 
city is under construction on the base as is a portable hospital 
heat is a big problem the hospital is treating about 15 cases 
of heat stress a day air force officials said 
interviews with the airmen were conducted between 9 am and 10 
am local time when temperatures already were approaching triple 
digits and the sun was scorching 
one air force sergeant was taken to the hospital during the 
pools visit for a minor case of heat stress he had been swinging 
a sledge hammer for several hours helping to set up the tents 
mcbroom said the saudi base facilities are the best he has ever 
seen 
the saudis build everything big and everything right he 
said 
mcbroom and his crew chiefs and maintenance personnel said they 
have had very few equipment problems associated with the heat most 
of the planes are being kept outdoors in the heat because 
electronic systems sometimes have temporary troubles when going 
from a cool to hot environment mcbroom said 
the air force has extensive stocks of missiles for the jets and 
crews were seen unloading boxes of 20mm shells for their onboard 
guns as well

aids has become the leading cause of death 
among adult men in the west african city of abidjan the magazine 
science says it is the second most common cause in adult women 
there after deaths related to pregnancy and abortion 
a recent study in the ivory coast capital city found a minimum 
annual incidence of aids of 1447 cases per million in adult men 
and 340 per million in adult women science said in its aug 17 
edition 
the study of cadavers was done in a 62day and 43day period 
among 698 adult bodies examined 41 percent of men and 32 percent 
of women were infected with hiv the agent that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome the highest rates were found in men and 
women aged 30 to 39 
science said the figures probably underestimate the true 
mortality due to hiv infection among factors skewing the figures 
were the exclusion of pediatric patients the unknown proportion of 
aids deaths not brought to the mortuaries studied and the cultural 
practice of seriously ill persons leaving abidjan to die in their 
home areas 
in addition deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis the third 
ranking cause of male adult death specifically were not counted 
as aids cases although 50 percent of such cadavers tested hiv 
positive 
although data concerning mortality due to aids are scarce 
the article said aids is likely to be the leading cause of adult 
death in a number of other african cities also 
in the united states according to the centers for disease 
control there were 161 cases of aids per 100000 population in 
the year ending in july

over infant cribs 
the decision to consider the problem approved thursday on a 21 
vote calls for the staff to investigate solutions to the hazards 
posed by such items the commission received reports of 30 
strangulation deaths one case of severe brain damage and 18 
nearmisses involving decorative ropes or mobiles for cribs 
the consumer federation of american and the new york attorney 
generals office petitioned the agency for an outright ban of the 
items thursdays vote means the panel will await further 
recommendations of its staff and general comment from the public 
before deciding upon any mandatory requirements 
one alternative to banning the products said staff member ann 
pavlich might be labeling which warns parents to remove the 
overhead crib items before infants are large enough to reach them 
and try to pull themselves upright possibly to tumble with them 
wrapped around their neck she suggested an age guideline might be 
5 months 
such crib toys or gyms are not to be confused with 
separate baby toys designed for actual handling by the infant and 
for which the government has long since set safety standards

israels chief rabbi has ruled ultraorthodox 
jewish men may shave their beards so gas masks fit properly in the 
event of a chemical attack by iraq and he urged them to carry 
scissors to shave quickly 
law forbids men from shaving and many ultraorthodox men grow 
full beards and wear side curls 
but traditional gas masks wont seal properly over facial hair 
and the issue had caused great anxiety among israels 
ultraorthodox community until thursdays ruling by chief rabbi 
mordechai eliyahu 
the government has considered distributing masks because of 
threats by iraqi president saddam hussein to attack the jewish 
state with chemical weapons private sales of masks have boomed 
the religious weekly yom hashishi on thursday suggested 
ultraorthodox men consider acquiring gas masks designed for 
children because they cover the entire head 
but the civil defense agency responsible for procuring and 
distributing gas masks has said catering to the needs of bearded 
men would not be possible because the masks are massproduced 
in his ruling eliyahu said that although jewish tradition 
always spoke of jewish men wearing beards there was no prohibition 
against shaving in the body of jewish law 
bearded men have to shave off their beards before wearing a 
gas mask since even a twoday beard prevents the mask from sealing 
properly and may allow the gas to penetrate inside he said 
eliyahu also said bearded men should carry scissors in their 
pocket in case they need to shave in a hurry the national itim

a thin washer may have caused the focusing 
flaw in the 15 billion hubble space telescope and a space 
shuttle mission can easily fix much of the problem nasa officials 
say 
the hubble could actually be better than it could be now 
charles pellerin nasa director of astrophysics said thursday 
pellerin and members of a nasa investigative team held a news 
conference after two days of hearings at hughes danbury optical 
systems inc maker of the flawed primary mirror that is producing 
blurry pictures from the orbiting observatory 
the mirror has an aberration caused by a 13millimeter error in 
a measuring device that was used to grind the telescopes mirrors 
said lew allen head of the team and director of nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
the error that we discovered is one that leads to an 
essentially pure spherical aberration and thats relatively easy 
to correct allen said 
pellerin said that all that needs to be done is remove the 
hubbles widefield planetary camera during a previously scheduled 
shuttle mission in 1993 and replace it with a camera designed to 
correct the error 
the camera was going to be replaced during the 1993 mission 
anyway because machinery undergoes extraordinary wear and tear in 
space pellerin said 
the only thing thats different is we didnt anticipate doing 
this because of optical problems he said 
the main camera is the hubbles most powerful instrument 
designed to peer almost to the edge of the universe and produce the 
telescopes most exciting discoveries 
nasa officials said earlier that replacing the camera wont 
solve the problem for the hubbles faintobject camera and other 
instruments which still will receive poorly focused light from the 
flawed mirror compared with the main camera however those 
instruments are much less severely impaired by the bad mirror 
the discovery of the flaw shortly after the hubble was launched 
april 25 proved a major embarrassment for nasa the telescope is 
designed to take clearer pictures of the far reaches of space than 
are possible from groundbased telescopes 
the 13millimeter error was discovered in a device called a 
reflective null corrector nasa officials said 
allen said that simple washers might have thrown off the entire 
instrument because the washers appear to be the same thickness as 
the error but he said that could be a coincidence and the team 
will study many other possibilities 
the 13millimeter error is huge in optics terms allen said 
pellerin likened it to a room that was accidentally built 3 feet 
too long 
allen said a test had indicated the error when the mirror was 
manufactured in the early 1980s at a division of perkinelmer corp 
that was bought last year by hughes but he said perkinelmer 
engineers had placed complete faith in the null corrector and 
disregarded the test results 
while declining to say whether hughes danbury was to blame for 
the error allen did say nasa was not aware of the results that 
showed there was an error 
as we go back through the documents we dont find any case 
where they called this to the attention of nasa he said 
thomas arconti spokesman for hughes danbury said only that the 
company would continue to work with nasa to find the answers to the 
remaining questions 
pellerin said the news would not shake nasas confidence in 
hughes danbury which is working on other nasa optics projects and 
made other highly technical parts of the telescope everything 
thats difficult is working fine he said 
allen said during the teams two days at hughes danbury it 
interviewed former and current employees who worked on the 
telescope he said they were all cooperative even though it was 
hard for them to accept that they had made an error 
people find it very hard to say oops he said they 
instead say that we had good reasons for doing what we did we had 
no reason to think it was wrong and so on everyone we talked 
to is finding it very hard to not be proud of what he did when he 
thought it was very good work 
the team will return to hughes danbury on sept 12 and 13 allen 
said

japanese officials today began investigating 
reports that us jet fighters buzzed japanese pleasure boats as 
imaginary targets during training flights 
us military officials said navy aircraft were training in the 
area wednesday where two yachts were buzzed by jet fighters 
the us officials speaking on condition of anonymity would 
not give any further details about the incidents in which a man 
was injured after a lowflying fighter buzzed his yacht 
japans maritime safety agency has received reports from local 
fishermen and boat captains of similar incidents occurring in the 
same area during the last two months agency spokesman naoki maeda 
said 
the presence of the us armed forces in japan under a mutual 
security pact is still a sensitive topic and reports of accidents 
involving us military personnel receive wide publicity 
he quoted one person as saying that earlier this month two jets 
with us military marks suddenly flew down very low as if they had 
been aiming at yachts near oshima an island 70 miles south of 
tokyo 
japanese newspapers quoting us military sources said the jets 
involved in wednesdays incidents were fa18 fighters attached to 
the aircraft carrier midway 
kyodo news service reported that japanese officials believed the

salvadoran rebel leaders say they 
will ask president alfredo cristiani to accept un human rights 
observers as a condition for an immediate ceasefire in el 
salvadors decadeold civil war 
the proposal will be presented later today when the latest round 
of peace talks begins in san jose according to miguel saenz a 
spokesman for the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front 
if the salvadoran government accepts that such a commission 
oversee observance of human rights in the country then agreement 
could be reached for a ceasefire at this meeting saenz said 
thursday 
the fiveday meeting under un mediation is the fourth round 
of talks between the rebels and the government since cristiani took 
office last year 
the previous rounds ended in deadlock with the government 
insisting the rebels enter into a ceasefire agreement before any 
other issues were discussed 
rebel leaders have demanded political reform principally that 
the government purge the armed forces of rightist elements and 
bring human rights violators to justice 
saenz said that establishing a un human rights commission in 
el salvador would be an effective way of getting around the 
deadlock 
human rights groups say 73000 people have died since el 
salvadors civil war began in 1979 and nearly half were civilians 
slain by the military or rightist death squads for suspected 
leftist sympathies 
last november six jesuit priests were roused from their beds at 
night in their university campus home in san salvador and shot dead 
by uniformed soldiers along with their housekeeper and her daughter 
the assassinations took place at the height of a guerrilla 
assault on the salvadoran capital and while that section of the 
city was under military control and a dusktodawn curfew 
meanwhile in el salvador repair crews today were restoring 
power to large sections of the country blacked out by guerrilla 
sabotage earlier this week 
officials of the stateowned lempa executive commission said the 
rebels attacked 17 main transmission lines knocking out power to 
nearly half of the small central american nation of 5 million 
people

a woman who says she has 21 personalities 
displayed three of them herself and characters named franny and 
jennifer in testifying she was raped by a man who took her out 
for coffee 
the judge required her to take an oath each time she changed 
identities during the hearing thursday lawyers introduced 
themselves to the different personalities each time she behaved 
as if the testimony was just beginning 
after hearing the testimony judge robert hawley ordered mark a 
peterson 29 to stand trial for sexual assault no trial date was 
set 
to convict peterson district attorney joseph paulus said he 
must prove three things that the victim had a mental illness 
that she was incapable of appraising her own conduct and that 
peterson knew about the illness 
peterson claims the woman consented to sex and that he did not 
know she had multiple personalties 
but the woman said she told peterson she had multiple 
personalities and introduced him to some of them and that he took 
advantage of one of them jennifer a funloving 20yearold 
that personality was dominant when peterson forced her to have 
sex in the front seat of a car after they went out for coffee the 
woman said 
on thursday she also testified as herself a 26yearold single 
oshkosh woman who is in therapy for multiple personality disorder 
and cannot remember the incident and as franny a 32yearold 
motherly type who reported the alleged attack to friends 
according to leonard kaplan a university of wisconsin law 
school professor state law clearly says that someone deemed 
mentally ill cannot consent to sex 
defense lawyer edward salzsieder said the key issue is whether 
the woman is mentally ill or just a big show 
during about 90 minutes of testimony the woman paused only 
briefly during personality switches requested by paulus 
can i have jennifer the one who likes to have fun paulus 
asked after talking with franny 
of course the woman replied smiling and closing her eyes 
seconds later she opened her eyes and blurted hi mr paulus 
in a slightly higher voice 
the woman her therapist seated nearby testified that peterson 
a man she met two days earlier while fishing raped her june 11 
she testified peterson wanted jennifer to appear she said he 
asked can i love you i said ok 
jennifer did not know what sex was but agreed because he just 
told me to the woman said 
police said peterson noted that during sex the womans 
6yearold personality emily appeared before she eventually 
became franny again 
inam haque a psychiatrist at winnebago mental health institute 
in oshkosh testified he treated the woman for four years and 
diagnosed her in february as suffering from multiple personality 
disorder 
the disorder is triggered by emotional or physical abuse during 
childhood victims create separate personalities to avoid 
confronting reality it affects about 7000 americans he said

actors equity bowed to pressure from within its 
ranks and agreed to let a white actor play a eurasian pimp in the 
broadway production of the hit london musical miss saigon 
now the question is whether the show will go on 
producer cameron mackintosh who had scrapped the 10 million 
show after the unions initial ban on jonathan pryce said thursday 
he will confer with the english actor and the miss saigon 
creative team to determine whether it can still be brought to 
broadway 
a decision is not expected until next week said mackintosh 
spokesman marc thibodeau 
miss saigon which was to have begun previews here in march 
already has 25 million in advance ticket sales the largest in 
broadway history mackintosh has said the cancellation would cost 
him about 600000 
actors equity which has a veto over foreign actors in the 
united states had denied permission aug 7 for pryce to repeat his 
london performance because casting a white actor in asian makeup is 
an affront to the asian community 
the decision stirred fierce debate over colorblind casting 
minority opportunities on stage and artistic freedom some 
complained it called into question the nature of acting itself 
pretending to be someone the actor is not 
equity reversed itself at a special meeting thursday of its 
70member council called in response to a petition from more than 
600 equity members outraged by the decision to bar the actor the 
union has 37500 active members 
alan eisenberg the unions executive secretary said the 
council was influenced by a demonstration of good intent by the 
producer 
mackintosh had said that pryce eliminated his slantedeye makeup 
immediately after learning that it offended members of the 
americanasian community 
in addition the union said it had a commitment from mackintosh 
to seek out asian actors for broadway roles and to help give them 
voice training 
in explaining the reversal eisenberg said the council which 
met for nearly six hours determined that pryce qualified as a 
star stars from other countries usually get automatic approval 
to perform in the united states 
pryce has appeared on broadway twice winning a tony in 1977 for 
his performance in comedians and starring in accidental death 
of an anarchist in 1984 
eisenberg said the controversy highlighted the need for the 
theater to address the frustrations felt over past and present 
discriminations and the lack of employment opportunities for 
minority actors 
on wednesday asianamericans had urged equity not to waver in 
its decision to bar pryce 
in an ideal world any artist can play any role for which he 
or she is suited said tisa chang artistic director of the pan 
asian repertory theater until that time arrives artists of 
color must fight to retain access to the few roles which are 
culturally and racially suited to them 
mackintosh has said the show has a cast of 50 actors including 
roles for 34 minority performers no other casting except pryce 
has been announced 
miss saigon is a love story about an american soldier during 
the closing days of the vietnam war in 1975 
pryce won the olivier award londons equivalent of the tony 
for his portrayal of the engineer a brothel owner in miss 
saigon

the village with a smile isnt 
anymore 
gone are the yellow emptyeyed smiley faces that stared 
oncoming motorists in the face as they drove through this suburb 
west of chicago 
some residents and city officials thought the symbol of 
happiness an image from the 1970s was behind the times 
it was just a little out of fashion said resident donna 
danielson sometimes people would make fun like coworkers 
so she and her husband dan offered to redesign the villages 
vehicle stickers and city limit signs the new city symbol is now a 
leafy branch with a cardinal perched on top 
you just cant say anymore hey dont worry about it 
smile said danielson an advertisement designer in chicago 
i think there is a lot more depth to forest park than a smiley 
face 
smiley faces also have been falling from fashion graces outside 
forest park a survey conducted last year by the roper organization 
at 10 us college campuses found the haveaniceday face was 
a fashion nono 
the loss of the smiles has been greeted with some frowns 
i just thought it was unique said edward lambke who headed 
the effort to adopt the smiley face while serving as a village 
commissioner 
theyve changed the smiley never if i was there would that 
ever happen i thought it was good for the town and i still do 
lambke who coined forest parks nickname a village with a 
smile has since retired from village government but has left the 
vehicle stickers on his car 
the smiley faces were painted on water towers at both ends of 
the town in 1974 in 1986 the smileys were adopted for the car 
stickers to give the village individuality in a sea of suburbs 
judging by some reactions to the new symbol the village may be 
a happier place without the smiley faces 
some people would pick up their new sticker and say oh my 
gosh im glad you got rid of it said village clerk marlene j 
quandt i just think it had seen its day 
but there are those who express a little sadness when they see 
the smiley face isnt here anymore 
forest park has not entirely abandoned the smiley face however 
no one has dared contend with the giant saffron smiles on the water 
towers 
the danielsons say those faces might have to wait a few years 
until the towers need a new coat of paint

four sheriffs a deputy sheriff and a 
police chief caught up in an fbi sting codenamed walking short 
have been charged with setting up a protection racket for drug 
traffickers 
two fbi agents acting as chicago businessmen interested in 
shipping cocaine led the yearlong sting whose name was inspired by 
the 1973 movie walking tall about a tennessee sheriff who did 
not cave in to corruption around him 
forty fbi agents fanned out through four contiguous eastern 
kentucky counties to make the arrests thursday the six were 
indicted on charges of conspiracy drug distribution and taking 
money to protect drug traffickers 
us attorney louie defalaise said the arrests demonstrated 
the absolute corrupting influence of drugs 
arrested were lee county sheriff johnny mann 39 breathitt 
county sheriff dean spencer 46 wolfe county sheriff lester drake 
51 owsley county sheriff billy mcintosh 57 beattyville police 
chief omer noe and wolfe county deputy sheriff wilson stone 
at a hearing thursday five of the men were released on bail 
ranging from 5000 to 20000 mann the alleged ringleader was 
denied bail after an undercover agent testified he had threatened 
to kill anyone who set him up 
according to the indictment agents paid the law officers more 
than 85000 to protect a phony cocaine and marijuana smuggling 
operation from police interference 
at one point cocaine packages were dropped by air onto a farm 
owned by one of the officers authorities said 
defalaise said the cocaine which totaled nearly 250 pounds was 
never distributed for sale to the public 
most of the drug counts carry up to life in prison the major 
conspiracy and extortion charges carry up to 20 years

a shiite moslem leader says the us 
military intervention in saudi arabia leaves no chance for a 
quick release of any americans held hostage in lebanon 
but hussin musawi a reputed mentor of proiranian kidnap 
factions in lebanon said thursday that a western european hostage 
might be freed soon 
musawi spoke hours after the leftist beirut newspaper assafir 
said all 14 western hostages held in lebanon including six 
americans will be freed by years end 
i think there is a demarcation line between american and 
european hostages musawi said in a telephone interview from his 
home in baalbek 
i think the american occupation of saudi arabia leaves no 
chance for an early release of the american captives but there is 
a chance the case of the european hostages might shortly ease up 
musawi leads a prosyrian wing in the fundamentalist hezbollah 
or party of god irans main ally in lebanon hezbollah is believed 
the umbrella for several hostageholding factions 
he said the outlook for the european captives was brighter 
because france has taken an independent stance from the united 
states in the gulf crisis 
french president francois mitterrands decision to release anis 
naccache a lebanese serving life for trying to assassinate former 
iranian prime minister shahpour bakhtiar in paris in 1980 was a 
contributing factor musawi said 
all french hostages have been freed four britons two west 
germans an italian and an irishman as well as six americans are 
held by extremist moslem groups in lebanon most have been held 
three years or more the longest held since march 16 1985 is 
terry anderson the aps chief middle east correspondent 
assafir quoted unidentified diplomatic sources as saying 
secret contacts involving the concerned capitals 
particularly tehran were under way to resolve the hostage issue 
the hostagetakers have made various demands for the release of 
prisoners held by israel in southern lebanon and of convicted 
terrorists jailed in kuwait and western capitals 
since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 which set off the 
crisis no firm word has emerged on the fate of 15 shiite prisoners 
whose release was demanded by kidnappers in return for american 
hostages 
most were serving long prison terms and three were awaiting 
execution for involvement in 1983 bombings the us and french 
embassies and kuwaiti installations 
some reports said the prisoners escaped after the invasion 
others said they were killed and some suggested they were moved to 
baghdad iraqs capital

the leading killer of american women in the 
workplace isnt crashes or fire its homicide 
the centers for disease control reported thursday that 42 
percent of the onthejob injury deaths of women in the united 
states from 1980 to 1985 were homicides 
second was vehicle accidents at around 39 percent said 
catherine bell an epidemiologist with the cdcs national institute 
for occupational safety and health 
if a womans going to die from an injury at work shes 
probably going to be murdered ms bell said 
niosh investigators identified 950 female occupational homicides 
over the sixyear period of that number 389 or 41 percent 
worked in the retail field 
researchers arent certain but it appears that strangers in the 
store not coworkers are responsible for most workplace 
killings of women ms bell said 
they appear to be robberyassociated crimes in the retail 
trade she said it quite likely is stranger violence 
the killings peaked in the winter months sixtyfour percent of 
the killings were committed with guns 19 percent were stabbings 
nationwide for both sexes about 13 percent of onthejob 
injury deaths during 198085 were homicides the cdc reported 
homicides accounted for 12 percent of mens occupational 
fatalities compared with the 42 percent for women 
findings regarding killings of men in the workplace are not 
complete but most onthejob deaths involve male workers who 
traditionally dominate more dangerous occupations and most of 
those male workplace deaths are accidental 
the cdc did not release figures for causes of workplace injury 
deaths among women other than homicides and vehicular accidents 
measures such as better lighting safer cashhandling and even 
bulletproof barricades should be considered to help stop slayings 
at work the agency said 
the workplace homicide rate for black women was nearly double 
that for white women but that was not necessarily unexpected 
nationwide black women are nearly four times as likely to be 
murdered as white women the cdc said citing a 1986 study

eleven us students have spent the 
summer near the mexican border listening to horror stories and 
trying to give them happy endings 
they werent studying fiction theyre trainee human rights 
activists 
the students from colleges across the nation served as interns 
for amnesty international for 10 weeks they worked on behalf of 
asylumseekers who claim to be fleeing harassment torture and 
death squads from haiti to el salvador 
in the process they became skeptical of their own government 
everything is really interconnected said amy voege a 
23yearold junior at central michigan university in mount 
pleasant mich 
the people who are fleeing their countries are fleeing because 
of human rights abuses there or fleeing because of war there 
she said but those human rights abuses and those wars are really 
supported by the united states government 
they will take back memories of those they helped among them 
was a honduran soldier who said he was beaten for refusing to 
torture prisoners and a guatemalan who said he fled after seeing 
soldiers shoot to death his cousin 
amnesty international said its asylum summer program tries 
to help asylumseekers from being deported and becoming abuse 
victims 
critics including some within the nearly 1 millionstrong 
movement worry that the group is departing too much from its 
traditional role of campaigning for people unlawfully imprisoned 
tortured or facing the death penalty 
the students ages 18 to 23 trained in southern texas with 
human rights organizations and helped prepare legal cases 
in one case a 17yearold salvadoran army deserter won asylum 
with help from students assigned to probar a legal aid office in 
harlingen 
melissa jameson 19 a sophomore at the university of redlands 
in redlands calif said the man was forcibly recruited then 
made to torture and kill animals for training they had to bite 
the necks of vultures and dogs 
then the trainers cut off the arm of a human body and played 
with it like a toy jameson said they said this will make you 
more of a man and when he cried they said youre going to have to 
get used to this 
the man whom she did not identify claimed he would be tortured 
or killed by government forces or harassed by guerrillas if sent 
back 
in another case asylum was denied to a honduran who said he was 
forcibly recruited into the army at 14 and was beaten and tortured 
when he refused to torture prisoners the youth who is appealing 
the denial of asylum also said he feared being tortured if 
returned home 
we had won an asylum case for a honduran young man who had 
faced pretty much the same thing said mercedeh momeni 22 of 
fredericksburg va it just shows how arbitrary the system is 
and how amnesty is on the right track in this program 
the interns complained that us governments helped create the 
conditions that force people to flee central america and that 
those fleeing unfriendly countries seem to have a better chance of 
winning asylum than refugees from allied nations 
the immigration and naturalization service said each asylum case 
is treated on merit without political bias 
isnt it logical that the united states would have better 
relations with countries that do not practice human rights abuses 
than with countries that do asked ins spokesman duke austin 
to argue that theres no difference between nicaragua el 
salvador cuba and haiti is asinine thats naivete in its highest 
form 
the border association for refugees from central america in 
mcallen had three students assigned to its office 
its extremely important for young people in the united states 
to become more involved in justicerelated issues said executive 
director ninfa krueger 
the students said they plan to step up their human rights 
activities in their schools but said paula couture 21 a junior 
at worcester state college at worcester mass people arent 
going to understand us when we get back

crew members of a commuter plane that 
crashed last year killing six people used credit cards to scrape 
ice from the wings and propellers and declined deicing equipment 
at least twice investigators say 
the report by the national transportation safety board contained 
no conclusions about the cause of the dec 26 crash said author 
eric sager of the ntsb in washington 
its one small part of the investigation sager said 
thursday in a telephone interview that information may or may 
not end up in the report 
a final report will be issued in several weeks 
the united express plane en route from seattle by way of 
yakima crashed about 400 feet short of the runway at pasco about 
80 miles south of yakima everyone aboard was killed 
ice can slow an airplane or force it down by increasing weight 
and drag 
sager said he did not think it unusual that the copilot and 
another united express employee would be using credit cards to 
remove ice from the 19passenger british aerospace jetstream 31 
turboprop during the stop in yakima 
ice is very frequent sager said they were attending to 
it 
the employees were looking at the wings and presumbably felt the 
buildup was not enough to warrant the use of deicing equipment 
sager said 
however a united express ramp agent in yakima told 
investigators that she was surprised the captain had chosen not to 
deice she said most other planes were undergoing the fiveminute 
procedure that night because it was misting and cold 
she noticed that chips of ice were blown back toward her in 
the propeller wash as the plane departed the report said 
shelley swanke a united express spokeswoman in pasco said 
company policy gives pilots the authority to decide when to use 
deicing equipment 
the report found no medical problems among the crew that might 
have contributed to the crash and no traces of drugs or alcohol 
united express is a franchise name used by several airlines 
around the country with ties to united air lines the commuter 
airline is owned by npa inc of fresno calif

two decades of political repression and restored the citizenship of 
23 literary scientific and cultural figures including alexander 
solzhenitsyn officials have said 
the full list of those deprived of citizenship between 196688 
and regaining it under the presidential decree will be published 
later this month said valentin kulikov a representative of 
gorbachevs press office 
the soviet media on thursday published the names of 10 people 
whose citizenship was returned including solzhenitsyn the nobel 
laureate charged with treason in 1974 
they included chess champion victor korchnoi writers vasily 
aksyonov vladimir voinovich lev kopelev georgi vladimov and 
valeri tarsis who died in exile in 1983 scientists yuri orlov and 
valeri chalidze and artist oskar rabin 
the names of the other 13 were not included in wednesdays 
presidential decreee there had been speculation the list would 
include joseph brodsky a nobel prizewinning writer who emigrated 
to the united states in 1972 under threat of imprisonment for his 
political comments 
these political repressions were justifiably condemned in this 
country and i believe it is now our duty to if you please absolve 
the governments guilt before our countrymen said gennady 
cheremnykh head of the citizenship and pardoning department of the 
supreme soviets secretariat 
the decree is a conveyance of apologies of sorts although it 
is belated it is an apology he said in an interview with the 
government daily izvestia 
cheremnykh said 175 soviets were stripped of their citizenship 
from 196688 about 60 of them are armenians who emigrated to the 
united states and canada the rest are dissidents he said 
under leonid i brezhnev the kremlin revoked the citizenship of 
prominent authors and artists who spoke out against repression 
their work was barred from appearing in their homeland 
gorbachev continued the practice during his first three years in 
office but then abandoned it 
in individual decrees gorbachev has already restored the 
citizenship of many notably cellist and conductor mstislav 
rostropovich and his wife singer galina vishnevskaya dissident 
historian zhores medvedev and theater director yuri lyubimov of 
these only lyubimov has returned to live in the soviet union 
no conditions were put on the citizens identified thursday 
cheremnykh told izvestia it was not immediately clear how many 
would return 
cheremnykh said solzhenitsyn who lives with his wife natalia in 
cavendish vermont had agreed to accept soviet citizenship but 
the writers wife denied that 
nobody has asked him absolutely nobody in any form has 
contacted us not through writing not through mediation she 
said thursday in an interview from their home 
solzhenitsyn 71 has said he would not return unless all of his 
books were published in the soviet union and widely available a 
number have been printed but almost nothing is widely available in 
the shortageplagued soviet union 
mrs solzhenitsyn said that a soviet court charged her husband 
with treason and only a court can lift the charges anything else 
is wielding the same power as brezhnev did she said adding 
that the expulsion order also must be reversed 
solzhenitsyns the gulag archipelago depicted the horrors of 
stalins prison camps his other wellknown works include one day 
in the life of ivan denisovich cancer ward august 1914 
and the first circle 
he won the nobel prize for literature in 1970 but in february 
1974 was arrested on a treason charge which carried a possible 
death sentence he was forced onto a plane to germany and stripped 
of his citizenship the next day 
korchnoi 54 said in an interview in switzerland he welcomed 
the restoration of his citizenship as an important step but 
the grandmaster said he would not return to the soviet union 
aksyonov contacted about gorbachevs decree by the soviet 
embassy said from his home in washington it was the last 
hindrance to being accepted officially in soviet cultural life i 
accept it as a formal apology from the government he said 
however he would not return to the soviet union to live 
chalidze 51 said he was not sure if he would accept the 
invitation to be a soviet citizen again the decree is a 
correcting of unjust things that were done in the past he said 
from his home in benson vermont but said i am an american 
citizen and about this i am quite happy 
political exiles and soviets who emigrate to israel are 
automatically stripped of their citizenship 
cheremnykh said most of 400000 soviets in this category had 
left the country voluntarily and indicated there was no chance 
their citizenship would be restored

setting out on his 
sixth term in office president joaquin balaguer has asked 
dominicans to cooperate with an austerity plan that touched off 
deadly protests this week 
balaguer 83 and blind from glaucoma defended his austerity 
plan during the ceremony thursday 
as i assume another term i am obligated not to make promises 
but to point out the changes that are needed to make the government 
work the conservative president said in his inaugural address 
the nationwide strike monday and tuesday brought this caribbean 
nation of 7 million people to a nearstandstill clashes between 
protesters and security forces left at least 11 dead and 50 
wounded police arrested 2000 protesters 
balaguer narrowly defeated his longtime leftist rival juan 
bosch in an election may 16 bosch 81 who accused balaguer of 
widespread voter fraud did not attend the inauguration 
nine major unions organized the 48hour strike this week to 
protest against sharply higher consumer prices caused by the 
government last week the austerity program is intended to bolster 
the countrys ailing economy 
under the program recommended by the international monetary 
fund the government cut subsidies and sharply increased prices for 
basic goods such as gasoline flour and sugar 
the government estimates the annual inflation rate at 50 
percent but some officials privately say it is about 70 percent 
in his speech balaguer did not mention the protests 
specifically but said his economic policies were intended to 
improve the quality of life of the poor and to diminish or 
completely eliminate inflation 
i ask for help and cooperation from all men and women of good 
will in this country because the task we will have in the next four 
years will be arduous he said 
balaguer is beginning his second consecutive fouryear term and 
his sixth over the past 30 years he is founder and leader of 
conservative social christian reformist party 
the president is also a lawyer and author of about 20 books 
in his last term balaguer embarked on an ambitious 2 billion 
public works program that has been mostly financed by printing 
money the construction project much of it timed for completion 
in 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of columbus 
discovery of america created hundreds of jobs but worsened 
inflation

tens of thousands of pakistanis 
reeling from 20 turbulent months of democracy streamed today to 
the grave of gen mohammad zia ulhaqs to pay tribute to the 
fallen dictator on the second anniversary of his death 
mourners traveled by foot cart and bus to the giant faisal 
mosque to offer prayers for zia who died aug 17 1988 in a 
mysterious plane crash all 37 people aboard including several top 
generals and us ambassador arnold raphel were killed 
zias son ijaz ulhaq placed wreaths at the graves of the 
other generals today and then led a huge procession to the faisal 
mosque from the neighboring city of rawalpindi the headquarters of 
the army that has ruled pakistan for more than half of its 43year 
history 
mourners planned to offer prayers for zia later today to mark 
the time his plane crashed in a desert in eastern punjab province 
ijaz was to offer a tribute using the occasion to launch his own 
political career 
zias death anniversary comes less than two weeks after former 
prime minister benazir bhuttos government was dismissed on charges 
of corruption nepotism and ineptitude 
ms bhutto whose father was overthrown by zia in 1977 claims a 
similar coup was staged against her but camouflaged by the 
constitution 
her father zulfikar ali bhutto was hanged in 1979 on charges 
of conspiring the murder a political enemy who was never killed 
she blames zia 
while in power ms bhutto proclaimed her father a martyr for 
democracy ijaz says his father was a martyr for islam 
sixfoot posters of the former military ruler line the wide 
boulevards of the capital giant banners proclaiming zia a martyr 
flutter in the warm summer breeze 
with the future of democracy uncertain many pakistanis are 
fondly remembering zia as a humble compassionate man and 
reminiscing about military rule 
hundreds of people make the pilgrimage to zias grave daily 
ijaz a 38yearold banker on the verge of running for office 
insists that his father was a good model for a candidate 
benazir bhuttos father was a civilian dictator and she came 
to power why cant the son of zia ulhaq asked ijaz 
elections are scheduled for oct 24 but speculation is rife 
that they will be postponed and that another round of military rule 
is inevitable 
a fourfoot framed picture of the former dictator dominates 
ijazs living room propped up at its side is a smaller picture of 
zia one hand on his heart in front of the white house with former 
president reagan striking a similar pose 
zias hercules c130 had been in the air less than five minutes 
when it weaved out of control and nosedived into the ground 
according to witnesses 
a technical report charged sabotage but a criminal 
investigation was never pursued ms bhuttos government made a 
weak attempt at probing the crash and the us government waited a 
year before sending investigators 
ijaz blames alzulfikar a group led by ms bhuttos brother 
murtaza it hijacked a plane in the mid1980s and zia had said 
they were behind several failed assassination attempts 
ijaz also claims president ghulam ishaq khan the army and the 
united states staged a coverup

the trial of 40 soldiers and 
civilians accused in the 1983 murder of president corazon aquinos 
husband ended today but a verdict could take another year a court 
official said 
former sen benigno aquino was assassinated aug 21 1983 as he 
stepped from a plane at the manila airport he was returning from 
selfimposed exile in the united states to lead the opposition 
against the late president ferdinand marcos 
marcos alleged that aquino was killed by a communist assassin 
rolando galman who soldiers shot dead on the tarmac prosecutors 
argued galman was part of a military conspiracy and that a soldier 
actually killed aquino 
prosecutors today asked the court to render a guilty verdict 
with the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation and 
treachery and taking advantage of their government positions 
aquinos slaying sparked massive protests that swept his widow 
to the presidency in february 1986 after a people power revolt 
ousted marcos and drove him to exile in the united states marcos 
died in hawaii in september 1989 
under mrs aquinos administration the supreme court overturned 
a december 1985 acquittal of former chief of staff fabian ver 24 
soldiers and one civilian after the court found evidence that 
marcos engineered the decision ver fled the country during the 
1986 uprising 
in april 1987 government prosecutors indicted 40 people for the 
murder of aquino and galman the case was filed with the 
sandiganbayan court which tries state employees charged with civil 
and criminal suits 
the 40 included ver two generals 33 soldiers and four 
civilians including former tourism minister jose aspiras now a 
member of the house of representatives who was an alleged 
accomplice 
also charged as accomplices were former information minister 
gregorio cendana and former air and former transport minister jesus 
singson 
the 3yearlong trial culminated today after defense lawyers 
and prosecutors submitted summaries of their arguments to the 
threemember court 
clerk of court dolores balajadia said that under philippine law 
the panel of judges has up to one year to make a final ruling 
there are no juries in the philippines where a verdict is the 
responsibility of judges 
during the trial the court saw photographs tape recordings and 
video footage of the seconds before and after aquino slumped dead 
on the tarmac with a single bullet wound in the back of the head 
it also heard the testimony of 51 defense and 79 prosecution 
witnesses including four who claimed they saw a soldier kill 
aquino

the federal communications commission is 
investigating complaints against a public tv station for showing 
some of robert mapplethorpes most sexually explicit photos 
wgbh showed the pictures in a 10 pm news broadcast july 31 
the day before the opening here of an exhibit of the late artists 
work which includes homosexual and sadomasochistic images and 
child nudes 
the fcc has not decided whether to take any action against the 
station said roger holberg an fcc attorney 
the traveling exhibit now on display at the institute of 
contemporary art has generated a storm of protests since it became 
a focus of sen jesse helms crusade against federal funding of art 
deemed indecent 
later the director of a cincinnati gallery that exhibited the 
photographs was arrested on obscenity charges he is awaiting trial 
leading the list of three complaints to the fcc was one by the 
rev donald wildmon head of the american family association in 
tupelo miss 
a letter from wildmon a longtime critic of alleged indeceny in 
media described the broadcast as nothing more than the 
sensational presentation of potentially obscene material 
eric brass attorney for wgbh defended the broadcast 
it just is not obscene brass said thursday i believe we 
have the right to do what we did in the context of a serious news 
program we cannot be in the position of censoring debate about 
censorship 
if material is judged to be obscene it can be banned from being 
broadcast holberg said but material deemed to be indecent is 
given more leeway as long as it is not shown before 8 pm when 
children are more likely to be watching 
congress told the agency last year to restrict broadcasting of 
indecent material 24 hours a day the new rule was challenged by 
broadcasters and other groups and a federal appeals court in 
washington is studying whether it can be enforced 
mapplethorpe put together the exhibit shortly before he died of 
aids last year at age 42 the 124 photographs are mainly portraits 
and pictures of flowers but about a quarter of them are sexually 
graphic 
we wanted to let the public know what the controversy was 
about and let them decide for themselves said julie eggleston a 
spokeswoman for the tv station wgbh as a part of the public 
broadcasting service receives federal funds

a century after the prince of wales 
tailor invented the tailless dinner jacket saratoga springs and 
tuxedo park are rolling up the sleeves of their pleatedfront 
shirts over which town introduced the tux to america 
ed hotaling a parttime columnist for the saratogian stirred 
things up by suggesting that tuxedos be renamed saratogas he 
contends the english creation made its debut in his summer resort 
hometown in upstate new york in the late 1880s 
the exclusive community of tuxedo park 40 miles northwest of 
new york city says the origin is in its name 
tuxedo park mayor cornelius jj madera jr said hotalings 
claim like saratogas famous racetrack smells of horses 
theyre spending too much time in the barns he said 
hotaling who began his campaign nine months ago wrote 
wednesday of a day when all waiters will look down at you in 
their saratogas invitations to parties will note the required 
mens wear in tiny letters saratoga 
hotaling claimed the semiformal evening jacket was first worn to 
a ball in saratoga springs grand union hotel by local playboy e 
berry wall he cites as his source the social historian george 
waller author of saratoga saga of an impious era 
but tuxedo park historian albert f winslow said a more likely 
story is that one of tuxedo parks founders james brown potter 
brought the tuxedo back from england 
the jacket was later picked up by griswold lorillard son of one 
of the founders of tuxedo park who wore a formal jacket with the 
tails cut off to a ball in 1886 winslow said 
you get a couple of department stores selling saratogas 
youll get a change growled hotaling who is also a producer for 
abc news in washington 
but its unlikely the dinner jacket will undergo a name change 
anytime soon 
i just couldnt imagine it happening when a names so 
entrenched in peoples minds said nick valentine owner of 
broadway tailors in newburgh if you say tuxedo you mean formal 
wear

iraq today began freeing iranian 
prisoners of war and withdrawing troops from iranian territory in 
an effort to settle one conflict while it faces growing world 
pressure over its occupation of kuwait 
iran announced it also was freeing iraqi pows today to 
reciprocate for baghdads peace initiative but it did not disclose 
their number 
the first batch of freed iranian pows arrived in qasreshirin 
an iranian border town decorated with the green islamic republic 
flag portraits of the late ayatollah rughollah khomeini and 
colorful ribbons 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia did 
not say how many prisoners had arrived in qasreshirin but 
baghdad and the international committee of the red cross have said 
1000 iranians were to be freed today 
iraqi president saddam hussein wednesday offered to release 
iranians captured in the eightyear war that ended in ceasefire in 
august 1988 peace talks have bogged down since then but saddams 
initiative could speed the process 
saddam also said he hoped to complete within five days the 
withdrawal from iraqioccupied territory in iran 
iraq which invaded kuwait aug 2 and massed troops along that 
countrys border with saudi arabia faces a us and arab troop 
buildup in the saudi desert and a growing world trade embargo 
neutralizing the iraqs 633mile eastern border with iran 
iraqs longest frontier frees an estimated 300000 iraqi troops 
who could be sent to kuwait to face the military buildup in saudi 
arabia 
the red cross has registered 19000 iranian pows in iraq and 
50000 iraqis in iran but estimates both sides actually hold a 
total of more than 100000 
iran says iraq occupies more than 770 square miles of its 
territory but the united nations says the size of the occupied 
area is half that amount 
the allswiss international committee of the red cross which 
has been asked by iraq to supervise the repatriation said 1000 
was the maximum number its baghdad delegation of 19 members could 
handle 
under the geneva convention the delegates must make sure in 
individual interviews that no prisoner is sent home against his 
will 
there have been no problems so far red cross spokeswoman 
martine haemmerli said in geneva 
inmates of an iraqi camp at mosul near the turkish border were 
to make up the first release and delegates began interviewing them 
thursday 
the red cross has said experience gained in the first phase is 
hoped to allow stepping up the pace to an eventual 2000 daily an 
increase of the baghdad delegation is under review but no decision 
has yet been taken 
saddam made his peace initiatives in a letter to iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani in the message he also accepted 
irans demand that a settlement of the border dispute be based on a 
1975 demarcation treaty 
saddam had rejected the 1975 agreement which divided the 
shattalarab waterway between them he wanted sovereignty over the 
channel a confluence of the tigris and the euphrates that is a 
major iraqi outlet to the gulf 
iranian officials on thursday welcomed saddams offer but 
rafsanjani said developments on the iraniraq front were separate 
from the crisis triggered by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
we hold on to our view that iraq must evacuate its forces 
from the kuwaiti territory to create the necessary conditions for 
reestablishment of peace and tranquility irans official news 
agency quoted rafsanjani as saying

four sailors have lost their clearance to work 
on nuclear ships because they publicly questioned nuclear reactor 
program safety on the aircraft carrier nimitz instead of telling 
superiors navy officials said 
the sailors have been temporarily assigned to the ships 
engineering department received pay cuts and will eventually be 
assigned to another post because the navy no longer trusts them to 
work around reactors navy spokesman cmdr bob pritchard said 
thursday 
the commanding officer lost confidence in their ability to 
perform pritchard said they would be made available for 
reassignment to another ship or installation depending on their 
qualifications 
but family members awaiting the nimitzs arrival today at north 
island naval air station contend the navy made scapegoats of the 
men without adequately investigating their complaints 
there are too many questions they dont want answered i 
wonder what the navy is afraid of said rima puma the mother of 
machinist mate second class steven puma 
puma and three shipmates told a seattle television station aug 
2 that crew members cheated on exams to compensate for their 
inadequate training that test results for radiation leaks were 
fabricated and that faulty hardware was installed on the nimitz 
based in bremerton wash 
the four also threatened to sabotage the vessels reactors to 
draw attention to their complaints the names of the other three 
sailors have not been released 
a joint investigation by several naval agencies found no 
evidence to support the allegations made and concluded that the 
ships reactors are safe and that the crew is qualified to operate 
them pritchard said 
but the probe did reveal that some sailors cheated on exams that 
covered their technical knowledge of the nimitzs nuclear reactor 
procedures 
a handful of guys admitted they looked on their buddies test 
paper during one exam pritchard said however there was no 
finding that would call into question the qualification and 
capability of the crew to operate the propulsion plant safely 
nimitz capt robert c williamson ordered the four sailors into 
protective custody as the ship was leaving its home port they were 
released aug 8 after the ship sailed pritchard said 
the crewmen received a verbal reprimand from williamson while at 
sea the skipper later revoked their nuclear credentials 
prohibiting them from working on any of the navys nuclearpowered 
ships the demotion also reduces the sailors merit pay for 
enlisting in the navys nuclear program 
officials said the crewmen were disciplined because they did not 
use military hot lines to air their concerns or take their 
complaints to supervising officers

take a hike saddam hussein 
the metropolitan transit commission is counting on public 
distaste for the iraqi president to boost ridership on city buses 
and encourage car pooling 
saddams picture and the words stop pumping him up 
appeared in newspaper advertisements in the star tribune of 
minneapolis and the saint paul pioneer press thursday 
the commission has had an advertising campaign since last spring 
encouraging twin citians to conserve energy by taking the bus and 
sharing rides 
after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and gasoline and oil prices 
began to rise the wheels started turning at grant amp palombo an 
advertising agency 
its an opportunistic message that happens to tie into the 
campaign we have in place for the mtc said john palombo the ad 
agencys chief executive officer 
below a head shot of saddam the ad reads its about time we 
showed this guy we dont need his oil take the bus or rideshare 
and you do just that 
phones at mtc headquarters were busier than usual thursday with 
callers asking for bus and car pooling information in reaction to 
the ads commission officials said 
people see it as a way of venting the frustration everyone 
seems to be feeling palombo said 
its too soon to tell if iraqs invasion and rising gasoline 
prices are boosting ridership but there are encouraging signs 
said todd melby mtc communications coordinator 
a comparison of revenues for the first two weeks of this month 
and the same period in august 1989 shows revenues are even with 
last years thats good news because revenues had been down this 
year 
so were actually saying were up 2 percent melby said

the justice department is investigating 
allegations that its nazihunting unit withheld evidence on a 
former california resident convicted of war crimes by a yugoslav 
court according to a published report today 
the departments office of professional responsibility is 
conducting the investigation into the case of andrija artukovic 
the los angeles times quoted unidentified sources as saying 
one official familiar with the probe said there was no evidence 
artukovic was falsely convicted of ordering the deaths of hundreds 
of serbs jews and gypsies during world war ii the newspaper said 
artukovic served as a cabinet minister in a nazi puppet 
government in wartime croatia that executed thousands he emigrated 
to the united states in 1948 under an alias and resided in seal 
beach before he was identified and extradited to yugoslavia in 
1986 two years later he died at age 88 in a yugoslav prison 
artukovics son radoslav alleges that the nazihunting unit 
the office of special investigations withheld evidence that might 
have cast doubt on two witnesses whose testimony was used against 
his father during extradition proceedings 
justice department spokesman doug tillett declined to comment on 
the allegations and the investigation 
radoslav artukovic said he had obtained conflicting affidavits 
by witnesses against his father and alleged that office of 
professional responsibility officials withheld those less favorable 
to their case the times said 
according to one affidavit a former serbian police chief 
fronjo truhar testified in 1952 that during the war artukovic had 
ordered an imprisoned lawyer to be killed the execution was 
carried out in july 1941 truhar said 
but in a 1951 affidavit truhar never mentioned artukovics 
alleged order to execute the lawyer that affidavit allegedly was 
not used as evidence at the extradition hearings the times said 
radoslav artukovic obtained documents that contradict an 
affidavit obtained in 1984 from bajro avdic who claimed he served 
as a motorcycle escort for artukovic in 1941 the times said 
avdic claimed he saw artukovic order soldiers to massacre 
innocent civilians but radoslav artukovic said the man had 
submitted three previous statements dating back to 1946 that 
differed substantially in details and recollections 
he changed his story each time he told it the younger 
artukovic said 
in addition radoslav artukovic alleges it was the office of 
professional responsibility not yugoslav officials that initiated 
extradition proceedings against his father 
neal m sher director of the office of special investigations 
has denied the allegation and said the justice department merely 
cooperated with a request by yugoslav officials the times said

and desolation and after sundown theres the fear of violence and 
death said one kuwaiti saeed hussein

seven people have been arrested in connection 
with the alleged delivery of a poison gas plant to iraq several 
years ago a west german prosecutor said today 
the prosecutor friedrich hoffmann in darmstadt said that among 
those arrested was a man he identified only as al kadhi an iraqi 
specialist employed by the west german foreign intelligence service 
hoffmann said the arrests which came after several years of 
investigation took so long because evidence was needed to prove 
that the plant allegedly delivered to iraq was constructed to 
produce poison gas 
the arrests were based on violation of west german export laws 
which limit and in many cases ban the sale or delivery of weapons 
of destruction to areas of conflict such as the middle east 
hoffmann said 
he said the plant produced mustard gas among other deadly 
chemical agents 
among those arrested were employees of the pilot plant company 
in dreieich 12 miles south of frankfurt workers in the export 
section of the preussag company in hanover and from the walter 
engineering trading company in hamburg hoffmann said 
he emphasized that the accusations were directed at individuals 
and not at the companies he named 
the west german news magazine der spiegel reported this week 
that dozens of german firms were helping iraq produce rockets 
chemical weapons and military nuclear technology 
the report coming in the middle of the persian gulf crisis and 
iraqi president saddam husseins threats to attack israel with 
chemical weapons angered an already anxious jerusalem 
israeli foreign minister david levy has demanded that steps be 
taken against west germans and others allegedly involved in helping 
iraq develop chemical weapons he met with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher on tuesday in bavaria to discuss 
those concerns 
according to the spiegel report al kadhi had worked for the 
west german foreign intelligence in iraq where he was arrested by 
iraqi officials and sentenced to death for spying several years ago 
the report said that president richard von weizsaecker of west 
germany interceded with iraq for clemency following a visit by 
genscher in 1987 for talks with iraqi president saddam hussein al 
kadhis sentence was reduced to life in prison a short time later 
al kadhi whom spiegel described as of germaniraqi descent 
arrived in west germany 
the 51yearold al kadhi began working with the walter 
engineering trading company in hamburg from where he allegedly 
shipped material for producing chemical weapons to iraq the 
magazine said 
the material which the magazine said was shipped to iraq via 
turkey was allegedly used to contruct a poison gas plant in iraq 
the report did not say exactly when the materials for the plant 
were shipped to iraq 
saddam has used chemical weapons in the past both in the 
iraniraq war and against kurds in his own country and officials 
in his government have threatened to use them against us forces 
massing in saudi arabia 
west german companies were also involved in developing a 
suspected libyan chemical weapons plant and possibly a second such 
facility the disclosures in december 1988 raised a storm of 
protest 
in june juergen hippenstielimhausen head of the 
imhausenchemie company was found guilty of shipping materials for 
an alleged chemical weapons plant in libya he was sentenced to 
five years in prison 
prosecutors said earlier this month that imhausen may have 
supplied plans for a second chemical weapons facility 
the united states alleged that the first plant in rabta 50 
miles from tripoli was intended to produce chemical weapons 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi denied it and said the plant was 
for pharmaceuticals 
in addition italy britain turkey greece and west germany 
have all seized material in the last year meant for baghdad and 
suspected of being components of a giant gun capable of firing 
shells hundreds of miles

the state agreed to revise its learnfare 
program which cuts welfare benefits to families whose children 
skip school in order to meet a judges objections that it may be 
unfair in some cases 
critics and supporters of the controversial 2yearold program 
should reach a final agreement by november said edward marion 
chief counsel for the wisconsin department of health and social 
services 
we have essentially agreed in principle on what is necessary 
to lift the injunction marion said thursday following a hearing 
before us district judge terence t evans 
last month evans ordered the suspension of learnfare in 
milwaukee saying recordkeeping errors had resulted in unfair 
treatment of some families receiving aid to families with dependent 
children 
the advocacy group legal action of wisconsin had sued on behalf 
of six families who claimed their afdc benefits were wrongly cut 
because of errors in school attendance records 
the injunction applied only to the 3200 teenagers attending 
milwaukee public schools that have lost or were in danger of losing 
benefits the program is still in effect elsewhere in wisconsin 
anne deleo a lawyer for legal action told evans that the state 
and her group have agreed that milwaukee county and the state 
department of health and social services will verify students 
attendance records before reducing their parents welfare benefits 
she said the state also will investigate teenagers reasons for 
skipping school to make sure the absences were not for legitimate 
reasons such as illness or death in the family 
the state also agreed to issue notices to a teenager and the 
family when they are being monitored for possible sanction 
weve got the agreement in principle that these things should 
be done ms deleo said how we do that and with what personnel 
we do it is still undecided 
learnfare authorized by the legislature in 1987 deducts about 
100 a month for an average family receiving 517 a month in afdc 
benefits if one of its teenagers is consistently truant 
legal action attorneys estimated that 1600 to 2000 milwaukee 
students were sanctioned each month under the program 
of the 30000 students subject to learnfare half live in 
milwaukee county and threefourths of the sanctions have been 
levied there according to state figures 
evans scheduled the next status hearing for jan 8 but said the 
injunction could be lifted sooner

ordered britons and americans to assemble at kuwait hotels but 
then failed to turn up to meet them there are 4000 britons and 
2500 americans in kuwait 
we are trying to clarify the situation both in baghdad and in

the state casino board today said it 
would hold off ruling on donald trumps financial restructuring 
until next tuesday despite his attorneys pleas that a quick ruling 
was needed to stave off a possible bankruptcy 
valerie armstrong acting chairwoman of the casino control 
commission said the panel realizes the importance of a quick 
decision but said it needed more time to look over the more than 
1000 pages of documents detailing a 65 million emergency loan 
granted to trump in june by banks 
as far as i am concerned this is expedited ms armstrong 
said 
on thursday trump attorney thomas cerabino had said that if the 
panel delays making its ruling for a week the plan could fall 
apart because the delay could trigger a string of defaults 
but today ed tracy president of the developers three atlantic 
city casinos played down any such talk asked about the effects of 
the delay until tuesday tracy said nothing specifically its 
merely a delay 
trump himself had no comment 
after the flamboyant developer missed a june 15 bond payment on 
the trump castle casino he entered into feverish negotiations with 
a group of seven banks the bankers agreed to an emergency 65 
million loan secured by equity in his three casinos 
but the agreement isnt final until it is approved by the state 
casino commission 
in its closing arguments today the state division of gaming 
enforcement recommended approval of the deal but said it was doing 
so reluctantly and attached 13 conditions trump attorneys said the 
organization would have no trouble meeting the conditions which 
were primarily reporting requirements 
thomas auriemma a deputy state attorney general said the 
gaming division was recommending approval of the deal because the 
situation for the trump organization is critical there are no easy 
or viable alternatives 
the company has left us at this point with little 
alternative auriemma said the division reluctantly recommends 
approval 
in his closing arguments trump attorney nicholas ribis pleaded 
with the commission to approve the deal saying trump has always 
honored his pledges and remains committed to atlantic city 
documents released wednesday show trumps debt at 32 billion 
against assets worth between 29 billion and 35 billion 
on thursday auriemma had described the trump organization as 
in dire straits and said the possibility of complete financial 
collapse is not out of the question 
but stephen bollenbach hired thursday as the trump 
organizations chief financial officer told the commission the 
trump empire could shed its debt 
clearly things need to change in this company said 
bollenbach i dont think that means were in dire straits but 
certainly somebody else might 
among the 13 conditions recommneded by the division are 
requirements that trump return in three weeks after any commission 
decision to detail his plan for making a 47 million bond payment

a state representative announced he was 
withdrawing his reelection bid and revealed he had been working 
undercover to help the fbis investigation of corruption among 
fellow legislators 
while some people might question the wisdom of assisting the 
fbi in their investigation i can only say when the fbi wants 
you to cooperate you will cooperate state rep robert kohn 
said reading from a letter he said he was mailing to constituents 
in his statement thursday kohn acknowledged that in his 15 
years in the legislature he had become part of the corrupt system 
he had intended to reform he said he had been working for the fbi 
for several months 
the charleston republican refused to answer questions but a 
newspaper reported he had discussed a plea bargain with prosecutors 
us attorney bart daniel also declined to answer questions 
about kohns statement including whether it had been cleared with 
him 
sources have said the fbi videotaped legislators taking money a 
federal grand jury looking into the case meets tuesday 
the investigation dubbed operation broken trust also 
involves lobbyist ron cobb a former house member according to 
legislators he offered them cash in exchange for their support on 
a bill that would have allowed parimutuel betting in south 
carolina 
kohn reported accepting 150 from cobb 
in his letter kohn revealed little of the details of his 
participation with the fbi or how he got involved 
when i first went to columbia i resolved to change the way 
business was done the good ol boy system if you will i not 
only failed to do that but i became a part of the system itself 
kohn said 
the irony is that by cooperating with the fbi i am indeed 
facilitating change but in a much different and more drastic 
manner than i had ever imagined 
he withdrew from his contest with democrat ida morea for 
personal and business reasons kohn said but he added his 
withdrawal will grant me the additional latitude i need to assist 
the fbi and the us attorney in their investigation and 
prosecution of public corruption in south carolina 
the state newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that 
kohn spent part of this week reviewing videotapes and working out a 
plea bargain with federal attorneys 
kohn an insurance consultant was the only one of the 16 
lawmakers known to have been questioned by the fbi who faced 
opposition in the november election

police fired tear gas today to 
break up groups of armed men as authorities tried to halt savage 
black factional fighting that has killed at least 178 people in the 
past five days 
at least five people were killed today in soweto police said 
police in armored vehicles dispersed groups of zulus armed with 
axes and spears in various parts of soweto witnesses said 
the african national congress today accused the south african 
security forces of inciting township violence in a bid to divide 
the black majority anc supporters have accused police of aiding 
inkatha in the violence a charge denied by authorities 
it is a matter of record that the south african government has 
developed a wellknown capacity for destabilization in 
neighboring countries the anc said it is our conviction that 
these methods and tactics have been brought to bear on the home 
front to bring about insecurity fear and a willingness to 
submit to draconian measures 
the police again used tear gas to halt a late morning 
confrontation between a group of zulus and soweto residents the 
witnesses said at least 26 people were killed and 217 injured in 
soweto in two days of violence between rival zulus and xhosas 
police said 
the soweto deaths raised the overall toll to 178 in five days of 
fighting in several johannesburg townships where police were still 
finding bodies from clashes earlier in the week 
most were hacked to death a police spokesman col tienie 
halgryn told the independent south african press association 
police said today that hundreds of people had also been injured 
in the five days of fighting 
a family of six including four children was admitted to a 
hospital today after their home in the kagiso township was 
firebombed police said a police spokeswoman said it was an 
isolated incident 
the fighting pits zulu supporters of the conservative inkatha 
movement against mostly xhosa members of the anc led by nelson 
mandela 
nationalism is intense among the zulus the largest tribal group 
in south africa many zulus involved in the fighting say they would 
not accept mandela and the anc as a future government 
throughout the night blacks erected street barricades in soweto 
with burning tires and debris that police tore down police fired 
tear gas to disperse roaming bands the witnesses said 
the spreading unrest led to an unscheduled meeting thursday 
between mandela and president fw de klerk mandela later met with 
law and order minister adriaan vlok the two sides agreed to form 
peace committees composed of police anc and inkatha members in the 
troubled areas 
but police said an initial meeting scheduled for today at a 
soweto police station was delayed 
on thursday night white rightwing protesters hurled a teargas 
bomb into a community hall in vryheid in northern natal where de 
klerk was giving a speech police dispersed the proapartheid 
protesters and de klerk delivered the speech outside the hall 
as dawn broke today many of sowetos 2 million residents began 
heading for work in nearby johannesburg and police said most areas 
were returning to normal many people stayed home thursday to 
protect their homes 
the fighting this week was considered some of the worst in five 
years of conflict that originated in south africas eastern natal 
province more than 5000 blacks have died in the conflict 
inkatha and the anc oppose apartheid but are divided by 
leadership rivalry tribal loyalty and differing visions of a 
future south africa 
the move of the conflict into johannesburg and other parts of 
transvaal province indicates the struggle for power between the two 
sides is heating up while the whiteled government moves toward 
majority rule de klerk has promised to end apartheid and share 
political power with the black majority

japan is considering breaking with its longheld 
policy against deployment of military equipment overseas as it 
considers responses to the persian gulf crisis a foreign ministry 
official said friday 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told reporters he did not 
preclude the possibility the government was considering sending 
minesweepers to the middle east 
asked about the constitutionality of this he said to make it 
a reality we have to go through various heated discussions among 
various agencies in the government as well as take into 
consideration the public opinion of japan if there is any 
difference of opinion on constitutionality we go down to the roots 
of the discussion and find out whether it is constitutional or not 
that is what we are doing right now 
japans postwar constitution bars the use of force as a means of 
settling international disputes and forbids the maintenance of 
land air and sea forces since the early 1950s that has been 
interpreted as allowing a purely defensive military 
current law also restricts the selfdefense forces japans 
military to japanese territory except for participation in 
ceremonial occasions overseas 
changes in the law would likely bring a strong reaction from 
japanese opposition parties and neighboring countries opposed to a 
greater role for japans military 
foreign minister taro nakayama began a nineday trip to the 
middle east on friday to visit countries affected by the 
iraqkuwait crisis his mission is to determine what actions japan 
can take to help the international effort to punish iraq for 
invading kuwait watanabe said 
japanese news reports said the sending of minesweepers could be 
seen as a defensive act needed to protect japans oil supply japan 
imports 99 percent of the oil it uses and is more dependent on 
middle east oil than any industrialized nation 
japans military remains controversial here and increases in 
defense spending are hotly debated asian nations invaded by japan 
during world war ii also have opposed increases in japans military 
strength 
japan previously has sent nonmilitary personnel to join 
peacekeeping or monitoring forces in nambia nicaragua and along 
the afghan border 
watanabe said japanese public opinion once sharply opposed to 
any kind of military involvement overseas has changed that kind 
of opposition which i have seen before is much much less these 
days he said

rebel leader charles taylor suffered 
minor injuries in an auto accident delaying his departure for 
peace talks with a rival rebel chief and an envoy to president 
samuel k doe an official said today 
tom woewiyu taylors spokesman and defense minister said the 
accident occurred as the rebel chief prepared to leave liberia for 
talks monday in banjul gambia on how to resolve liberias 
8monthold civil war 
the accident was not serious but taylor returned to the 
firestone rubber plantation clinic for treatment and to arrange new 
transport woewiyu said from abidjan ivory coast the plantation 
is 35 miles southeast of monrovia 
woewiyu did not say when taylor would leave liberia for banjul 
the meeting was announced thursday by gambian government 
sources word of the talks could lead to further delays in the 
deployment of a sixnation west african force charged with halting 
the fighting 
us marines today flew about 360 indian nationals from the uss 
saipan off the liberian coast to freetown capital of neighboring 
sierra leone they were airlifted thursday from the us embassy in 
monrovia to the warship 
a us embassy spokesman in freetown told reporters the marines 
had evacuated about 700 people in the past week mostly foreigners 
and would continue evacuating the capital on sunday 
the united states has sent troops and ships to protect us 
installations in liberia but says it will not intervene militarily 
to end the conflict 
the agreement on a liberian meeting to end the war was being 
arranged between both rebel factions and a doe envoy said 
government sources in banjul 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said taylor and 
rival rebel leader prince johnson were expected to attend talks 
monday in banjul 
nigerian and guinean troops meanwhile are mobilizing in 
freetown sierra leone with soldiers from gambia ghana sierra 
leone and togo forming a force to exceed 2500 men 
the international force is charged with ending the civil war 
that has killed about 5000 people most of them civilians 
taylors rebels had evacuated most foreigners but not scores 
of guineans and nigerians from monrovias battlefront in an 
18vehicle convoy on wednesday 
woewiyu said nigeria and guinea whose leaders are friends of 
doe are trying to use the west african force as a cover to get

the woman at the heart of a clerical sex scandal 
claims she was married to former atlanta roman catholic archbishop 
eugene marino and her lawyer says they were trying to have a baby 
vicki long who also claims to have been romantically involved 
with one other priest spoke publicly thursday for the first time 
since marinos resignation in july as the nations highestranking 
black roman catholic 
gloria allred charged at a news conference that church 
officials eager to split up the couple tried to convince ms long 
that marino is insane 
a spokesman for marino denied the charges and said the church 
does not believe ms long and marino were married 
we are making no claims whatsoever that the archbishop was 
insane we never have made such claims the rev peter dora said 
archbishop marino has made it clear that there was no marriage 
ceremony or vows and that he is not or never was married to vicki 
long 
marino 56 resigned earlier this summer because of his twoyear 
involvement with ms long though catholic priests take lifelong 
vows of celibacy church officials acknowledge that the couple had 
an intimate relationship 
ms long said the relationship was not simply an affair 
archbishop marino and i exchanged marriage vows in december 
1988 and i have considered myself to be married to him since that 
time she said reading from a statement 
ms long 27 of riverdale did not answer questions at the news 
conference she said the church supported her financially but 
damaged her relationship with marino 
i believe that people who are trusted by the archbishop and 
who benefited from that trust have now turned against him she 
said i encourage archbishop marino to be strong to know that i 
still love him and that i stand by him 
the archbishop seduced her married her lived with her as 
husband and wife and now has been taken away from her by her 
church ms allred said 
the two spent almost every night together when he was in 
town and dated openly ms allred said at the height of the 
romance the couple tried to have a child the lawyer said 
in december 1988 marino performed a wedding ceremony in which 
the two exchanged rings the lawyer said 
ms allred said whether the marriage was legal will be 
determined at a later point and she refused to say whether a 
marriage certificate had been filed 
after marino went into seclusion he was calling vicki six or 
seven times a day and telling her that the church was placing 
considerable pressure on him to resign and trying to convince him 
that he was sick and crazy ms allred said 
two persons close to marino disputed ms longs contention that 
she and the former archbishop spent significant amounts of time 
together 
the week before he left he worked 103 hours and i was with 
him all the time said gerard oconnor marinos administrative 
assistant and chauffeur i never saw them together 
marinos housemate for about a year until may the rev don 
kenny director of vocations for the archdiocese said he never saw 
ms long in the house and that marino stayed at the house virtually 
every night he was in town 
bishop james p lyke acting administrator of the archdiocese 
on thursday denied a report by tv station waga that marino who 
church officials said was admitted to a psychiatric hospital a week 
before had overdosed on pills and was under a suicide watch at st 
vincents hospital in harrison ny 
approached at his hospital room thursday by a reporter from the 
atlanta constitution marino said he had no comment 
the rev michael woods of sandy springs also resigned because of 
intimate ties to ms long but she denied she had a sexual 
relationship with woods she has filed a lawsuit against the church 
claiming the rev donal keohane formerly of columbus fathered her 
4yearold daughter 
blood tests proved keohane was not the father but the church is 
paying child support

theres been a minimum of conviviality i 
can assure you 
one us official used those words to sum up the trying times of 
the handful of american diplomats who deal directly with iraqi 
authorities these days 
presidents bush and saddam hussein have accused each other of 
lying but at least are able to exchange the insults at long 
distance american and iraqi diplomats dont have that luxury 
for example the officer in charge of the us embassy in 
baghdad joseph wilson or a standin goes to the iraqi foreign 
ministry several times a day on behalf of the 3000 americans 
stranded in kuwait and iraq he always comes back emptyhanded 
less frequently iraqs ambassador to washington mohammed 
mashiq almashat is summoned to the 6th floor state department 
office that deals with the persian gulf issue 
he sits upstairs and tells us he doesnt know and then comes 
downstairs to the press and denies everything said one 
official articulating a widely shared frustration among us 
diplomats 
almashats meetings at the state department usually are short 
and heated said another official the iraqi envoy was 
unavailable to give his account of the sessions 
wilson aside from his discussions at the foreign ministry also 
has been checking in with more than 30 americans detained under 
armed guard at the hotel rashid in baghdad keeping them apprised 
of developments wilson making his rounds in 100 degree plus heat 
has yet to bring them good news 
on friday the situation for the americans may have taken an 
ominous turn with reports they had been moved for the first time 
embassy officials were unable to visit with them 
as the usiraqi military confrontation mounts a sixyear 
american effort to cultivate baghdad is looking like one of the 
more futile diplomatic exercises of the past decade 
starting with the normalization of relations in november 1984 
the united states has tried to woo the iraqis through expanded 
trade and other ties since the events of aug 2 when iraq invaded 
kuwait diplomats like wilson have been left to pick up the pieces 
at each meeting with iraqi authorities us diplomats have 
stated in the clearest terms the us demand that iraq allow the 
stranded americans to leave 
as officials describe it the iraqi explanations for their 
actions have been increasingly unconvincing more and more the 
americans look like pawns in the war of nerves between the two 
governments saddams actions according to some analysts suggest 
that he sees the americans on his turf as insurance against an 
allout us military attack 
that he regards the americans as bargaining chips seemed more 
evident on thursday when iraqi military authorities ordered all 
2500 americans in kuwait to report to a downtown hotel in kuwait 
city the order has been widely ignored 
the iraqis generally have given contradictory accounts of what 
they have in mind for the americans almashat has said the 
americans will be free to leave in due course but other envoys 
have said flatly the americans will be forced to stay put until the 
current crisis ends 
in baghdad iraqi under secretary for foreign affairs nazir 
hamdoon has been citing bureaucratic delays in explaining why the 
americans have not been allowed to leave 
we have told them that iraqi credibility has been severely 
strained one american official said

education secretary lauro cavazos told 
educators from this texasmexico border area today that students 
who do not speak english are not ready to learn and drew swift 
criticism 
cavazos speaking to about 1500 laredo principals and teachers 
urged them to get parents more involved in education and to make 
sure students have a command of english 
parental involvement and language competency are basic 
cavazos said if that child cannot speak english the first day of 
school that child is not ready to learn 
in a panel discussion afterward south texas superintendents 
took issue with cavazos statement about language 
the comment that we heard this morning that students who are 
not speaking english are not ready to learn is a disabling 
comment robert zamora superintendent of the la joya school 
district said to rousing applause zamora said students are 
capable of learning in other languages 
cavazos a native of south texas and former president of texas 
tech university said he supports bilingual education but said its 
goal should be to move the students into speaking english 
young people cannot take full advantage of all opportunities in 
the united states without speaking english he said 
cavazos said the bush administration favors giving educators 
more freedom because that helps ensure parental involvement and 
language competency 
throughout his speech cavazos emphasized his remarks referred 
to national education not specifically to laredo or texas 
that said cavazos again stated his position that spending more 
money is not the answer to education problems he said how money is 
spent is more important 
earlier this year cavazos came under fire from some state 
lawmakers when he made that statement in a speech to the texas 
legislature which was grappling with school finance reform 
cavazos today mentioned the texas finance dilemma here in 
texas much of the attention has been on school finance and there 
have been some inequities he said 
later today cavazos was to cross the border to nuevo laredo to 
sign a firstever binational education agreement with mexico

beginning to receive preliminary housing counts the census bureau 
reports 
official population numbers wont be issued until at least the 
end of the year though preliminary ones will be sent to state 
officials within a few weeks 
the early housing reports are designed to allow local 
governments to challenge the bureaus findings pointing out areas 
where homes and people may have been missed officials said 
the census got under way in march with the mailing of nearly 100 
million forms in recent weeks workers have been going doortodoor 
to try to count people who were missed in the first phase 
sending the preliminary count to local officials does not mean 
that the effort is complete census director barbara everitt bryant 
said

soviet justice minister vf yakovlev said at 
the close of a weeklong visit friday that he looks forward to 
continued discussions on legal regulation of economic markets 
we have simply lost the talent for market regulation and we 
have to relearn all this yakovlev said during a joint news 
conference with attorney general dick thornburgh 
the meetings resulted from similar sessions last october in 
moscow when the two agreed to a regular exchange of information on 
legislation and judicial decisions regarding topics such as 
individual rights the environment organized crime drug 
trafficking trade and immigration 
thornburgh and yakovlev signed another joint statement friday 
agreeing to continue the discussions and expand them to include 
consumer protection civil litigation civil rights matters and 
federalism 
in addition they agreed to study development of a bilateral 
arrangement to help each other on civil and criminal cases as well 
as the formal establishment of working groups to address annually 
the administration of justice issues 
as part of the us exchange of legislative actions thornburgh 
said he had presented to the soviets a russianlanguage summary of 
the recently passed civil rights law the americans with 
disabilities act 
yakovlev said his country has made great advances in the last 18 
months in establishing a separation of powers with individual 
executive legislative and judicial branches similar to what exists 
in the united states 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev as part of perestroika has 
expressed interest in developing a legal system that relies on due 
process rather than arbitrary decisions of bureaucrats 
this is a very difficult process were engaged in yakovlev 
said through a translator but added later that development of such 
separate branches of government is becoming a reality in the 
ussr 
of particular interest to the soviets meeting here was the 
details of the interaction between the three powers in the united 
states 
although the discussions didnt focus on particular legal cases 
yakovlev said he had heard about the savings and loan crisis in 
this country 
thornburgh commented to have an sampl crisis you have to have 
sampls first 
we do have them responded yakovlev perhaps not as well 
developed as in the united states 
that kind of development you dont need quipped thornburgh 
one aspect of the us system that particularly interested the 
soviets was the community services program that attempts to mediate 
disputes between people before they come into court 
this is something we never had heard about before yakovlev 
said these things are like terra incognita to us

quit and it was followed by a slightly smaller head 
unconditional surrender ends war in europe 
smith went back on the roof laid the paper down and placed 
shingles over it 
i remember thinking that if and when the roof was redone 
someone would find the newspaper he said 
smith was recently given the job of reroofing the auditorium

jurors weighing the fate of three former 
pilots accused of flying a jetliner while under the influence of 
alcohol have instructions not to reach their verdicts solely on 
bloodalcohol content 
the jury met for more than five hours thursday and for three 
hours today in the case the us justice departments first 
prosecution under a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a 
passenger jet while under the influence of alcohol jurors were to 
resume deliberations monday 
in giving the jury the case us district judge james rosenbaum 
pointed out that there is no set standard as to the quantity of 
alcohol a person must consume before a person is regarded as being 
under the influence of alcohol 
he set this definition for being under the influence when a 
person is so affected by an alcoholic beverage that the person does 
not possess that clearness of intellect and control of himself as 
he otherwise would 
the offense carries up to 15 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
the legal limit for driving a car in many states is 10 percent 
but federal law does not specify an illegal bloodalcohol content 
for pilots 
in tests the northwest airlines pilots had bloodalcohol 
readings of 006 percent 008 percent and for the captain 013 
percent 
since the trial opened july 25 defense attorneys have argued 
that the pilots were not impaired and that the proof is that the 
40minute boeing 727 flight from fargo nd to the twin cities on 
march 8 was flawless 
the pilots were arrested at minneapolisst paul airport after a 
lumber salesman had reported to the federal aviation administration 
that the pilots had been drinking in a bar outside fargo at least 
six hours before the flight left with 91 passengers 
first officer robert kirchner and flight engineer joseph balzer 
said they shared beer from at least six pitchers the night before 
the scheduled 6 am flight captain norman lyle prouse said he 
drank 15 to 20 rum and colas a waitress said balzer and kirchner 
left about 1030 pm and prouse about 1130 pm 
you dont have to find that they were totally smashed just 
that they were under the influence assistant us attorney 
elizabeth de la vega told the jury 
a toxicologist estimated inflight bloodalcohol levels for 
kirchner and balzer to be equal to about three beers each prouse 
had the equivalent of about eight mixed drinks in his system at 
takeoff the toxicologist said 
at those levels the defendants were under the influence of 
alcohol de la vega said 
prouse 51 of conyers ga kirchner 36 of highland ranch 
colo and balzer 35 of antioch tenn testified they were not 
impaired on the flight prouse an alcoholic said 35 years of 
drinking have given him a high tolerance for alcohol 
northwest fired the pilots for violating its 12hour prohibition 
against drinking before flying and the faa has revoked their 
licenses

police have arrested seven people including 
an intelligence agent in connection with the alleged delivery of a 
deadly poison gas plant to iraq a prosecutor said friday 
the arrests come as us and other troops deploy in the persian 
gulf braced for a possible chemical weapons attack from iraqi 
president saddam husseins forces 
saddam has used chemical weapons in the past against iranian 
troops and iraqs own kurdish minority 
prosecutor friedrich hoffmann in darmstadt identified one of 
those arrested as a man employed by the west german foreign 
intelligence service in iraq he was identified only as al kadhi 
hoffmann said the arrests were the result of several years of 
investigation 
the security policy spokesman for the free democrats olaf 
feldmann called for tightening of export laws in light of the 
developments the free democrats are one of chancellor helmut 
kohls coalition partners 
west german officials were embarrassed by an earlier chemical 
weapons scandal starting in december 1988 there were disclosures 
of widespread west german involvement in constructing one and 
possibly two chemical weapons plants for libya 
the latest arrests stemmed from violations of west german export 
laws hoffmann said those laws limit and in many cases ban the 
sale or delivery of weapons of destruction to areas of conflict 
such as the middle east 
he said among those arrested were employees of the pilot plant 
company in dreieich a darmstadt suburb 12 miles south of 
frankfurt workers in the export section of the preussag company in 
hanover and from the walter engineering trading company in hamburg 
hoffmann stressed that the accusations of illegal shipments to 
iraq were directed at individuals not at the companies 
the west german news magazine der spiegel reported monday that 
dozens of german firms had helped iraq produce rockets chemical 
weapons and military nuclear technology 
the report came in the midst of the crisis set off by iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait and followed threats by iraq to attack 
israel with chemical weapons if iraq is attacked 
according to the spiegel report al kadhi worked for the west 
german foreign intelligence in iraq where he was arrested by iraqi 
officials and sentenced to death for spying several years ago 
werner berghof press spokesman for the west german intelligence 
service said it was against agency policy to comment on personnel 
matters such as its relationship with al kadhi 
berghof reached by telephone at agency headquarters in munich 
repeated an earlier assertion that the service was not indirectly 
or directly involved with the transfer to iraq of technology or 
products needed to make poison gas 
the spiegel report said west german president richard von 
weizsaecker interceded with iraq for clemency for al kadhi 
following a visit by genscher in 1987 for talks with the iraqi 
leader al kadhis sentence was reduced to life in prison 
a short time later al kadhi whom spiegel described as of 
germaniraqi descent arrived in west germany 
the 51yearold al kadhi began working with the walter trading 
company in hamburg from where he allegedly shipped material to 
iraq the magazine said 
the material which the magazine said was shipped to iraq via 
turkey was allegedly used to contruct a gas plant in iraq to 
produce mustard and other deadly chemical agents 
the report did not say exactly when the materials for the plant 
were shipped 
the hamburger morgenpost newspaper said that iraq paid 10 
million for the plant quoting a former employee of the walter 
engineering trading company in hamburg the newspaper also said the 
plant could have gone into production at the beginning of this year

the government has submitted a bill to parliament 
that would allow foreign companies to become sole owners of new 
enterprises in the soviet union prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
said friday 
it would be the first time in at least 60 years that foreigners 
have been allowed to wholly own businesses here under current law 
foreign companies must join with soviet firms in joint ventures 
it is impossible to move toward a market economy while the 
country is isolated from the world economy ryzhkov said in 
remarks carried by the official tass news agency one can no 
longer rely on joint ventures alone 
tass quoted a senior official of the state foreign economic 
commission who asked to remain anonymous as saying the bill would 
encourage foreign investment by granting substantial benefits for 
joint ventures in which the share of foreign capital exceeds 30 
percent 
in a speech friday president mikhail s gorbachev said the main 
cause of the nations economic crisis was the pervasive monopoly 
and domination of state property 
we should carry out privatization but do this within the 
framework of our choice he said 
ryzhkov also appealed for the consolidation of efforts to 
move toward a market economy the government is preparing a program 
for such a transition 
a separate 12member panel is developing a blueprint for moving 
toward a market economy that panel was appointed by gorbachev and 
boris n yeltsin president of the soviet unions largest republic 
russia 
yeltsin on thursday criticized ryzhkov and accused him of 
duplicating the commissions work by developing a parallel economic 
plan he also said that if both plans are presented to the soviet 
parliament russia would adopt its own plan 
but tass said ryzhkov noted that his government began developing 
a plan at parliaments request he expressed surprise that the 
gorbachevyeltsin commission was developing an alternative program 
but said his government would be willing to use everything valuable 
developed by the commission 
if they disagree about how to proceed toward a market that 
may have unpredictable consequences for the entire union ryzhkov 
warned 
he also responded to yeltsins comment that the people do not 
trust the countrys government 
yeltsin is right in one thing no government will be able to 
work without the peoples trust ryzhkov said if yeltsins 
opinion turns out to be true the government will have to quit 
he said he was convinced that the plan developed by the 
government would be completed on schedule and submitted to 
parliament for approval

the us military buildup in the persian gulf 
area codenamed desert shield to suggest its defensive intent is 
adding stealth fighterbombers marine amphibious assault units and 
other forces normally used for offense 
theres a very substantial offensive capability in that area 
now said joshua epstein a defense analyst at the brookings 
institution a private research organization he said the addition 
serves two purposes to help dissuade saddam hussein from sending 
his army into saudi arabia and to reassure the nervous saudis 
the clearest sign of a shift toward offensive capabilities was 
the departure thursday from langley air force base va of f117a 
stealth fighterbombers 
the planes which saw their first combat action during 
decembers invasion of panama are designed to penetrate heavily 
defended areas to attack targets in iraq they could hit supply 
depots or key oil installations 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said plans 
called for sending 22 of the radarevading fighterbombers to the 
persian gulf area 
additional signs of a shift toward offense 
president bush on thursday ordered us naval forces in the 
gulf region to begin intercepting commercial shipping to and 
from iraq and kuwait to enforce un economic sanctions against iraq 
the orders allow the navy to use force against ships if necessary 
an armada of marine corps amphibious assault ships is heading 
for the persian gulf the seaborne units equipped with amphibious 
tracked vehicles that can travel on land at speeds up to 50 mph 
are designed for offensive as well as defensive operations they 
are supported by a variety of aircraft including the fa18 hornet 
a ground attack airplane also capable of airtoair combat 
the air force said b52 bombers have been sent overseas since 
the start of the gulf crisis b52s conducted massive bombing raids 
in the vietnam war also moved to within striking range of iraq are 
us f111 longrange bombers in turkey 
the marines are sending in 45000 of their finest and deploying 
a6e intruder bombers used in the us bombing of libya in 1986 
among other weaponry the marines are taking to saudi arabia 
more than 100 m1 battle tanks and more than 150 fixedwing 
aircraft including harrier vertical takeoff planes used for light 
attack missions and close air support of ground troops 
rear adm steve clarey told an american press pool in saudi 
arabia on friday that the marines will take up defensive positions 
but will be ready to defend as far forward as they can in the 
event iraqs army attacks saudi arabia 
we certainly have assault capability he said this is a 
mechanized capability with tanks armored vehicles light armored 
vehicles they have that mobility and they have that firepower to 
go anywhere theyre told to go 
bush on aug 8 described desert shield as purely defensive 
he has said his ultimate goal was to get the iraqi army out of 
kuwait which it captured on aug 2 and to restore the kuwaiti 
royal family to power while emphasizing an economic embargo he 
has not ruled out the use of us force to try to dislodge the 
iraqi army 
asked whether the f117a stealth planes had any defensive role 
in the gulf crisis pentagon spokesman pete williams said thursday 
i think this gets into the question of deterrence some of those 
forces that you have there would be deterrent by their mere 
presence 
williams was referring to the idea that by sending offensive 
weaponry and large numbers of troops to saudi arabia the bush 
administration could deter saddam from launching an attack out of 
fear that his own country would suffer a devastating counterattack 
spicing the us military deployments with several prominent 
offensive weapons such as the stealth fighterbomber is part of an 
apparent bush strategy to gain the psychological upper hand 
the iraqis are playing equally hard at the intimidation game 
saddam has strongly suggested he would use his chemical weapons 
against us troops if provoked 
pentagon sources say contingency plans call for putting as many 
as 250000 air sea and ground forces in and around saudi arabia 
depending on iraqs military moves

record exports and shrinking oil imports 
helped push the nations merchandise trade deficit to a sevenyear 
low in june the government reported friday but analysts saw oil 
as a problem in coming months because of the mideast crisis 
the economists suggested that while exports may remain strong in 
the second half of the year oil is likely to drive up the cost of 
imports as price hikes from the middle east crisis are added to the 
bill 
the commerce department said the deficit dropped to 507 
billion a 347 percent decline from mays 777 billion and the 
lowest since a 396 billion imbalance was posted in june 1983 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher who had joined many 
analysts earlier in predicting the deficit would drop below 100 
million this year was quick to note the record 3429 billion in 
exports 
while the monthtomonth figures can be erratic the strong 
positive trend indicates increasing us export competitiveness in 
the world marketplace he said 
the 46 percent increase in exports included not only 500 
million in aircraft shipments but gains in other business capital 
equipment as well 
bruce steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch called the 
exports good news since that sector was the only part of the 
economy with any strength in june 
gilbert benz an economist at the swiss bank corp in new york 
said the figure will boost the secondquarter gross national 
product which earlier had been estimated to have grown a meager 12 
percent 
its the one component that might help us skate around a 
recession in the second half of the year benz said 
imports declined 29 percent to 3937 billion helped by a 631 
million drop in oil costs 
oil imports in june fell 146 percent to 369 billion 
americans imported 840 million barrels a day down from 895 
billion in may 
the deficit is the difference between imports and exports and 
for the first six months was running at an annual rate of 9162 
billion if it ended the year at that pace it would be the first 
deficit since 1983 under 100 billion 
analysts were quick however to toss in the middle east caveat 
the persian gulf crisis is already generating oil price 
increases which likely will contribute to a worsening trade deficit 
in the future said john howard international finance director 
at the us chamber of commerce 
unfortunately the merchandise trade deficit has nowhere to go 
but up suggested barry k rogstad president of the american 
business council the price of oil is today nearly double what it 
was in june had the current price prevailed in june the deficit 
would have widened by 35 billion 
indeed commerce said the average price per barrel in june was 
1464 compared with thursdays 2736 a barrel cost for the 
benchmark west texas crude 
as usual the biggest deficit was with japan a 31 billion 
imbalance up from a 30 billion deficit in may other deficits 
included taiwan 900 million china 800 million canada 700 
million brazil 300 million korea 200 million and hong kong 
100 million 
the united states posted a surplus with western europe of 899 
million

moslem worshipers chanted proiraqi slogans and 
reportedly burned american flags after friday noon prayers at 
jerusalems al aqsa mosque one of islams holiest sites 
riot police watched from rooftops but did not interfere the 
crowd dispersed peacefully after half an hour 
in the west bank village of beit furik reporters said about 400 
palestinians bearing the likenesses of plo leader yasser arafat and 
iraqi president saddam hussein chanted syrian president hafez 
assad and egyptian president hosni mubarak are cowards for 
collaborating with the americans 
the demonstrations were the latest in a series of rallies in the 
occupied lands celebrating saddam as the national savior of the 
palestinians and condemning those arab leaders joining the western 
effort to stop iraqi aggression 
both egypt and syria have denounced iraqs invasion of kuwait 
and sent troops to bolster the international force in saudi arabia 
saddam has always been liked by palestinians for his aggressive 
stand toward the west but his popularity began to soar after he 
said he would only pull out from kuwait if the israelis withdrew 
from the west bank and gaza strip 
about 10000 worshipers attended noon prayers at al aqsa which 
stands beside the dome of the rock mosque on haram asharif the 
site where moslems believe the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven 
the area is also venerated by the jews as the site of the jewish 
temple 
in his sermon the al aqsa preacher sharply criticized saudi 
arabia for allowing american forces to land on its territory 
the arab leaders are giving moslem lands to the americans 
he said one day all arab land will be in the hands of the 
americans this land is for moslems and not for americans 
saddam has tried to portray the gulf crisis as a jihad or holy 
war between moslems and infidels mecca islams holiest site is 
in saudi arabia 
following the prayers hundreds of worshipers carrying 
palestinian and islamic flags chanted with our soul with our 
blood well sacrifice for you saddam 
reporters were confined to a rooftop overlooking parts of haram 
asharif and could not see the al aqsa demonstrators 
one of the protesters leaving the compound said american and 
israeli flags were burned the crowd responded by whistling and 
clapping said the man who would only give his first name jumma 
leaders of the antiisraeli palestinian uprising issued a 
leaflet condemning prowestern arab states and declaring the full 
support for the iraqi people in confronting the imperialists 
the leaflet distributed throughout the occupied lands set 
aside saturday as a day of solidarity with iraq through 
demonstrating and marching in every place in our land 
the israeli peace now movement condemned the palestinian views 
in an ad placed in newspapers 
we are disappointed by the enthusiastic palestinian support 
for saddam hussein the ad said the path of saddam hussein is 
the path of violence threats and war support for him is support 
for the resolution of disputes between nations through force

the son of gen mohammad zia ulhaq 
on friday blamed ousted prime minister benazir bhutto for the 
mysterious plane crash that killed his father two years ago but he 
provided no proof 
ijaz ulhaq called on the militarybacked caretaker government 
that replaced ms bhutto to open a new investigation into the crash 
on aug 17 1988 it killed zia many of the countrys top generals 
and us ambassador arnold raphael 
ms bhuttos own father zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown by 
zia in 1977 and hanged in 1979 she says zia issued the execution 
order 
the anniversary of zias death came less than two weeks after 
ms bhuttos government was dismissed on charges of corruption 
nepotism and ineptitude 
ms bhutto who took power in november 1988 claims her ouster 
was a coup camouflaged by use of constitutional powers 
a technical inquiry found the crash that killed zia was 
sabotage but a criminal investigation was never conducted 
ijaz a 38yearold banker blamed ms bhutto her government 
and her pakistan peoples party saying that through criminal 
negligence it covered up any evidence 
the former prime minister and her ministers actually ridiculed 
the tragedy provided cover to the criminals and shut the door on 
any investigation said ijaz speaking at a news conference 
following a brief memorial ceremony for his father but he provided 
no evidence to support his claims 
neither ms bhutto nor her spokesmen could be reached for 
comment but they have dismissed similar allegations as baseless 
earlier ijaz promised to carry on zias dream of wielding an 
islamic federation stretching from the soviet central asian 
republics to western china 
the dream is being fulfilled pakistan afghanistan iran 
turkey ijaz told about 100000 people who crowded onto the 
sprawling grounds of the faisal mosque and climbed its sloping roof 
and towering spires 
a new movement a new unity will start from here ijaz said 
i swear by the grave of zia ulhaq 
with the abrupt change of government and uncertainty over the 
future of democracy many pakistanis are remembering zias 11year 
military rule despite its harshness in a more favorable light 
hundreds of people make the pilgrimage to zias grave daily 
elections are scheduled oct 24 but there has been speculation 
they will be postponed and that another round of military rule is 
in the works the military has ruled pakistan for more than half 
its 43year history

the treatment ms matalin said

said president bush is greatly concerned about lee

president bush today protested 
attempts to move americans trapped in iraq or kuwait against 
their will the white house said bush was considering a selective 
callup of reserves to meet the militarys needs for doctors and 
other specialists 
us ship commanders got orders to intercept all ships carrying 
goods to or from iraq but so far have not had to stop any vessels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the pentagon has asked bush to call up reserves and fitzwater 
said well try to keep this to the smallest possible it is 
likely to be limited to calling up reservists who are doctors 
cargo handlers and other specialists in short supply 
us officials are still trying to find out where the iraqis 
have taken some 38 americans removed from the rashid hotel in 
baghdad fitzwater said they are believed to have been taken to 
another hotel 
iraqi officials have told us they were safe but have not 
given us any explanation as to why they were moved or where they 
are the spokesman said 
in washington the state department reported us diplomats had 
been prevented from entering another hotel the melia monsour to 
see if the americans had been moved there 
clearly we are very seriously concerned about the 
americans said state department spokesman richard boucher 
boucher also reported that food available to americans on open 
markets in iraq and kuwait was diminishing 
on the 2500 americans trapped behind iraqi lines in kuwait 
fitzwater said there are not signs that anyone has been rounded 
up in kuwait no signs of harassment he said the americans 
appeared to be ignoring an iraqi call thursday for americans and 
other foreigners to gather in various hotels 
in fact the state department said today only five americans 
responded to the order and when they got to the hotel they found 
no iraqi officials boucher said the iraqis did not repeat the 
demand today 
on criticism from united nations secretary general javier perez 
de cuellar that the united states may be overstepping its bounds in 
enforcing the naval blockage against iraq fitzwater said we 
obviously believe that article 51 authorizes our intercept 
activities we believe the un understands that 
asked if the united states considered the moving of the 
americans from the rashid hotel an act of provocation fitzwater 
said we consider it a matter of serious concern 
he said it is not known when bush will decide whether to call up 
reserves fitzwater previously has noted that bush has the 
authority to call up to 200000 reserves for 180 days 
but the spokesman said he did not expect any massive callup 
in recent years congress has allocated more and more of the 
support functions for the military to the reserve forces so that 
you find a major aspect of our support in terms of cargo handlers 
and doctors and medical specialists and so forth are in the 
reserves he said 
the president has not made a decision on this yet but he is 
looking at certain specialized categories that would be necessary 
to support the effort in the gulf he said 
bush will return to the white house sunday night and meet monday 
morning with budget aides and energy secretary james watkins the 
session with watkins is to discuss the impact of the persian gulf 
crisis on us energy reserves bush will address the veterans of 
foreign war convention in baltimore later monday as previously 
planned 
bush who put in a predawn call to the white house situation 
room said there was nothing new with the americans in kuwait 
asked what would happen if they were taken to iraq bush said 
i dont think anybody ought to be moved against their will in 
contravention of international law 
he also said the japanese were told that they cannot leave 
the country 
iraqis ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat 
today repeated his assurances that the americans in iraq and kuwait 
wouldnt be harmed interviewed in abcs good morning america 
almashat said i can assure you they are well treated and will 
be released in due time 
bush on thursday signed the order instructing us ship 
commanders in the middle east to intercept ships carrying goods to 
or from iraq or kuwait including shipments through aqaba to the 
maximum extent possible we will conduct operations without the use 
of force the presidents order said 
a pentagon source said earlier that those steps could include 
attempting to block the ships passage or firing a warning shot 
across the bow 
defense secretary dick cheney was bound for riyadh today to 
visit american troops standing guard in the saudi desert against a 
possible further thrust by iraqs saddam hussein whose troops 
overran kuwait aug 2 
the unprecedented deployment of us military ground and air 
power in strategic areas of saudi arabia continued today with the 
unloading of tanks and other heavy equipment and arms us marines 
are rapidly building to a force of 45000 in the middle east 
almost a quarter of their whole strength 
bush after spending more than two hours with jordans king 
hussein on thursday said i cant say i am satisfied but what i 
am is encouraged that jordan intends to abide by the united 
nations sanctions against iraq 
king husseins brother crown prince hassan said on cbs this 
morning that his majesty made it clear to bush that we will 
adhere to the un resolution 
pentagon sources said the marines are building to a force of 
45000 to counter an iraqi army now believed to have grown to 
160000 in overrun kuwait american military planners are preparing 
to put 250000 soldiers on the ground if necessary 
the us navy already has massed 27 ships including three 
carriers in the gulf the nearby arabian sea and the red sea 
the pentagon put its first public price tag on operation desert 
shield nearly 12 billion for just the first 7 weeks the

federal army units moved into the 
streets of a town in croatia today amid rising tension over plans 
to ban a referendum on serb autonomy in the republic the state 
news agency reported 
the tanjug news agency said the army took up positions in the 
croatian town of knin at 630 pm local time less than 30 minutes 
after the mayor declared a state of war 
earlier army jets intercepted three croatian government 
helicopters and forced them to return to their bases tanjug 
reported the army is dominated by serbs traditional rivals of 
croatians 
the unprecedented army moves in the air and in knin followed 
requests for assistance in dealing with interior ministry armored 
vehicles heading toward the town of obrovac where large crowds had 
gathered 
the news agency did not say who had asked for the armys help 
and what kind of assistance was requested 
in obrovac and benkovac large crowds of citizens are in the 
streets hindering and stoppic traffic tanjug said citing a 
statement by the croatian interior ministry 
the news agency also reported that hundreds of serbs living in 
croatia infuriated that authorities planned to ban an unofficial 
referendum on serb autonomy within croatia broke into a police 
station in the town of grachc 
while the statement did not specify to which ethnic group the 
demonstrators in obrovac and benkovac belonged they appeared to be 
serbs angered by the ban 
croatian authorities earlier today vowed to prevent the 
unofficial referendum saying it was aimed at undermining 
democratic reforms in croatia 
leaders of the 400000strong serb minority in western croatia 
had been scheduled to start a twoweek referendum sunday in which 
serbs were to choose whether they want some degree of 
selfgovernment within croatia 
serbia and croatia have been traditional rivals since they were 
united within yugoslavia in 1918 serbs say hundreds of thousands 
of their compatriots were murdered in croatia in world war ii by 
nazilike croatian nationalists 
serbs in croatia claim they are being systematically 
discriminated against by what they allege are extremists in the 
croatian democratic union a centerright political party which 
last spring overwhelmingly won the first free elections in croatia 
in over 50 years 
the serbs are strongly supported by the staterun media in 
neighboring serbia in which the communist party has refused to 
hold westernstyle elections and has described the cdu government 
as fascist and racist 
croatian authorities have said the planned ballot is not legal 
because it is unclear who is organizing it and because croats 
living in the serbian region will be denied the right to 
participate 
croatias new government advocates turning the yugoslav 
federation into a loose association of semiindependent states in 
which national minorities would be guaranteed full political and 
national rights

a group of nine foreigners 
including three americans bolted across the kuwaiti desert to this 
border town today in an effort to avoid an iraqi order to gather at 
a downtown hotel 
no one responded to the iraqi call as far as i know but 
everyone is making a rush to get out of kuwait said stephanie 
mcgehee an american stringer for the associated press who was in 
the group 
contact with ms mcgehee was lost two days after the aug 2 
invasion as the iraqis gradually cut off all telephone and telex 
lines 
on thursday iraqi military authorities ordered britons and 
americans to assemble at kuwait hotels but then failed to turn up 
to meet them there are 4000 britons and 2500 americans in kuwait

trying to get out she said 
the group included both men and women 
ms mcgehee said that in order to escape she and the others had 
all dressed as kuwaitis since she spoke arabic she sat next to the 
driver she carried the identity card of a lebanese friend

woman was shot in the foot in one of the latest convoys of escaping 
nationals

and about 50000 iraqis in iran the united nations estimates that 
both sides actually hold more than 100000 
tehran radio interrupted its normal morning program to announce 
that iraqi troops had begun withdrawing from iranian territory it 
said iranian officers monitoring the development reported the 
withdrawal got under way at 5 am 
morteza sarmadi the foreign ministry spokesman reported 10 
hours later that the iraqis had withdrawn from 164 square miles of 
iranian territory in the ilam region on the central sector of the 
iraniraq border 
iran says iraq occupies more than 773 square miles of its land 
the united nations says the size of the occupied area is half of 
that 
iraqi president saddam hussein has said he hopes to complete 
within five days the withdrawal from territories occupied in the 
closing weeks of the iraniraq war a unsponsored ceasefire 
took effect aug 20 1988 but peace talks stalled immediately 
afterward over disagreement on various issues particularly control 
of the shattalarab waterway along the countries border 
on wednesday saddam agreed to drop demands for full control of 
the waterway and made other concessions to iran to end their 
differences he promised to begin withdrawing troops from occupied 
territory in iran and returning pows 
neutralizing the border with iran allows saddam to focus on the 
conflict with the united states and its western and arab allies 
triggered by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the withdrawal from iranian territory frees some 300000 iraqi 
troops who could then be sent south to kuwait to face the military 
buildup in saudi arabia 
iran has criticized iraqs occupation and annexation of kuwait 
but it also has attacked the usled western intervention in the 
persian gulf 
in a prayer sermon in tehran on friday irans former chief 
justice ayatollah musavi ardebili called on saddam to defuse the 
crisis before a confrontation with the united states 
if you saddam withdraw the imperialists will have no 
pretext for starting a war 
if the united states gets a foothold in the region it will 
never leave ardebili said in the sermon broadcast by tehran 
radio 
before now repatriations of pows had been largely limited to 
the sick wounded or aged angelo gnaedinger the red cross chief 
delegate for the middle east said a total of 969 iranians and 
1343 iraqis had been repatriated before friday he said both sides 
were known to hold more of these hardship cases

federal prosecutors said today they will 
appeal a judges order that a doctor abducted in the enrique 
camarena murder case be returned to mexico 
a motion was filed for a stay pending appeal in the case of dr 
humberto alvarez machain saying they believed the judge had 
committed several clear errors of law 
the brief also said us authorities would have virtually no 
chance of getting alvarez back into custody if he is repatriated 
however us district judge edward rafeedie told prosecutors 
that the stay was unnecessary because they planned to file the 
appeal later in the day he also set an aug 24 bail hearing for 
alvarez 
a week ago rafeedie ruled that the us abducted alvarez in 
violation of an extradition treaty with mexico that the kidnapping 
was an offense to mexicos sovereignty and that his court lacked 
jurisdiction to try the physician 
alvarez was charged with violent crimes in aid of racketeering 
conspiracy kidnap and murder in the slaying of camarena a us 
drug enforcement administration agent who was killed in 1985 he is 
accused of administering drugs to keep camarena 31 alive while he 
was being tortured 
the doctor who faces a possible life prison term if convicted 
was spirited out of mexico in april and the mexican government 
strongly protested the action 
in hearings on the issue the dea acknowledged it had paid 
20000 in dea funds plus 6000 a week in expenses to people who 
brought alvarez to the united states to face charges

health secretary louis sullivan the 
only black in president bushs cabinet journeyed to bushs 
oceanfront home friday for talks aimed at averting a veto of a 
major civil rights bill 
sullivan and constance newman director of the office of 
personnel management met with bush white house chief of staff 
john sununu and counsel c boyden gray to discuss the job 
discrimination bill that passed the house and senate in the last 
month 
reporters were not allowed onto bushs walkers point compound 
to question sullivan or the other participants in the meeting 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated bushs threat 
to veto the legislation unless it is changed in a housesenate 
conference the bush administration has said the bill would force 
employers to resort to hiring quotas for minorities in order to 
avoid job discrimination suits 
sununu has spearheaded repeated efforts to negotiate a 
compromise with sen edward kennedy dmass and civil rights 
groups backing the democraticcrafted measure which would reverse 
a string of five supreme court rulings in 1989 that narrowed 
protection against job bias 
civil rights groups deny that the bill would force quotas and 
they have been unwilling to accept the white houses corrective 
language 
we are still hopeful that we can get some changes said 
fitzwater but he added theres no change in our veto threat 
while sullivan has not been involved in those negotiations 
fitzwater said that in addition to running a huge government 
department with major civil rights responsibilities sullivan is 
a black man and has very strong personal interests and concerns in 
this bill 
he called sullivan a leader in the civil rights movement for 
many years who feels very strongly about this issue and he simply 
wants to talk to the president about it 
newman is also one of bushs highest ranking black appointees 
in washington campbell gardett a spokesman for the department 
of health and human services said sullivan was searching for ways 
to get congress and the black community to work together to get 
legislation the president can sign 
gardett said sullivan shares bushs concern about quotas 
the house approved the bill 272154 on aug 3 and the senate 
passed the measure 6534 on july 18 both were less than the 
twothirds margin needed to override a veto 
congress has failed to override any of the 13 vetoes bush has

shields guns and spears rampaged through soweto and other black 
townships friday clashing in sporadic battles that have killed 183 
people in six days 
police in armored vehicles rolled over streets barricaded with 
boulders and burning cars they used tear gas to disperse shouting 
mobs and fired shotguns at combatants fleeing through narrow 
shantytown streets 
police said at least 31 people had been killed and 217 injured 
in two days of savage handtohand fighting in soweto south 
africas largest black township 
the fighting pits zulu supporters of the conservative inkatha 
movement against mostly xhosa members of the african national 
congress led by nelson mandela 
the anc accused the governments security forces of plotting to 
use the zulubased inkatha party to stir up tribal rivalry in the 
townships 
more than 5000 people have died in fighting between inkatha and 
anc supporters in the eastern natal province in the past five years 
their bloody conflict spread to the township of thokoza east of 
johannesburg on sunday and later to four more areas including 
soweto southwest of johannesburg 
groups of up to 100 armed men waved sticks knives bayonets and 
shields fashioned of trashcan lids as they marched most of the 
combatants were zulu migrant workers from the inkatha stronghold of 
natal or xhosa residents of soweto 
on friday afternoon hundreds of inkatha supporters moved out of 
their compounds and stood on the railway track with guns and 
sticks waiting for the trains to bring black commuters home from

gasolinebombing of homes and indiscriminate gang attacks on 
individuals a family of six including a 5monthold baby and 
three other children were badly burned when someone threw a 
firebomb into their shack in kagiso township north of soweto 
the anc said state security forces in collusion with inkatha 
were trying to spread a climate of fear and terror in towns 
that are anc strongholds 
they want to provoke a mass backlash among blacks and whites 
in support of tough repressive measures by the government in order 
to undermine the process towards peace the anc statement said 
the spreading unrest led to an unscheduled meeting thursday 
between president fw de klerk and mandela who have been holding 
discussions to clear the way for formal negotiations on ending 
white minority rule 
inkatha president mangosuthu buthelezi said anc supporters 
frequently insult denigrate and attack inkatha members on the 
trains in the buses and other places he said that had sparked 
the conflict 
buthelezi making his statement in ulundi in natal province 
said inkatha was committed to democracy and opposed to violence 
but he said until respect for one another is observed it will be 
difficult to obtain peace 
many zulus involved in the fighting said they would not accept 
mandela and the anc as a future government 
freelance photographer sabastian balic described one killing at 
a migrant workers hostel in soweto on friday 
when i arrived there was a crowd around outside the 
dormitory they were poking through the windows with these spikes

and ran outside he must have made 50 yards before he was brought 
down said balic 
then the crowd laid into him with axes i would say a blow

people were just stabbing and hitting him on the ground for three 
minutes

foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said friday 
the soviet union would send troops to the persian gulf if the 
united nations calls for a multinational military force to solve 
the persian gulf crisis 
shevardnadzes statement took the soviet union one step closer 
to agreement with the united states on an armed united front to 
halt iraqi aggression it could put american and soviet soldiers on 
the same side for the first time since world war ii 
meanwhile president mikhail s gorbachev accused former ally 
iraq of treachery in using sovietprovided weapons to seize 
kuwait he called for international cooperation to keep the 
conflict from becoming a fullscale military confrontation 
the soviet union was iraqs major weapons supplier for more than 
a decade providing it with modern jet fighters and licensing an 
entire factory for building its topoftheline t72 tank 
moscow halted arms shipments to iraq the day after the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and joined the united states in a call for 
a worldwide arms embargo however the kremlin refused to join a 
usled multinational military force against the iraqis 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said last 
week that if the united nations approved a military force then 
we would think about it and would take our own sovereign decision 
about what to do 
at this stage we do not consider the possibilty of 
participating in either the international force or naval 
blockade the spokesman said then 
on friday correspondents crowded around shevardnadze at a press 
conference to ask if soviet troops would be sent to the gulf 
yes if there is a decision by the security council 
shevardnadze said 
he would not say how the soviet union would vote on such a 
proposal in the un security council but he said if the soviet 
union votes for that decision it certainly will take part 
gorbachev told soviet military men in odessa on friday that 
iraqi use of soviet weapons to attack kuwait gave the soviet union 
a special responsibility to solve the crisis 
we have witnessed an act of treachery he said in remarks 
carried by the official news agency tass 
iraqs action was a violation of everything the world 
community now pins its hopes on as it seeks to put civilization on 
the tracks of peaceful development gorbachev said 
the use of force to redraw borders especially in order to 
annex a sovereign country threatens a perilous chain reaction 
endangering the whole world community said the soviet president 
shevardnadze said he was discussing the gulf crisis with 
secretary of state james a baker iii almost daily by telephone 
the soviet foreign minister laid heavy emphasis on ussoviet 
agreement to revive a un military staff committee under the 
jurisdiction of the security council american officials said 
earlier such a committee would coordinate the defense of the us 
british french and other warships in the gulf should they come 
under iraqi fire 
us officials also have said the soviet union suggested the 
warships carry a un flag 
when this staff committee is created the military should get 
together and determine what collective action is needed should 
force be used or not that should be determined at an expert level 
what measures and what actions are needed the foreign minister 
said 
in answer to a kuwaiti reporters question on whether the soviet 
union would concede to iraqs demand for closure of all embassies 
in kuwait shevardnadze said he wants to avoid such action

president hosni mubarak said friday 
there is still time to find a peaceful solution to the persian gulf 
conflict and appealed to his iraqi brothers to steer away from 
confrontation and bloodshed 
mubarak has spearheaded arab diplomatic efforts to defuse the 
crisis which began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
i made so many contacts to several mediators to find a 
peaceful solution the egyptian president told reporters i 
reached nothing 
but he said he would continue his efforts and hoped others would 
do the same 
i am calling our brothers in iraq to respond to the voice of 
peace to avoid confrontation and bloodshed which may take place in 
case of being obstinate said mubarak who spoke after a meeting 
on the crisis with three european community foreign ministers 
the egyptian leader mediated contacts between iraq and kuwait 
just before the invasion and gathered arab league nations for an 
emergency summit eight days after iraqs conquest of kuwait 
mubarak has been the target of saddams wrath for sending 
egyptian troops to join the multinational force deployed to defend 
saudi arabia from further iraqi aggression he was the first arab 
leader to send a contingent 
but mubarak said he hoped to avoid a military clash with iraq 
we must not reach the edge of the abyss war and its 
consequences are very bad so lets give a chance to whoever can 
mediate he said 
mubarak said libyan leader moammar gadhafi had sent him a 
message urging that foreign forces in the region come under a 
united nations umbrella he said he agreed a unheaded force 
would be better than separate forces 
mubarak said the egyptian force in saudi arabia would probably 
number no more than 2000 men and said it like moroccan and syrian 
contingents would come under saudi command 
but figures from military sources had placed the number of 
egyptian troops already deployed at about 4000 and another group 
is scheduled to leave next week 
the arab troops were deployed after arab league nations held 
their summit in cairo a week ago a dozen of the 20 members present 
voted to send troops 
mubarak was asked about us moves to monitor shipping in the 
gulf of aqaba and the red sea both adjacent to egypt which 
washington says is necessary to enforce the unapproved economic 
embargo against iraq 
i am with the international embargo he said it may put 
us in a position to avoid all confrontations 
the egyptian president said he hoped saddam would act more 
speedily to settle the kuwait conflict than he did in seeking peace 
with iran 
eight years of fighting between iraq and iran ended in 1988 
saddam announced a peace initiative this week and iraq on friday 
began pulling out of iranian territory it had seized and 
repatriating prisoners of war 
i hope with all my heart that we dont have to wait so 
many years for kuwait mubarak said

editors note us air power heading to the middle east is 
turning sections of the atlantic sky into crowded midair service 
stations national writer fred bayles was aboard an air force 
tanker to view the busy refueling operations off the east coast 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this usually lonely patch of air is 
suddenly buzzing with the hum of faraway crisis 
the ocean below is empty except for the shadows of clouds five 
miles above the sky is filled with planes echelons of thirsty 
dartshaped fighters chase matronly tanker planes loaded with fuel 
radio channels crackle with curt instructions 
the deployment of us military air power to the middle east has 
turned the skies off the east coast into busy service station 
stops where fighters hook up to transport planes for a fillup at 
530 mph 
theres considerably increased activity in tanking 
operations said lt col george peck a spokesman for the 
strategic air command which operates the air force tankers it 
is an integral part of this operation 
the increased activity was obvious from aboard a kc135 tanker 
based at the plattsburgh ny air force base which took part in a 
refueling operation thursday 
the tanker was one of 16 from plattsburgh griffiss air force 
base in new york and pease air force base in new hampshire that 
formed an air bridge across the empty ocean for a flight of 24 f4 
phantom fighters 
pairs of tankers called cells could be seen spread across the 
horizon each plane was followed by three fighters 
it was a big operation said the captain who piloted the 
tanker a military cousin of the old 707 airliner three cells 
were operating pretty close in the same area and we were hearing on 
the radio of other cells coming up it was a continuous operation 
the captain whose name was not disclosed for security reasons 
said it was an example of what the tankers can do 
thats what our job is we can get where we need to be unload 
the gas and let the bombers fighters and cargo airplanes go off 
and do their mission she said 
the increase in military air activity has had only slight impact 
on commercial air travel 
there have been minor delays in some traffic but not any big 
disruptions said jo ann sloane a spokeswoman for the federal 
aviation administration 
the tankers in thursdays mission traveled across new england to 
a point 190 miles east of cape cod where they rendezvoused with the 
days receivers a squadron of fighters taking off from seymour 
johnson air force base in north carolina 
the f4g phantoms based at george air force base outside los 
angeles were wild weasels specially equipped with electronics 
and armaments for the dangerous task of disrupting and destroying 
enemy radar and antiaircraft installations 
the gleaming white missiles under their wings highlighted the 
fact this was no practice mission 
inside the hot noisy tanker which flew its first mission 
before any of its crew was born an airman first class took her 
position in the tail of the plane lying on a platform to maneuver 
the 20foot refueling boom into a port just behind the fighters 
canopy 
she nursed the jet into place with brief directions over the 
radio and a series of red green and white directional signals 
flashing from the tankers belly 
with this many planes operating in the area you dont want to 
have a lot of chatter she explained 
she repeated the delicate maneuvers for more than an hour 
loading three fighters with 900 gallons of jp4 fuel then adding 
another 400 gallons to top off the fighters already emptying fuel 
tanks 
the process which covered another 560 miles to the east is 
known in air force slang as dragging them across the pond 
when the job was done the kc135 turned for home other 
tankers were waiting to escort the fighters the rest of the way 
across the ocean 
good journey said the boom operator as the fighters veered 
away their mission done there was little emotion over the 
prospect of where the fighters were headed 
we train to do this all the time said the boom operator 
but it makes it a little more urgent when its the real thing

a woman who was required to take a 
driving test because authorities thought she might be too fat to 
drive safely proved friday she can operate a car even though she 
weighs 367 pounds 
using a borrowed beatup dodge aspen that she had only driven 
once regina guy passed the test with more than 75 people watching 
from a distance 
a state motor vehicle hearing examiner ordered friday morning 
that she pass the test or forfeit her license 
thats it im legal guys guy said afterward 
but she remained angry that she had to prove that her weight 
doesnt stop her from being a safe driver 
fat people are human we deserve equal treatment said guy 
25 because of my size i should not be discriminated against 
the baltimore womans problems began july 13 when she was 
stopped because the lights were not working properly on another car 
she had borrowed from a friend 
the officer wrote on his report to the motor vehicle 
administration due to this persons obesity she was unable to 
sit behind the wheel of the car 
guy was sitting in the center of the seat and was using her left 
hand and left foot to drive the car the officer said 
i feel that this driver should have special equipment on her 
car the officer wrote 
guy denied she was sitting in the center of the seat or was 
driving abnormally 
how could i sit in the center i couldnt possible drive from 
the center she said 
friday guy sat behind the wheel of the normally equipped car 
she said she was unhappy that the officer was absent from the 
hearing friday morning i still would like a chance to face my 
accuser she said 
several members of the national association to advance fat 
acceptance showed up to support guy at the hearing among them 
peggy williams owner of the station wagon guy was driving when she 
was stopped 
its not fair its just not fair williams said why is 
she being singled out to take a test when she did nothing to 
indicate she was a bad driver 
guys lawyer christopher brown said it was a clear case of 
discrimination against fat people the only reason she was 
singled out was because of her weight he said 
williams said she can fit behind the wheel of her car even 
though she weighs 450 pounds almost 100 pounds more than guy 
its not a question of her not having enough room she has to 
pull the seat closer than i do to drive williams said

nasa scientists rejoiced at pretty 
damn good test photos from the magellan probe today but also 
grappled with communications difficulties as the spacecraft circled 
venus 
fifteen hours after the spacecraft lost contact with earth on 
thursday evening the signal was reestablished but the signal 
failed again at midday and was expected to continue to be a problem 
until scientists could send magellan new instructions on how to 
properly aim at earth officials said 
meanwhile project manager tony spear said the test pictures 
collected from the spacecrafts radar mapper before the problems 
developed had produced some raw images that looked pretty damn 
good he said nasa will release the first pictures on monday 
instead of waiting until september 
thursdays test returned far more pictures than expected 
including several socalled noodles or areas of the planet 
about 1000 miles long by 15 miles wide project scientist steve 
saunders said 
the pictures show lava flows and faults and fractures and 
cinder cones with craters in the top saunders said 
scientists at nasas jet propulsion laboratory were concerned 
when they did not hear from magellan as expected at 832 pm 
thursday but they stressed that the spacecraft is loaded with 
computer programs that automatically help it find earth if contact 
is lost 
originally scientists had expected that the outage would 
continue until this evening but late this morning as scientists 
were were conducting a news conference about the problem magellan 
manager steve wall rushed in with word that nasas deep space 
network station at goldstone calif had reestablished contact 
with the spacecraft and locked onto its signal 
it is magellan wall said the spacecraft looks healthy 
the second loss of contact a short time afterward was not 
entirely unexpected spear said scientists now expect the 
spacecraft to be in and out of touch until controllers can send it 
new instructions on how to properly aim at earth he said 
however the second signal loss blunted some of the sense of 
relief at hearing from magellan after the overnight silence 
wall said engineers had been out of contact with the spacecraft 
thursday night as it fixed on two stars a procedure magellan 
routinely performs to make sure it is pointed properly 
nasa should have heard from magellan at 832 pm pdt thursday 
when this star calibration was completed but we did not 
reestablish contact jpl spokesman jim doyle said 
the last previous radio contact with the craft had been at deep 
space network stations at goldstone and in australia 
the assumption is that after it made a star calibration it 
looked at the wrong star and then couldnt point back to earth 
accurately doyle said then the contact was lost 
project officials believe the spacecraft detected an unknown 
onboard problem and entered a protective safing mode in which 
it orients itself toward the sun so its solar array will continue 
to receive power and find a guide star said doyle 
from that position it was programmed to automatically start a 
routine of locating the sun then searching for earth wall said 
the problem with magellan comes in the wake of nasas troubles 
with the flawed hubble space telescope and with hydrogen fuel leaks 
that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet 
magellans formal mission to map the surface of venus is 
supposed to start aug 29 contact was lost after magellan started 
a twoday test meant to make sure the spaceships radar can make 
pictures of venus and to adjust the radar waves so the pictures are 
focused said lab official ed sherry 
venus the second planet from the sun is covered by thick 
clouds that prevent optical cameras from seeing its rugged 
landscape 
magellans 744 million mission will use radar to penetrate the 
clouds then collect the reflected waves to make the best maps and 
pictures yet of earths nearest planetary neighbor 
the spacecraft was launched from the shuttle atlantis 15 months 
ago and went into orbit around venus a week ago after a roundabout 
948millionmile journey 
at least 20 us and soviet spacecraft have visited venus 
including some that landed and photographed a small area of 
landscape magellan will yield a global map 
its radar was designed to distinguish surface features as small 
as two football fields a level of detail 10 times better than in 
pictures made by radar on two soviet spacecraft that were launched 
in 1983

if a city councilman has his way the town 
that calls itself maple city will prune back or uproot entirely 
a 90yearold law requiring property owners to plant trees 
the law passed in 1900 by the city council assesses residents 
500 fines if they dont plant trees in front of their houses but 
councilman tom stump says thats going out on a limb 
its not the citys business to demand that people plant trees 
on their property stump said at a recent meeting at the least 
the fine should be trimmed to 50 he said 
stump favors a separate ordinance that would recommend residents 
plant certain trees such as cottonwoods elms and gingkos the 
council will debate the proposal sept 4 
mayor mike puro supports the current law saying the trees that 
line the streets of this northern indiana city of 20000 improve 
the quality of life

consumer food prices are going up 5 percent to 
7 percent this year sharply more than had been predicted and 
perhaps slightly because of the mideast oil crunch the agriculture 
department said friday 
the new forecast compared with the 3 percent to 5 percent price 
hike the department has been predicting for 1990 since december 
doubledigit price gains in the first half of this year for 
fresh fruits pork eggs and dairy products along with 
uncertainties about future energy prices are mostly to blame 
for the upward revision said the departments economic research 
service 
however most of the years price increases probably took 
place in the first half the agency said gains in the second 
half are expected to be more modest 
but the report added that this assumes most of the evolving oil 
price shock will take until next year to spill over into the 
grocery store 
retail food prices rose an average of 58 percent in 1989 the 
sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 much of that gain was 
fallout from the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation 
one usda official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said 
that without the mideast crisis and rising energy costs the new 
food price estimate for 1990 would have been in the range of 5 
percent to 6 percent 
thus the official said an allowance of only one percentage 
point was made at the upper end of the estimate to allow for higher 
oil prices 
further the source said some department analysts had wanted to 
hold the new 1990 food price increase to less than what was 
decided most felt the oil pinch is not going to hit this year the 
source said 
in its official report the agency said rising oil prices will 
increase the cost of growing processing packaging and 
distributing food 
because of the rapidly changing situation its unclear how 
much and how fast the increases will ripple through food prices 
the report said 
while food transportation costs probably will rise in coming 
months rail costs are partly shielded from shortterm movements in 
fuel prices the report said railroads often hold significant 
inventories of diesel fuel and buy fuel under longterm contracts 
for river barges lower freight rates this summer were said to 
suggest competitive pressures will hold down rate increases 
this fall when the big crops of corn soybeans and other 
commodities head for market 
the report which is prepared with a team of analysts and 
reviewers within the usda agency said the general trade embargo 
will significantly cut food supplies going to iraq about 
onefourth its caloric food needs come from imports 
last year about onefourth of iraqs agricultural imports 
came from the united states the report said other major 
suppliers have been australia canada the ec european community 
and turkey 
the agency said iraqs agricultural import situation is being 
monitored and that implications for trade are being reevaluated 
on a continuous basis

gov l douglas wilder said friday he plans 
to cut 333 million in local aid to help balance the state budget 
and those reductions also will hurt school budgets 
although we tried to address the revenue shortfall without 
affecting aid to public education it was not possible to do so 
wilder said 
if our revenue situation improves i will seek to mitigate 
these funding reductions as the first order of business he told 
a meeting of the senate finance house finance and house 
appropriations committees 
wilders budget director karen washabau said other cuts the 
governor has proposed in state agency spending could cause 400 to 
1500 layoffs but she said those figures were tentative until the 
governor decides sept 14 what specific cuts he will order 
wilder elaborated on cuts he announced during a statewide 
televised address thursday night to deal with a projected 14 
billion shortfall in the states 26 billion 199092 budget which 
is biennial he said tax collections are expected to drop because 
of a slowing state economy 
wilder said he will also order 375 million in state agency 
cuts withdraw a 2 percent state employee raise set for december 
and use more than 300 million in lottery profits for operating 
expenses instead of building projects 
he also proposed cutting 11 million in state money for private 
museums and attractions and eliminating several minor agencies that 
are budgeted for about 5 million 
several legislators complained they were left out of the 
budgetcutting plans and still had little idea how wilders 
proposed cuts will affect services in their districts 
legislators and education officials also said they were worried 
that cuts in school aid could force localities to raise taxes 
state sen stanley c walker a former norfolk school board 
member said local school budgets are already tight 
the least setback can be meaningful and knock you down he 
said 
local governments are going to feel the pinch said madeline 
wade president of the virginia education association a teachers 
organization theyre going to have to make some tough 
decisions

the navy partially lifted the veil of secrecy 
friday from the a12 avenger stealth airplane being developed as 
its main bomber for the early 21st century 
the navy released an artists drawing of the plane which 
resembles a manta ray the two air intakes on the front underside 
of the aircraft look a bit like gills 
no details were provided on the exact dimensions and other 
features of the previously secret aircraft 
the avenger is the latest in a family of newgeneration aircraft 
with stealth radarevading technology the air force is building 
b2 stealth longrange bombers and f117a stealth fighterbombers 
using composite materials that limit radar reflections 
the avenger is still under development and has been the subject 
of growing controversy since the navy announced earlier this year 
that it was a year behind schedule 
both the defense department and the navy are investigating the 
delays which came to light after the department had completed a 
monthslong review of its main aircraft programs the problems 
reportedly involve the manufacture of stealth composite materials 
last april defense secretary dick cheney announced he was 
cutting the avenger purchase from 858 to 620 planes 
the navy has not released figures on the avengers full 
production cost but it has been reported that it could reach 55 
billion the plane currently is in the fullscale development phase 
under a 478 billion navy contract held jointly by mcdonnell 
douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
the bush administration requested 11 billion in production 
funds for the avenger for the 1991 budget year starting oct 1 but 
both the house and senate have eliminated all production funds for 
the coming year leaving only a smaller amount for research and 
development 
the avenger is designed to replace the a6e intruder which has 
been the navys main attack aircraft for 27 years 
the avenger is designed to penetrate sophisticated missiles 
defenses to deliver bombs with exceptional accuracy against fixed 
and mobile targets on land and sea its automated electronic 
cockpit includes a missile warning system for early identification 
of enemy radars and guided missiles 
the plane is named after the world war ii avenger that was the 
first attack aircraft with radar

iraqs effort to settle its war with 
neighboring iran appears aimed at securing the use of an iranian 
pipeline to punch a hole in the usenforced un embargo on 
its oil exports the chairman of the house armed services committee 
said friday 
theres something very strange about this deal said 
rep les aspin dwis it is essentially a total capitulation by 
iraq theres a possibility were going to see iran exporting iraqi 
oil 
a united nations security council resolution prohibiting trade 
with iraq over its conquest of kuwait has stopped the flow of 
nearly 45 million barrels of oil daily from the two countries 
sending world oil prices up by more than 7 a barrel 
iraqi president saddam hussein offered wednesday to withdraw all 
troops from iranian territory and give up control of the 
shattalarab waterway along the countries border aspin said he 
is skeptical that the real reason saddam made the offer was to 
free iraqi troops to face a us military buildup in saudi arabia 
that deal has to go down very hard with his military aspin 
said of saddam they just spent eight years fighting a war there 
were looking at some other deal here im concerned hes going to 
try to use it to punch a hole in the sanctions and embargo 
one of iraqs major pipelines runs along the shattalarab and 
at one point it is just five miles and across the waterway from 
iranian pipelines leading into and out of its refinery at abadan 
although the abadan refinery was blown up in the iraniraq war 
iran still moves much of its 3 million barrels of oil a day through 
the pipeline to its main export terminal at kharg island 
it would only take a matter of weeks to bridge the two 
pipelines aspin said he estimated that iraq could then move as 
much as 1 million barrels a day or roughly more than onethird of 
its preembargo oil exports through the pipeline to kharg island 
the secret of the potential success of the embargo and the 
sanctions is the oil aspin said there might still be food and 
other things coming in from jordan or iran but its going to be 
limited unless you have the money to pay for them

police and police reserves took up 
position friday in knin to prevent flareups between croats and 
serbs agitating for automony within croatia the state tanjug news 
agency reported 
earlier army jets intercepted three helicopters of the croatian 
interior ministry and forced them to return to base tanjug 
reported the ministry is in charge of police 
the army is dominated by serbs traditional rivals of croatians 
but gen bozidar adzic chief of state of the federal armed forces 
played down the encounter telling croatian tv the jets scrambled 
only because the helicopters strayed from proper flight corridors 
traditional rivalry between the two ethnic groups was aggravated 
by the croatian governments decision to bar a referendum of serbs 
in the republic on serbian autonomy within croatia 
the serb minority of 400000 in western croatia had been 
scheduled to start two weeks of voting sunday on the issue 
serbia and croatia have been rivals since they were united 
within yugoslavia in 1918 as two of the nations six republics 
in knin a town of about 10000 with a large serb population 
police with rifles stood guard around strategic buildings said 
witnesses contacted by telephone 
in obrovac and benkovac large crowds of citizens are in the 
streets hindering and stopping traffic tanjug said friday 
citing a statement by the croatian interior ministry 
tanjug said hundreds of serbs broke into a police station in the 
town of grachc 
authorities in croatia had anticipated trouble on thursday 
they ordered the disarming of the army reserve in benkovac which 
is dominated by serbs 
croatian authorities attacked the plebiscite saying it was 
aimed at undermining democratic reforms in croatia 
croatias interior minister iosip bojkovac said the 
situation is very tense and has been artificially inflamed by the 
communist government and news media in neighboring serbia the 
nations largest republic 
the serbs in croatia are strongly supported by the staterun 
media in serbia where the communist party has balked at holding 
westernstyle elections and has described the government in croatia 
as fascist and racist 
the centerright croatian democratic union political party this 
year overwhelmingly won the first free elections in croatia in more 
than 50 years 
tanjug contradicted earlier reports friday that federal army 
units moved into knin in a poor farming region after mayor milan 
babic declared a state of war it said no soldiers were in the 
streets 
serbs say hundreds of thousands of their compatriots were 
murdered in croatia during world war ii by a nazitype unit of 
croatian nationalists 
serbs in croatia claim they are being systematically 
discriminated against by those they describe as extremists in the 
cdu 
croatias new government advocates turning the yugoslav 
federation into a loose association of semiindependent states in 
which national minorities would be guaranteed full political and 
national rights 
if croatia is going to opt for confederal status within 
yugoslavia the serb minority will demand full political 
selfgovernment jovan raskovic head of the serbian minority 
said in an interview 
about 5000 serbs gathered in nova pazova a serbian town north 
of belgrade late friday in noisy support of their brethren in 
croatia about 1000 serbs attended a similar rally in belgrade 
hours later 
no incidents were reported

saudi arabian prince turki bin abdul 
aziz a brother of king fahd said friday a boycott against iraq 
will not work and that swift action is necessary to drive saddam 
hussein out of kuwait 
i believe that this embargo this boycott is not going to be 
useful because you know there are many merchants of war who make 
their living by contributing to the escalation of war among 
nations turki said through an interpreter 
the prince said the best course would be for an international 
force to take swift military action to end husseins rule 
i think if they want to put a quick end to it the united 
states knows how to do that prince turki said i am not 
talking about eliminating him physically or assassination but they 
should put an end to his rule to his regime because he is a 
bloodthirsty person and thats his trade he lives off blood 
the prince 53 made his remarks at a news conference in a 
lavishly decorated hotel ballroom near harvard square where he and 
his entourage have been staying for the past two weeks turki said 
he came to cambridge to talk with harvard university about ways he 
could help enhance the schools educational programs in medicine 
and human rights 
the prince one of the kings seven full brothers said he did 
not have a clear idea how many arab troops have joined american 
forces in the region 
but his political adviser mustafa aziz had said in an 
interview before the prince arrived at the conference that he 
understood about 5000 arab troops were there mostly egyptians but 
also syrians and moroccans 
in an exchange that required several attempts at clarification 
the prince said that if saddam hussein had been at all concerned 
about vengeance he should have moved on the west bank nine years 
ago when israel bombed an iraqi nuclear plant 
his translator zaki aslan said the prince was not calling for 
an assault on israel just pointing out a lack of logic in saddam 
husseins rationale for moving on kuwait because the two countries 
were once part of the same empire 
prince turki said saddam hussein is a sadist and a psychotic 
he enjoys killing people he called him a liar for several 
reasons including his overture to iran after the deaths of 
thousands of iranians in the eightyear iraniraq war 
the prince former deputy minister of defense also said he was 
disappointed in king hussein of jordan who met with president bush 
thursday 
i was hoping that king hussein would not go down and lower 
himself to come to the united states as an emissary of saddam 
hussein he said i thought he would honor himself further if 
he hadnt done so 
king hussein originally was believed to be carrying a message 
from saddam hussein but he said after his meeting with bush that 
he had brought no such message 
the prince was joined at the news conference friday by his wife 
princess hend a son and a daughter they sat with dozens of 
reporters at a breakfast press conference held in a ballroom 
decorated with elaborate flower arrangements 
the princess who speaks english and who studied in the united 
states for a year broke in pointedly two times during the news 
conference to demand what she thought were necessary clarifications 
of the translation 
princess hend also talked briefly with reporters although she 
declined to discuss political questions the princess said several 
times that the people in her country were shocked by the invasion 
of kuwait 
friends are worried she said theyre in shock they are 
in a state of standby

disruptive children can cause parents 
to drink more a florida state university study released friday 
shows 
im not suggesting we blame children for the alcoholism of 
their parents because those who grow up in alcoholic homes have 
suffered enough already said dr alan lang an associate 
professor of psychology at florida state nonetheless 
particularly difficult children can cause distress for parents and 
in some cases this may contribute to increased alcohol use 
contrary to the teachings of selfhelp groups who place the 
onus on parents and tell children of alcoholics they arent to 
blame the florida state study may provide the first documented 
evidence that children actually can cause their parents to drink 
more 
lang teamed with dr william pelham of the university of 
pittsburgh to conduct the research 
our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in 
parentchild interactions is a twoway street lang said 
problem drinkers make poor parents but problem children may also 
drive parents to drink 
he said the findings are similar to those of studies that show 
children who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral 
problems are abused more often than normal obedient children 
the point is that while we usually think of parents as 
influencers of children children can affect parents as well 
lang said and the outcome is not always favorable 
dr robin room scientific director of the alchohol research 
group of the medical research institute of san francisco wasnt 
surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into 
the cause of drinking among parents rather than give in to the 
bumper stickertype humor that says children cause their parents to 
drink 
its important to understand that parental drinking patterns 
can later influence their childrens drinking patterns room said 
the florida researchers under a grant from the national 
institute of alcohol abuse and alcoholism asked 120 parents with 
5to12yearold sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a 
similar age 
the parents were then given an opportunity to drink as much or 
as little alcohol as they wanted while anticipating a second 
interaction with the same child 
half of the parents in the study had difficult children of their 
own with short attention spans hyperactivity conduct disorders 
or some combination of the three the other half had only children 
without behavior disorders 
but the researchers stacked the deck half the parents had 
initially interacted with boys who behaved normally while half had 
faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive 
and disruptive way 
among parents of normal children those who interacted with 
disruptive boys drank onethird more than those who interacted with 
a cooperative child 
i feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate 
that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the 
characteristics and behaviors of children lang said 
parents with disruptive children at home responded differently 
to the study however depending on the drinking patterns of their 
own parents those who had a family history of drinking problems 
drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant childactor 
while those with no such family history drank less 
this suggests that people differ in their vulnerability to 
increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a 
difficult child lang said

swift criticism friday did not keep 
education secretary lauro cavazos from repeating his assertion that 
students who dont speak english are not ready for public education 
parental involvement and language competency are basic 
cavazos told about 1500 teachers and principals in this city on 
the mexican border if that child cannot speak english the first 
day of school that child is not ready to learn 
in a panel discussion later south texas superintendents 
criticized cavazos saying students were capable of learning in 
other languages 
the comment that we heard this morning that students who are 
not speaking english are not ready to learn is a disabling 
comment said robert zamora superintendent of the la joya school 
district 
later friday during a news conference across the border in 
nuevo laredo cavazos repeated the comment and added we work 
with the parents with the schools to prepare the youngsters in 
english so they will learn my final point that i always make is 
that they not forget that other language and that culture 
cavazos former president of texas tech university said he 
supports bilingual education but that its goal should be 
encouraging students to speak english so they do not miss 
opportunities in the united states 
it was not the first time cavazos drew criticism from fellow 
hispanics for his comments on hispanic education in april the 
league of united latin american citizens criticized him for blaming 
hispanic parents for the high dropout rate among their children 
in march he angered some hispanic lawmakers when he told the 
state legislature that money was not the answer to education 
problems 
cavazos repeated that stance friday saying that education could 
be improved by giving teachers more freedom and allowing local 
schools more control 
the new bottom line in education is not how much do we need to 
spend by how much are our students learning cavazos said 
he stressed that he was referring to public schools across the 
nation not just in texas and acknowledged there have been some 
inequities in school finance in the state 
in nuevo laredo cavazos and mexican education secretary manuel 
bartlett diaz signed an agreement calling for closer educational 
ties between the two countries the agreement paves the way for a 
border conference on education next winter

ambassadors of the five permanent members 
of the security council held an unprecedented joint meeting with 
senior military aides friday to discuss an expanded un military 
role in the persian gulf crisis 
the purpose of this gathering was to exchange information on 
the naval activities in the gulf and in the area french 
ambassador pierre louis blanc told reporters after the meeting at 
the french mission 
the session was attended by un envoys of the united states 
britain china france and the soviet union and by military 
advisers of the five governments together known as the security 
councils military staff committee 
the committee was created 44 years ago when the united nations 
was new but has been inactive meeting on a perfunctory basis two 
times a month 
diplomats emphasized that friday was no ordinary meeting it 
included senior us british and french officers a senior soviet 
official was unable to attend and the level of the chinese military 
was not known 
blanc said consultations were informal and further meetings 
could follow if the need arises 
no immediate indication surfaced that the five were moving to 
form a joint un military command in the gulf or to fly the un 
flag but western observers said the five had moved with 
extraordinary speed to discuss coordination for the first time and 
reactivate a un military role 
we wont have a un army tomorrow one said but we could 
have exchange of information and coordination letting each other 
know about rules of engagement and that is quite significant 
by un standards that is whirlwind progress 
the observers spoke on condition of anonymity 
under the un charter the military staff committee is charged 
with coordinating all un military actions of an enforcement 
nature excluding peacekeeping 
it is intended to organize and command joint military 
operations which never have come into existence the last time the 
un flag was flown in a un enforcement operation was during the 
195053 korean war 
that war was not strictly a un operation however and was 
handed over to the united states 
moscow has been pressing for an expanded un peacekeeping role 
and for revival of the un military staff committee foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze said friday the soviet union would 
send troops to the gulf if the united nations calls for a 
multilateral military force 
the soviet union has said it would not participate except under 
a un flag 
the united states britain france and the soviet union are 
especially interested in some kind of coordination but china is 
wary diplomats said 
they said beijing wants to see what action the arab states take 
in the crisis before committing itself to outside military action 
the five permanent members began meeting on the military 
question on tuesday in washington and met again thursday in new 
york

a top iraqi official said friday that 
baghdad will keep all foreigners from aggressive nations until 
the threat of war against iraq is lifted 
about 3000 us citizens are being held in iraq most of them 
taken from occupied kuwait following the aug 2 invasion by iraqi 
forces as well as at least 4000 british citizens 
the statement carried by the official iraqi news agency was 
monitored by the british broadcasting corp in nicosia 
the people of iraq have decided to play host to the citizens 
of these aggressive nations as long as iraq remains threatened with 
an aggressive war said iraqis parliament speaker sadi mahdi 
iraqs invasion prompted an international embargo on goods in 
and out of iraq tens of thousands of us and foreign forces have 
massed in the area mostly in saudi arabia to oppose further iraqi 
military action 
this measure will remain in force until such time as tangible 
and sufficient guarantees are forthcoming fro the people of iraq 
that the danger of oppressive aggression has passed madhi said 
he singled out the us government among all western governments 
for what he called going out of their way to take hostile and 
unjust stands toward iraq 
he said these governments had lied repeatedly about the issue 
which he referred to as precautionary measures taken to keep the 
nationals of these countries in iraq 
baghdad holds an estimated 14000 westerners apart from 2500 
americans and 4000 britons trapped in kuwait during the invasion 
about 500 other americans were in iraq at the time of the invasion 
the decision announced by the parliament speaker came after a 
meeting of the revolutionary command council chaired by president 
saddam hussein this week the government had said foreigners in 
iraq and occupied kuwait were considered restrictees 
saddam on thursday called president bush a liar for sending 
troops to the region and acting in a warlike manner 
ina carried a separate brief dispatch saying only that the 
council met to discuss iraqs peace moves toward iran which 
included the start of releasing prisoners of war during the 198088 
iraniraq conflict and troop withdrawels from the border friday 
the council controls the ruling arab baath socialist party 
which handpicks most of the members of iraqs parliament

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
has asked the national assembly to pardon five men accused of 
assassinating her husband the opposition sandinista party 
newspaper barricada said friday 
the victim pedro joaquin chamorro was a prominent and highly 
respected newspaper publisher whose death in january 1978 helped 
ignite the revolution that overthrew the rightwing dictatorship of 
anastasio somoza in 1979 
sandinistas now mrs chamorros political foes have praised 
her husband as a martyr for public freedoms 
barricada said the president sent a letter to the speaker of the 
national legislature asking the pardon but officials contacted by 
the associated press neither confirmed nor denied the report 
mrs chamorro said in june she would seek such a pardon 
barricada said a government source gave it a copy of her letter 
and quoted it as saying as the offended party i have 
demonstrated to the national assembly my feelings to forgive and 
forget toward those who were the material authors of the 
assassination and other related crimes 
therefore i ask the pardon within the spirit of 
reconciliation which motivates me 
no one answered repeated telephone calls to the presidency 
after chamorros assassination the somozaera police arrested 
men described as hired gunmen silvio pena domingo acevedo silvio 
vega harold cedeno and juan ramon acevedo all remain in prison 
but were never formally convicted 
according to barricada mrs chamorro asked that they be 
pardoned along with 82 other common criminals 
after the sandinistas took power in 1979 the chamorro family 
brought a court case accusing anastasio somoza portocarrero a son 
of the dictator along with somoza official fausto zelaya and cuban 
exile pedro ramos of being authors of the plot to kill chamorro 
the newspaper said mrs chamorros petition did not say whether 
those men should be included in the pardon all fled into exile 
after somoza fell 
her husband publisher of la prensa and long a vocal critic of 
the somoza dictatorship was ambushed and shot on a managua street 
for decades la prensa was nicaraguas only opposition 
newspaper his death touched off violent demonstrations and rallied 
the nicaraguan opposition to back the sandinista revolution 
the leftist sandinistas governed the country until april 25 
when mrs chamorro took office after winning february elections in 
a landslide

a marine opposed to interventionist us 
foreign policy sought conscientious objector status friday and was 
transferred to a unit that wont be deployed to the persian gulf 
for operation desert shield his lawyer said 
cpl jeffrey paterson stationed at kaneohe marine corps air 
station on the island of oahu said he would not fight to protect 
oil prices and opposed interventionist policies in the mideast 
paterson 22 of hollister calif is reportedly the second 
kaneohe marine to seek conscientious objector status 
eric a seitz patersons attorney said the soldiers 
application was accepted for processing friday but that a decision 
could take some time 
paterson who had worked as a supply clerk and in field 
artillery was transferred to a nondeployable unit seitz said 
however capt leonard ryan public affairs officer at the base 
would not confirm that paterson had changed units ryan said 
paterson had been charged with unauthorized leave for being away 
from his unit thursday but no other charges were planned 
a marine corps spokeswoman in washington said officials there 
were unaware of the case and would not comment 
paterson said he had been tentatively scheduled to leave for the 
middle east on sunday base spokesmen would not discuss planned 
deployments 
i cant fight for the military at all anymore he said if 
i was going to el salvador id do the same thing 
paterson who has seven months left in the marines said he 
belongs to la casa a group that objects to us 
interventionist policies 
there are very few people who want to go to saudi arabia and 
fight for the price of oil he said all wars are in the 
objectives of leaders and corporations and not the people 
paterson said he joined the marines in 1986 but two years later 
joined organizations opposed to us policy in central and south 
america and the middle east 
he said he hoped the media attention about his case would make 
the marines want to get rid of me as soon as possible 
seitz said the soldier told him marine officials were 
considering charging him with a number of violations under the 
uniform code of military justice 
among the possible charges were unauthorized leave releasing 
classified information and inciting others to resist orders seitz 
said but ryan said no further charges were planned because 
paterson returned to his unit friday 
christopher marler another marine stationed at the base filed 
a lawsuit aug 10 seeking a court order to prevent his deployment 
to the middle east marler had filed for conscientious objector 
status in april citing his protestant religious beliefs 
the government said it agreed not to send marler into combat 
because his application was filed months ago marler was 
unavailable for comment friday

the countrys wetlands are so diverse that 
a national policy to save them should be managed by the states a 
federal task force was told friday 
the domestic policy councils wetlands task force held the first 
of six public hearings around the country to discuss how to meet 
president bushs no net loss goal meetings will also be held 
in illinois louisiana washington state alaska and rhode island 
i think there are many areas where this country has to have a 
uniform policy but not in this kind of area where you have so much 
diversity and so much local color and so many local 
ramifications said north dakota gov george sinner 
environmentalists say development mainly agriculture has 
claimed about 55 percent of the nations wetlands in addition to 
providing a home for wildlife the countrys remaining 99 million 
acres of wetlands help control erosion and recharge groundwater 
last year bush pledged to create a federal policy requiring 
that any wetlands developed equal the number of acres reclaimed 
in 1987 north dakota passed the countrys first nonetloss 
wetlands law which established a land bank to replace swamps and 
marshes acreforacre 
david sprynczynatyk engineer for the state water commission 
said north dakota has added 632 acres of wetlands since the law 
took effect it has about 2 million acres of wetlands the most in 
the contiguous united states 
i just cant see how the policy can work with a myriad of 
federal agencies coming in with new regulations sometimes 
overlapping sometimes conflicting said sinner 
officials from other western states agreed 
state boundaries are too artificial they dont respect the 
boundaries of wetlands or drainage basins said robert hall of 
the denver water department give the state or states the 
flexibility to do that to meet an overall goal but let us do the 
balancing 
western farmers said they should be able to help decide which 
land should be protected 
the bitter hostility caused by the total disregard of the 
landowners wishes and constitutional rights has resulted in a 
wetlands war in which wildlife has been caught in the crossfire 
and nobody wins said wes tossett cochairman of the north 
dakota agriculture coalition 
environmentalists at the meeting said a national policy even 
if managed by the states should take effect right away wayne 
baron of the national wildlife federation estimated 600000 acres 
of wetlands have been lost nationwide since president bush 
announced the no net loss goal 
quite frankly were waiting for the action he said

the pentagon said 
this is the first use of the civil reserve air fleet since the 
program was conceived in the 1950s under the program airlines 
prepare and commit specific aircraft that can be used to carry 
troops and military cargo in times of crisis the airlines are 
reimbursed 
the program includes 29 airlines but in this first initial stage 
of the program only 16 carriers are involved the statement said 
it did not identify the airlines involved 
johnsons action activates the lowest stage of the program 
the program is designed with three stages so the airlift command 
can tailor the airlift force needed for any contingency the 
pentagon statement said 
the initial stage calls for the civilian airlines that are part 
of the program to provide planes within 24 hours of the request 
the planes will be used to augment the military airlift 
commands routine overseas missions as well as for operations in 
the middle east the statement said 
pentagon spokesman pete williams asked why the pentagon was 
forced to make the move said gen johnson needs more planes 
military commanders at the pentagon had begun to complain that 
they werent capable of moving enough of their troops quickly 
because of transportation shortages even though the troops were 
fully ready to go to saudi arabia

when bush announced the us military operation in the gulf aug 
8 he said it was purely defensive and aimed at protecting 
americas vital interest in the saudi oil fields which provide 15 
percent of us oil imports 
bush said his ultimate goal was to get the iraqis out of kuwait 
and restore the kuwaiti royal family to power but he has not ruled 
out the use of us force to try to dislodge the iraqi army from 
kuwait 
iraqs statement that it intended to hold onto citizens of 
aggressive nations also could change the american game plan 
when us troops invaded panama in december bush cited among 
other things reports that panamanian troops were harassing 
americans 
defense secretary dick cheney who helped persuade saudi arabia 
to accept a usled force on its soil was bound for riyadh on 
friday to visit us troops standing guard in the saudi desert 
against a possible thrust by iraq 
saddam massed tens of thousands of troops on kuwaits southern 
border after invading the emirate prompting fears that he intended 
to invade saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter 
in addition to the thousands of american soldiers now in saudi 
arabia pentagon sources say the marines are building to a force of 
45000 to counter an iraqi army now believed to have grown to 
160000 in kuwait us military planners also are preparing to put 
250000 soldiers on the ground if necessary 
for many of the us soldiers the intense heat of the saudi 
desert is difficult to cope with the guys sure would like a cold 
one an air force captain said thursday from the sundrenched 
tarmac of a saudi air base 
tell the folks back home to send in the budweiser plane an 
army tank gunner said 
in addition to the us soldiers flooding the region american 
naval and air force firepower is growing beyond the strictly 
defensive role that bush described when he offered to protect saudi 
arabia 
the clearest sign of a shift toward offensive capabilities was 
the departure thursday from langley air force base va of f117a 
stealth fighter bombers the stealths are designed to penetrate 
heavily defended areas to attack vital targets 
in iraq they could hit supply depots or key oil facilities 
military sources in washington say plans called for sending 22 
of the radarevading fighter bombers to the persian gulf area 
an armada of marine corps amphibious assault ships also is 
heading for the region the seaborne assault units equipped with 
amphibious tracked vehicles that can travel on land at speeds of up 
to 50 mph 
the air force says b52 bombers which conducted massive bombing 
raids in the vietnam war also have been sent overseas since the 
gulf crisis started

the fbi investigated allegations that the son 
of us attorney general dick thornburgh used marijuana and cocaine 
as recently as 1988 but the justice department said friday the 
allegations were unsubstantiated 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said the fbi 
investigation was closed earlier this week after two friends of 
william thornburgh were questioned about allegations that they had 
seen him use drugs 
both people who were interviewed said they never used cocaine 
with bill thornburgh thats from the fbi reports eramian said 
in an unusual public statement about the status of an 
investigation he added that the probe also found no evidence of 
marijuana use 
referring to the allegations eramian said appropriate 
inquiry found them to be unsubstantiated bill thornburgh is not 
the subject of an investigation the matter is closed 
eramian also criticized former state auditor general don bailey 
who first made the allegations and accused him of having a 
political motivation stemming from disagreements when dick 
thornburgh was pennsylvanias governor he said bailey was not 
interviewed by the fbi 
sources familiar with the case said investigators interviewed 
the two friends one time each during the last week 
eramian said the two men were apparently the only people 
interviewed by the fbi after the case was referred to the 
harrisburg office by the justice departments criminal division 
the investigation grew out of a 15monthlong drug probe that 
has resulted in guilty pleas to cocaine charges by two former 
deputy state attorneys general and the indictment on four 
cocainerelated charges of henry barr a former top aide to 
thornburgh in harrisburg and at the us justice department 
the allegations against the younger thornburgh were first made 
by former pennsylvania auditor general don bailey in a july 17 
letter to us sen arlen specter rpa 
in his letter bailey identified the two men who allegedly used 
drugs with thornburgh and asked that a special prosecutor be 
appointed to study the entire drug investigation specter made the 
request for an independent prosecutor but earlier this week the 
justice department rejected it 
the allegations in baileys letter include cocaine use during a 
harrisburg party in december 1988 at the time william thornburgh 
was in the navy and his father was president reagans attorney 
general 
thornburgh has continued serving as attorney general for 
president bush and has been a hardliner in the war against drugs 
william thornburgh still in the navy could not be reached 
friday 
eramian said attorney general thornburgh was not aware of the 
inquiry because he recused himself from the case when barr first 
surfaced as a target earlier this year 
he said the probe of baileys allegations was thorough he added 
it was not unusual to close an investigation after only one week 
and two interviews that found no evidence of wrongdoing he also 
lashed out at bailey for making the allegations 
for a number of years mr bailey has engaged in personal 
vicious reckless and unfounded allegations against a number of 
persons with whom he has been at odds on a personal and political 
basis including former governor thornburgh eramian said 
but to spread a reckless story about a persons child is beyond 
all bounds of decency 
in a related matter eramian said fbi agents questioned dick 
thornburgh about barr last week other justice department officials 
who were also questioned said agents asked about barrs work at the 
department and whether there were any signs of drug use 
gordon zubrod the federal prosecutor heading the drug 
investigation said he could not comment on any of the developments

a federal judge friday threw out a major portion of 
the claims by former contra supply courier eugene hasenfus and said 
he may consider additional changes before the case goes to the jury 
the decision by us district judge c clyde atkins leaves only 
certain financial claims in the case 
atkins said he may consider additional directed verdict motions 
by lawyers for defendants southern air transport and irancontra 
figure richard secord the jury is expected to begin deliberations 
monday 
atkins ruled that jurors cannot consider damages for mental 
stress suffered by hasenfus or his wife sally he also removed 
claims of negligence and misrepresentation by hasenfus and the 
family of the late wallace sawyer jr 
atkins threw out punitive damage claims by hasenfus and sawyer 
but said he could consider whether to reinstate the claim by mrs 
hasenfus 
hasenfus and sawyer were aboard a cargo plane shot down over 
nicaragua in october 1986 while on a covert flight to supply contra 
rebels hasenfus of marinette wis was the only survivor and was 
jailed by nicaraguan authorities 
the judge let stand claims by hasenfus for back salary as well 
as the issue of whether sawyers family should receive death 
benefits 
also remaining in the case is the question of whether the 
defendants should pay for mrs hasenfus legal expenses to free her 
husband in nicaragua and reimburse her for travel expenses 
but thomas spencer an attorney for secord said he was 
confident a jury would find there was not an official employee 
contract with hasenfus or sawyer of magnolia ark 
there was never any proof they were the employers he said 
our position is that the employer is ronald reagan 
secord who helped former national security council aide oliver 
north organize the contra supply network pleaded guilty to lying 
to congress for his part in the irancontra affair and is serving 
two years probation

nasa engineers successfully capped a 
daylong battle to stay in touch with magellan on friday after the 
balky spacecrafts first pictures of venus showed old lava flows 
cinder cones and faults created by venusquakes 
after repeatedly losing and regaining contact with magellan 
engineers sent a computer command to the spaceship friday night 
that restored regular communications at 711 pm pdt said tommy 
thompson magellan science manager at the agencys jet propulsion 
laboratory 
we jumped up and clapped he said it was just like the 
home team scoring a touchdown 
thompson said engineers expected to remain in touch with 
magellan except when it flys behind venus when it normally is 
unable to send or receive radio signals from earth 
an unknown problem made magellan lose its radio link with earth 
on thursday night as it orbited venus 147 million miles from earth 
almost 15 hours later as engineers held a news conference 
magellan official steve wall rushed into the room to announce 
contact had been reestablished 
but as the hours passed nasa tracking stations in california 
australia and spain lost and regained magellans radio signal 
because of builtin safety programs in the spacecrafts computers 
when magellan first dropped out of contact sophisticated 
computer programs put it in a protective safing mode so that 
its solar panels pointed to the sun to draw power hours later the 
safety system made the spacecraft rotate until its antenna located 
earth and resumed communications jpl spokesman jim doyle said 
the spacecraft was programmed to keep rotating which explained 
why controllers kept losing and regaining contact doyle said 
the command sent to magellan on friday night stopped the 
spacecraft from rotating and kept its secondary antenna in 
continuous communication with earth except when the spacecraft is 
behind venus thompson said 
thompson said magellan will be kept in its protective mode until 
the cause of the initial loss of contact is understood and fixed 
magellan project manager tony spear was optimistic the problem 
wouldnt seriously affect magellans 744 million mission to use 
radar to make the best pictures and maps yet of venus 
cloudcovered landscape 
i have faith in the spacecraft he said admitting he was 
surprised by the trouble 
the communications problem developed shortly after magellan 
bounced radar waves off venus for its first test pictures of 
earths nearest planetary neighbor the information used to make 
the pictures was sent to earth before contact was lost 
weve got some raw images that look pretty damn good spear 
said adding the pictures would be released early next week despite 
nasas initial plans to wait until september 
project scientist steve saunders who examined the pictures 
said they show old hardened lava flows and faults and fractures 
and volcanic cinder cones with craters on top 
the kind of faulting we see would certainly mean there are 
venusquakes saunders said 
earlier soviet and us spacecraft also revealed volcanic 
features on venus although magellans images are supposed to be 10 
times more detailed 
magellan wont be able to learn if any venusian volcanoes are 
active for at least eight months thats because it must pass over 
the same area of venus twice before it can determine if the 
landscape has been altered by an eruption 
saunders said thursdays radar test returned far more pictures 
than expected covering several areas of the planet about 1000 
miles long by 15 miles wide during normal mapping which had been 
scheduled to start aug 29 magellan will make pictures of 
noodleshaped swaths of venusian landscape about 10000 miles long 
by 15 or 16 miles wide those will be assembled into bigger 
pictures 
magellans headaches were the latest for the national 
aeronautics and space administration which recently grounded its 
shuttle fleet temporarily because of hydrogen leaks and had its 
hubble space telescope seriously impaired by a focusing flaw in a 
mirror 
magellan was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 
and went into orbit around venus on aug 10 after a roundabout 948 
millionmile journey 
wall said engineers were out of contact with magellan on 
thursday night as it turned away from earth to get a fix on two 
stars a calibration the spaceship routinely performs to make sure 
it can point properly 
magellans radio signals are tracked by 230footwide dish 
antennas at goldstone calif and in australia and spain 
the assumption is that after it made a star calibration it 
looked at the wrong star and then couldnt point back to earth 
accurately said doyle then the contact was lost 
engineers believe magellan detected some onboard problem then 
went into its protective mode spear said the spaceship probably 
tried to get a fix on a guide star so it could figure out which 
way it was pointing but may have picked the wrong star or been 
confused by stray sunlight reflecting off venus 
most of us have been up most of the night dealing with the 
problem spear said friday 
venus is covered by thick clouds that prevent optical cameras 
from viewing its landscape magellan radar is designed to send 
radar waves through the clouds then collect the reflected radar 
echoes and send them to earth in digital form computers at jpl 
then can assemble them into maps and pictures 
the spacecrafts radar was designed to distinguish surface 
features as small as two football fields

president bush has decided to call 
up military reserves to meet shortages of doctors cargo handlers 
and other specialists in the persian gulf crisis officials said 
friday 
in the tense gulf navy commanders operating under new orders to 
intercept ships carrying goods to or from iraq stopped two iraqi 
vessels off the coast of bahrain the pentagon reported the ships 
were allowed to proceed after us forces determined they carried 
no goods the statement said the ships were not boarded 
separately bush protested that iraqi attempts to move american 
civilians around iraq and kuwait violated international law 
the president made his decision to draw on some of the nations 
12 million reservists as the us military continued a massive 
troop and hardware movement to the tense gulf region 
the pentagon meantime announced that up to 38 commercial 
airliners owned by 16 carriers are being turned over to the 
military to transport troops and cargo to the gulf region the move 
is unprecedented in us civil aviation history 
one administration official said of the decision on reserves 
in principle its been decided but the details are still being 
worked out its just a question of how many folks theyre 
going to call up and who they are theyre wrangling about that 
right now 
the washington post reported in saturday editions that up to 
80000 army reservists and smaller numbers of personnel from other 
military reserve branches could be called to active duty if 
recommendations to bush were followed 
announcement of the decision was delayed because paperwork had 
not yet arrived at bushs vacation home from the pentagon where 
military officials had requested the callup 
the administration brushed off criticism from united nations 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar about the us use of a 
barricade to enforce sanctions against iraq we believe its 
fully authorized presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
fresh concerns were raised about the safety of americans after 
35 us citizens were removed from the rashid hotel in baghdad and 
taken to an undisclosed location most likely another hotel 
fitzwater said there was some indication the iraqis wanted to keep 
them away from the news media 
we consider it a matter of serious concern fitzwater said 
the vacationing bush teeing up for a 7 am golf game told 
reporters i dont think anybody ought to be moved against their 
will in contravention of international law 
american diplomats in baghdad believe the americans may have 
been taken to the melia monsour a hotel where british citizens are 
being detained but iraqi authorities prevented the embassy 
officials from entering the hotel to check richard boucher a 
state department spokesman said in washington 
asked whether a hostage situation was developing boucher said 
i cant speculate at this point 
later in the day the white house declined comment on an 
assertion by the speaker of iraqs parliament that iraq will hold 
all foreigners from aggressive nations until the threat of war 
against his country ends he said they would be spread throughout 
the country housed in military and civilian targets 
meanwhile a group of nine foreigners including three 
americans bolted across the kuwaiti desert to the saudi arabian 
border town of khafji in an effort to avoid an iraqi order to 
gather at a downtown hotel reported stephanie mcgehee an american 
stringer for the associated press who was in the group 
the state department said food available on open markets to the 
3000 or so americans in iraq and kuwait was diminishing 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat 
repeated that the americans in those countries wouldnt be harmed 
i can assure you they are well treated and will be released in 
due time he said 
the massive buildup of american military power in the gulf 
continued in response to iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and to 
what the administration sees as a threat to the oilrich kingdom of 
saudi arabia the deployment now includes stealth fighterbombers 
marine amphibious assault units and other forces normally used for 
offense 
fitzwater said the pentagon had asked bush to authorize a 
selective callup of reservists the president is authorized to put 
a maximum of 200000 reservists on active duty for 180 days but 
fitzwater said a massive callup was not anticipated 
well try to keep this as small as possible the spokesman 
said 
in recent years congress has allocated more and more of the 
support functions for the military to the reserve forces so that 
you find a major aspect of our support in terms of cargo handlers 
and doctors and medical specialists and so forth are in the 
reserves he said 
the movement of americans from the rashid hotel in baghdad 
followed a threatened roundup of us citizens in iraqioccupied 
kuwait a day earlier 
fitzwater said the idea of gathering the americans in one 
location appeared to have fizzled a handful of americans five or 
six showed up at the appointed hotel but were told by the staff 
there they had no idea what this was all about 
to this point the bush administration has challenged any 
suggestion the 3000 americans trapped in iraq and kuwait were 
hostages 
fitzwater said that iraqi officials when questioned about the 
35 americans in baghdad told us that they are safe but have not 
given us any explanation why they were moved or where they are 
he said we are also discussing this matter with the other 
nations who have people in baghdad to try to get everyone to 
work in concert in bringing diplomatic pressure on baghdad to make 
sure that these citizens are safe and accounted for 
fitzwater said there are as many as 3 million foreigners in 
kuwait and iraq from many countries 
they all are essentially in the same situation which is that 
they have freedom of movement they are being treated relatively 
well under the circumstances or at least have not been singled out 
for harassment but they have not been allowed to leave 
bush will return to the white house sunday night and meet monday 
morning with budget aides and energy secretary james watkins to 
discuss the impact of the persian gulf crisis on us energy 
reserves bush will address the veterans of foreign war convention 
in baltimore later monday and make a campaign trip to rhode island 
before returning to kennebunkport 
in military deployment announcements the pentagon said friday 
elements of the armys 1st cavalry division and 2nd armored 
division from fort hood texas have begun preparing to leave for 
the middle east 
nine of the military sealift commands ready reserve force 
ships have been activated and are moving to loading ports in 
support of the saudi operation 
the air force has sent four air transportable hospitals to the 
persian gulf area medical personnel and equipment have come from 
macdill air force base fla langley air force base va shaw air 
force base sc and seymour johnson air force base nc an air 
transportable hospital from myrtle beach air force base sc also

armynavy surplus stores are reporting a run 
on gas masks by southern californians apparently fearful that iraq 
could extend its use of poison gas to the united states 
most are afraid that iraq is going to send terrorists over to 
this country and they want to be prepared for any chemical 
warfare said michael sherman owner of south coast army and navy 
surplus in newport beach 
his store usually sells about two to three masks a week mostly 
to people who work with spray paint or pesticides 
lately weve been selling about 20 a week sherman said 
the masks are israeli army issue sell for 995 and dont come 
with any guarantees of effectiveness against poison gas he said 
we cant say theyre going to do anything because of the 
liability situation we sell them as novelty items sherman said 
a more serious and expensive model is available at orange army 
navy store the 115 mask is chemical resistant and is the same 
type the military uses said store manager dave tipple 
tipple said sales jumped immediately after iraq invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 iraq used poison gas in its conflict with iran and also 
against ethnic kurds in iraq 
jeff millers hq army navy store in downtown los angeles has 
been bombarded by callers asking for gas masks but miller said 
restraint was in order 
unless the iraqi government decides to send a fleet up to 
marina del rey we dont think anyone will need it i havent seen 
the iraqi flotilla off the marina said miller

the security council on friday expressed 
anxiety over the fate of foreigners trapped in kuwait and iraq 
and called on the un secretarygeneral to take all necessary 
steps to help them 
hundreds of thousands of foreigners including about 4000 
britons and 2500 americans were stranded when iraq overran kuwait 
on aug 2 another 500 americans were in iraq 
late friday the speaker of iraqs parliament sadi mahdi said 
iraq will hold all foreigners from aggressive nations until the 
threat of war against his country ends his statement was carried 
by the official iraqi news agency and monitored in nicosia 
he said those foreigners would be spread throughout the country 
housed in military and civilian installations 
on thursday iraqi military authorities had ordered americans 
and britons in kuwait to assemble in hotels there and implied they 
would be rounded up if they did not comply 
both britain and the united states protested the order 
in addition us officials are trying to find out where the 
iraqis have taken about three dozen americans removed from a luxury 
hotel in the iraqi capital of baghdad white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said they were believed to have been taken to another 
hotel 
clearly we are very seriously concerned about the 
americans said state department spokesman richard boucher he 
spoke before mahdis announcement 
also earlier friday the us ambassador to the united nations 
thomas r pickering said after a security council meeting that 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar should become 
immediately engaged in this humanitarian crisis having to do with 
foreign nationals represented in iraq and kuwait 
british ambassador crispin tickell told reporters we want the 
secretarygeneral to do all he can in a private way 
he said more than 1 million nationals of other countries are 
living and working in iraq and kuwait and find themselves in 
painful circumstances today 
the security council after meeting in closed session said its 
members express their concern and anxiety over the foreign 
nationals status and asked the secretarygeneral to take all 
steps considered appropriate 
the statement was given by the security councils president 
aurel dragos munteanu of romania 
perez de cuellar has already been asked by the european 
community to send an envoy to the region to investigate and help 
secure the release of foreigners 
in other action at the united nations on friday a special 
security council committee convened to discuss compliance with the 
un embargo against iraq 
a threecountry committee meeting in closed session discussed 
an interim report on compliance dozens of the 159 un member 
states it also was expected to discuss violations and enforcement 
but was not expected to call for a un blockade at this time 
the committee headed by finland and joined by colombia and 
canada also was consulting with the rest of the 15member council 
perez de cuellar said the use of military power to enforce un 
sanctions against iraq violates the un charter unless the 
security council approves it his comments thursday challenged the 
reason for the usled naval barricade of iraq 
american officials have said the usled multinational force is 
acting in line with the un sanctions 
in response to perez de cuellars challenge white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday we obviously believe that 
article 51 of the un charter authorizes our intercept 
activities we believe the un understands that 
president bush on thursday signed an order instructing us ship 
commanders in the middle east to intercept all ships carrying goods 
to or from iraq or kuwait he authorized ship commanders to use the 
minimum force necessary to stop any ship suspected of carrying 
goods to or from kuwait or iraq 
if the threenation committee decides the boycott is not being 
honored the security council can declare a military blockade and 
appeal to member states to enforce it 
the soviet union has been pressing for a broader un role in 
controlling regional conflicts it said friday it would participate 
in a military operation in the persian gulf under the un flag

its no accident when a drunken driver 
gets into a car wreck florida officials have conceded in a 
warofwords victory for mothers against drunk driving its a 
crash 
florida state troopers and the department of highway safety and 
motor vehicles will no longer refer to collisions between vehicles 
as accidents partly because of pressure from madd theyre now 
known as crashes 
accidents implies that the vehicles are out there acting 
independently through some unseen forces said department 
spokesman ed birk theres almost always a human factor and a 
human reason behind the crash 
the department has begun referring to all collisions as 
crashes not just those involving drunks birk said but he 
conceded that years of coaxing from madd played a big part in the 
decision 
the antidrunken driving organization has long sought to 
convince governments and news reporters that wrecks involving 
alcohol arent accidents 
it is important that people not think of it as something that 
couldnt be helped said betty jane spencer of florida madd 
some of them are accidents but not drunk driving 
florida state troopers were told in a july 18 memo from director 
bobby burkett to begin using the word crash in all 
correspondence and when they speak about a collision publicly 
the justpublished book of statewide statistics on wrecks has 
been retitled florida traffic crash facts and the former 
traffic accident report forms used by police agencies across the 
state will soon be known as traffic crash report forms 
a vast majority of crashes are not accidents birk said 
theres a human being behind the wheel thats got to be 
responsible 
the only other state to adopt crash as the official word for 
a car wreck is missouri said madd national president mickey sadoff 
for 10 years weve fought for this word change because to 
call it an accident seems to absolve people of responsibility 
she said by calling it a crash you are elevating it to show 
its a preventable violent crime 
mrs spencer who lost four children in a drunkendriving wreck 
said madd members often write letters to newspapers and tv stations 
when reporters refer to such collisions as accidents 
its very offensive to people who have lost loved ones to call 
it an accident she said i think now that the state is 
starting to use crash the news people will start feeling more 
comfortable with it 
there were 36312 alcoholrelated collisions in florida in 1989 
down from 37800 the year before according to the new crash 
facts book almost 1500 people died in those collisions which 
represented 144 percent of total wrecks

government and mohawk negotiators opened their 
first formal talks thursday to settle a territorial dispute that 
has prompted the indians to take up arms and touched off protests 
nationwide 
the indian negotiators slipped out a back door after thursdays 
talks and government negotiators were tightlipped however 
federal negotiator bernard roy told reporters nothing nefarious 
should be read into the meetings midafternoon termination 
it simply has to do with the fact that the mohawks have 
certain customs and they are not to conduct negotiations after 
sundown roy told reporters 
the talks are aimed at defusing a fiveweekold standoff between 
indians and authorities at oka a town 18 miles west of montreal 
the indians are trying to block a golf course addition on land they

the nuclear regulatory commission is 
investigating its decision to license the seabrook nuclear plant 
amid claims that its licensing board was pressured to overlook 
safety concerns 
seabrook opponents welcomed the move as long overdue 
i think its a great idea sen gordon humphrey rnh 
said thursday i have long felt that the licensing process has 
been corrupted by political pressures and that some decisions have 
not been objective 
roy morrison a spokesman for the antinuclear clamshell 
alliance said seabrook opponents hope the investigation will turn 
up the corruption and misconduct they long have alleged 
the whole process has been a scandal we have an agency thats 
been in a moral vacuum morrison said the reasonable thing 
that should be done is the license should be suspended until a full 
investigation is completed 
seabrook spokesman ron sher said plant officials are confident 
the investigation will turn up no improprieties 
seabrook station has been the most closely scrutinized nuclear 
plant ever licensed with respect to the safety of the plant and the 
adequacy of the emergency response plans he said 
david williams the nrcs inspector general is investigating 
the atomic safety and licensing boards decision to recommend 
seabrooks licensing according to documents made public wednesday 
the recommendation long delayed by concerns about evacuation plans 
for nearby communities paved the way for the nrc to grant a 
commercial operating license on march 15 
the board recommended licensing even though appeals by 
antinuclear activists had not been decided the opponents claim 
there is no way to evacuate the area adequately in an emergency 
the seabrook opponents appeal did not preclude the atomic 
safety board from issuing the operating license according to ivan 
smith chairman of the licensing board 
but state house minority leader mary chambers a democrat said 
the investigation should center on what occurred between nov 9 
when by some accounts the licensing board was not ready to go 
ahead and nov 13 when it announced its favorable decision 
they dont believe its possible to evacuate the area and then 
four days later change their minds something happened there she 
said chambers said she doesnt know whether it was corruption or 
not but it clearly looks like there was some pressure brought to 
bear 
morrison was more blunt 
its pretty obvious that through the whole process the nrc was 
in the tank and that ivan smith took a dive he said smith 
did have some concerns until he got talked to we want to know who 
talked to him 
antinuclear activists have speculated that white house chief of 
staff john sununu an ardent seabrook supporter while new hampshire 
governor exerted some clout sununu has denied having any 
influence over the decision 
leo norton the nrcs assistant inspector general for 
investigations wouldnt comment on what prompted the investigation 
other than some very sensitive issues are involved 
smith refused to comment on details but acknowledged that 
williams investigation is highly unusual 
i have never heard of any such thing as this in almost 40 
years of law practice he said 
in a memo smith wrote that williams seems to be trying to 
determine whether the change was corruptly induced by nrc 
officers and corruptly made by members of the licensing board 
if he finds wrongdoing williams can recommend action to the 
full commission

interior secretary manuel lujan jr 
said thursday that americans are unlikely to consume less fuel 
unless they are hit by the likes of the 1973 oil crisis when 
motorists waited in long lines to fill their tanks 
i think thats what does it he said i dont really 
believe that the increase in price at this point has discouraged 
anyone from going anywhere 
lujan who was in albuquerque to present awards to three oil 
companies said the united states should cut its reliance on 
foreign oil by easing regulations so that more domestic oil can be 
extracted 
the bush administration has announced it will use the persian 
gulf crisis and resulting gasoline price increases to push for oil 
exploration in an alaskan wilderness the arctic national wildlife 
refuge 
lujan also said drilling should be allowed at the 25 billion 
point arguello project a 25 billion development about 150 miles 
north of los angeles that has been blocked by concerns of 
ecological damage 
lujan presented the interior departments payorreporter award 
for diligent production reports and royalty payments to conoco 
the santa fe energy co and the williston basin interstate pipeline

airlines may have to cut flight schedules up to 
35 percent starting in october because of mandatory budget cuts 
the head of the federal aviation administration warned thursday 
faa administrator james b busey iv said he is planning on 
drastic cutbacks if the budget impasse isnt broken by oct 1 at 
that time the government would implement the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law he said 
if grammrudman goes into effect the faa would have to slash 
spending about 32 percent busey said while speaking at the atlanta 
aero club 
that means i will have to begin furloughing members of the 
work force to the extent that we will have approximately 30 percent 
of our work force on furlough on any given day he said that 
will cause a corresponding reduction in our ability to control air 
traffic between 25 and 35 percent 
the administrator said he notified his work force of about 
50000 on monday about the prospect of furloughs each worker would 
have to take off up to 2 normal working days each twoweek pay 
period 
memos sent this week by the office of personnel management are 
telling the nations 24 million federal workers they could face up 
to 22 days off without pay in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
or about one day in each twoweek pay period 
busey said the furloughs would apply across the board to air 
traffic controllers maintenance inspectors equipment specialists 
and security officials 
i dont know how to prioritize between those 
responsibilities he said therefore an acrosstheboard 
furlough mechanism is the only way i know how to manage 
he said he intends to discuss the contingency plans next week 
with the air transport association a trade group that represents 
virtually all us airlines 
although the bush administration and congressional leaders have 
been known to play brinkmanship with the budget time is running 
out as other problems such as the middle east crisis are 
competing for washingtons front burner 
in 1982 42000 federal workers were furloughed briefly in a 
budget dispute between congress and the reagan administration 
president bush last week exempted uniformed military personnel from 
furloughs

injecting insulin glands into a transplanted 
liver prevents diabetes in some patients a procedure that could 
help diabetics who have kidney damage researchers said thursday 
the islets of langerhans the tiny insulin factories found in 
the pancreas were injected into the livers of nine patients whose 
pancreases were removed at two pittsburgh hospitals 
all nine patients produced insulin at first and for five of 
them bloodsugar levels remained normal and insulin shots were 
unnecessary according to a study published this week in the 
lancet a british medical journal 
doctors from the universities of pittsburgh miami and milan 
italy said fk506 a drug that prevents rejection of transplanted 
organs and glands contributed to the operations success 
gerold grodsky a researcher of islet gland function at the 
university of california at san francisco called the study a 
major step 
however he cautioned that the procedure will be useful only for 
people who are taking antirejection drugs such as kidney 
transplant recipients a third of whom have diabetes 
the patients in the study had lost their pancreases spleens 
stomachs and parts of their small and large intestines to abdominal 
cancer and had received liver transplants 
the surgery next will be tried on patients with kidney damage 
due to diabetes that appears early in life an associate professor 
of surgery at the university of pittsburgh said 
the real target of the research eventually is juvenile 
diabetes the most troublesome kind said dr andreas tzakis 
one percent of the us population suffers from juvenile 
diabetes which can cause blindness heart problems and kidney 
failure the procedures success is less promising for them because 
their bodies would reject donor glands grodsky said 
more research on the bodys immune system is needed before 
people with juvenile diabetes but no transplants can be helped 
said dr daniel mintz of the university of miamis diabetes center 
another of the studys authors 
in the lancet study two patients died of infections and 
multiple organ failure and a third died after six months when his 
cancer reappeared another patient became diabetic later 
the researchers said the best example of how the gland 
transplant works is seen in mary arthur 16 of louisville ky 
who underwent a transplant in january to replace a liver diseased 
with cancer 
the transplant of the islets of langerhans takes only 30 
minutes the cells either are injected into a small blood vessel 
near the liver during surgery or delivered intravenously the study 
said 
the islets seem to be making a new home in the liver although 
its not their normal home tzakis said they go there to live 
and they get a blood supply in there 
preparing the islets takes four hours the cells comprising 
only 1 percent of the pancreas and visible only with a microscope 
are removed from a dead donors pancreas 
dr paul lacey a pathologist at washington university in st 
louis said the study confirms results a washington university team 
published in the april issue of the journal diabetes 
the washington researchers transplanted the islets of langerhans 
into a diabetic patient with kidney damage then recorded a 
reduction in blood sugar when insulin production resumed lacey 
said

american firepower on the arabian peninsula 
has grown beyond the strictly defensive role that president bush 
described nine days ago in pledging to protect saudi arabia from 
iraq 
the clearest sign of a shift toward offensive capabilities is 
the departure thursday from langley air force base va of f117a 
stealth fighter bombers 
the stealth fighterbombers which saw their first combat action 
during decembers invasion of panama are designed to penetrate 
heavily defended areas to attack vital targets in iraq they could 
hit supply depots or key oil facilities

oil price increases are straining already tight city and state 
budgets forcing cutbacks in car and air travel by government 
workers and causing fresh jitters over the possibility of a 
recession 
most local budget officials contacted this week by the 
associated press said it was too early to weigh the impact of oil 
price increases stemming from the 2weekold persian gulf crisis 
theres no reason to panic at this point said verlyn 
leiker budget director of kansas city mo who estimated that the 
oil price rise has added only a few hundred thousand to that 
citys 350 million budget 
a few energyproducing states even believe theyll come out 
winners if oil prices continue upward but budget officials 
elsewhere fear sustained oil price increases of 25 percent to 30 
percent would almost certainly bring about deep municipal and state 
service cuts

actors equity reversed itself thursday and 
said it would allow a white british actor to play a eurasian in the 
broadway production of the hit london musical miss saigon 
the vote to approve actor jonathan pryce came at a special 
meeting of the unions 70member council called in response to a 
petition from more than 600 equity members outraged by the decision 
last week to bar the actor 
the council determined that indeed mister pryce qualifies as 
a star in accordance with the criteria established in the agreement 
between equity and the league of american theaters and producers 
said alan eisenberg 
the council ban of pryce prompted the shows producer to cancel 
its broadway run and dividing the theater community 
the producer cameron mackintosh has not said whether he would 
resurrect the show if the union rescinded its order miss 
saigon was to begin previews here in march its top ticket price 
was 100 mackintosh said the cancellation of the 10 million 
musical which had a record 25 million in advance ticket sales 
would cost him about 600000

life in the business marsh which ordinarily 
hums with innovative little outfits that eventually grow and nip at 
the heels of giant companies is quiet these days 
business isnt good for beginners many dont even get a hearing 
from the loan officer at the bank venture capitalists those folks 
who used to take big risks for big rewards havent been very 
venturesome either 
the federal reserve following a tight money policy has made 
life miserable for them and banks fearful of regulators and often 
reacting to their own earlier excesses have all but welded the 
hinges on their vaults 
congress has hindered rather than helped not only has it failed 
to solve the deficit problem it is poised now to pile on a whole 
new set of regulations that can only raise costs and drive 
smallbusiness people mad 
the regulations all accompanied by energydraining paperwork 
concern minimum wages mandated health costs mandated leaves 
mandated access for handicapped mandated pollution controls the 
paperwork alone is full time 
an american express co survey of newbusiness formation showed 
a 42 percent decline in the second half of 1989 dun amp bradstreet 
corp says new incorporations are stagnant in the first four 
months of 1990 they totaled 236102 down 09 percent from 238306 
in the yearearlier period 
business failures meanwhile are higher for the first time 
since 1986 dampb puts the percentage at 95 percent over last year 
and as usual many of these are upstart companies in april the 
new england failure rate was nearly triple that of a year earlier 
and the middle atlantic rate was more than double 
small and beginning business is the breeding ground of 
creativity the source of new jobs the inventor of new products 
and services and the future competition for big companies that 
otherwise might develop clogged arteries 
from emerging businesses will come new ways to contain 
healthcare costs new hightech companies to solve what has 
stymied the bigger guys new products to help the balance of 
payments new marketing strategies 
economists accustomed to the big scene to viewing abstract 
statistics to dealing with macro rather than microeconomics 
often make little of the emergingbusiness problem everyone 
suffers in a downturn they say 
others contend correctly that much of the credit crunch 
involves real estate and building and that many forestalled 
ventures are speculative whatever they involve the future of jobs 
and companies 
no area of the economy exists in isolation 
the construction of one house for example involves a thousand 
economic transactions including the purchase of raw land payment 
of fees to towns soil testing sewers water mains curbs 
gutters streets landscaping 
it involves according to the national association of home 
builders 18 manyears of employment including the direct 
services of carpenters plumbers electricians insulators 
painters roofers cement workers tilers and others 
the jobs and the businesses involved are by no means local 
steelmakers carpetmakers furnace makers and makers of air 
conditioners must ship their products from many miles away by air 
by rail by road 
but it isnt just real estate and building that are being 
deprived of water in the smallbusiness marsh it isnt only 
hightech companies either 
when business withers at the grass roots the damage sometimes 
isnt seen for a while big business can shout threaten and stamp 
its feet thus getting the the attention of elected officials the 
smallest businesses might not 
when ideas and innovations die when inventions arent financed 
when startup companies arent nourished the signs might be barely 
detectible in the national statistics 
the economic measuring devices arent always so perceptive that 
they can detect the pulse of small business the faint murmurs in 
the business marsh

as the us network anchor buildup continued in 
the middle east abcs peter jennings was asked if he felt a little 
lonely staying here to anchor world news tonight 
not at all said jennings who used to cover the middle east 
in his correspondent days im in exactly the right place my job 
is to coordinate the coverage not just go and do one dimension of 
it 
he spoke last thursday as the network anchor total in the 
middle east rose to seven with the arrivals in saudi arabia of 
nbcs tom brokaw and abcs sam donaldson the latter there for 
primetime live 
it was perhaps the largest array of highpriced anchors since 
the moscow summit of 1988 when there were so many news stars 
running loose only luck prevented a highspeed interview pileup 
but this time theyre spread out those who have been sent to 
cover and anchor so to speak the middle east crisis caused by 
irags armed takeover of kuwait 
theyve reported from dubai jordan cairo saudi arabia and 
in cbs dan rathers case a navy carrier from which he anchored 
on tape part of one newscast rather and abcs ted koppel also 
have been the only us anchors to broadcast from baghdad yet 
nbcs garrick utley still is trying to get in 
ironically ted turners global cable news network hasnt sent 
in an anchor star it has stuck with its grunts the 
correspondents why didnt cnn send in just one of its anchors 
say bernard shaw 
its because of what we are as opposed to the other guys 
says ed turner cnns executive vice president for newsgathering 
they have halfhour shows and if thats how they want to use 
their anchors super 
it should be pointed out that koppel and rather have done 
breakingnews bulletins and report for newscasts on their networks 
other than their own just like the lesserknown lesserpaid 
correspondents 
but this story unlike any story i can ever remember has so 
many different locations turner says and an anchor is 
supposed to tie it all together from a central location 
the place to do that is not downtown baghdad or downtown 
amman the place to be is what you consider your news universe 
jennings gives almost the same reason its a complicated 
story as the reason hes staying here 
koppel the nightline anchor has scored good beats 
particularly by being the first us network newsman into iraq 
jennings says but i cant go off and pursue the one thing and 
still run our coverage 
rather says turner is a helluva reporter he likes doing 
that hes excited about it and thats fine but thats not an 
anchors job if youre really anchoring youre talking about 
holding the show together 
rather has been in the middle east since the crisis began 
brokaw started only last thursday when he reported for the nbc 
nightly news and anchored part of it from what seemed a palm 
treelined oasis 
why the delay 
weve been saying all along that if we can get into baghdad 
saudi arabia or kuwait we would go says the shows executive 
producer steve friedman 
saudi arabia which tightly restricted correspondents visits 
even before the current gulf crisis gave brokaw approval to enter 
last week likewise abcs donaldson 
that approval was why we went in with brokaw says friedman 
weve been holding off because im not going to send tom to a 
place where i can only get a phone call report from the nbc 
anchorman 
with the advent of satellites the wandering anchorman has 
become almost routine there are varied reasons for moving about 
jennings says to bring attention to particular event or region 
or a single story 
another reason the anchor is sent in on a major story is clout 
the fact an anchor is wellknown and has contacts with major 
movers and shakers sometimes gets him interviews or into places 
lesser mortals only might dream about as friedman puts it 
an anchorman gives you cachet because everybody all over 
knows who they are ted koppel got into baghdad because hes ted 
koppel and worked the story 
media critics some of whom may yet cover a fire sometimes 
question the validity of anchor expeditions calling them showbiz 
moves intended more to drum up publicity and ratings for network 
newscasts than to commit journalism 
the urbane jennings would give such carpers the back of his hand 
i dont think they watch what we do i dont think they even 
look at content or look at the reporting our audience wants 
to know what the hells going on not where any of us are standing 
at any given date 
my advice is to pay less attention to anchors and more to 
content 
 
elsewhere in television

after growing up as an army brat sandy 
vonkaenel became an army wife and it wasnt long before her 
husband was off to vietnam 
all that experience helps now that hes away again in saudi 
arabia 
for those whove been associated with the army for a lengthy 
time its not so difficult she said taking time out from a 
dayandnight schedule of activities from networking with 
other wives in support groups to distributing red white and blue 
ribbons 
we knew what our husbands jobs were its not a big 
surprise said mrs vonkaenel whose husband joined the army 21 
years ago for younger wives its more difficult 
twentyone years ago karen walsh was born recently when her 
soldierhusband just 23 himself learned he would be among the 
thousands deployed as part of a force to deter a possible iraqi 
invasion of saudi arabia she was unprepared 
i think my whole generation i guess were kind of naive we 
dont remember that war she said referring to vietnam 
we never really thought that this would happen i know i never 
did when he went into the army its hard to believe its 
actually happening 
this is not to say that the officers wife is nonchalant or 
that the young specialists wife is overwhelmed as he works long 
hours preparing and she waits for him to ship out at any time 
in both of the wives voices is the steel of military stoicism 
in both of their laughs is the breath of nervousness 
both women who spoke on the condition their husbands first 
names not be used find some refuge in routine 
birthday parties go on soccer camps go on said the 
42yearold mrs vonkaenel who has a 13yearold son and a 
5yearold daughter school starts next week normal routine 
at the same time theres an outoftheordinary routine since 
the deployment began i have a family assistance meeting 
tonight mrs vonkaenel said ive been on the phone all 
morning 
during an interview she was interrupted three times by phone 
calls unit by unit soldiers spouses set up phone trees and 
she volunteered her name and number 
an earlier call had been from a wife who has only a learners 
permit and couldnt drive alone how could she go get groceries 
the forts family aid office would send someone to help 
another call what if the aid office didnt come if they 
dont ill come and get you mrs vonkaenel told the woman 
asked if she has trouble sleeping these days mrs vonkaenel 
said yes but laughed not because i cant sleep she said 
its because im too busy 
mrs walsh is getting less sleep too her two children almost 
1 year old and almost 3 wake her up early and ted koppel keeps 
her up late 
i usually stay up until nightline goes off she said i 
keep that little tv in the kitchen on all day so i can hear 
anything that comes on any reports ive always watched a lot of 
news but now i watch four or five evening newses 
as she spoke her little daughter blurted my daddys in the 
army 
she sees sometimes on the news the army daddies and she 
asks mrs walsh said her husband could leave at any time 
hes all packed and ready to go she said 
i promised myself i wouldnt cry if it happened she said of 
the deployment then as it got worse i have cried its not 
knowing whats going on thats really bad 
mrs walsh and her husband were high school sweethearts both 
went to college briefly he joined the service for the education 
benefits and to give him discipline or something his wife 
said he felt that he needed that 
its not a career hes been in longer than we planned on but 
her voiced trailed off and she smiled 
hes about a year into his second hitch the first was spent in 
colorado far from both their families in charlotte nc mrs 
walsh said shes happier at fort bragg the whole communitys 
centered around the army she said 
portable signs in front of businesses and churches bear messages 
such as god bless america and our soldiers overseas a rock 
music station plays the national anthem at noon introduced by a 
disc jockey who says were damn proud to be americans 
at an intersection one day last week a van with a bumper 
sticker that read army spouses are special waited as a convoy 
of a dozen boxy medics ambulances olive drab with large 
redandwhite crosses turned eastward the direction of ports 
where ships have been loading military vehicles and equipment 
the reminders are everywhere 
i was thinking earlier today everyone else is kind of going 
through their normal life mrs walsh said its just something 
they see on tv maybe they think about it but not as much as i 
mean we think about it all the time 
feelings get mixed up sadness fear pride 
ive just started becoming more aware of how lucky we are that 
were here when i see all theoutheast

metropolitan opera in new york this season from porgy and 
bess to boris gudonov but only a decade ago he was working 
in the local tobacco fields 
in between he met essex moseley president of the charlotte 
county assembly part of a network of grassroots selfhelp groups 
being set up in poor rural counties around the south 
the assembly was sponsoring a music contest and we took 
michael down moseley said 
and the voice i was really knocked off my feet he said 
forest then 18 and trained only in the church choir and school 
chorus won the competition first prize was a scholarship to the 
shenandoah conservatory of music in winchester va 
i was very lucky to be in the right place at the right 
time said forest from his manhattan apartment shortly after a 
visit home where he sang in his old mount zion baptist church

stratforduponavon england ap on a hazy afternoon in the 
bards birthplace of stratford shakespeare was making particular 
sense for a room of american and british teachers 
royal shakespeare company actor ralph fiennes was reciting 
sonnet 129 thexpense of spirit in a waste of shame he 
stopped after each word and the teachers shouted what 
the exercise compelled fiennes to pay heed to every part of the 
verse and his audience was impressed 
the idea of acting each word i can make my students do 
that said lynn lawrence chairman of the english and drama 
department at osbourn park high school in manassas va 
ive got tears in my eyes sighed marcia rosenboom who 
teaches high school drama and english at george community high 
school in george iowa 
fiennes and vocal coach andrew wade were showing how 
shakespeares elizabethan language emerges clearly through 
breathing and technical exercises which the teachers can apply at 
home 
the teachers were recently in stratford on the first phase of a 
program teaching shakespeare texts and performances which 
continued in washington dc at the folger shakespeare library 
the 500000 program is the brainchild of the education 
departments of the folger and the rsc 
this is the largestscale shakespeareeducationforteachers 
program that has ever gone on in the world tony hill the rscs 
director of education said in a joint interview with his folger 
library counterpart peggy obrien 
there is a double aim to immerse teachers in shakespeare from 
performing and analytical perspectives and to give them the chance 
to meet each other 
teachers can be the most insular selfobsessed and frankly 
boring group of people you ever get in the world said hill who 
spent four years with obrien planning the current four weeks 
at least part of that is to do with the fact that theyre so 
seldom given the tools to do their job that youd give to any other 
industry 
obrien a former high school teacher said teachers are too 
often very invisible one of the only ways we can see each other 
is when we get in a group like this at an institute 
the 40 teachers on the program include 25 americans and 15 
britons ranging in age from 24 to 60 they were chosen from more 
than 500 applicants in the united states and 350 in britain 
three scholars from american universities were on hand 
throughout to lecture and offer tutorials and there are as many 
master teachers to develop teaching strategies to take back to 
the classroom 
of primary importance in stratford is the opportunity to watch 
classically trained talent such as fiennes who is playing troilus 
in troilus and cressida grappling with difficult knotted 
verse 
its about making the punctuation mark a physical movement 
denise fournier a 29yearold teacher from concord nh decided 
after the young actor completed a drill in which grammar dictates 
changes in gesture 
for lynn lawrence seeing the plays performed helps to teach 
them students are leery theyre afraid of failure and of not 
understanding shakespeare i need to get them to see it as a 
story and a performance and theres no other way to get that 
the teachers attended stratford productions of king lear 
troilus and cressida and the comedy of errors as well as 
edward ii by christopher marlowe shakespeares contemporary 
their textual focus was on lear troilus and romeo and 
juliet the last chosen because said hill its something 
everybodys going to have taught 
the site for some offers its own rewards 
we americans dont have any of this wonderful scenery or the 
birthplace said karen huffman who teaches advanced placement 
english to 12thgraders in rapid city sd it brings shakespeare 
home 
she added that the camaraderie was invaluable 
im getting reassurance that im doing the right thing 
huffman said im really pleased im keeping pace out there in 
the boondocks 
martha christian one of the master teachers said 
teaching is lonely most of us teach in isolation this gives us 
a network of people who are enthusiastic

this is no joke its the new york 
governors race 
on the democratic side gov mario cuomo is seeking reelection 
to a third fouryear term if he wins some think he might run for 
president in 1992 hes campaigning by planting trees all across 
the state 
on the republican side cuomos challenger is economist pierre 
rinfret if he wins he wont run for president he cant he was 
born in canada you have to be born in the usa to be president 
when rinfret won the republican state conventions nomination in 
late may he wasnt even a republican he said he thought he was 
he said he even remembered voting in republican primaries it 
turned out he was listed in voting records as an independent there 
was no record of him having voted in any recent gop primaries he 
subsequently enrolled as a republican 
thats not to say there werent enrolled republicans ready to 
run there were two of them in fact they are running they just 
arent running as republicans 
herbert london a new york university dean wanted the 
republican nomination but was rejected by gop leaders after 
meeting rinfret london said he rejected an offer to become the 
economists running mate london then accepted the conservative 
partys nomination to run for governor hes since spent much of 
the campaign attacking rinfret and the republicans who rejected him 
louis wein a new york citybased consultant went to the 
republican state convention intending to fight rinfret for the 
nomination rinfret is prochoice on the abortion issue wein who 
is antiabortion was upset that the republican platform included a 
prochoice plank 
wein said he finally agreed not to challenge rinfrets 
nomination after party leaders promised that the prochoice plank 
would be removed rinfret was nominated by acclamation but a 
prochoice plank weaker than the original stayed in 
wein then accepted the gubernatorial nomination of new yorks 
right to life party 
he also began circulating petitions in an attempt to force 
rinfret into a sept 11 primary for the gop ballot spot when he 
didnt collect enough signatures he went to court he claims he 
was the victim of fraud and doublecross at the state gop 
convention republican leaders say they only promised they would 
discuss the prochoice stand 
wein wants a state judge to order a republican primary 
once they stop laughing at the courthouse said rinfret 
campaign manager john faso im sure that it will be 
unceremoniously dismissed 
id rather see mario cuomo governor than mr rinfret said 
wein at one point 
the campaign has played largely like this rinfret attacks 
cuomo cuomo ignores rinfret london and wein attack rinfret 
rinfret provides some additional interest hes never run for 
office and his political inexperience often shows 
immediately after his nomination rinfret told reporters that he 
wasnt a millionaire a few minutes later he said his net worth was 
more than 12 million he explained the discrepancy by saying he 
was teasing he is a millionaire 
in a later interview rinfret said he and his wife battled each 
morning to see who would get to read the new york times first he 
then said that he hated the times the states most influential 
newspaper because its biased its prejudiced and it lies 
he later told the times he had been misunderstood i was 
fooling around like a moron he said 
rinfret who runs an international economic consulting firm and 
once served as an unpaid adviser to president nixon was discovered 
by republican leaders less than two weeks before the gop 
convention a host of other prominent new york republicans such as 
rudolph giuliani assembly minority leader clarence rappleyea and 
staten island borough president guy molinari had refused to run 
rinfret called such republicans gutless wonders 
a decorated world war ii veteran he also called cuomo 
chicken for going to college instead of off to war in korea 
cuomo meanwhile keeps mum on whether hell run for president 
and keeps planting trees hes planted them on long island and in 
niagara falls and at a host of stops in between its a device 
meant to promote passage of a 2billion environmental bond issue 
the bond issue will be on the november ballot in new york state 
there is also an election for governor

with the price of petroleum rising and crude 
supplies falling are oil company stocks a good bet during the 
mideast crisis 
that depends 
most experts say shares of the major integrated oil 
companies such as exxon mobil and chevron should be a safe 
investment for the near term in fact many of these stocks are 
considered undervalued 
but some suggest it may be wise to avoid companies that are 
primarily involved in refining crude such as diamond shamrock rampm 
these companies it is argued may be caught in the squeeze between 
the steeper prices they must pay for crude and pressure they face 
to hold down prices at the pump 
while major oil companies may be in a good position investing 
in these stocks is not riskfree analysts say 
its absolutely not the place to make a quick buck said 
frank knuettel who follows oil companies at prudentialbache 
securities inc 
for one thing oil companies face profit pressures as they 
replace supplies gathered before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
with higherprice oil 
in addition the oil giants are under increasing pressure by 
both the government and consumer groups to hold down gasoline 
prices amid charges of price gouging 
finally nobody knows whether the higher prices will cause a 
steep dropoff in demand for gasoline and other refined products 
that could crimp the bottom line 
higher prices and the potential for higher taxes will all work 
on demand said bear stearns amp co analyst stephen smith 
but the oil giants should be able to navigate around most of 
these pitfalls analysts say 
replacing crude supplies lost from iraq and kuwait should not be 
a problem said barry sahgal an analyst at the new york brokerage 
ladenburg thalmann amp co inc 
they are so flexible that they can move from one crude source 
to another he said 
in addition analysts say the major oil companies will benefit 
from the rise in crude prices even if they cant pass along all of 
the costs to customers accounting practices allow them to book a 
profit when their production subsidiaries sell the crude at the 
newly higher prices to their refining units 
companies selfsufficient in crude production such as arco 
should particularly benefit smith said while those that have to 
purchase supplies on the world market will benefit less 
knuettel said he believes oil company profits will grow this 
year even if rising prices crimp demand for gasoline and other 
refined products but he is less bullish about buying oil stocks 
than some analysts 
knuettel advises investors holding stock in major integrated oil 
companies to stand pat if the shares are considered a longterm 
investment but if the shares are held in a trading account 
investors should consider selling them to take a profit on days 
when the stock prices are up he said 
the excitement of the moment has caused oil shares to reach 
excessive prices near term he wrote in a recent analysis 
in fact prices of many of the major oil company stocks hit 
52week highs in the days after iraqs invasion of kuwait since 
then they have moderated somewhat 
there was panic buying in the issues said sahgal on the 
belief that the stocks would benefit from the rise in oil prices 
and offer an inflation hedge 
bear stearns said in a report last week that even if oil prices 
average in the low 20 range for the rest of the year energy 
company stocks including gas and coal concerns are not trading at 
prices that reflect their true value the brokerage recommended 
these stocks be purchased aggressively

brazilian television which was 
pretty steamy already is filling prime time with nudity and 
semiexplicit sex in a network ratings battle 
viewers have been favored with such wonders as an allnude rock 
band and a nearcomplete striptease 
what many call the tv sex war has inspired heated debate of 
electronic eroticism and how much is too much 
the pornographic use of nudity is indecent but nudity in 
itself is innocent said darcy ribeiro anthropologist and former 
education minister the ancient greeks performed acts far more 
indecent than anything seen on local tv 
it all started in april when manchete tv brazils thirdlargest 
network launched the primetime soap opera pantanal about a 
wealthy ranching family in the vast pantanal wetlands of central 
brazil 
manchete had an instant smash for the first time its ratings 
surpassed those of globo tv the leading network and the worlds 
fourthlargest after abc cbs and nbc of the united states 
pantanal broadcast six nights a week and scheduled to run 
through december has an excellent cast and features breathtaking 
views of the wetlands 
was it the scenery that attracted huge audiences and started the 
whole country talking not a chance it was nearexplicit love 
scenes the penchant of female stars for bathing in the river the 
total frontal nude of an underwater swimmer in the opening credits 
as manchete celebrated its success globo counterattacked with a 
week of steamy uncut movies running opposite the soap opera 
globo also unveiled literally popular star claudia raia during 
a beach scene in its own primetime soap opera queen of the junk 
yard which runs just before pantanal 
other networks joined in 
silvio santos owner of sbt the secondlargest broadcast a 
series of literary adaptions as an alternative to the racy fare of 
other channels and said later we had the worst audience ratings 
in the nine years of sbt 
a university of sao paulo survey in late june counted 1145 
displays of nudity and 276 scenes of explicit or implict sex in one 
week of television 
some viewers are outraged 
we are not voyeurs we are normal people ana conceicao of 
rio wrote to a major newspaper the scenes being shown are so raw 
that explicit sex will soon be broadcast into our homes 
romeu trussardi filho head of the commercial association of sao 
paulo accused the networks of opportunism to generate higher 
ratings and greater profit opportunities 
justice minister bernardo cabral has scheduled a meeting in 
early september with station owners writers soap opera stars and 
religious officials to discuss creation of a television code of 
ethics 
most brazilians seem to like the spice 
a survey by the newspaper folha de sao paulo found 83 percent of 
those questioned felt comfortable with the nude scenes in 
pantanal 13 percent were embarrassed when watching with 
others and 4 percent were embarrassed when watching alone 
most said they wanted as many or more nude scenes 
the public likes the sex and nudity said marta suplicy a 
psychoanalyst and author of several books on sex and culture 
most people have boring lives and enjoy watching others have a 
good time 
brazilians are used to exposed bodies in minuscule tanga 
bikinis on the beaches or at the wild carnival holiday before lent 
but eroticism on television was limited until a new constitution 
abolished all censorship in 1988 
coverage of carnival heated up immediately and the justice 
ministry asked networks to exercise restraint in live broadcasts of 
seminude samba dancers at private clubs 
rosemarie muraro a prominent writer and feminist said 
television merely reflects the way most brazilians view sex and 
sexuality 
people here are much more comfortable with their bodies than 
in anglosaxon countries she said no one even notices the 
skimpy bikinis on copacabana beach 
she advocated more male nudity most of the bare scenes on 
television feature women 
ms muraro said her one concern about sex on television was that 
it might increase the rate of teen pregnancy 
mrs suplicy the psychoanalyst said gratuitous sex scenes 
reaffirm a macho culture and sexist stereotypes and could harm 
younger viewers 
no country in the world exposes its children to the same level 
of eroticism on television as brazil she said sevenyearold 
girls think about nothing but romance and seducing boys 
the ratings battle like the debate rages on 
in late july globo presented skid row a mystery with the 
fully exposed form of actressmodel silvia pfeifer as its main 
attraction 
manchete struck back with the song of the mermaids a 
nearplotless revelation of the bare breasts of three other 
actressmodels 
critics panned mermaids including one who said if the 
show is any guide homers ulysses did not plug the ears of his 
brave sailors to protect them from the mermaids enchanting song 
it was to spare them from the stupidities they spouted 
the public felt otherwise mermaids crushed skid row in 
viewer polls

the cost of living rose 04 percent in july 
the government said in a report showing persistent inflation even 
before the iraqi invasion of kuwait sent oil prices soaring 
the advance thursday in the labor departments consumer price 
index was slightly higher than most economists had expected it 
came despite a 07 percent decline in energy costs sure to be more 
than reversed when august prices are reported next month 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices jumped a 
worrisome 06 percent analysts view this socalled core rate

many executives are trying to keep a stiff upper 
lip when it comes to how the recent spike in oil prices will affect 
corporate profits in the final months of 1990 
but analysts say theres virtually no industry that will escape 
unscathed even if the middle east crisis is resolved soon and it 
appears increasingly less likely that the final quarter will 
salvage a year of relatively lackluster returns 
everybody is going to be hurt by this said robert brusca

wouldnt think this is the kind of thing you can diversify 
against 
the jump in oil prices is seen as raising costs of production 
materials and shipping for everyone from farmers to industrialists 
statistics indicate the economy already was in a slowdown before 
the oil shock and the outlook now might include a fullfledged 
recession 
still many companies are maintaining their outward composure 
they say that although theyre monitoring the situation its still 
pretty much business as usual 
were concerned about the macro question of peace in our time 
but i dont know if the gulf crisis will have a bearing on the 
fourth quarter said barbara lucas a vice president of 
towsend mdbased black amp decker corp 
union carbide corp has seen no major effect on our operating 
or production costs and has made no major changes in its 
strategic plans spokesman thomas sprick said from company 
headquarters in danbury conn 
both he and lucas suggested their companies may be somewhat 
insulated from higher prices because they have longterm contracts 
for raw materials 
but contracts do get renegotiated or even broken the legal 
fees associated with breaking a contract might be cheaper than 
supplying somebody with cheap energy said john silvia an 
economist and vice president at kemper financial services in 
chicago 
silvia has revised his profit projections in light of the oil 
crisis hes predicting corporate profits will total 306 billion 
in the quarter ending sept 30 down from an earlier estimate of 
around 320 billion and for the final quarter of the year he 
expects profits to show an 18 percent decline from the yearago 
period 
there will be different degrees of impact but i dont think 
anybody is going to walk away from it and say theyre not 
affected silvia said 
companies taking the hit initially are airlines transportation 
companies and consumer durables manufacturers but that will filter 
down to most other industries over time he said 
the most serious overall issue has to be consumer 
confidence silvia said given the weakness in demand 
manufacturers may have a hard time passing on price increases to 
compensate for their higher costs 
the middle east crisis adds another layer to the problems 
firms are facing nikkos brusca said theyre cutting back 
capital spending inventories have been cut down and order 
backlogs have been falling for some time all indications that 
corporate projections are less than optimistic 
many observers were hoping the final quarter would provide 
businesses with a shot in the arm similar to the last three months 
of 1989 when aftertax profits rose 28 percent after falling in 
each of the previous three quarters retailers in particular are 
especially vulnerable in the final quarter when they typically 
rack up most of their earnings during the holiday shopping period 
this year things started modestly the commerce department said 
aftertax profits rose 11 percent in the first quarter results 
for the second quarter are scheduled to be released aug 24 
but executives are not interested in looking backwards 
if we have an interruption of supply higher oil prices and a 
reallocation of resources it would be difficult to see how we 
would escape that said leonard hadley executive vice president 
and chief operating officer of maytag corp based in newton iowa

the gold cordoba nicaraguas new 
money has stumbled out of the starting gate despite an aggressive 
campaign by the government to bolster confidence in the currency 
nicaraguans seem wary of the gold cordoba which went into 
circulation on monday and with the old cordobas still circulating 
confusion mingles with the uncertainty 
the old cordoba was devalued thursday the 31st time since 
president violeta barrios de chamorro took office april 25 trading 
at 750000 to the dollar from the previous rate of 690000 it was 
bringing up to 800000 to the dollar on managuas flourishing and 
illegal black market 
francisco mayorga the head of nicaraguas central bank said 
the gold cordobas will be backed by dollars and will be exchanged 
on par with the dollar 
mayorga said tying the new currency to the dollar is intended to 
end the string of devaluations and bring some stability to the 
economy 
the government said the devaluations of the old cordoba will 
continue until it is entirely replaced by the new money possibly 
by the end of the year 
on monday 45 million of the new cordobas went into 
circulation representing about 10 percent of the value of the 
money in the country 
state workers received up to 50 gold cordobas as a part of their 
salaries and got the rest in old cordobas 
but the lowest gold cordoba denomination is 5 cordobas equal to 
five dollars a large sum in one of the hemispheres poorest 
countries 
bills of one gold cordoba and less are to begin circulating in 
october but for now nicaraguans spending gold cordobas have to 
take change in the old money at the official rate 
thousands of government employees meanwhile headed to black 
market moneychangers to try to swap the new money for dollars in 
case the new money became devalued but the black marketeers known 
locally as coyotes werent interested 
the gold cordoba cannot be on par with the dollar said one 
the dollar is the world currency and even in underdeveloped 
countries with stable economies the money is not on par with the 
dollar 
the central bank also refused to change the new cordobas for 
dollars saying such a run would deplete its supply 
nicaragua is swimming in virtually worthless cordobas in their 
last year in office the leftist sandinista government stopped 
devaluing them leaving the currency extremely overvalued 
mrs chamorros government began a series of devaluations that 
sent prices for basics soaring leading to two damaging general 
strikes mostly by sandinistaled unions

an increase in the world supply of crude oil 
will not necessarily translate into plenty of gasoline for the 
united states according to oil industry sources who warned that 
higher prices might persist 
even though oilproducing nations could probably boost their 
output by up to 35 million barrels per day making up for most of 
the 4 million barrels kept off the market by the boycott of iraq 
and kuwait there could be problems in getting the crude refined to 
meet us standards the sources said 
additional production might be the wrong kind of crude or it 
could come from libya and iran which the united states will not do 
business with several executives of a major oil company told 
reporters in a meeting thursday 
the executives who spoke on condition that neither they nor 
their company be identified said refineries that could increase 
output in several foreign countries are also unable to make oil 
products that meet stringent us environmental standards such as 
unleaded gasoline 
there are certain crudes and certain products and certain 
suppliers you cant turn to one of the executives said 
the stuff thats idle today does not serve the purposes of the 
us said another executive 
a spokesman for the american petroleum institute the industrys 
main trade group said refineries generally are geared to take a 
certain type of oil and they try to get that oil theres great 
variation among crudes and refineries he said 
world oil markets have been in a state of chaos with prices 
steadily on the rise after iraq invaded neighboring kuwait on aug 
2 and an international boycott of the oil from both nations was put 
in place 
the oil executives said three modern sophisticated refineries 
in kuwait have been knocked out of the world market because of the 
boycott those refineries had a capacity of about 600000 barrels 
of refined oil per day some of which was arriving in the southern 
united states through the gulf of mexico the executives said 
the executives predicted that opec nations will not immediately 
increase production to make up for the iraqkuwait shortfall until 
they allow time for oil inventories to drop 
crude oil futures traded higher thursday as investors remained 
uncertain about what might happen in the middle east on the new 
york mercantile exchange the september contract for west texas 
intermediate rose 90 cents to 2736 a barrel 
retail gasoline prices shot up after the invasion and remain 
well above their levels of a month ago unleaded selfservice 
gasoline averaged 1216 a gallon nationally on monday compared 
with 1075 a gallon on aug 1 according to a spot check of 1400 
service stations by the american automobile association 
one of the oil executives called the current situation a 
longterm problem he predicted the price of crude would stay 
high as will the price of gasoline in coming months 
dozens of us refineries have closed in recent years when oil 
prices declined it would take a continued higher margin of profit 
on gasoline prices before oil companies build new refineries or 
increase the capacity of existing refineries he said

two oil companies that had frozen wholesale fuel 
prices as consumers cried foul over steep increases at the pump 
lifted the moratoriums citing competitive pressure 
spokesmen for the amoco corp and unocal corp declined to say 
whether the oneweek price freezes caused losses amoco and unocal 
said they would monitor prices daily and that increases were 
possible 
president bush in a televised address last week called on the 
nations oil companies to hold down pump prices and not take 
advantage of market jitters and rising crude oil prices following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
amoco and unocal were among several big oil companies to freeze 
or lower wholesale prices the reductions did not directly affect 
prices at retail gas stations which by federal law set their own 
prices 
there remains a lot of upward pressure amoco spokesman 
michael thompson said thursday well be watching the marketplace 
in the days to come and well see what happens 
amoco had frozen prices on gasoline jet fuel and distillates 
thompson said the company based in chicago did not change prices 
thursday it charges wholesalers 
unocal based in los angeles had frozen only wholesale gasoline 
prices it was to lift the freeze at 3 am edt today 
its a daily review and hourly review depending on how the 
market moves unocal spokesman jim bray said we made a 
marketing decision several of the other majors have gone up 
recently 
on wednesday atlantic richfield co extended a freeze on 
gasoline jet and diesel fuel prices but said it would review it 
on a daily basis 
arco which sells gasoline at 1500 stations in five western 
states was the first oil company to announce a freeze after pump 
prices increased sharply following iraqs invasion 
but there was no indication that the freezes were anything more 
than cosmetic as crude oil prices have risen only slightly in the 
interim on thursday crude oil gained 90 cents to 2736 per 
42gallon barrel compared with about 26 a barrel a week earlier 
retail gasoline prices shot up 16 cents a gallon on average 
after the invasion but apparently have stabilized at the higher 
levels unleaded selfservice gasoline averaged 1216 a gallon 
nationally on monday compared with 1075 a gallon on aug 1 
according to a spot check by the american automobile association 
phillips petroleum co which cut its wholesale gasoline price 
by 45 cents a gallon on aug 8 said thursday it has increased the 
price by 18 cents since then 
british petroleum cos us unit which last friday said it 
would hold its pump prices steady and later lowered them by about 3 
cents a gallon in most markets said its prices were about the same

while soldiers stand guard in the deserts 
of saudi arabia some oklahomans are busy at sewing machines and 
cutting tables to prepare equipment that may be needed on the front 
lines 
sac and fox industries has a 30 million contract with the 
department of defense to produce nearly 500000 chemical warfare 
suits protective garments that would be needed if iraqi president 
saddam hussein uses his stockpiles of poison gas 
the company owned by the sac and fox indian tribe is planning to 
almost double its work force and reopen a clothing factory in 
temple some say that may help some oklahoma towns bounce back from 
recent pullouts and cutbacks by major employers 
sac and fox employs 550 people at plants in commerce cushing 
and idabel the increase in production including eventual 
operations at temple could raise the employee total to more than 
1000 said sac and fox industries president james brannum 
he said the increase is dependent on the company getting more of 
the type of fabric it uses which he said is in big demand 
for now 19 workers from temple the southwestern oklahoma town 
where haggar clothing shut down a factory in february are 
commuting 220 miles to idabel in the states southeastern corner 
where they stay during the week at a hotel the company has leased 
said office manager mary chambers 
theyre patriotic brannum said theyre not just doing it 
for the town or oklahoma theyre wanting to do what is right for 
the country in a time of crisis 
people are also eager for work in addition to the haggar 
shutdown in temple idabel has been hit by defense department cuts 
at the red river army depot in northeast texas 
while it is possible that sac and fox wont be able to hire all 
of the 270 workers laid off when haggar left temple mayor jack 
kindred said any opportunities are encouraging 
sac and fox industries has already signed a lease on the former 
haggar plant kindred said 
the communitys economy sagged when haggar left kindred said 
we had about five little towns that we drew into temple he 
said 
you used to drive through downtown and both sides of the 
street would be lined with cars said glen good manager of 
warehouse discount food weve got a dress shop thats barely 
hanging on even our car license tag agent is hurting 
if sac and fox can put nearly as many people back to work than 
were here before thats good 
in idabel the impact may not be as noticeable the mccurtain 
county seat was projected to grow even before the sac and fox 
expansion said bruce willingham a sac and fox industries director 
theres been a gradual increase in employment willingham 
said 
the situation in the middle east has brought home to the 
workers how pivotal their jobs are 
he said it takes between 30 to 60 days to complete a suit with 
a good piece of that time spent on detailed inspection process 
about 10000 suits are near completion and 60000 total are under 
way on tuesday 3200 suits were shipped plant officials said 
ms chambers said when the current contract is complete the 
government has the option to order additional suits the 
2500member tribe expects there will be a market for the suits for 
some time she said

clothing colors and table manners can make or 
break business executives image consultants said here at their 
annual trade show 
we have been programmed by television to deliver a message in 
30 seconds said marily mondejar founder and executive director 
of image industry council international a trade organization for 
consultants who teach businesses how to polish their images 
in the first five seconds of meeting a person that person 
will make a decision about you based on maybe the colors youre 
wearing your jewelry your hair how youre moving that is what 
image is all about she said thursday at the san franciscobased 
groups third annual meeting 
image is about bringing the best in you so that people 
will listen to what you have to say ms mondejar said 
wearing appropriatecolored clothing is one way executives can 
create an image to achieve their goals she told about two dozen 
executives at a seminar titled corporate savvy 
for example darker colors convey a sense of authority while 
lighter ones indicate friendliness a businessman seeking to 
consummate a deal might want to convey both traits by wearing a 
dark suit with a lightcolored necktie she said 
table manners also can be a winning tool for executives 
according to ms mondejar who said 70 percent of all business 
deals are closed during a meal 
to project a polished professional image executives should 
know the proper way to butter their bread said mj cross an 
image consultant from munster ind 
to butter a bread roll take a bitesized pinch butter that 
bite and put it in your mouth rather than chomping into a large 
piece of buttered bread she advised as the executives prepared to 
launch into a fivecourse demonstration meal at a posh downtown 
restaurant 
otherwise you have a great tendency to leave a buttery 
moustache if you happen to have facial hair ms cross said 
color analysis is another way to assess peoples personalities 
and help businesses succeed ms mondejar said 
the theory groups people into categories based on the four 
seasons depending on the color of their eyes hair and complexion 
an emerging branch of color analysis attaches personality traits to 
each season ms mondejar said in an interview during the 
conference 
for example darkfeatured people are winters while those 
with lighter eyes and complexions are summers she said 
winters tend to be bossy and powerhungry while summers 
are more compromising and harmonious ms mondejar said 
executives can use the theory to assess their competitors and 
also determine what clothing colors can help them project the most 
complimentary professional image she said 
joan c levalley president of a suburban chicago accounting 
firm was among the 150 or so executives who sought 
businessboosting tips at the fourday conference 
ms levalley said she has used a color consultant to improve her 
own appearance and has decorated her office in earth tones to 
project a warm comfortable image for clients 
business are learning that if we dont project ourselves in 
the professional status we are were going to fail because 
somebody else is going to do it better said ms levalley

exxon corp is fighting a 65 billion tax claim 
brought by the irs and the oil giant predicted it will chip away 
most of the governments case before going to trial next year 
this case when it gets to court is not going to be a 65 
billion case exxon tax lawyer william d obrien said thursday 
after filing a petition against the internal revenue service in 
us tax court in washington 
exxon chairman lawrence g rawl called the attempt by the 
government to collect almost three times the 25 billion that 
exxon has already paid in federal income tax for 198082 totally 
unwarranted 
after exxon announced its filing late thursday an irs spokesman 
in washington said no tax officials were immediately available to 
discuss the governments position in the decadeold dispute 
according to exxon the governments tax claim hinges on 
allegations that the oil giant avoided taxes by charging too little 
for oil it purchased from saudi arabia 
the irs completely ignores that saudi arabias policy of price 
moderation in the late 1970s and early 1980s required exxon to buy 
and sell saudi crude oil at the same prices established by the 
saudi arabian government obrien said at the time saudi arabia 
was trying to keep the price of oil under control by selling crude 
cheaply in the wake of the iranian revolution 
at the time the us government was also encouraging moderation 
in oil prices obrien said exxon finds it ironic that the 
government now has flipflopped during the latest oil crisis and 
started saying exxon should have charged more for its oil 10 years 
ago obrien said 
since exxons income tax filing is so complicated the company 
had waived the normal statute of limitations to give the irs plenty 
of time to complete its audits earlier this year exxon demanded 
that the irs move ahead on the matter giving the tax collectors 
little choice but to file a claim against the company obrien said 
exxon decided to force the irs hand because lawyers did not 
want to wait on the outcome of a similar fight between the 
government and texaco he said 
the governments contention that exxon did not charge enough for 
its oil much of which was distributed to the companys overseas 
subsidiaries involves 15 billion of the irs claim obrien 
described the other elements of the dispute as plainvanillatype 
items that ordinarily are in an oil companys tax return 
they include such items as deductions for drilling costs he 
said 
since exxon pushed the government into making its claim the irs 
employed a shotgun approach because it did not have time to 
thoroughly explore each item obrien predicted that negotiations 
between the two sides will result in many of the irs contentions 
being dropped 
should exxon end up paying more taxes the company has enough 
reserves on hand to avoid any effect on earnings obrien said he 
expects the case to go to trial before tax court judge meade 
whitaker sometime in 1991

the ameritrust corp plans to cut about 11 
percent of its staff as part of a plan to reduce costs by 60 
million by the end of 1992 
about 40 percent of the 780 positions are being cut through 
attrition said howard glassroth ameritrusts vice president for 
corporate affairs 
the action is a response to the changing marketplace and the 
economy glassroth said thursday 
this is fairly typical of whats going on in the banking 
industry right now he said 
ameritrust reported losses of 332 million for the first half 
of this year 
jerry jarrett ameritrusts chairman and chief executive 
officer said the bank will provide comprehensive severance 
options and career transition programs for employees who are 
losing their jobs 
glassroth said he didnt know who would lose jobs or when the 
cuts would occur the company employs about 6800 people nationwide 
the program is expected to last 12 to 16 months but many of the 
cuts will occur this year 
bank employees will start learning monday whether they will stay 
or go 
ameritrust said the costcutting program would not change its 
plans to move into new headquarters in 1993 nor does the company 
plan to close any bank branches 
the company lost 516 million in the first quarter of this year 
after a regulatory exam led to a special 120 million addition to 
its reserve against possible loan losses 
daniel martin analyst at standard amp poors corp criticized 
ameritrust for not being careful enough in the standards it used to 
evaluate highly leveraged transactions 
growth has taken place apparently without the attention to 
underwriting standards that should have been in place to avoid 
affecting asset quality down the road he said 
he said the rating on some ameritrust bonds had slipped in 
recent years largely because of increased riskiness in its loan 
portfolio 
martin and other analysts praised the decision to cut costs 
saying it reflects increased competitive pressures in the banking 
industry 
i think its tough for the people who are losing jobs but i 
think its a positive move for the company said tom brown an 
analyst with paine webber he said many banks have begun trimming 
personnel branch and administrative expenses to make up for 
sluggish loan growth caused by a slowing economy

resorts international moved closer to 
emerging from bankruptcy proceedings early today when a judge 
approved a restructuring plan that would allow entertainer merv 
griffins casino company to shed some of its massive debt 
shortly after midnight us bankruptcy judge rosemary 
gambardella approved a plan to give bondholders 78 percent of the 
company dropping griffins stake to 215 percent said resorts 
attorney stephen kaplan

bankruptcy code and amended in april to include the proposed sale 
of resorts paradise island operations in the bahamas 
resorts would exchange the 911 million in debt held by 
bondholders for new notes totaling 434 million eliminating more 
than half of the casino companys debt 
the plan had been overwhelmingly approved by bondholders but 
must still be approved by the state casino control commission and 
the bahamian government 
last week the commission approved resorts preliminary draft 
documents concerning ownership restructuring the transfer of 
securities the shift of resorts to a publicly traded company and 
resorts president david hanlons employment contract 
the panel which declined to rule on the plan until ms 
gambardella released her decision is scheduled to consider the 
matter today 
the commission also will consider part of the plan that sets 
aside a 5 million legal kitty to allow resorts bondholders to sue 
donald trump resorts former owner bondholders claim trump left 
the company insolvent in a 1988 swap with griffin in which trump 
got the unfinished taj mahal casino resort next door 
trump has said griffin is responsible for weighing the company 
down with too much debt

once the bond market brushes the desert sand 
from a pile of government reports that show a weakening economy 
fixedincome securities could be poised for a rally 
the government reports of economic output leading indicators 
and unemployment traditionally dominate the markets activity 
but since iraqi troops invaded kuwait and american forces were 
dispatched to saudi arabia news on the persian gulf crisis has 
been holding traders attention 
really the street is preoccupied with mideast news rather than 
any government reports said james marshall a government 
securities trader at clayton brown amp associates in chicago 
rather than climbing on the signs of a weakening economy the 
market has been swayed in its daily ups and downs by the latest 
pronouncements from baghdad or washington 
most of the movement has been down the yield of the treasurys 
30year benchmark bond which rises when the bond price falls has 
climbed from 845 percent shortly before iraq invaded kuwait to 
flirting with 9 percent late last week 
what weve been saying in general is the economic statistics 
will take a back seat in general to whatever is going on in the 
middle east said kathleen camilli chief economist at ramirez 
capital consultants in new york 
investors are looking for signals of whether the persian gulf 
crisis is headed for a resolution and how oil prices could be 
affected ultimately theyre trying to get an idea of what is going 
to happen to inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome 
securities 
investors concerned about inflation have shied away from 
committing themselves 
thursdays report that the consumer price index rose 04 percent 
in july was slightly more than what economists had expected and 
made many doubtful the fed would try to lower interest rates before 
the persian gulf crisis settles down or there is more evidence the 
economy is sagging 
many are confident the fed will have to lower interest rates to 
stimulate growth eventually the government also reported thursday 
that that housing starts had fallen for the sixth straight month in 
july to their lowest level since the last recession 
once bad news on the crisis slows or oil prices come down 
investors are likely to rediscover the economys weakness said 
irwin kellner chief economist at manufacturers hanover trust co 
economists say several reports from the government show the 
economy is in trouble 
julys unemployement rate reached its highest mark in nearly two 
years at 55 percent housing starts fell 26 percent in july the 
gross national product showed a modest 12 percent increase in the 
second quarter economists point to a drop in total sales combined 
with a buildup in inventories as signaling an economic downturn 
the federal reserves own beige book a survey of the 12 fed 
districts reported the pace of economic growth was slowing 
if we get back to normal over there and oil prices show some 
weakening the market will be in real good shape marshall said 
more statistics highlighting the economys ill health could also

the us trade deficit dropped to a sevenyear 
low of 507 billion in june the government said today but 
analysts expect it to resume acceleration once the impact of the 
middle east crisis takes effect on the price of oil imports 
the commerce department said the june deficit was down 347 
percent from the 777 billion imbalance posted in may it was the 
lowest deficit since 396 billion in june 1983 
until recently many economists and government officials 
including commerce secretary robert mosbacher were predicting that 
strong export growth would offset a growing dependence on foreign 
oil and result in the first us deficit below 100 billion since 
1983 
in fact the deficit for the first half of 1990 had been running 
at an annual rate of 9162 billion 
mosbacher welcomed todays news saying that while 
monthtomonth figures can be erratic the strong positive trend 
indicates increasing us export competitiveness in the world 
marketplace 
but some analysts question the effect of the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait and the subsequent rise in oil prices on later trade reports 
this month some say deficits could grow even larger once the 
higher oil prices are added to the import bill starting in august 
the stock market largely ignored the news and appeared to be 
concentrating on thursdays report on inflation and the mideast 
itself the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 3342 
points to 264802 by late morning 
the deficit improvement in june came from a 29 percent decrease 
in imports to 3937 billion and a 46 percent gain in exports to 
a record 343 billion the trade deficit is the difference between 
imports and exports 
a commerce spokesman said 500 million in airplane shipments 
contributed to the record exports 
it was the first time this year the deficit had dropped below 7 
billion it averaged 764 billion a month so far in 1990 compared 
to 912 billion in 1989 
but higher oil import costs now threaten to add even more than 
expected to the us import bill at the same time overseas 
economies have slowed lessening demand there for us goods 
so you have a combination of slower export growth and a higher 
oil import bill explained mark m zandi an economist with 
regional financial associates in bala cynwyd pa 
those two things are going to serve to limit any possibility 
of a significant improvement in the merchandise trade deficit over 
the next six months to a year he said 
oil imports in june fell 146 percent to 369 billion 
americans imported 840 million barrels a day down from 895 
billion in may the average price per barrel fell to 1464 down 
from 1557 
however in an ominous portent for trade reports this fall 
prices of the benchmark west texas crude had risen to 2736 by 
thursday 
in addition to aircraft other capital goods foods and 
consumer goods added to the export total 
on the import side there were declines in industrial supplies 
consumer goods and automobiles 
as usual the biggest deficit was with japan a 31 billion 
imbalance up from a 30 billion deficit in may 
the united states posted a surplus with western europe of 899 
million 
other deficits included taiwan 900 million china 800 
million canada 700 million brazil 300 million korea 200 
million and hong kong 100 million 
the deficit peaked at 15212 billion in 1987 and then dropped 
to 11853 billion the following year the 1989 deficit slid 
further to 109 billion 
a further improvement this year would have been good news for 
the bush administration which had counted on a strong trade 
performance to help keep the economy out of a recession and help 
reduce the federal budget deficit 
over the past three years fully onethird of overall us 
economic growth has been supplied by surging export sales that has 
become even more important recently as consumer spending has faded 
in the face of adverse economic news 
zandi noted that until the middle east developments the united 
states foreign oil bill totaled about 100 billion a year prices 
have soared since the invasion 
so if it remains at current levels it could add between 10 
billion and 15 billion over the coming year to our oil import 
bill he said 
at the same time evidence points to weaker exports because of 
slower economic growth particularly in japan and the pacific rim 
nations and to a lesser extent in western europe zandi said 
our forecast is for real export growth to slow to about 5 
percent over the next year from about 17 percent now he said 
zandi also had a scenario that would dramatically improve the 
deficit but one which few want to see 
if the economy slides into a significant recession where we 
see consumers and businesses retrenching that would cause the 
deficit to improve soley because imports would collapse he 
explained

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade as 
concern about slack export demand replaced talk of possible frost 
in the northern corn belt 
few traders took thursdays frost forecast by one private

research department inc in chicago 
thats absurd he said of the prediction for freezing 
temperatures monday night as a matter of fact were probably 
going to have a warmer weekend this weekend than weve had for a 
while 
karlin attributed further selling to expectations that export 
demand for us feed grains is likely to remain weak especially 
if the persian gulf conflict tips the worlds major economies into 
recession

with the contract for delivery in september at 281 a bushel

there are 12 days of christmas but 12 
months of shopping for it 
on a recent summer morning the sleighs outside the christmas 
house here looked misplaced on a lush lawn but inside cheerily 
making their way among the nutcrackers and garlands were plenty of 
customers 
i come in here and i just think oh its time to start 
buying marcia mulholland 50 said over the strains of 
christmas tunes 
mulholland isnt alone christmas enthusiasts spread enough 
cheer to keep hundreds of similar stores open yearround throughout 
the country from nome to new orleans 
there is no question in my mind that people are spending more 
on christmas than they used to said barry vaill who owns the 
45000squarefoot store in rural rhode island christmas is in 
renaissance 
his sales exceeded 1 million last year but he said pointing 
to 50 carefully trimmed trees first and foremost im in the 
entertainment business if they buy something fine 
last spring vaill and 20 other stores formed the national 
independent christmas shops an association to share ideas offer 
support and guard the christmas image against cutrate discounters 
that use the christmas name to sell everything from furniture to 
flower pots 
vaill the association president said most yearround christmas 
store owners are drawn to the business by a love of the holiday 
still he estimated about 25 percent are trying to capitalize on a 
lucrative niche 
but the christmas business isnt all merry and it takes a 
certain faith to survive 
i dont think you realize what the first quarter is like until 
youve been through it said association membership chairwoman 
gayle boutin owner of the christmas house of stone mountain ga 
she said sales in january and february can drop to 10 percent of 
december levels 
vaill helps keep more than coal in his summer stocking by 
selling decorations for every holiday st patricks day trees 
uncle sam nutcrackers halloween garlands and thanksgiving dolls 
boutin who had sales of 250000 in her 1000squarefoot shop 
last year relies on tourists for much of her trade as do many 
others who locate their stores in historic buildings from an adobe 
in el paso texas to san franciscos fishermans wharf 
everybody in every market does it differently said vaill 
but they all claim to be doing well 
theyre all up 20 percent to 25 percent this year and this is 
not a good year for retail sales so tell me what that means he 
said 
he and boutin agree an increased interest in collectables has 
helped stimulate the industry 
annalee dolls started 30 years ago as a womans hobby and last 
year employed 450 people to make more than 700000 felt dolls said 
sam vachon executive marketing director of the meredith nh 
company 
he said about 15 percent or 105000 dolls go to yearround 
christmas stores five years ago it was maybe 5 percent he 
said 
every year there are more and more stores carrying christmas 
yearround he said 
annalee makes dolls for other holidays but about threequarters 
are related to christmas he said the reindeer santas and such 
stand from 3 to 30 inches and retail for 12 to 340 
people have really started decorating for christmas he 
said i think its a feelgood thing it makes them feel good 
james heintze of derwood md who is writing a guide to 
yearround christmas shops has identified 150 nationwide 
annalees vachon however said he thought there are hundreds tiny 
rhode island boasts at least six 
heintze 47 a professor of american studies at american 
university in washington said he hasnt figured out yet why people 
shop at christmas stores offseason he only knows that they do 
he theorized that since many families get together only for 
christmas shopping for the holiday is a reminder of that 
mulholland of cranston had her mother and daughter in tow at the 
christmas house 
kim mulholland 26 settled on a buyers choice scrooge caroler 
that she put on layaway 
another customer mary bentson 55 of dallas had her sights 
set on something less expensive than the 30 to 40 dolls 
i told my sister when i came to rhode island i wanted to 
come buy some little tree ornaments she said 
her brotherinlaw mike decarlo 62 of providence had no 
qualms about shopping for christmas during new englands dog day 
summer 
there are no crowds you get the pick of the place this is 
the best time to come he said you come here in the winter and 
you cant get in the place 
end adv for monday aug 20

sears roebuck and co plans to eliminate 
thousands of jobs in coming months to help cut costs and improve 
profits a newspaper reported friday sears would not confirm the 
report 
the move involving administrative and retail employees is 
expected to result in annual savings of more than 100 million

it cited an unidentified person familiar with the plan 
the newspaper said the cuts are part of sears chairman edward a 
brennans strategy to revive the companys weak retailing business

nonselling positions at the retailers 850 us stores

the us dollar fell broadly friday in europe 
posting an alltime low against the german mark as worries over 
fundamental weakness in the us economy gripped the market 
gold rose in steady trading 
the dollar fell to 15485 german marks in frankfurt from 15630 
marks late thursday it was the lowest close in europe in the

the dollars latest decline came despite the governments report 
of an unexpectedly small us trade deficit for june of 507

dealers said pessimism over the condition of the us economy 
had eclipsed any bullishness in the dollar 
the overall opinion is that the us economy is so bad the 
market doesnt really care if those figures are good or not the 
general idea is to sell the dollar a dealer in frankfurt said 
dealers said the dollar was also hurt by reported comments from 
west german central bank vice president helmut schlesinger in a 
newspaper interview published friday he said the us currencys 
decline fits the central banks strategy because it reduces west 
german import prices 
this was seen as an invitation to sell the dollar on the 
presumption that the influential west german central bank probably 
would not intervene to support it

activities or to offer benefits to employees that are effective

the company also will allow prounion employees the same 
privileges as antiunion workers in the matters of distributing 
handbills and posting fliers he said 
the settlement wipes the slate clean in terms of the unfair 
labor practice charges that have been filed by the union demarte 
said 
we felt it was more important to reach a settlement of the 
issues pending before the nlrb rather than continuing to debate the 
merits of the unions allegations he said 
but peterson said nordstrom wants the settlement so a new union 
decertification petition can be circulated adding that the process 
cannot begin while there are charges pending before the nlrb 
the union has five days to object after the settlement is 
signed said nlrb regional attorney walter mercer 
the union is in the process of filing new charges against the 
retailer peterson said adding that there will not be an 
election or decertification in the near future 
the new charges will involve alleged discrimination against 
union negotiators at a store south of seattle peterson said 
the union also plans appeals on four other charges the labor 
board ruled against he said 
the ufcw represents about 1500 of nordstroms seattlearea 
employees nordstrom employs about 30000 people nationwide 
in february the washington state department of labor and 
industries ruled that nordstrom had violated state law by failing 
to pay some employees for such activities as attending company 
meetings making deliveries and writing customer thankyou notes

chrysler corp which is trying to reduce its 
salaried work force as a costcutting move is offering nearly all 
of its 60000 or so unionized employees money to leave the company 
chrysler spokesman lee sechler said friday that 400 to 450 of 
the eligible workers had chosen the buyout so far another week is 
left for workers to sign up the last day of work for anyone

last october chrysler began a program to carve 1 billion from 
its 26 billion annual budget by the end of this year since then 
the target has risen to 15 billion 
included in the cuts were the early retirements of about 2500 
or more than 11 percent from chryslers salaried work force 
sechler declined to say how much chryslers voluntary 
termination of employment program for its unioncovered employees 
will cost he also declined to give the formula used to calculate 
the buyout amount but said it would be based heavily on the 
employees seniority with the company workers employed with 
chrysler for at least one year are eligible 
originally executives estimated that about 600 workers would 
sign up for the buyouts sechler said 
sechler said the program contained in the 1988 contract between 
chrysler and the united auto workers union was begun in late july 
or early august 
the uaw and each of the big three are involved in national 
contract negotiations the current agreements covering more than 
450000 workers expire sept 14

sweaters made of synthetic fibers in taiwan 
are being sold in the united states at less than fair market value 
the commerce department ruled friday 
the national knitwear amp spsortswear association in new york had 
filed complaints last september against sweater manufacturers in 
south korea hong kong and taiwan 
the department had ruled against the manufacturers in hong kong 
on july 21 and against those in south korea on aug 3 
the findings clear the way for the international trade 
commission to determine whether the products are harming us 
industry if the commission finds us firms are being damaged the 
government can impose duties on the imports to make their prices 
comparable to those of us companies 
the department said the imports represent 72 percent of the 13 
billion us market and the three countries represent 55 percent of 
the imports it said the value of the sweaters imported from south 
korea in 1989 was 4761 million from hong kong 2088 million 
and taiwan 4855 million

isnt that foster grant in bankruptcy court 
the company whose ads asking which star was behind its 
sunglasses produced sales and advertising prominence has sought 
chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
industry executives said foster grant corp foundered in the 
last decade after failing to capitalize on its catchy and 
successful print and television ads of the 1960s and 70s that 
asked isnt that behind those foster grants 
in papers filed thursday in us bankruptcy court in tuscon 
ariz it reported total assets of about 25 million and 
liabilities of about 36 million including nearly 193 million in 
unsecured debt 
foster grant founded in 1919 by sam foster was the first 
company to use abrasionresistant lens coatings that blocked the 
suns ultraviolet rays but is best known for its advertisements 
the first of 17 print ads debuted in 1965 and featured peter 
sellers behind a pair of foster grants other entertainment 
personalities including woody allen vanessa redgrave julie 
christie raquel welch and jane fonda appeared in the ads which 
ran until 1968 
a series of television ads followed and commercials later 
featured nonstars and asked isnt that you behind those foster 
grants 
despite the success of a campaign still remembered today foster 
grants recognizable name never really took them into the high 
level part of the market said mauri edwards foster grants vice 
president of marketing from 196473 
it came through the 70s in pretty good shape but the thing 
went downhill rapidly in the 80s said edwards who now manages 
public relations for the sunglass association of america 
he said foster grant began its downturn after the death in 1971 
of joe foster whose father in 1929 sold a 50 percent interest in 
what was then a small maker of sunglasses and combs to what is now 
goody products 
in 1975 foster grant with more than 300 million in sales of 
petrochemicals sunglasses and other products was sold to the us 
arm of the west german chemicals concern hoechst ag 
it then was acquired by the american unit of the french 
pharmaceutical and chemical company rousseluclaf sa the company 
sold its bulk plastic making operations in the 1970s 
in 1986 foster grant was acquired by andlinger amp co a private 
investment banking and management company 
foster grant vice president ed russell blamed the bankruptcy 
court filing on cash flow problems and low profit margins resulting 
from competition from asian imports 
the company had not been profitable in 1989 nor in the first 
half of 1990 he said adding that loss figures still were being 
compiled 
the company said it sold more than 50 million of sunglasses 
eyeglasses and related lens products in 1989 compared with with 
55 million in 1983 in the same period us retail sales of 
nonprescription sunglasses rose to 17 billion from 885 million 
according to industry figures 
foster grant which had as many as 2000 seasonal employees in 
the 1960s said it was laying off 345 of 475 employees at its main 
distribution center in tucson an assembly plant in nogales 
mexico and a plant in leominster mass for one week starting 
monday 
foster grant still is one of top names in the mass sunglass 
industry where glasses sell for under 10 optiray inc owned by 
goody products of kearny nj is considered the leader in that 
field along with bonneau of dallas 
the market for more expensive sunglasses is led by bausch amp lomb 
inc of rochester ny maker of the rayban line other popular 
brands include the french sunglasses vuarnet and bolle 
foster grants technical products division supplies products to 
the computer automotive sporting goods and electromechanical 
industries

fundamerica inc a buying club with 100000 
members filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors friday 
and asked the court to appoint an independent examiner to 
investigate various allegations against it 
the irvine califbased firm is facing scrutiny from regulators 
in florida and other states and is the subject of a 150 million 
classaction suit in san francisco 
its federal bankruptcy filing in santa ana which had been 
expected listed assets of 175 million and liabilities of 145 
million 
prompt and decisive action had to be taken to preserve 
fundamericas viability for its members and marketers said 
mitchell g blumberg its president and chief executive 
critics say fundamericas discounts on goods and services are 
available free through other channels or are subsidized by its 
membership fees in lawsuits they allege the companys true 
business is highpressure marketing of memberships in packages of 
40 at 80 apiece 
florida officials have charged fundamerica founder robert t 
edwards with fraud for allegedly bilking club members out of 82 
million in an illegal pyramid scheme 
fundamerica has not been convicted of any crimes 
the chapter 11 filing gives the company breathing room from 
creditors while it tries to sort out its problems blumberg a past 
associate of edwards in real estate said the filing would give 
fundamerica time to develop marketing plans acceptable to 
regulators 
he said he believed it would allow the company to automatically 
lift a freeze on assets that was reaffirmed wednesday by marilyn 
hall patel the federal judge in the classaction suit he said 
fundamerica would ask the bankruptcy judge to use company funds to 
meet its payroll 
blumberg said the company was reviewing the legal challenges 
against it and invited the bankruptcy court to appoint an 
independent examiner 
we are confident that we are delivering an honest and valuable 
product via an honest credible and reputable marketing 
organization he said in a statement

markets republic national bank in new york quoted an afterhours 
bid of 40850 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt down 50 cents from 
thursdays late bid

currency but the japanese yen in new york trading after falling 
broadly overseas 
the latest decline came despite the governments report of an 
unexpectedly small us trade deficit for june of 507 billion 
despite the improvement dealers said traders shunned the dollar 
because they feel the economy may be headed into a recession and 
that the federal reserve will have no choice but to encourage lower 
interest rates 
when us rates are falling relative to those in other 
countries the dollar is less appealing to foreign investors 
dollar traders are just not interested in the trade picture 
said walter simon a currency options trader at bank julius baer amp 
co they are interested in the whole weakening of the us 
economic climate 
he said the dollar finished above its lows because of some late 
dollarbuying by traders who were reluctant to leave themselves 
exposed over the weekend to the possibility that flareups in the 
persian gulf could push the dollar higher 
the united states seems to be taking a lot more aggressive 
posture toward iraq simon said 
but he said the dollar is demonstrating only limited appeal as a 
haven currency during this international conflict which began with 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
dealers in europe said the dollar was hurt by reported comments 
from west german central bank vice president helmut schlesinger he 
was quoted in a newspaper interview as saying the dollars decline 
fits the central banks strategy because it reduces west german 
import prices 
this was seen as an invitation to sell the dollar without the 
risk that the german central bank would move to brake its fall 
dealers said 
the dollar rose in new york against the japanese yen edging up 
to 14760 yen from 14725 yen late friday earlier the dollar fell 
055 japanese yen to 14735 yen on tokyo and was quoted at 14765

venezuela on friday continued trying 
to persuade a majority of opec nations to meet to discuss oil 
production increases in wake of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
energy and mines minister celestino armas said venezuela was 
lobbying hard to get at least seven of the 13 organization of 
petroleum exporting countries to the table in order to work out an 
agreement to cover at least part of iraq and kuwaits 46 million 
barrels per day of blocked supply 
armas sent a letter dated friday to opec president sadek 
boussena calling for the meeting to decide on production increases 
continuing interruption of energy could seriously damage the 
longterm prospects of the petroleum industry for the producers as 
well as the consumers said the letter which was also sent to 
opecs secretary general in jiddah saudi arabia informed oil 
industry sources reported that venezuela the united arab emirates 
qatar and kuwait were responsive to a saudi call for an emergency 
session 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be named said a 
meeting may be convened either monday or tuesday in geneva 
they said iraq libya and ecuador were opposed to the proposal 
while indonesia has suggested a consultation rather than an 
emergency ministerial session 
algeria nigeria gabon and iran have not yet taken a stand 
they said iran in the past has sought to maximize prices 
iraqs oil minister on friday lashed out at the proposal for an 
emergency meeting insisting that the shortfall was created by the 
saudi blocking of iraqi oil exports from its transsaudi oil 
pipeline 
the staterun iraqi news agency quoted minister issam alchalabi 
as describing the call for the session as an attempt to add 
legitimacy to the justification of overproduction in violation 
of an opec agreement reached july 28 in geneva 
it was not immediately clear whether a small group or the cartel 
ministers would meet separately should the rest refuse to attend 
the proposed emergency meeting 
in venezuela armas indicated an agreement with several other 
opec nations was possible if attempts at full consensus fail 
this would be a formula to explore he said 
nor did he rule out a production increase by venezuela alone 
well cross that bridge when we come to it he said 
armas emphasized that venezuela had responsibilities to its 
clients among them the united states which buys about half of 
venezuelas 194 million barrel daily output and has asked 
venezuela to produce another 500000 barrels 
venezuela is responding to its hemispheric responsibilities 
armas said we have a responsibility to countries who are our 
friends 
he admitted that venezuela initially increased production after 
the united states had asked for more oil then changed its mind and 
turned off the taps 
he said venezuela at first had thought it a good idea to 
increase its inventories but changed its mind after realizing that 
this action could be misinterpreted by the market as a plan to 
unilaterally sell more oil armas said 
among other opec members saudi arabia has the potential to 
produce an estimated 1 million to 2 million barrels more a day and 
the uae about 500000 more

the sudden rise in oil prices is jolting cities and states 
across the country already struggling with some of their worst 
budget woes in years 
restrictions on government travel have been ordered in indiana 
thermostats are being adjusted in government office buildings in 
baltimore and oil suppliers are being served notice in new york 
that price gougers will be remembered come contract time 
this is just another whammy along with the other cutbacks from 
the federal government weve received over the last 10 years j 
thomas cochran executive director of the washingtonbased us 
conference of mayors said in an interview friday 
one of the things we learned from the last oil crisis in the 
1970s was the tremendous amount of gasoline and fuel that cities 
use in their fleets and in government buildings this is definitely 
an item that will have an impact on their budgets he said 
actual service cuts have been slight just two weeks after the 
persian gulf crisis sent world oil prices soaring according to 
budget officials interviewed this week by the associated press 
what worries them most is the heightened prospect of a recession 
it could be a killer said rex olliff finance specialist 
for los angeles with a recession it would be difficult to get 
through this year and next year there would be a real problem 
sustained oil price increases of 25 percent to 30 percent would 
almost certainly bring about deep municipal and state service cuts 
other budget officials added 
virginia already struggling with its worst budget shortfall 
since world war ii 14 billion for 199092 faces 2 million in 
added costs if fuel prices remain where they are department of 
transportation officials say they might make up the difference by 
putting off highway maintenance 
the oil prices are just one added burden to be sure said 
ellen davenport of the virginia association of counties 
new york city figures each penny rise in gasoline prices will 
add 166500 to the cost of fueling its 24000car municipal fleet 
john beckman spokesman for the general services department 
said the city is warning heating oil and gasoline suppliers that 
the city intends to punish price gouging 
we are going to be scrutinizing them to see who gouged us and 
who treated us fairly the people with whom we contract should be 
cognizant of that because at contract time were going to 
remember he said 
boston already 13 million short in its 136 billion budget 
for the fiscal year that began july 1 could see 25 million in 
additional red ink if fuel prices go up 30 percent said barbara 
gottschalk the city budget director 
a few energyproducing states believe theyll come out winners 
if oil prices continue upward 
in texas state comptroller bob bullock estimates the treasury 
would gain 50 million for every 1perbarrel oil price increase 
new mexico the seventhlargest oilproducing state would realize 
4 million a year for every dollarabarrel rise 
alaskas revenue department calculates that if oil prices remain 
at current levels through the next year the state will have a 
nearly 300 million surplus by next july 
but other cities and states less optimistic about their fortunes 
have already taken modest savings steps 
we will be turning thermostats down and wearing more sweaters 
in anticipation of costs rising this winter said baltimore 
finance director william r brown jr 
connecticut its budget already 244 million in the red is 
paying 13 cents more per gallon than a year ago for the 75 million 
gallons needed to fuel its state car fleet and police cruisers 
state officials prepared a memo asking state car users to cut back 
on their driving 
albuquerque nm and rhode island are talking about cutting 
back on city car fleets or restricting takehome car use wyoming 
may cut back on outofstate air travel by state officials 
indiana lt gov frank obannon sent a memo ordering state 
agencies to increase car pooling and cut back on discretionary 
travel 
in north carolina david crotts the state legislatures senior 
fiscal analyst said rising oil prices could create a 100 million 
shortfall in revenue projections potentially wiping out much of a 
141 million state rainy day fund state agencies already have 
cut back on travel budgets 
meanwhile minnesota rideshare a statefunded agency that 
promotes car pooling and the metropolitan transit commission

navistar international corp said thursday its 
income for the third quarter dropped 786 percent to 6 million 
due largely to continuing weak demand for medium and heavy trucks 
the chicagobased truck maker which blamed a 77 percent drop in

chatham operations will be suspended for an additional 10 days 
in september and springfields mediumtruck assembly line will be 
shut down for another five days in october the company said 
for the quarter ending july 31 navistar reported earnings of 6 
million on sales of 972 million compared to earnings of 28 
million on sales of 108 billion for the same 1989 period 
after dividends on the series g preferred stock income per 
common share broke even for the third quarter the company reported 
earnings of 8 cents per share for the 1989 period 
for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 navistar reported a 
net loss of 4 million or 10 cents per share on sales of 28

livestock analysts on friday predicted a sharp drop in cattle 
futures prices after a government report showed far more cattle 
were placed on feedlots last month than the market had expected 
the anticipated drop of at least a penny a pound would extend 
losses posted friday on the chicago mercantile exchange ahead of 
the report 
on other commodity markets friday pork futures were mixed oil 
and gasoline futures skyrocketed precious metals rose and grains 
and soybeans were mixed 
live cattle futures settled 20 cent to 57 cent lower in 
chicago with the contract for delivery in august at 7790 cents a 
pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 67 cent lower with august 
at 8965 cents a pound live hogs were unchanged to 35 cent lower 
with august at 5752 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 83 
cent lower to 117 cents higher with august at 4812 cents a pound 
in a report released after the close of trading the agriculture 
department said 7 million cattle were on us feedlots as of aug 
1 4 percent more than on that date a year ago 
the usda said july feedlot placements rose 18 percent over a 
year ago while july marketings off of feedlots rose 3 percent 
market analysts were most surprised by the placements figure 
which compared with expectations for about a 6 percent increase 
charles k levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said the placements total of 15 million head was the 
third largest ever for july and 19 percent above the 10year 
avearge 
the july placements represent young cattle sold or moved to 
feedlots to be fattened on grain for slaughter in november and 
december 
levitt said feedlot operators aggressively sought animals in 
july because the feedlot business had been profitable that month 
and because feedgrain prices were declining suggesting the 
profitability would continue 
a bountiful winter wheat harvest in the southern plains where 
many feedlots are located contributed to a drop in wheat prices 
from about 330 to less than 3 a bushel in july making wheat an 
economical and readily available alternative to corn as a feed 
grain levitt said 
july placements also were higher than expected because good 
growing conditions had extended the usable life of the pastures on 
which young cattle are raised before they are moved to feedlots for 
finishing 
instead of moving animals to feedlots through the spring many 
producers kept their cattle on pastures until july when pasture 
conditions finally deteriorated levitt said 
petroleum futures soared on the new york mercantile exchange as 
middle east tensions escalated 
as the persian gulf crisis entered its third week evidence 
mounted that iraq intends to intern hundreds of trapped americans 
and president bush decided to call up military reserves to meet the 
need for doctors and other specialists 
analysts attributed an explosive jump in gasoline futures to 
reports of tight supplies of unleaded gasoline that meets the 
environmental requirements of the northeast 
atlantic richfield co said about 270 of its stations in the 
southwest had run out of regular unleaded gasoline as demand surged 
and a refinery fire reduced supplies 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 34 cent to 127 cents 
higher with september at 2863 a barrel heating oil was 3 cents 
to 507 cents higher with september at 8054 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 265 cents to 851 cents higher with 
september at 9597 cents a gallon 
most precious metals rose modestly on new yorks commodity 
exchange reflecting inflation fears fed by the rise in oil prices 
gold settled 10 cent lower to 40 cents higher with august at 
40960 a troy ounce silver was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with 
august at 5179 a troy ounce 
corn and soybean futures rose but wheat ended lower on the 
chicago board of trade after a day of choppy trading in the absence 
of fresh supplyanddemand developments 
wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents lower with september at 
282 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 1 cents higher with september 
at 250 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with 
september at 115 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 8 cents 
higher with august at 615 a bushel

investors dumped stocks and dollars again friday 
as oil and gasoline prices shot higher and uncertainty intensified 
about the desert standoff against iraq and its effect on the weak 
us economy 
other markets showed more stability but trading remained 
nervous going into the weekend 
on wall street sellers took the offensive for most of the day 
amid speculation that the economy already in a recession by some 
accounts would suffer further from expensive oil resulting from 
iraqs seizure of kuwait and its threat to other key persian gulf 
oil states 
trading trends shifted constantly with bluechip issues falling 
sharply at the outset before staging periodic rallies to finish 
well above the days lows 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials ended down 3664 at 
264480 at one point in the session the bestknown average of 
wall street was down more than 60 points 
more than four stocks fell for every one that rose on the new 
york stock exchange 
reflecting the depth of the market retreat was the selloff of 
the standard amp poors 500stock index which many consider a more 
accurate barometer of the markets health than the dow average the 
index fell 456 points to 32783 giving it a more than 35 percent 
drop on thursday and friday alone 
inflation and recession worries had been blamed partly for the 
dow averages nearly 67point drop on thursday 
traders said friday that investors also seemed unwilling to buy 
stock before the weekend due to the uncertainties posed by the 
persian gulf conflict worsening the days decline 
oil and gas prices again rose sharply as traders continued 
betting that the standoff between iraq and a multinational force 
led by the united states would hamper supplies 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude for september delivery rose 127 to 2863 per barrel that 
compared with about 21 a barrel just before iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait touched off the crisis 
in further bad news for consumers and businesses alike unleaded 
gasoline skyrocketed higher finishing at the highest level since 
it began trading in late 1984 on the new york mercantile exchange 
september wholesale unleaded gas closed up 851 cents at 9597 
cents a gallon 
a favorable us trade report from washington did little to 
settle wall street down and provided only temporary help for the 
dollar which declined in new york after plunging in europe 
the commerce department said the trade deficit dropped to a 
sevenyear low of 507 billion in june although the imbalance was 
expected to rise due to the surge in oil import prices 
the dollar traded at 15500 german marks late friday in new 
york compared with 15525 late thursday a new alltime low 
earlier in frankfurt however the dollar had plummeted to 15485 
marks from 15630 late thursday 
in the credit markets the yield on the treasurys key 30year 
bond rose to about 893 percent from 892 percent late thursday 
foreign markets also continued suffering from persian gulf and 
economic worries 
overnight in japan the key index on the tokyo stock exchange 
plunged by 277 percent traders in tokyo said many investors were 
disappointed that thursdays meeting between president bush and 
jordans king hussein failed to produce any breakthrough in the 
iraqi stalemate 
stock prices also were sharply lower in european trading with 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index on the london

kansas gas and electric co asked federal 
and state regulatory agencies thursday to reject kansas city power 
and light cos hostile takeover bid 
the wichita utility which is opposing the 875 million 
purchase made its request to the kansas corporation commission and 
the federal energy regulatory commission it said the takeover bid 
will cost the two utilities at least 15 million 
kgampe said in its motion to ferc that the kcpl application to 
approve the merger should be rejected because the kgampe board has 
not consented to the deal 
kgampe also said the tender offer is subject to significant and 
fundamental conditions which make it virtually impossible for kcpl 
actually to acquire kgampe under the terms and conditions set forth 
in the application 
in addition the utility said kcpls attempted takeover should 
not be aided or facilitated in any way by ferc and noted that 
merging utilities seeking approval from ferc have until now 
reached agreement on all aspects of the merger before submitting to 
ferc an application that has their joint support 
kcpls decision to acquire kgampe by hostile means disrupts all 
possibilities of further coordination between the two companies 
during the hostile takeover period and forces both companies to 
incur millions of dollars for commitment fees other costs and 
disbursements for bankers lawyers and financial consultants the 
wichita utility said 
kgampe estimated that kcpl has spent or committed expenditures of 
more than 10 million for the takeover bid kgampe estimated its own 
costs at 45 million 
in a separate motion kgampe cited several reasons for the state 
commission to reject the kcpl filing 
the tender offer is believed by kgampe to be illegal 
the kgampe board did not consent to the kcpl application or 
acquisition 
the tender offer is highly conditional making it virtually 
impossible that kcpl will acquire kgampe anytime soon under 
conditions set forth in its application to the kcc

companies exclusive right to file a reorganization plan

the casino control commission on 
friday unanimously approved a restructuring plan for resorts 
international that leaves owner merv griffin with just 215 percent 
of the company and includes a 5 million fund to possibly sue 
donald trump 
the commission voted 50 for the plan approved early friday 
morning by us bankruptcy judge rosemary gambardella it still 
must be approved by the bahamian government where resorts also 
runs a casino 
the plan filed under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
gives bondholders holding 911 million in bonds 785 percent of the 
company and 434 million in new notes 
it allows resorts to unload more than half of its massive debt 
and bank on a recovery of its fortunes along with atlantic citys 
casino industry 
resorts said the plan would take effect in 11 days with new 
notes distributed 10 days later griffin also will invest 15 
million and another 11 million a year later 
with the plan in place resorts will be able to generate 
sufficient cash to maintain its operations and service its debt 
even if it were to experience no growth in its 1989 adjusted 
operating income throughout the fiveyear forecast period said 
acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong 
accordingly i believe that resorts will continue to have 
financial stability upon the implementation of the reorganization 
plan she said 
griffin said afterward that he was relieved and confident 
resorts and atlantic city would rebound from recent months of flat 
growth in a poor economy 
its a load off griffin said now its up all the way 
the plan was filed in december and amended in april to include 
the proposed sale of resorts paradise island operations in the 
bahamas resorts officials estimate the bahamian property could 
fetch between 250 million and 300 million the plan forecasts the 
sale by december 1991 two months before resorts new jersey gaming 
license comes up for renewal 
ms armstrong reemphasized the bahamian sale remains a key to 
the restructuring 
the revamping also sets aside a 5 million legal kitty to allow 
resorts bondholders to sue donald trump resorts former owner 
bondholders claim trump left the company insolvent in a 1988 swap 
with griffin in which trump got the unfinished taj mahal casino 
resort next door 
trump has said griffin is responsible for weighing the company 
down with too much debt 
the plan also features an unusual feature allowing bondholders 
to buy units in the kitty to be repaid accordingly if a decision 
goes against trump those unit holders would not have to qualify 
before the commission but the kittys trustee would the panel 
ruled 
resorts would have to repurchase the units if litigation does 
not settle in a year for at least 36 million

trading was quiet friday in the absence of fresh developments in 
the persian gulf standoff between iraq and a multinational force 
led by the united states 
but some dealers capitalized on the low prices to buy said 
bruce r lakefield executive vice president with shearson lehman 
goverment securities inc traders also bought bonds to cover 
positions in borrowed securities before the weekend 
it seems that the risk is still for middle east events to be 
bearish but something could happen lakefield said in the 
absence of any events people basically bought back 
that occurred despite skyrocketing crude oil and gasoline 
prices which normally trigger fears of inflation and send 
investors fleeing from longterm fixedincome investments such as

prices in july led traders to conclude the federal reserve would 
not lower interest rates anytime soon to stimulate the economy 
the market ignored a commerce department report friday showing 
the us trade deficit declining to a sevenyear low the figure 
that on other days would have been expected to add to the selloff 
because it indicated economic strength

governments were unchanged to up lsqb point intermediate maturities 
were unchanged to up 116 point and longterm issues fell about lsqb 
point according to telerate inc a financial information service

the president of sony corp of america 
denied friday that the company tried to influence a union vote by 
taking pictures of employees who were unaware their faces would 
appear in an antiunion video 
sony officials showed the video to employees a day or two before 
a vote was taken on whether to oust their union local 888 of the 
united food amp commercial workers international 
the national labor relations board has filed an unfair labor 
practice complaint against sony in connection with the pictures and 
a raffle held the day of the vote 
employees in seven new jersey cities and in new york city voted 
in march to dump the union but the election results could be 
tossed out and a new vote ordered if sony loses the case said 
michael lightner an attorney with the labor board 
unfair conduct by an employer might be both unlawful and 
constitute grounds for a new election lightner said its fair 
to say that if we win on the unfair labor practice theyll set 
aside the election 
until the case is resolved the union will remain in power 
the company did not tell union officials why the pictures were 
being taken which prompted the labor board to file the complaint 
lightner said the complaint did not concern the content of the 
video 
neil vander dussen sonys president and chief executive 
officer said the union was told only that sony routinely 
photographs its employees for its own use 
our people just didnt think that it was necessary to go into 
great detail he said they were taking them for the video 
yes but we routinely take pictures of our employees 
vander dussen said the complaint was based on technicalities 
and said that sony employees clearly wanted the union out the vote 
was 7644 against the union 
to make an issue out of this is just to delay the 
decertification process he said 
vander dussan said sony will fight the charges the case must go 
to an administrative law judge if facts in the complaint are 
disputed it then goes to a threemember panel of the labor 
relations board in washington 
an attorney for the local said he would argue that the 
antiunion tone of the video gave employees who watched it a false 
perception of their coworkers and union sentiment 
it creates the impression that the individuals pictured are in 
favor of getting rid of the union said attorney larry cary it 
also creates the impression that the company is watching you and 
we think thats coercive 
a second issue in the complaint filed by the labor board is over 
a 27inch television raffled by sony on the day of the election 
vander dussen said all employees who voted were entered into the 
drawing as a way of ensuring a large turnout and not to induce 
employees to vote against the union as the complaint charges 
if they vote for the union theyre still entered into the 
raffle so i dont see how that makes any sense vander dussen 
said

nordstrom inc announced friday it settled all 
its outstanding claims with the national labor relations board but 
a union official demanded the company also admit wrongdoing 
the seattlebased retailer signed the agreement friday stating 
it would not punish employees for union activities or offer to 
employees benefits that are effective only if the union is ousted 
nordstrom spokesman dave marriott said 
nordstrom also will allow prounion employees the same 
privileges as antiunion workers in the matters of distributing 
handbills and posting fliers marriott said 
the settlement included a nonadmission of guilt clause 
which nlrb regional attorney walter mercer said is fairly common 
but united food and commercial workers local 1001 will object to 
any settlement unless nordstrom admits it has done what they have 
been accused of said union president joe peterson 
the union has five days to object after the settlement is 
signed mercer said 
terms of the settlement must be posted for 60 days in the five 
seattlearea stores and one tacoma store with ufcw local 367 and 
local 1001 employees mercer said 
overall 13 of the 19 charges filed by the ufcw have been 
dismissed or withdrawn said joe demarte nordstrom vice president 
for personnel 
the settlement wipes the slate clean in terms of the unfair 
labor practice charges that have been filed by the union demarte 
said 
he said the settlement was sought because we felt it was more 
important to reach a settlement of the issues pending before the 
nlrb rather than continuing to debate the merits of the unions 
allegations 
but peterson believed nordstrom wanted the settlement so that a 
new petition to decertify and oust the union could be circulated 
he said the process cannot begin while charges are pending before 
the nlrb 
the union is in the process of filing new charges against the 
retailer peterson said those charges will involve alleged 
discrimination against union negotiators at a store south of 
seattle peterson said 
the union also plans appeals on four other charges the labor 
board ruled against he said 
marriott said nordstrom expected such an action 
the ufcw represents about 1500 of nordstroms seattlearea 
employees nordstrom employs about 30000 people nationwide inn 60 
stores in six states 
in february the washington state department of labor and 
industries ruled that nordstrom had violated state law by failing 
to pay some employees for such activities as attending company 
meetings making deliveries and writing customer thankyou notes 
a union lawsuit seeks back pay for the workers

amoco corp and unocal corp began raising 
wholesale gasoline prices as promised friday citing competitive 
pressures 
atlantic richfield co said it would continue its price freeze 
despite a surge in demand that caused pumps to run dry briefly at 
about 270 stations as buyers lined up for its lowerpriced fuel 
president bush appealed for voluntary price restraints last week 
after iraq invaded oilrich kuwait 
chicagobased amoco and los angelesbased unocal were among the 
companies that froze gas prices to dealers for a week they 
announced thursday the freeze would end blaming competitive 
pressures no arcostyle shortages were reported by either company 
however 
on friday unocal said it had raised prices by a penny a gallon 
in san diego and san jose calif seattle portland and eugene 
ore las vegas and reno nev and phoenix and tucson ariz 
amoco which sells gas in 30 states said it raised prices to 
dealers by 1 cent per gallon in the st louis market by 2 cents 
per gallon in indianapolis milwaukee detroit and minneapolis and 
2 cents per gallon in kansas city and denver 
amocos refineries are currently using crude oil received and 
priced since the iraqi invasion of kuwait and this gasoline price 
increase partially reflects the higher price of that oil robert 
j rauscher amoco marketing vice president said in a statement 
the increases do not directly affect retail gas prices because 
federal law requires those to be set independently but they 
generally are passed along to consumers 
los angelesbased arco has access to ample alaska oil which 
historically has helped it maintain a lowprice marketing strategy 
that includes all selfservice stations it has kept its freeze in 
effect although it said it was reviewing the situation daily it 
sells gasoline at 1500 stations in five western states 
an aug 10 lundberg survey of pump prices found arco prices 4 
cents to 12 cents per gallon cheaper than competitors in the los 
angeles area that kind of price disparity has caused sales volume 
to surge by 9 percent since arco announced its freeze on aug 8 
spokesman doug elmets said 
that heavy demand coincided with a fire monday that cut 
production of gasoline by 15000 barrels per day at arcos refinery 
in suburban carson that and heavy business at gas stations caused 
sold out signs to go up at regular unleaded pumps at the 270 
stations elmets said 
nearly all the stations were in southern california and the 
phoenix and las vegas areas elmets said its taken an average of 
2 hours to replenish regular unleaded gas at the stations 
he said to ensure an adequate supply to dealers arco had taken 
the unusual step of purchasing 100000 barrels of gasoline on the 
spot market wednesday for 1 per gallon or 42 million 
weve hired every common carrier we can find to get gas to our 
stations elmets said we are going to continue to hold the 
line as long as we can 
a unocal spokesman barry lane said unocal preferred not to 
pursue such a strategy 
we certainly dont want to get caught into a shortage 
situation by being too far below the market he said adding 
we dont want to be too far above either

unleaded gasoline hit a record high friday on 
the new york mercantile exchange friday as crude oil prices shot 
up and speculators kept betting that the middle east standoff would 
curtail supplies 
september wholesale unleaded gas futures soared to as high as 
9625 cents before settling at 9597 cents per gallon up 85 cents 
from thursdays record close 
theyre afraid theres not going to be crude around to make 
gasoline with said ed kevelson a broker with dean witter 
reynolds inc the entire mood is up the whole trend is up 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude finished up 127 at 2863 per barrel 
for the week september crude rose 240 per barrel while 
unleaded gasoline was up 165 cents a gallon 
oil prices have been rising in hectic rumordriven trading 
since iraq invaded neighboring kuwait on aug 2 and major 
industrialized nations responded by embargoing their oil 
the tighter supply combined with the possibility of a broader 
middle east war has spurred waves of buying by speculators hoping 
prices will soar further 
as prices moved up friday there wasnt anything to act as a 
dampener said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with 
shearson lehman brothers inc its just a real feeling that this 
situation is going to last for a while 
prices had fallen slightly early in the week as traders 
speculated that diplomats might find a solution to the oil crisis 
but the rally renewed with a vengeance after a meeting thursday 
between president bush and jordans king hussein an ally of iraq 
and the united states produced no progress toward a peaceful 
settlement 
traders were concerned that imports and oil supplies will 
tighten particularly in the northeast which is more dependent on 
foreign oil than other regions hittle said 
gas prices get an added boost because us refining capacity 
already is tight and most foreign gasoline cant be imported 
because it does not meet federal emission standards 
among other energy futures wholesale home heating oil for 
september delivery rose to 8054 cents per gallon up 51 cents for 
the day and 79 cents for the week 
september natural gas rose to 1440 per 1000 cubic feet from 
thursdays 1430 on the week natural gas was down 5 cents
